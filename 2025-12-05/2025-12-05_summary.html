Former Philippine President Duterte awaits trial in the ICC for using the pretext of a drug war for his murder campaign.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Public outrage is mounting over the Trump administration's September 2 “double tap” strike, in which the U.S. military bombed a small boat for a second time to kill the survivors of a first strike. This particular strike has garnered significant attention due to its clear violation of U.S. and international law because shipwrecked sailors should never be targeted. But it is crucial to note that Donald Trump's entire bombing campaign against vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific is illegal as well.

Trump's campaign of extrajudicial violence under the pretext of fighting a “drug war” is reminiscent of the policies of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is currently in custody in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, awaiting trial for murdering alleged drug dealers and users. Like Duterte, Trump's bombing campaign should be considered a crime against humanity.

On September 2, Trump proudly posted a video on Truth Social depicting the first of his murderous bombings of alleged drug traffickers on small boats in international waters. Trump stated he had personally ordered the operation:

Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. TDA is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro, responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE! Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!!!!!!!!!

Although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has waffled about whether it was he or Admiral Frank M. Bradley who issued the order for the second strike, Trump left no doubt that the orders resulting in the killing of 11 people came directly from him, the Commander in Chief.

Since that double tap bombing, 21 publicly known U.S. airstrikes on 22 vessels have killed at least 83 people. The legal rationale for these bombings has shifted over time, but it is apparently based on a classified memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel.

The memo reportedly claims that the United States is in a state of armed conflict with drug cartels that use drug proceeds to buy weapons and fund violence, so the U.S. is acting in collective self-defense.

But on December 1, international law scholars Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman, and Tess Bridgeman argued in Just Security:

There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on [September 2], let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold.

“There is no evidence that this group is committing an armed attack against the U.S. that would allow the U.S. to use military force against it in national self-defence,” three UN experts have also said. “International law does not allow governments to simply murder alleged drug traffickers,” the experts noted, calling Trump's strikes extrajudicial executions. “Criminal activities should be disrupted, investigated and prosecuted in accordance with the rule of law, including through international cooperation.”

An assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies dated February 26 found that Tren de Aragua was neither controlled by the Venezuelan government, nor committing crimes in the United States on its orders.

Even if there was a state of armed conflict, these would be war crimes. The Geneva Conventions forbid the targeting of civilians and shipwrecked sailors. Without a state of armed conflict, this is just plain murder.

Moreover, the administration has provided no evidence that the people on these boats were involved in a drug operation. In fact, officials have admitted that they don't even know the identities of the people killed in the strikes.

But regardless of whether or not there is proof that the victims were trafficking drugs, there is no legal justification for killing them. If there was probable cause they were committing crimes, there are procedures for arrest and trial with due process protections.

On October 28, in a post decrying the murder of 57 civilians in attacks on 14 civilian boats up to that point, Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur for the protection of human rights while countering terrorism, and Challis Chair of International Law at the University of Sydney, wrote “A systematic attack on civilians is a crime against humanity under international law.”

Rodrigo Duterte was charged by the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber I on March 7, with the crime against humanity of murder committed pursuant to his “war on drugs” while he served as mayor of Davao City and president of the Philippines.

While both Duterte and Trump have enacted state violence in their drug wars, they have used different mechanisms — both of them illegal. Whereas Trump launched a military operation to kill alleged drug traffickers, Duterte established police “death squads” to kill the targets of his so-called war on drugs. Unlike Trump, Duterte was supposedly able to identify the targets of his drug war, but that still did not shield him from legal accountability.

In a campaign that Catholic leaders called a reign of terror, Duterte ordered that alleged criminals be “neutralized,” which, the ICC chamber said, meant “kill.” Trump has similarly ordered the killing of “narcoterrorists,” with no evidence to support such a designation.

The chamber found reasonable grounds to believe Duterte was individually responsible for the crime against humanity as an indirect co-perpetrator, even though he didn't personally commit the murders. Trump is likewise liable for the (so far) 83 boat strike deaths because he gave the initial order.

Under the doctrine of command responsibility, commanders — all the way up the chain of command to the commander in chief — are legally responsible for acts they knew or should have known would be committed by their subordinates. Orders by Hegseth and/or Bradley can be imputed to Trump to hold him liable for a crime against humanity.

Furthermore, Hegseth, Bradley, and all service members who participated in the bombings had a duty to disobey the illegal orders to launch those strikes.

Both the ICC's Rome Statute and customary international law punish crimes against humanity, so any state can prosecute them under the well-established doctrine of universal jurisdiction.

On October 23, Trump said, “I think we're just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. … They're going to be, like, dead.”

Trump's hypocrisy became all the more transparent on December 1, when he issued a pardon to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year sentence for expediting the importation of over 400 tons of cocaine into the United States over nearly two decades. Prosecutors called Hernández the architect of a “narco-state.”

During Trump's first term, he praised then-President Duterte, telling him in a telephone call that he was doing “an unbelievable job on the drug problem.”

Whereas Duterte used his “war on drugs” as a pretext to neutralize his political opponents, Trump appears to be using his strikes on “drug boats” as a potential lead-up to an unlawful military attack on Venezuela in order to engage in illegal forcible regime change and secure control over the proven oil reserves in Venezuela, the largest in the world.

Since August, Trump has moved troops and warships — including the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier — to the Latin American region. On December 2, Trump declared that he could attack accused drug traffickers who cross Latin America by land “very soon.” Trump also warned it's not just Venezuela he has in his sights but Colombia as well. A few days prior, he announced that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed.

As Congress remains mute in the face of Trump's impending military attacks, we must mount a full court press.

People should lobby their senators and congressmembers to create a select committee to investigate the misuse of Trump's war powers. It could issue subpoenas, gather facts, and garner media attention.

On December 3, Democratic Senators Tim Kaine (Virginia), Chuck Schumer (New York), and Adam Schiff (California), and Republican Senator Rand Paul (Kentucky) introduced a war powers resolution that “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.”

Attacking Venezuela would violate the UN Charter. This resolution should be supported and senators urged to co-sponsor it, although it is unlikely to pass in the House of Representatives.

Congress members should respond to pressure from their constituents. Pressure can take the form of phone calls, letters, emails, sit-ins, demonstrations, op-eds, and letters to the editors. It is incumbent upon all of us to stop this dangerous course of action.

World Cup athletes, fans, and personnel fear Trump's anti-immigration policies may disrupt the tournament's operation.

On Saturday, December 6, soccer fans around the world will find out where their favorite teams will be playing in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Players and staff from 48 countries and territories will play 104 games across North America — and for the first time in history, Canada is hosting some of the games. Together, Toronto and Vancouver will host 13 matches.

In addition to the matches, 84 training sites and 178 practice fields will be spread across Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. Plus, tens of thousands of broadcasters from around the world will cover the games for their home countries.

Holding the games in three countries means that ease of crossing borders is a fundamental part of the World Cup going smoothly. Hundreds of thousands of players, staff, and fans will need to move across the U.S.-Mexico border and the Canada-U.S. border multiple times in order to attend the matches over the course of six weeks in June and July 2026. But already, months before the games begin, concerns are mounting over whether attendees will be able to enter the host countries at all.

“Trump has made clear that U.S. restrictions on immigration visas, travel bans, and ongoing ICE kidnappings apply to World Cup fans and, in several cases, to athletes' delegations as well,” Harsha Walia — the author of Border and Rule: Global Migration, Capitalism, and the Rise of Racist Nationalism — told Truthout.

“The fact that FIFA is continuing to host the World Cup as planned and has not at all leveraged their business relationship to advocate for human rights commitments signals FIFA's capitulation to growing authoritarianism and protection of capitalist interests,” added Walia, who lives in Vancouver.

It isn't exactly easy to cross the Canada-U.S. border under the Trump administration. Cross-border travel has dropped as Canadians seek out other destinations for travel, scared off by images and stories of people being caught up in immigration enforcement, or even disappeared. ICE has been given a green light to continue its worst practices, Truthout has previously reported. With 20 new Canadian-built armored vehicles on their way into ICE's possession, oppression from ICE will continue and likely get even worse.

Earlier this year, several countries issued travel warnings to their citizens, telling people to be careful in the United States due to immigration enforcement agents' increasingly brazen tactics. Some refugees who have crossed into Canada have been turned away by Canadian border agents only to then be placed into ICE custody and face deportation. Sixty thousand people are currently in ICE detention, the highest number in many years, and the number of fatalities in ICE custody is the highest it has been in 20 years.

On November 28, 2025, Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would prevent migration to the United States by people who are from, in his words, from “the Third World.” One month earlier, he announced that the United States would only accept 7,500 refugees per year, a shockingly low number given that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are 117.3 million forcibly displaced people on the planet.

The U.S. administration has signaled that staff from Iranian and Haitian teams, like player analysts, kinesiologists and other technical staff, won't be allowed to enter the U.S. for the games.

These conditions have the potential to make crossing borders for the World Cup more dangerous for personnel and fans. Errors in documents or visa delays could each put someone at risk of detention, deportation, or disappearance.

To facilitate entry to the United States to watch the games, the U.S. has created a special FIFA visa for World Cup ticket holders, the U.S. State Department announced in November, which will give fans priority appointments for their visa requirements, or give fans from certain countries access to visa waivers.

Even so, athletes and fans may find it difficult to move across borders to attend the event. In October, a star of the international mountain biking world, Jolanda Neff, arrived at the Lake Placid World Cup just 45 minutes before her race started due to visa issues. Coach and veteran of the sport Steve Peat was denied entry entirely. In Canadian MTB magazine, Terry McCall wrote, “to be very clear, both Peaty and Neff are very experienced professionals with solid team backing. This isn't a couple juniors winging it on their first trip overseas,” warning that fans, athletes, and team staff may face similar struggles at future U.S.-based sporting events.

Foot Africa reports that already, the U.S. administration has signaled that staff from Iranian and Haitian teams, like player analysts, kinesiologists, and other technical staff, won't be allowed to enter the U.S. for the games. Iranian citizens who are part of that support staff, for example, will likely be rejected.

Meanwhile, Canada has not announced a special program for the World Cup. FIFA ticket holders have been asked to apply for their visas as soon as possible, as there are no guarantees that they will be allowed entry into Canada. Of the 48 teams playing in the tournament, more than half represent countries where Canada requires a visa for its travelers to be allowed to enter the country. Documents can range from CA$7 for a visa waiver to CA$100 for a visa. The Government of Canada advises applicants to mention that they're coming to Canada for the World Cup in their application.

Toronto Star sports columnist Bruce Arthur notes that while Brazil required ticket holders from some countries to hold visas at the 2014 World Cup, they waived the fees. Ticket holders didn't need visas to attend the World Cup in Russia in 2018 or Qatar in 2022.

Simon Black, professor of labor studies at Brock University, says that by increasing the number of teams at the World Cup from the usual 32 teams to 48, there are many more teams from small countries in the Global South where, “under ‘normal' circumstances, it would probably be difficult to get in [to Canada] regardless.”

Entering Canada is difficult for people from countries outside of Europe or the United States. Processing times vary wildly: the Government of Canada website posts an estimated 469 days for Côte d'Ivoire, 162 days for Iran, 37 days for Colombia, 23 days for Jamaica, and no time estimate at all for Cabo Verde — all countries that have teams in the World Cup.

A spokesperson from the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said in an email statement: “Canada is excited to welcome hundreds of thousands of visitors for the FIFA World Cup 2026, including athletes, coaches, officials, medical staff, media, corporate sponsors and fans from around the world. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is working closely with FIFA and federal partners to make travel to Canada as simple and smooth as possible without compromising security.”

To head off some of these issues, the Canadian government issued a temporary policy to exempt people who carry a FIFA invitation from work authorization requirements.

Canada's visa problems might be overshadowed by an erratic U.S. president who has made immigration enforcement and deportations a key part of his administration's work, but they have increasingly plagued large-scale international events. When the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture was held in Montreal in 2023, a quarter of conference attendees had their visas denied. In a joint letter signed by 76 computer scientists, they wrote “In order to advocate for the best interests of our academic communities, we can only recommend a moratorium in selecting Canada as a destination for such events.” In July 2024, the International Health Economics Association decided to relocate their 2025 conference to Indonesia, asserting they could not process the visas fast enough. Conference organizers had anticipated 1500 people would attend from all over the world.

To head off some of these issues, on November 14, 2025, the Canadian government issued a temporary policy to exempt people who carry a FIFA invitation from work authorization requirements that usually apply to foreign nationals who enter Canada.

The exemption started on December 1 and will expire on the last day of July, or just after the World Cup ends. To be eligible, individuals must apply for a visa and have a letter of invitation from FIFA. It will cover athletes and team staff, as well as some vendors, but not fans. 

Vancouver city councilor Sean Orr lived in Vancouver during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. In advance of the World Cup, his attention has been on how the city's most vulnerable will be treated while the matches are played in his city. The city council hasn't considered immigration or refugee issues; generally, they fall within the jurisdiction of the federal government. But he points to the detention of Democracy Now!'s Amy Goodman when she crossed the border for an event just before the 2010 Olympics as a warning sign that things might get more difficult for critics of the Canadian or U.S. governments who cross the border closer to the World Cup.

In an ideal world, Orr would like to see FIFA place personnel needs at the center of planning the World Cup. “I expect that there be a robust human rights framework attached to FIFA, and I know the city is working on it, but what does that mean when it comes to enforcement? What does that mean, on the ground, to protect people, sex workers, fans and residents? FIFA is in control of so much,” Orr told Truthout.

Black says that given the problems that so many people have had with immigration enforcement in the United States, “I can't not see there being some sort of issue,” during the games. Ultimately, he believes that all governments hosting the World Cup need to center the rights and freedoms of the people whose jobs rely on their freedom to travel to matches. What's needed most is “free movement of labor, which is what this is, across borders … without fear of harassment from immigration authorities, without fear of deportation, without fear of detention.”

Walia echoed this sentiment, calling on FIFA to take responsibility to protect human rights.

“FIFA should firmly require all host countries to safeguard migrant rights, end unlawful immigration enforcement at least during the tournament, end the displacement of unhoused communities in the lead up to and during the games, and protect journalists, activists and workers,” Walia said.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

A major immigration crackdown is underway in New Orleans and the surrounding areas of Louisiana, dubbed “Operation Catahoula Crunch” by the Trump administration. According to planning documents, 250 federal agents will aim to make 5,000 arrests over two months. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the operation will target “the worst of the worst,” though the number of arrests being planned suggests that authorities will conduct broad sweeps including those who have no criminal records, as has happened in other immigration crackdowns.

“They're going to target whoever they can, and as the Supreme Court has unfortunately authorized them, they're using racial profiling as part of that approach,” says Homero López, legal director for the New Orleans-based organization Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, or ISLA. “What they're doing is they're taking folks out of our community: our neighbors, our friends, our family members.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.

We turn now to New Orleans and southeast Louisiana, where more than 250 federal immigration agents launched Operation Catahoula Crunch this week. They reportedly aim to make more than 5,000 arrests over two months.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the operation will target, quote, “the worst of the worst,” unquote. But local officials say they're skeptical. City Councilmember Lesli Harris responded, quote, “There are nowhere near 5,000 violent offenders in our region. … What we're seeing instead are mothers, teenagers, and workers being detained during routine check-ins, from their homes and places of work.” So far, agents have targeted the parking lots of home improvement stores like Home Depot and workers at construction sites.

At a New Orleans City Council hearing Thursday, about 30 protesters were removed after demanding city leaders do more to protect immigrants, calling for ICE-free zones. In a public comment session, residents went to the microphone one by one and were cut off when it was clear they wanted to talk about immigration, which was not on the formal agenda. This is Mich González of SouthEast Dignity Not Detention Coalition. After his mic was cut, he continued to try to be heard.

MICH GONZÁLEZ: We delivered a letter to City Council on November 21st. I'm part of the SouthEast Dignity Not Detention Coalition, and we requested a meeting. This should be on the agenda. It should be on the agenda.

CHAIR: Not germane.

MICH GONZÁLEZ: Public safety is at the heart — 

Little kids are not going to school right now. People are not able to take their disabled parents to their medical appointments. … Please, I'm begging you.

PROTESTERS: Shame! Shame!

MICH GONZÁLEZ: And right now it's about the safety of the people who live here. But I promise you, in just — these people are planning to stay here for two months and take as many as 5,000 of the people who live in this great city of New Orleans.

PROTESTERS: Shame! Shame!

MICH GONZÁLEZ: And they are the people who work here. They're the people who clean dishes here. They're the people who take care of the elderly in the nursing homes. … Please, I'm begging you.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by Homero López, legal director for ISLA, Immigrant Services and Legal Advocacy, based in New Orleans.

Welcome to Democracy Now!, Homero. If you can start off by talking about what exactly you understand this plan is? As they move in 250 immigration agents, they say they're making 5,000 arrests in the next two months. What's happening to New Orleans?

HOMERO LÓPEZ: Yes. Thank you, Amy, for having me on.

We have seen the officers come into the city and the surrounding areas, as well. And the fact that they're looking for a specific quota, that they have a number that they're going after, makes it clear that they're not targeting, as they claim, the worst of the worst. Instead, they're going to target whoever they can, and as the Supreme Court has unfortunately authorized them, they're using racial profiling as part of that approach.

AMY GOODMAN: They're calling it “Catahoula Crunch.” Louisiana's state dog is the Catahoula. Explain what they're saying here, what Kristi Noem is talking about, who the immigrants are that they're going after.

HOMERO LÓPEZ: Yeah. They originally had called it the “Swamp Sweep,” but I guess they thought “SS” was a little bit too on the nose, so they went after “Catahoula Crunch” instead.

And what they're saying is they're going to target, you know, folks who have criminal backgrounds, or at least that's the purported position from the higher-ups at least. There was a video of Bovino recently saying he's going after immigrants. He was asked, “Who are you targeting? What are you — who are you looking for?” And he said, “This is an immigration raid.” And so, he's — they're focusing on immigrants across the board.

What we've seen has been folks at work, folks at their check-ins, people around schools, ICE officers setting up around or CBP officers setting up around the schools. And the fear that's being — the fear that's coming into the — being sowed in the community is really the true intent of what they're — of their operation here.

AMY GOODMAN: Catahoula Crunch named after the Louisiana state dog. Didn't Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem famously shoot her dog?

HOMERO LÓPEZ: That is a story that's come out, yes.

AMY GOODMAN: Many ICE officials who now work at the national level came up through Louisiana. Is that right? Can you talk about them? And who are the hundreds of agents moved in to do these arrests?

HOMERO LÓPEZ: Yeah, Louisiana is playing a oversized role when it comes to immigration enforcement throughout the country. The former wildlife and fisheries secretary here in Louisiana is now one of the deputy — or, is the deputy director of ICE nationally. Our former area, New Orleans, ICE director, field office director, is also at headquarters. There are various deportation officers here from Louisiana who have gone to work at headquarters. And so, the approach that they used to take or that they have taken in Louisiana since 2014 to incarcerate as many people as possible, quickly warehouse and deport people from the state, is something that seems to be the structure that is being operated now from the national headquarters.

AMY GOODMAN: Louisiana, in other parts of the country, we know it particularly here when it comes to detention. You have Mahmoud Khalil, who is the Columbia student who was imprisoned in Louisiana. You have Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student who was imprisoned in Louisiana. Talk about the overall detention complex in Louisiana.

HOMERO LÓPEZ: Louisiana has a history, a terrible history, of being the incarceration capital of the world. And that is no different when it comes now to immigration detention. Louisiana is number two when it comes to the second — the state with the second-largest detained immigrant population in the country, next to Texas. However, we're not a border state. We also don't have a large immigrant population by numbers. Instead, what Louisiana does is it receives a lot of people who are detained around the country.

And so, the additional aspect of what happens in Louisiana is that we have these very rural, isolated detention centers in central Louisiana, central and northern Louisiana, which are very far away from major metropolitan or from major population centers, which means what you end up with is people removed from their legal and support systems. So, when you had someone like Mahmoud Khalil being moved down here from New York, what you had was removing him from his social network, from people who could assist him, from being able to provide him with assistance. Same thing with Rümeysa Öztürk. And these were highly publicized cases, places where folks had large support networks. And so, when we deal with folks who don't have those support networks, who don't have that publicity, who don't have that kind of support, and you have them in such a remote, isolated area, what you end up is basically warehousing folks without giving them an opportunity to fight their case and be able to present a viable case through actual due process.

AMY GOODMAN: You can't help but notice that New Orleans is a blue city in a red state, Louisiana. Louisiana has the most detention beds outside of Texas. Can you talk about the consent decree that was overturned last month, Homero?

HOMERO LÓPEZ: The consent decree was overturned last month by the Justice Department, and they wanted to get rid of it. It had been in place for over a decade here in Louisiana, that did not — or, here in New Orleans, that had not allowed the local sheriff's office to cooperate with ICE.

Now the new sheriff, we don't know exactly what she's going to do, but what it does is it removes this tool that existed, which was originally implemented because of previous abuses, that had been determined by a federal court, that New Orleans police, New Orleans Sheriff's Office should not be cooperating, and had ordered the sheriff's office not to cooperate. Without that consent decree in place, it's now up to the sheriff. And so, there is a movement on the ground from advocacy groups and from other organizers to push the sheriff to continue to have that kind of policy, but we'll see what comes from that.

AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the people you represent? I mean, I think it's really important, not only in New Orleans, but around the country. A number of the people being picked up are going to their court hearings. They are following the rules, and they end up being arrested.

HOMERO LÓPEZ: Yeah, the majority of people who are being arrested, the majority of calls that we're receiving are from folks who have — who are going through the process, whether they be children who originally applied through the Special Immigrant Juvenile status process and are awaiting their ability to apply for residency, whether it's spouses of U.S. citizens who are going to their interviews and are being picked up, whether it's people who have immigration court hearings and have filed their applications and are attending the hearings, are going — again, they're doing it, quote-unquote, “the right way.” And that's who is being picked up. Those are the folks who are the low-hanging fruit. Those are the folks who are going to be targeted.

There's a reason that these officers are going to worksites and not necessarily doing in-depth investigations to identify folks that they claim are a danger to the community. Instead, what they're doing is they're taking folks out of our community: our neighbors, our friends, our family members. And that's who they're detaining and they're sending into these terrible detention centers in order to try to quickly deport them from the country.

AMY GOODMAN: Homero López, I want to thank you for being with us. Do you have a final comment on the City Council hearing that was held yesterday as mics were turned off on person after person who was calling for ICE-free zones?

HOMERO LÓPEZ: Yeah, we hope that City Council will take a stance. We understand that they don't necessarily have a ton of power over federal actions, but the point here is about the values that the city stands for and what we are going to demonstrate to our community and to our residents of who we support, what we support and what we stand for in the city.

                    “This is truly one of the great honors of my life,” Trump said in remarks after receiving the award, as he also praised the foreign policy moves of his administration. 
                





            FIFA President Gianni Infantino credited Trump with helping broker peace agreements in multiple parts of the world, including the Middle East.
    


            The world soccer's governing body announced in November that this year will see the introduction of the award — a new annual accolade given to someone who FIFA says has taken “exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world.” How the winner is chosen isn't exactly clear.
    


            FIFA had remained tight-lipped over who will be bestowed the inaugural Peace Prize amid rumors it was destined for the US president.
    


            Infantino and Trump have seemingly developed a close relationship in the buildup to next year's World Cup. He was a vocal supporter of Trump's bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize, an award ultimately given to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.

            President Donald Trump — who's expected to receive the FIFA Peace Prize during today's World Cup Draw in Washington — didn't answer a question about whether receiving the award would conflict with his vow to strike “on land” soon in Venezuela.
    


            “I haven't been officially noticed — I've been hearing about a Peace Prize, and I'm here to represent our country in a different sense, but I can tell you I did settle eight wars, and we have a ninth coming, but which nobody's ever done before,” Trump told CNN's Kaitlan Collins ahead of the draw.
    


            “But I want to really save lives. I don't need prizes. I need to save lives. And we're saving a lot of lives.”
    


            The president's comments come as the administration has increased strikes against alleged drug boats. And the administration is facing scrutiny from Congress, including some GOP lawmakers, in the wake of revelations about a so-called “double-tap” strike that killed survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug vessel.
    


            But the president has shown little sign that the criticism is likely to deter further escalation in the region, repeatedly suggesting he'd like to see land strikes.
    


            “I think you're going to find that there's a very receptive ear to doing exactly what they're doing, taking out those boats,” he told reporters at the White House Wednesday. “And very soon we're going to start doing it on land too, because we know every route, we know every house, we know where they manufacture this crap, we know where they put it all together.”
    


            President Donald Trump wasted no time highlighting the renovation work underway at the Kennedy Center as he arrived at the venue Friday ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw, praising what he described as a sweeping overhaul of the aging performing arts complex.
    


            “We've done a lot of work at the Kennedy Center. It was falling apart, and now it's much back,” Trump said. “And we'll get it back within the next four or five months through construction.” He added that before the effort began, “You can look at the walls, marble was broken, everything was a mess.”
    


            “So we've done a really great renovation job on it, and over the next three, four months, it'll be complete, and we're honored to have it here,” the president said.
    


            The president's comments come as he continues reshaping Washington's landmarks during his second term.
    


            In the months since returning to office, the president has left a visible imprint on the nation's capital, from the Kennedy Center's newly painted columns and planned new carpet and seating, to his vow to rebuild Dulles International Airport, which he recently described as “a terrible airport.”

            Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the military officer who oversaw the controversial September 2 attack on an alleged drug boat, told lawmakers on Thursday that he had consulted with the uniformed lawyer on duty during the operation before approving a secondary strike that killed survivors, according to two sources with direct knowledge of his congressional briefings.
    


            An initial strike killed 9 crew members leaving two survivors clinging to a component of the overturned boat, CNN has reported. The two bobbed in the water for most of an hour while Bradley, who was at that time the head of Joint Special Operations Command, and other military officers decided what to do.
    


            During that period Bradley consulted the JAG officer, or judge advocate general officer, who assessed it would be legal to move forward with a second strike, the sources added.
    


            That second strike, which one source said happened 41 minutes after the first, killed the two survivors, CNN reported.
    


            The legality of the strike has become a deeply contested topic on Capitol Hill where lawmakers have split along party lines, with most Republicans saying the strikes was justified and Democrats suggesting a war crime may have been committed.
    


            First lady Melania Trump held a meaningful reunion Friday, meeting with 24-year-old Caoilinn McLane during a holiday visit to Children's National Hospital.
    


            In 2017, McLane was a patient here, battling childhood acute myeloid leukemia at age 15, spending months between the pediatric intensive care unit and the oncology unit at Children's National. McLane met the first lady multiple times, including Trump's first holiday visit to the children's hospital as first lady, and the two stayed in touch.
    


            Eight years later, Trump returned to the hospital for the annual first lady holiday visit, where she was introduced by McLane, now grown up and in remission, a student at Virginia Military Institute.
    


            In a hospital atrium decorated with colorful hot air balloons suspended from the ceiling, a towering, sparkly Christmas tree, and stacks of wrapped presents, Trump also met dozens of children gathered to see her — and Santa Claus.
    


            Trump read “How Does Santa Go Down the Chimney,” shook hands with Santa and Mrs. Claus, and shared hugs with some of the children gathered before privately visiting with young patients in the oncology unit.
    


            The White House quietly released President Donald Trump's new national security strategy late yesterday, a 33-page document that elevates his “America First” doctrine and sets out the administration's realignment of US foreign policy, from shifting military resources in the Western Hemisphere to taking an unprecedentedly confrontational posture toward Europe.
    


Catch up on some key points in the document: 



On the Western Hemisphere: The strategy centers on Trump's call for a “readjustment” of the US military presence in the Western Hemisphere to counter migration, drug trafficking and what it describes as the rise of adversarial powers in the region.
    


            It outlines plans for a larger Coast Guard and Navy presence in the region and deployments to “secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force.” The document frames this as part of a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, an 1823 presidential call for European powers to respect the US sphere of influence in the West.
    


On Europe: The strategy's section on Europe represents a more dramatic escalation, warning that European nations face “economic decline” that could be “eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.”
    


            The document goes on to argue that “over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European,” raising what it calls “an open question” about whether those countries would continue to view their alliance with the United States in the same way.
    


On China: The Trump administration's strategy also outlines a dual-track approach to China, pushing to contain Beijing's global influence while preserving economic ties and maintaining the current conditions on Taiwan, saying that “deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority.”

            Delegations from the US and Ukraine will meet again in Miami later today, according to a Ukrainian official, as they attempt to make a breakthrough in ongoing peace talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            Ukraine's negotiating team held “constructive talks … on key aspects of the peace process” with their American counterparts yesterday, Oleksandr Bevz, adviser to Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, said on Facebook.
    


            “Today, the delegation will continue its work in Miami. Based on the results, the President will hear reports and determine the next steps for the Ukrainian team,” he added.
    


            The Ukrainian delegation was expected to discuss the outcome of Tuesday's meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
    


            President Donald Trump announced Friday that he has approved “tiny cars” to be manufactured in the United States, although there isn't a specific federal regulation prohibiting small micro cars in the US.
    


            “I have just approved TINY CARS to be built in America. Manufacturers have long wanted to do this, just like they are so successfully built in other countries,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            “They can be propelled by gasoline, electric, or hybrid. These cars of the very near future are inexpensive, safe, fuel efficient and, quite simply, AMAZING!!! START BUILDING THEM NOW! Thank you to the DOJ and the Departments of Transportation and Environment.”
    


            The president also praised the idea during a televised Cabinet meeting Wednesday, telling his team he had been struck by “a very small car” he saw during his recent Asia trip, calling them “really cute.”
    


            “How would that do in this country? And everyone seems to think good, but you're not allowed to build them,” Trump said.
    


            However, some of these small cars from Asia that Trump speaks of have been imported already, although not in significant numbers. There are local regulations on which roads they can drive on, and there are federal rules requiring certain levels of safety for car occupants in case of crashes.
    


            But it has been mostly market forces, not regulation, that has stopped the production of ultra small vehicles in the United States. American car buyers have shown a desire for bigger trucks and SUVs, enough so that the traditional “Big Three” US automakers essentially stopped producing small sedans years ago. Some imported models, such as the Daimler-Benz two-seat “Smart car,” did not catch on in the US market.
    


CNN's Samantha Waldenberg and Chris Isidore contributed to this post. 



            Democratic House Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts has called for the public release of a video showing the so-called double-tap strike on an alleged Caribbean drug boat in September.
    


            “We need to get the truth to the American people,” Clark said this morning to CNN's Kate Bolduan. “I think that we should take (US President Donald Trump) up on what he said … that he's not against releasing this video.”
    


            Earlier this week, Trump said that his administration would “certainly” release the footage, which reportedly shows survivors of an initial strike on the vessel being killed.
    


            Clark added she has two “critical concerns” regarding the video: “One is for the security of our troops, and one is for the security of the American people.”
    


            “We need to know where we stand legally as a country. That is critical to keeping the American people safe,” she said, accusing US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Trump administration of an “unprecedented withdrawal of information.”
    


                    “This is a matter of national security. It is a matter of our standing. It is a matter of protecting our troops. And we need to have a full investigation and be as public and transparent as possible,” Clark said.
                





            All eyes today will be on The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, where the 48 soccer teams set to compete in the upcoming FIFA World Cup will be drawn into 12 groups. US President Donald Trump will be at the drawing, which will take place around 12 p.m. ET.
    


            The president is also expected to attend a concert in the White House's East Room today.
    


            This is his official schedule:
    


            The two men killed in a second strike on a suspected drug vessel in early September did not appear to have communications devices, the top military official overseeing the strike told lawmakers, according to sources.



            This new information is stoking criticism of the strike, adding to growing questions about its legality.
    


Here's what some Democrats in Congress told CNN:



Washington Rep. Adam Smith said that after he saw the full video of the strike, he thinks that the clip should be made public.
    


Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a retired US Army pilot, says the new information “tells you the Defense Department has been lying to everybody” for months.
    


            “I know what drug interdiction looks like…it is not killing shipwrecked sailors,” said Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss.



            Attorney General Pam Bondi said today the suspect in the Washington, DC, pipe bomb case is expected to face more charges.
    


            “We got someone who was charged with a very, very dangerous crime off the streets, and more to come,” Bondi told Fox News.
    


                    She later added: “Hundreds of agents are on this case because this is a very dangerous person. And again, I believe there are more charges to come.”
                





            The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., was arrested yesterday and is currently facing two federal explosives charges. Cole is expected to appear before a federal judge in court later today.
    


            During interviews with the FBI, the suspect arrested in the pipe bomb probe told investigators that he believed the 2020 election was stolen, providing perhaps the first indication of a possible motive for the bombs placed near the DNC and RNC headquarters, people briefed on the matter said.
    

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that Brian Cole Jr., the man accused of planting viable pipe bombs outside the DNC and RNC offices the night before the 2021 attack, has been federally charged with using an explosive device.

            French President Emmanuel Macron said the United States needs “the Europeans to advance their efforts for peace” in Ukraine, underlining the importance of European-American cooperation on the issue at a time when their differing approaches to the talks are putting their alliance under strain.
    


            “Unity between the Americans and the Europeans on the Ukrainian issue is indispensable,” Macron told reporters at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China.
    


                    “We need to work together, we should work together,” he added. “We welcome and we support the efforts for peace that have been made by the US.”
                





            Still, Macron emphasized that the US needs European input too, as “this is happening on the European continent and we are the providers of security guarantees, as it's we who can speak about sanctions, as it's we that have in our hands the frozen Russian assets, to give some examples.”
    


                    “And it's through this partnership that that can be effective. And so, no distrust — in contrast: cooperation, in service of Ukraine, international law and our collective security.”
                





            GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas — who was briefed by Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley yesterday on the September so-called double-tap strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean — said this morning he did not see evidence of the men on the boat trying to use a radio to call for help.
    


            When pressed by John Berman on “CNN News Central” if he saw any evidence of the men trying to use a radio, Cotton said, “No I didn't.”
    


            The senator went on to defend the second strike, saying, “They were clearly not incapacitated. They were not distressed.”
    


                    “They were trying to get the boat back up and to continue their mission of spreading these drugs all across America,” Cotton said. “That's what they were doing and that's why Adm. Bradley ordered the second strike.”
                





CNN exclusively reported yesterday that Bradley told lawmakers during congressional briefings that the two men killed in the strikes did not appear to have radio or other communications devices, according to sources with direct knowledge of his briefings.
    


            This revelation comes after defense officials have been quietly pushing back on criticism that killing the two survivors amounted to a war crime by arguing, in part, that they were legitimate targets because they appeared to be radioing for help or backup — reinforcements that, if they had received it, could have theoretically allowed them to continue to traffic the alleged drugs aboard their sinking ship.
    


            Ukrainian and US delegations ended a meeting in Miami, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported in the early hours of Friday.
    


            The Ukrainian delegation included Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov and Chief of the General Staff Andrii Hnatov.
    


            Suspilne did not give any other details of the meeting.
    


            The delegations were expected to discuss the results of the Tuesday meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin, US special envoy Steve Witkoff, and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
    


                    Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address yesterday: “Our task now is to obtain full information about what was said in Russia, what other reasons Putin found to prolong the war and put pressure on Ukraine, on us, on our independence.”
                





            Ukrainian and US officials last held talks on Sunday, also in Miami. At the time, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the meeting as “a very productive and useful session where… additional progress was made.”
    


In Moscow: Russia is awaiting a response from the US following Tuesday's discussions, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state media TASS.
    


            There are currently no plans for a phone conversation between Putin and Trump, but one can easily be arranged if necessary, Ushakov said, TASS reported.
    


            That US-Russia meeting did not yield any breakthroughs on a possible peace deal, but Putin characterized it as “productive.”
    


            Putin is currently in India, where he said that Russia was ready to provide an “uninterrupted” supply of fuel to the Indian economy as both countries grapple with the fallout from US sanctions on Russian oil companies.

            President Donald Trump is set to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw today at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, where FIFA will announce the groups and matchups for the opening stage of the quadrennial tournament.
    


            The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams (up from 32) and is set to be played across 16 cities in three countries.
    


            Hear from Paul Tenorio, senior writer for The Athletic, as he talks to CNN Sports' Don Riddell about the newly expanded tournament:
    


Some context: The decision to hold the opening event of the World Cup at the Kennedy Center combines two of Trump's second-term priorities: bringing the World Cup to the US, and a reshaping of the center after he seized control of its board.
    


            Trump said he would oversee a sweeping revamp of the center and its programming. He has said that people may start referring to the performance arts center as the “Trump Kennedy Center.”
    


Sideline meetings: Trump is also expected to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on the sidelines of the draw, a senior White House official told CNN.
    


CNN's Kristen Holmes contributed reporting to this post. 



            Just over three months after a double-tap attack on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean that killed surviving crew members, lawmakers had a private briefing yesterday with Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who oversaw the attack.
    


            Since that first attack in September, the US military has killed at least 87 people in strikes that have destroyed 23 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the US. Just yesterday, the military killed four people in a strike on a boat in the Eastern Pacific. Here's a timeline of the strikes.



Here are the latest developments:



Survivors didn't radio for backup: The two men killed in the second strike were holding onto their capsized boat and did not appear to have communications devices, according to three sources with knowledge of the briefings. Defense officials had previously argued, in part, that they were legitimate targets because they appeared to be radioing for help — reinforcements that could have theoretically allowed them to continue to traffic the drugs aboard their sinking ship.
    


Lawmakers divided: Lawmakers were divided along party lines after the briefing, with a top Democrat calling a video of the incident “one of the most troubling things” he had seen as a congressman. But the panel chairman, Republican Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, said that he thought the second strike was justified.
    


Hegseth's role: North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is responsible for the processes that led to the killing of the boat strike survivors. But after the briefing, Crawford told CNN that he is “confident” in Hegseth. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Hegseth “serves at the pleasure of the president” even as he acknowledged another controversy involving the defense secretary, about his use of the Signal app earlier this year, was a “mistake” that should not be repeated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn a stark new line in the war: Ukraine must withdraw its forces from the eastern Donbas region, or Moscow will seize it "by force," he warned on Dec. 4. 

The threat is hardly new — but the stakes are. President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory.

After a decade of trying and failing to take Donbas outright, the Kremlin is now tying any future ceasefire to Ukraine's capitulation on the region, raising the pressure as Moscow seeks to reshape the war's endgame on its own terms. 

So what is Donbas? And why is Russia so obsessed with it?

Donbas is a historical region in eastern Ukraine. The term "Donbas" is short for "Donets Coal Basin," named after the Siverskyi Donets River that runs through the region.

The word has been in use since the 19th century and has referred not only to modern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but also parts of Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and even regions of southern Russia, where the Siverskyi Donets River also flows. 

The region is best known as Ukraine's industrial and coal-mining heartland — a symbol of the country's heavy industry. Yet parts of Donbas are also agricultural, with sprawling farmlands surrounding its industrial centers. 

Donetsk and Luhansk, the two oblasts that make up the core of Donbas, have long been economic powerhouses built on coal, steel, and machinery.

Russia's war against Ukraine started not in 2022 but in 2014 — with the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas. That's why Ukrainians often refer to 2022 as the start of the full-scale phase of a war that had already been raging for years.

From the beginning, Moscow tried to disguise its aggression.

While boasting about the annexation of Crimea, it denied involvement in its war in Donbas, promoting a false narrative that allegedly local "separatists" were responsible for the fighting.

In reality, there was no genuine separatist movement. The proxy republics were Kremlin creations — armed, funded, and directed from Moscow as part of a broader campaign to destabilize Ukraine.

For much of Ukraine's modern history, Donbas was its economic engine.

Before Russia's invasion, Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts were home to hundreds of metallurgical, coal, and chemical plants that exported globally.

According to the London-based Center for Economics and Business Research, the region accounted for roughly 15.7% of Ukraine's GDP and 14.7% of its population before 2014.

Russia's war changed everything. The work of many of these enterprises came to a standstill as Russian attacks damaged industrial property, millions of locals fled the hostilities, and blockades between Ukraine and Russian-occupied territories abolished trade. 

The invasion also led to a fall in Ukraine's international exports and foreign investment.

Between 2014 and 2021, the same research center estimated Ukraine lost $102 billion due to the war in Donbas — about 8% of its pre-war GDP each year.

Still, many businesses continued to operate, in spite of a front line that moved closer after 2022. 

Earlier this year, however, a critical Donbas coal mine was forced to close due Russia's advances in the area. It was Ukraine's last operating coking coal mine, dealing a blow to Ukraine's economy. 

The war's human cost has been immense.

Between 2014 and December 2021, at least 3,400 civilians and 4,400 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in Donbas, according to U.N. data. Nearly 20,000 were injured.

At least two million people were forced to flee their homes because of the fighting. Roughly the same amount of people continued to live under Russian occupation — amid poverty, Kremlin indoctrination, and crossfire along the front, as Ukraine fought off continuous Russian attacks.

Since 2022, Russia has destroyed many cities and villages in the region. In Mariupol alone, which was home to about 500,000 people before Moscow's full-scale invasion, estimates suggest that Russia has killed up to 75,000 civilians.

The actual cost of Russia's war, beyond the numbers, is yet to be fully grasped.

"When you talk about Donetsk Oblast like a hot cake that can be passed around," Oleksii Ladyka, a local journalist from Kramatorsk now serving with Ukraine's 92nd Assault Brigade, told the Kyiv Independent in August.

"I want them to remember that everyone here has their own family, has their loved ones, has a hope and a wish for a peaceful life and a future for their children, just like anyone anywhere in the world." 

One of Moscow's oldest myths is that Donbas "naturally" belongs to Russia because many of its residents speak Russian. In reality, language has never equaled nationality or political leaning.

Before 2014, the vast majority of Donetsk and Luhansk residents identified as Ukrainian citizens. Polls consistently showed that most wanted to remain part of Ukraine.

Russia has long exploited linguistic ties to justify its aggression — but speaking Russian does not mean supporting Moscow.

A poll conducted by the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center between April 24 and May 4, 2025, found that 82% of Ukraine's Russian-speaking population expressed a negative view of Russia.

Russia's claims of "saving" Russian-speaking Ukrainians do not add up in the face of widespread destruction. Years of neglect and war damage have also left Russian-occupied areas of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts with barely functioning infrastructure, leading to a water crisis in these regions in the summer of 2025.

The true reason behind Putin's interest in gaining Donbas is likely military in nature.

By mid-August 2025, Russia had occupied 19% of Ukraine's territory, according to Reuters.

Luhansk Oblast is almost entirely under Russian control, while Ukrainian forces continue to hold firm in parts of Donetsk Oblast — roughly 6,600 square kilometers (2,550 square miles), including the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, with the battle for Pokrovsk still continuing.

For Putin, full control over Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast remains a top demand.

As the Economist put it, the real reason lies in Ukraine's so-called "fortress belt" — a 50-kilometer (31-mile) stretch of heavily fortified towns from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk to Druzhkivka and Kostiantynivka.

This network of fortifications, trenches, minefields, and anti-tank barriers has been continuously strengthened since 2014. After Bakhmut was occupied in 2023, Ukraine redoubled its efforts to reinforce the line.

Former Defense Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the Economist that enormous resources had been poured into the defense network, turning Sloviansk and Kramatorsk into "fortress cities" — logistical hubs and industrial strongholds that have so far resisted Russia's advance.

The latest U.S.-backed 28-point peace plan — drafted by U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff together with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund — envisions Ukraine withdrawing its forces from the region entirely.

Putin reiterated on Nov. 27 that a pullback of Ukrainian troops is his key condition for any ceasefire, even as Washington attempts to revive stalled negotiations.

For Kyiv, the idea of "swapping" the parts of Donbas still under control remains unthinkable. 

It would mean surrendering the very territory Moscow has failed to seize since the very beginning of its invasion in 2014.

The map is engineered to give GOP control of 30 of the state's 38 congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Texas can use its new, GOP-friendly congressional map while a legal challenge plays out, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, temporarily pausing a lower court ruling that had blocked the map from going into effect.

With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court's decision likely means Texas' new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.

Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas' motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.

On Nov. 18, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.

The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown's ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday's ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown's ruling while that longer legal process can play out.

The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”

The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state's 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.

Brown's ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.

Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”

Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.

“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won't protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.

In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown's 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”

“Today's order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today's order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”

The ballot measure seeks to undo a citizen-driven one that passed in 2024, which expanded abortion rights in the state.

An appeals court in Missouri has ordered the rewording of a misleading explainer for a Republican-backed ballot measure that aims to undo a previously passed initiative that expanded abortion and reproductive rights in the state.

The order from the three-judge panel within Missouri's Western District of Appeals represents the second time in just a few months that the explanation accompanying the anti-abortion ballot measure was found to be confusing or deceptive.

Following the 2022 Supreme Court ruling Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, which upended federal recognition of abortion rights, a “trigger law” in Missouri automatically banned abortion in the state. In 2024, abortion rights activists spearheaded a ballot initiative campaign and garnered enough signatures to force a vote on the measure in November, which Missouri voters subsequently passed.

That initiative, now known as Article I Section 36 of the state constitution, recognizes abortion rights up to the point of fetal viability, and allows abortion after that point if it's to protect the life or health of a pregnant person.

After that vote, Missouri state GOP lawmakers immediately began considering ways in which they could still restrict abortion. Republicans eventually advanced their own anti-abortion initiative measure in May through the state legislature, known as HJR 73, which will appear on the ballot in 2026.

In September, however, a state judge ruled that the explanation that would appear with the initiative was unclear, and might be confusing to voters. Shortly after that ruling, Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins (R) rewrote the explainer, which was approved by that judge. 

But Anna Fitz-James, a medical doctor and proponent of the 2024 initiative, appealed that ruling with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union. The appeals court agreed with her complaint, finding that the revised wording was still problematic. 

The post-September explainer offered by Hoskins asks voters if they want to “repeal” the results of the 2024 initiative, without detailing which reproductive rights were included, and “allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape, and incest.” A voter could feasibly believe that the Republican-backed initiative was emboldening some abortion rights based on that language, Fitz-James asserted, rather than actually restricting rights that were recognized last year.

The appeals court ruled on Thursday — less than 24 hours after hearing oral arguments in the case — that, while the language wasn't ambiguous enough to warrant removing the ballot measure altogether, it needed further alterations.

“While we agree with the circuit court that HJR 73 passes constitutional muster, we conclude that both statements fail to sufficiently advise voters that HJR 73, if enacted, would repeal and replace Article I Section 36, as well as inform voters of its additional effects,” the court ruled. “Therefore, we certify to the Secretary of State a revised summary statement and fair ballot language statement.”

Per the court's order, the initiative will now ask voters if they want to “repeal the 2024 voter-approved Amendment providing reproductive healthcare rights, including abortion through fetal viability,” providing a clearer idea of what will happen if voters choose “yes” on the ballot.

Both sides could technically appeal the decision, but it seems that the matter is resolved at this point.

Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway lauded the court's decision to keep the initiative in place, stating “there was no legitimate reason to displace” the language now inserted into the explainer. 

The ACLU also expressed satisfaction with the outcome, noting that it makes the measure clearer to voters, who have already approved pro-abortion language.

“It is crucial that Missourians know they are being asked to end the protections for reproductive health care that we just passed in the last general election,” said Tori Schafer, director of policy and campaigns at the ACLU of Missouri.

Action detailed in a state department memo directs officials to deny visas to any applicant engaging in ‘censorship'

US politics live – latest updates

The Trump administration has moved to formalize a crackdown on the issuance of visas for people who it deems to have engaged in censoring the free speech of US citizens.

The action, detailed in a state department memo sent to overseas missions this week, first reported by Reuters and then NPR, directs consular officials to deny visas to any applicant “responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the US”.

The order, which state department officials have not denied, requires enhanced vetting of applicants “to see if they have worked in areas that include activities such as misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others”, Reuters reported.

It will initially focus on applicants for H-1B visas, usually given to highly skilled foreign workers in the technology industry among other sectors, but is applicable to all visa applications, the news agency added.

The directive is the latest in a number of recent moves by Donald Trump to restrict legal immigration to the US through consular avenues, and hardens a promise made by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in May to bar entry to the US to anybody perceived to be suppressing the free speech “essential to the American way of life”.

In a post on X at the time, Rubio wrote: “Foreigners who work to undermine the rights of Americans should not enjoy the privilege of traveling to our country. Whether in Latin America, Europe, or elsewhere, the days of passive treatment for those who work to undermine the rights of Americans are over.”

According to NPR, which said the memo was sent to US foreign stations on Tuesday, diplomatic officials are instructed to turn down visa applications from anybody who worked on factchecking, content moderation “or other activities the Trump administration considers ‘censorship' of Americans' speech”.

They must scrutinize for evidence an applicant's work history, including going through their LinkedIn profiles and other social media accounts, and looking for mentions in media articles of “activities including combatting misinformation, disinformation or false narratives, content moderation, compliance, and trust and safety”.

If evidence emerges to indicate to a vetting officer that an individual was engaged in censorship activities, “you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible [for a visa]”, the memo states.

Despite having the support of many tech company billionaires, Trump has singled out the industry for criticism and reprisals for banning him from social media platforms including Twitter (before it became X) and Facebook following the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot in Washington DC.

Many H1-B visa applicants, especially from India, work in the field of technology. In September, the president introduced a $100,000 fee for new applicants for the visa classification, a move analysts said at the time could stifle economic growth in the US and provoke a “brain drain” to other countries.

This week's visa restrictions will have other negative impacts, according to experts.

“I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with ‘censorship',” Alice Goguen Hunsberger, vice-president of trust and safety at PartnerHero, told NPR.

“Trust and safety is a broad practice which includes critical and life-saving work to protect children and stop child sexual abuse material, as well as preventing fraud, scams, and sextortion.

“Having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer.”

The Guardian contacted the White House for comment.

In a statement, a state department spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on allegedly leaked documents, make no mistake, the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. We do not support aliens coming to the US to work as censors muzzling Americans.

“In the past, the President himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.”

            Honduran presidential candidate Salvador Nasralla said last-minute interference from US President Donald Trump in the country's closely fought election had damaged his chances of winning and left him trailing as vote counting dragged on.
    


            Nasralla, a three-time presidential hopeful who describes himself as center-right, said in an interview with Reuters that Trump's surprise endorsement last week of the conservative candidate Nasry Asfura had flipped the race.
    


            “It hurt me because I was winning by a much larger margin,” Nasralla said at a hotel in downtown Tegucigalpa, rejecting Trump's label of him as a “borderline communist.”
    


            The latest results released on Thursday by the electoral authority showed Nasralla narrowly trailing in the election, with 39.38% of the vote to Asfura's 40.27%, with around 87% of the ballots counted.
    


Ex-Honduran leader thanks Trump for pardon on US drug trafficking charges



            That slim margin could easily flip. Roughly 17% of ballots have “inconsistencies” and will be reviewed, according to Honduras's electoral authority.
    


            Nasralla also criticized Trump's pardon on the eve of the election of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was serving a 45-year jail term for drug trafficking in the United States.
    


            “I think he deserves punishment in Honduras. I don't know for how long, but he deserves punishment and the Honduran justice system has to prosecute and punish him,” Nasralla said.
    


            Asfura's conservative National Party forged a close partnership with Washington under Hernandez, who governed from 2014 to 2022 and was arrested shortly after leaving office.
    


            Trump has made no secret of his goal to forge a bloc of conservative allies in the region, stretching from Nayib Bukele in El Salvador to Javier Milei in Argentina.
    


            Amid disruptions in the counting of ballots from Sunday's election and allegations of fraud, Nasralla has accused rivals of plotting to steal the election.
    


            Nasralla said his suspicions of election tampering flared around 3:00 a.m. on Thursday when his team reported the election website suddenly went dark. When it came back online, “everything had flipped,” he said. His narrow lead had vanished, leaving him slightly behind.
    


            “That suggests some algorithm changed that shouldn't have,” he added, though he acknowledged he has no proof of wrongdoing.
    


            Fraud allegations haunted Honduras in the fiercely contested 2017 presidential election, with widespread accusations of manipulated vote tallies and irregularities.
    


Long lines in Honduras as voters hit polls



            Honduras' election officials this week urged calm as they work to resolve complications with its rapid count system, technical issues affecting a web portal designed to display real-time results, and unannounced system maintenance.
    


            On Monday, with Asfura ahead in the vote count, Trump hurled allegations of possible fraud without proof and said there will be “hell to pay” if results were changed.
    


            The Organization of American States has so far not documented any manipulation and other experts chalked up the vote count delays to incompetence rather than fraud.
    


            “They all had a hand in building a pretty weak and broken electoral system and this is a byproduct of all that infighting that went on for weeks and months,” said Eric Olson, a senior policy advisor at the Seattle International Foundation and expert on Honduran politics. “This process is not great but it happens all the time in the case of Honduras.”

Kash Patel ordered the FBI to give his girlfriend's drunk friend a lift home after a night of partying in Nashville, according to reports.

Alexis Wilkins, the FBI director's girlfriend and a country music performer, asked her security detail to drive a friend home on at least two occasions, three sources told MS NOW, formerly MSNBC.

Under the direction of Mr Patel, Ms Wilkins has controversially been afforded an FBI detail including members of an elite SWAT team. It is the first known instance of an FBI director's girlfriend receiving a dedicated protective detail.

When asked to provide Ms Wilkins's friend with an escort, the agents objected to deviating from their assigned duties, according to the report.

Mr Patel then allegedly ordered them to comply and, in one instance, allegedly called the head of her security team and shouted at him to ensure the request was carried out.

Former FBI agents and senior law enforcement officials told MS NOW they believed it was troubling Mr Patel had diverted elite tactical agents away from SWAT responsibilities to act as Ms Wilkins's detail.

Agents also said they were astonished that the director instructed those same agents to devote their time to an individual to whom the FBI had no conceivable protective responsibility.

“Not only is the assignment of FBI SWAT personnel to a security detail to protect his girlfriend inappropriate, directing these highly trained professionals to babysit his girlfriend's friend is outrageous, and demonstrative of Kash Patel's complete lack of judgment and integrity,” Christopher O'Leary, a former FBI agent said.

The FBI denied the story. “This is made up and did not happen,” Ben Williamson, an FBI spokesman said.

House Democrats recently launched an investigation into Mr Patel's use of an FBI jet, requesting the bureau turn over all flight records amid reports the director used the aircraft for “date night” travels with his girlfriend, trips to sporting events and a hunting retreat.

Mr Patel has defended his use of the plane, saying in a recent interview that he uses it “less than my prior two predecessors”.

Rinaldo Nazzaro says detention of suspected Base members in Spain justifies ‘resistance … by any means necessary'

After Spanish police and Europol's counter-terrorism section arrested three suspected members of the Base – a globally proscribed neo-Nazi terrorist group – in the eastern province of Castellón, its American leader living in Russia was defiant and signaled further actions.

In a text message to the Guardian, Rinaldo Nazzaro called the arrests another “example of political persecution” by world governments that are “further justifying our resistance to its hegemonic rule by any means necessary”.

The group's presence on the Iberian peninsula underlines how its American brand of extremism, glorifying hyper-violence and modeling itself on an armed insurgency against the state, continues to popularize and be exported abroad. Nazzaro and the Base are also suspected of harboring links to Kremlin spy agencies and aiding their broader sabotage efforts.

Experts were shocked at the level of organization and the arsenal of weaponry the cell was able to achieve inside of Europe.

“This cell was particularly serious,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a terrorism researcher at the Counter Extremism Project who keeps tabs on the digital accounts of the Base. “It should be noted that the group's cell in Spain had its own public Telegram channel, which is unusual, where they repeatedly called on others to join the group, shared photos of weapons training and urged militant action.”

In recent months, the Base has made headlines, claiming the July assassination of a Ukrainian officer in Kyiv and other acts of terrorism inside Ukraine. Then, last week, a Luxembourg court imprisoned a Swedish member of the Base for plotting a mass casualty event at a past Eurovision singing competition.

Fisher-Birch says the Spanish cell was openly endorsing the operations of the group in Ukraine as a sort of example and applauding its efforts to start a white ethnostate in the Zakarpattia region of the war-torn country. Similarly, the Spanish cell advocated online for “calculated ruthlessness” against its perceived enemies and to “acquire mountain land to form protected, self-sufficient and self-managed white communities”.

A data dump of the Base's Spanish Telegram activities reviewed by the Guardian contains propaganda videos, photos, and other posts with what appear to be automatic rifles and other firearms. Ted Kaczynski, the legal name of the Unabomber who sent letter bombs and other explosives to American business executives from his Montana shack during the 70s and into the 90s, also appears to be idolized by the cell.

“Your liberties aren't dying,” one message reposted by the Spanish cell reads, “they're being killed by people with names and addresses.”

Several other photos typical of the Base's internal propaganda of the past show masked men holding its black flag in the Spanish countryside and stylized images of armed members in forests, along with posts espousing the benefits of drone warfare and survivalism.

“It's very simple,” one of its April posts reads, “we live for combat, we sacrifice ourselves for victory.”

The Europol press release on the arrests showcases a confiscated weapons cache – items of which were clearly used in the same propaganda put out by the Base – containing what appears to be multiple firearms, a machine pistol, neo-Nazi paraphernalia, envelopes of cash, ammunition, combat knives, and shirts with Kaczynski's and Adolf Hitler's faces. The European law enforcement agency made it clear the cell's leader was in direct contact with Nazzaro.

“The potential ties to Russian sabotage operations in Europe, whether or not the cell members were aware of it, are also incredibly concerning,” said Fisher-Birch. “The fact that the leader of the Spanish cell was allegedly in contact with Rinaldo Nazzaro also underscores his continued role and raises the possibility that he is directing certain aspects of activity in Europe.”

Currently believed to be living in St Petersburg with his Russian wife and children, Nazzaro has long been accused of being a Russian intelligence asset – an allegation that took on more seriousness when his group started offering money for assassinating Ukrainian military and political figures over the summer in what many saw as direct collaboration with the Kremlin's objectives.

The personal history of the New Jersey native, who formerly worked for the Department of Homeland Security and with American special forces as an analyst targeting jihadist terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, has consistently brought with it questions. Nazzaro has denied any associations with Russian intelligence, going so far as to tell a Kremlin-controlled television channel that he had “never had any contact with any Russian security services”.

But the Base's growing presence on the continent comes as Kremlin operatives are being tapped for sabotage missions all over Europe, targeting allied countries that are supporting Ukraine as it continues to resist invasion. Russian spies are increasingly paying either unknowing individuals in pre-established criminal networks or far-right activists to carry out those attacks.

Both the Spanish police and Europol declined to comment on questions about the cell's potential links to Russian intelligence operations in Europe.

But stateside, the Base hasn't lost its footprint, either. While Nazzaro and the organization have leaned on global expansion, the group is still believed to be most active inside of its founding country, even in the face of historical police scrutiny. The Base was the subject of a relentless FBI counter-terrorism investigation that led to more than a dozen arrests of its members, including three who planned a 2020 mass shooting and bombing in Virginia.

“What stands out about the Spanish case is how closely it mirrors the patterns we have observed elsewhere,” said Steven Rai, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) who has closely studied the Base's global growth in recent years, “including in the United States, where Base members are pairing their ideological beliefs with offline action, including paramilitary-style training, tactical drills and shooting exercises.”

In favor of investigations targeting the Trump administration's political enemies and anti-fascist activists, and contributing resources to nationwide ICE raids, the FBI has moved away from concerning itself with groups like the Base. Multiple sources have said that the bureau, at the behest of the White House and under its director, Kash Patel, has pulled resources from pursuing cases against rightwing extremists of all stripes.

“These behaviors echo the group's earlier era between 2019 and 2020, when various members planned serious acts of violence before being arrested,” warned Rai.

“It is important that law enforcement agencies, platforms, and other stakeholders remain vigilant about the broader threat posed by the Base's underlying ideology and the online ecosystem which has crystallized around it.”

 This article was amended on 5 December 2025. Ted Kaczynski lived in a shack in Montana, not Colorado as an earlier version stated.

Microplastics are the new fear in town—they're linked to numerous health risks, and we just cannot seem to get away from them.

“Plastic is everywhere,” Richard Thompson, professor of marine biology at the University of Plymouth in the UK and the first scientist to coin the term microplastics, told The Epoch Times. “Microplastics are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.”

Hello, this is Yuliia Taradiuk reporting from a foggy Kyiv on day 1,381 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story so far: 

Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, said its drones hit a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber as past of a series of eight "accurate strikes" on military targets inside Russian-occupied Crimea on Dec. 5.

The attacks were carried out with long-range drones by the Prymary ("Ghosts") unit, HUR said in a post on Telegram.

A Su-24 tactical bomber, a radome, a 39N6 Kasta-2E2 radar group, an Orion unmanned aerial vehicle, two 48Ya6-K1 Podlot radar systems, a freight train and a Ural truck were damaged in the attacks.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Since illegally annexing Crimea in 2014, Russia has thoroughly militarized the peninsula, using it as a base for regular missile and drone attacks against Ukraine, operations in the Black Sea, and land operations into southern Ukraine.

Since 2023, Ukraine has steadily increased its options for striking Russian targets in Crimea, using both airborne and maritime drones, depending on the target.

Russian troops reportedly shot dead a Ukrainian Armed Forces soldier who had surrendered in the Siversk direction, Ukraine's military and the Prosecutor General's Office reported on Dec. 5.

According to the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade, Russian troops carried out a covert infiltration into the combat formations of Ukraine's Defense Forces near Svyato-Pokrovske village in the Siversk direction.

Later, a video appeared on Russian information channels showing Russian military personnel at one of the Ukrainian positions in the area.

"The footage shows a Ukrainian soldier raising his hands and demonstrating his willingness to surrender, meaning he was no longer participating in hostilities. Despite this, the occupiers continued to keep him at gunpoint and probably opened fire, which could have led to his death," the brigade wrote on Dec. 5.

The Prosecutor General's Office said that the wounded soldier tried to take cover, but the Russian soldier "finished him off with a shot from an assault rifle."

A pre-trial investigation, under the procedural guidance of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office, has been launched into Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, a war crime that resulted in the death of a person.

The killing of prisoners of war (POWs) violates the Geneva Conventions and is considered a war crime.

French marines opened fire on unidentified drones flying over a French naval base home to nuclear submarines, Le Figaro reported on Dec. 5.

According to the publication, overnight on Dec. 4, five drones flew over the Ile Longue submarine base, where French nuclear deterrent forces are stationed.

Following the incident, a search and anti-drone operation began. The marine battalion assigned to safeguard the base carried out several anti-drone strikes.

The Atlantic Maritime Prefecture announced that it is opening an investigation. "Sensitive infrastructure was not threatened," spokesperson for the Maritime Prefecture, Captain Guillaume Le Rasle, told Le Figaro.

A group of Ukrainian children ages 2 to 17 returned to Ukraine from Russian-occupied territories in southern Kherson Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 5.

The Ukrainian humanitarian NGO Save Ukraine, which rescues children from Russian occupation, reported in a Dec. 4 Facebook post that 18 children were brought back to  Ukrainian-controlled territories over the last week.

Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, deputy head of the Kherson Oblast Military Administration, told the Kyiv Independent that around half of the 18 kids were rescued from the Russian-occupied parts of Kherson Oblast, located on the eastern side of the Dnipro River.

"Each and every one of them fully experienced the so-called 'Russian world,'" Prokudin said in a Telegram post. "It is a real miracle that the children were rescued."

Save Ukraine said in the post that it has rescued over 1,000 children from Russian occupation thus far, but "thousands" are still waiting.

Ukrainian drones hit Russia's Temryuk seaport in Krasnodar Krai and the Syzran Oil Refinery in Samara Oblast overnight, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 5.

The General Staff said it conducted the operation to "reduce the military and economic potential of the Russian aggressor," as domestically produced Ukrainian drones continue to target infrastructure associated with the Russian army deep inside Russia.

The Temryuk port handles the shipment of various cargo types, including liquified natural gas, which is then used to supply the Russian army, according to the General Staff. It added that fire erupted after a Ukrainian drone hit the facility, and that the extent of the damage is still being assessed.

The Syzran Oil Refinery is another infrastructure that supports the Russian logistics, with an annual processing capacity of 7 to 8.9 million tons of oil, the General Staff reported. An earlier Ukrainian drone strike that allegedly damaged a primary oil purification installation has already limited the refinery's capability, being forced to "completely" suspend primary processing of crude oil and operate at less than 50% of its design capacity, the General Staff alleged.

Ukraine's confirmation of its drone strikes comes hours after Russian officials and media reported them earlier in the day.

At least one person has been killed and 23 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 5.

Russia launched 137 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 80 drones. Fifty-seven drones made it through, striking 13 locations, according to the Air Force. 

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed a 12-year-old boy and injured three people, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported. Russian forces carried out shelling with Grad MLRS. Two houses, five apartment buildings, and a civilian vehicle were damages.

In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks injured 11 people over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Throughout the night, Russian forces launched drones, airstrikes, and artillery attacks on 46 settlements, including the city of Kherson. Two residential buildings and 11 houses were damaged, along with a cell tower, bakery, gas pipeline, and a civilian vehicle.

In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks injured seven people, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Over the past day, Russian forces shelled settlements in Donetsk Oblast 30 times. A total of 157 people, including 30 children, were evacuated from the front line.

In Sumy Oblast, Russian attacks injured 40-year-old woman, according to Governor Oleh Hryhorov. Over the past day, Russian forces shelled 39 settlements in Sumy Oblast 90 times. 

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a Russian strike injured one person, the local military administration reported.

Russia has lost around 1,178,610 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 5.

The number includes 1,240 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,396 tanks, 23,686 (+1) armored fighting vehicles, 68,907 (+94) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,843 (+34) artillery systems, 1,558 (+2) multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 431 (+1) airplanes, 347 helicopters, 86,900 (+424) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

The largest House Democrat ideological caucus has called for the defense secretary to ‘resign immediately before his actions cost American lives'

Pentagon announces it has killed four men in another boat strike in Pacific

The New Democrat Coalition, the largest House Democrat ideological caucus, has called for Pete Hegseth to “resign immediately before his actions cost American lives”. It comes after the Pentagon's inspector general's report found he had endangered the lives of US service members by compromising sensitive military intelligence in a Signal group chat earlier this year.

The coalition's chair Brad Schneider and it's national security working group chair Gil Cisneros issued a statement blasting Hegseth as “incompetent, reckless, and a threat to the lives of the men and women who serve in the armed forces”.

The Inspector General's report confirms what we've known all along: Secretary Hegseth is incompetent, reckless, and a threat to the lives of the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces.

A true leader is responsible and accountable – Hegseth is no such leader. He failed to take responsibility for this shameful incident and refused to cooperate with the independent investigation. Now he is denying any accountability for the likely illegal double-tap strike in the Caribbean.

Time and time again, the Secretary has lied, dodged, deflected, and shockingly scapegoated his subordinates. He is a disgrace to the office he holds and should resign immediately before his actions cost American lives.

The Trump administration has moved to formalize a crackdown on the issuance of visas for people who it deems to have engaged in censoring the free speech of US citizens.

The action, detailed in a state department memo sent to overseas missions this week, first reported by Reuters and then NPR, directs consular officials to deny visas to any applicant “responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the US”.

The order, which state department officials have not denied, requires enhanced vetting of applicants “to see if they have worked in areas that include activities such as misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others”, Reuters reported.

It will initially focus on applicants for H-1B visas, usually given to highly skilled foreign workers in the technology industry among other sectors, but is applicable to all visa applications, the news agency added.

The directive is the latest in a number of recent moves by Donald Trump to restrict legal immigration to the US through consular avenues, and hardens a promise made by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in May to bar entry to the US to anybody perceived to be suppressing the free speech “essential to the American way of life”.

Trump reveals that this is one of the biggest honours of his life and then proceeds to reiterate how great he is, for the benefit of anyone who might have been in the rest room while Infantino was talking.

He tells the audience about the “millions and millions of lives” he and Infantino have saved, before mentioning the huge number of tickets Fifa have sold for the World Cup, while steering a wide berth of mentioning Fifa's dynamic pricing strategy. He also nods to his Mexican and Canadian counterparts. It's a mercifully short speech.

A few moments ago Donald Trump was formally presented with the first Fifa Peace Prize. He was presented with a medal and a certificate by Fifa president Gianni Infantino. “I'm going to wear it right now,” said Trump, placing the medal around his neck.

In further comments made before the Fifa World Cup draw in Washington DC, Donald Trump failed to answer a question from a CNN reporter about whether receiving the Fifa Peace Prize would conflict with his vow to strike “on land” soon in Venezuela.

“I haven't been officially noticed — I've been hearing about a peace prize, and I'm here to represent our country in a different sense, but I can tell you I did settle eight wars, and we have a ninth coming, but which nobody's ever done before,” Trump said.

“But I want to really save lives. I don't need prizes. I need to save lives. And we're saving a lot of lives.”

Donald Trump has said he will meet with leaders of Mexico and Canada to discuss trade after the Fifa World Cup draw.

Trump on Friday said that he was “getting along very well” with both leaders and that the US is “working with” Canada and Mexico. He gave no other details.

A reminder that my colleagues are covering the draw in Washington DC here:

Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized Netflix's $72bn acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery's studios, calling it an antitrust “nightmare.”

In a statement on Friday, Warren said:

“This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk.”

She went on to add:

“Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption. The justice department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.”

Netflix was up against takeover bids from Paramount's Skydance and from Comcast, which owns Universal Studios, NBC, and Sky.

Hailing the deal, Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos said:

“The combination of Netflix and Warner Bros creates a better Netflix for the long run… In a world where people have so many choices, more choices than ever on how to spend their time, we can't stand still.”

He also vowed in an investor call on Friday that the deal will be “pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator,” Deadline reports. 

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, instructed law enforcement officials on Thursday to investigate antifa and other supposed domestic terror groups, and specifically directed them to search for “tax crimes” the groups may have committed, according to a memo obtained by the Guardian.

The document signals how the Trump administration and Bondi are ramping up efforts to crack down on leftwing groups. Antifa, short for antifascist, is not a clearly defined organization, but rather a loose network of activists. Trump signed an executive order in September declaring it a domestic terrorism organization – something legal experts say he does not have the authority to do.

“These domestic terrorists use violence or the threat of violence to advance political and social agendas, including opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology, anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, or anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; hostility towards traditional views on family, religion, and morality; and an elevation of violence to achieve policy outcomes, such as political assassinations,” Bondi wrote in the document.

Brian Cole Jr is expected to appear in court later today, he has not yet entered a plea. He was charged yesterday with transporting an explosive device and attempted malicious destruction by means of explosive materials. The FBI has not publicly cited a motive.

The CDC's vaccine advisers have voted 8-3 to remove the broad recommendation that all newborns in the US receive a hepatitis B vaccine, in a major move signaling the Trump administration's regressive approach to vaccines that have been given safely and effectively for decades.

The committee voted to recommend that parents of infants whose mothers test negative for hepatitis should decide when – or if – their child should receive the vaccine series, after consulting a healthcare professional.

The move will add confusion to routine vaccinations and create access issues, especially for lower-income families, experts said. While the advisers make non-binding recommendations, they frequently form the basis of official policy, and they directly affect the way private and federal insurance providers cover the vaccines.

“This is going to lead to an increase in preventable infections among children,” said Michaela Jackson, program director of prevention policy at the Hepatitis B Foundation. The vote is “removing choice by causing barriers to access” and “parents are not going to know who to trust any longer,” she said.

Hepatitis B vaccines are still recommended to children whose mothers test positive for the virus, the advisers said. The shots for most infants at birth will now be “shared clinical decision-making”, the advisers deciding, voting 8-3, although this is a term that is poorly defined and usually reserved for non-routine vaccines.

If a parent is not able to get their child the vaccine at birth, the advisers now suggest waiting at least two months.

Court didn't announce a date to hear oral arguments but it will likely be in the next few months 

The US supreme court has agreed to decide if Donald Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship with an executive order is constitutional.

Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in office in January that declared that children born to undocumented immigrants and to some temporary foreign residents would no longer be granted US citizenship automatically – seeking to upend a guarantee of US citizenship to anyone born on American soil that has been understood since 1898.

Legal challenges were prompt, with judges in Washington State, Maryland and Massachusetts freezing the policy for the whole country. The supreme court later sided with the Trump administration on technical grounds dealing with how the challenges to the policy were handled by lower courts through universal injunctions.

The supreme court didn't announce a date to hear oral arguments but it will likely be in the next few months, with a decision handed down by the end of June.

A key CDC advisory panel voted to abandon the decades-old recommendation that all babies get vaccinated against hepatitis B within the first 24 hours of life, in a major win for health secretary and vaccine-sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr. The 8-3 decision followed heated debate and three failed attempts at a vote. The advisers said that women who test negative for the virus should consult with their health care provider and decide “when or if” their child will be vaccinated at birth. They didn't change the recommendation that newborns of mothers known to be infected or whose status is unknown be innoculated. The shift will only got into effect if approved by the CDC and is not expected to affect insurance coverage of the shots. Public health experts fear the change would lead to an increase in preventable infections in children. “Today is a defining moment for our country,” Michael Osterholm told the NYT. “We can no longer trust federal health authorities when it comes to vaccines.”

The New Democrat Coalition, the largest House Democrat ideological caucus, called for Pete Hegseth to “resign immediately before his actions cost American lives”. It comes after the Pentagon's inspector general's report found he had endangered the lives of US service members by compromising sensitive military intelligence in a Signal group chat earlier this year. The coalition's chair Brad Schneider and it's national security working group chair Gil Cisneros issued a statement blasting Hegseth as “incompetent, reckless, and a threat to the lives of the men and women who serve in the armed forces”.

Two men who survived a US airstrike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean clung to the wreckage for an hour before they were killed in a second attack, according a video of the episode shown to senators in Washington. The men were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible radio or other communications equipment. They also appeared to have no idea what had just hit them, or that the US military was weighing whether to finish them off, two sources familiar with the recording told Reuters. The pair desperately tried to turn a severed section of the hull upright before they died. “The video follows them for about an hour as they tried to flip the boat back over. They couldn't do it,” one source said.

The man charged with planting two pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican party headquarters the night before the January 6 attack on the US Capitol told the FBI he believed conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, NBC News and CNN reported. He's appeared in court this afternoon. The judge was expected to read Cole the charges he's facing and inform him of his rights, and could also decide whether Cole should be detained for now or set conditions of his release while he awaits his next court date.

Donald Trump's administration has said Europe faces “civilisational erasure” within the next two decades as a result of migration and EU integration, arguing in a policy document that the US must “cultivate resistance” within the continent to “Europe's current trajectory”.

Billed as “a roadmap to ensure America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history and the home of freedom on earth”, the US National Security Strategy makes explicit Washington's support for Europe's nationalist far-right parties.

The document, with a signed introduction by Trump, says Europe is in economic decline but its “real problems are even deeper”, including “activities of the EU that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies that are transforming the continent, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition … and loss of national identities”.

The 33-page exposition of Trump's “America First” worldview appears to espouse the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, saying several countries risk becoming “majority non-European” and Europe faces “the real and stark prospect of civilisational erasure”. It adds:

Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognisable in 20 years or less.

US policies must therefore include “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations” as well as enabling Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” and “opening European markets to US goods and services”.

The Trump administration has moved to formalize a crackdown on the issuance of visas for people who it deems to have engaged in censoring the free speech of US citizens.

The action, detailed in a state department memo sent to overseas missions this week, first reported by Reuters and then NPR, directs consular officials to deny visas to any applicant “responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the US”.

            Family ties may become strained for former South African President Jacob Zuma after his eldest daughter accused her half-sister of deceiving 17 men – half of whom are reportedly relatives – into fighting for Russia in Ukraine.
    


            The controversy highlights the growing recruitment of Africans into Russian military forces due to a shortage of Russian recruits as well as the close ties between Moscow and veterans of the African National Congress. Zuma previously belonged to the political party, which originated as a liberation movement that fought for democratic rule in South Africa.
    


            Zuma, 83, stepped down as president in 2018 in the wake of a series of corruption scandals and was expelled from the party he once led in 2024. He received military training in the Soviet Union during apartheid, an institutionalized system of racial segregation that kept Blacks and Whites apart.
    


            Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, 43, is one of nearly two dozen children of the former South African leader. She has been a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has expressed admiration for him on social media.
    


            Last week, Zuma-Sambudla resigned from her position in parliament, where she represented the uMkhonto weSizwe Party — led by her father — following a criminal complaint filed against her by her older half-sister, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube.
    


            This complaint came after the South African government began investigating how 17 citizens became trapped in the war-torn Donbas region of Ukraine. The government was alerted to the men's plight after they made distress calls asking to return home.
    


Across Africa, Russia is growing in influence. What might Moscow want?



            Authorities revealed last month that the men were “lured to join mercenary forces involved in the Ukraine-Russia war under the pretext of lucrative employment contracts.”
    


            Zuma-Mncube alleged that the actions of Zuma-Sambudla and two other individuals contributed to the men's situation. Zuma-Sambudla has not publicly responded to the accusations.
    


            Under South African law, it is illegal to serve in a foreign military without government approval.
    


            The Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second-largest political party, has also filed criminal charges against Zuma-Sambudla after discussions with the families of the trapped men.
    


            Zuma-Sambudla already faces separate charges of incitement to commit terrorism and public violence, according to prosecutors, for allegedly inciting violence on social media during riots that resulted in more than 300 deaths following her father's imprisonment for contempt of court charges in 2021. Zuma was released in 2023. Zuma-Sambudla has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
    


            Lawmaker Chris Hattingh, a Democratic Alliance spokesperson on defense and military veterans, shared his findings with the national broadcaster SABC.
    


            “I have been in contact with families, and everybody tells exactly the same story,” he said, explaining that the men “were totally misled” and “lured into Russia for personal development” under the guise of “security training.”
    


            When they arrived in Russia, Hattingh continued, “Their clothes and passports were allegedly burned, their phones were taken away gradually, and then finally, there's no contact with them anymore.”
    


            In her defense, Zuma-Sambudla said she did not intend to recruit South Africans to serve as mercenaries in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
    


            In an affidavit presented to the police and referenced by the local newspaper, Daily News, she stated that she had been misled by someone named “Khoza,” who contacted her on WhatsApp, claiming to be a South African citizen living in Russia with connections to a “legitimate paramilitary training program” that did not involve combat.
    


South Africa to probe recruitment of citizens as mercenaries in Russia-Ukraine conflict



            Zuma-Sambudla  revealed that she enlisted and participated in the paramilitary training in Russia for a month and was not exposed to any combat situations, according to the newspaper. She then recommended 22 other people, including her relatives, to enroll in the program. Of the 22 people who initially traveled, 17 South Africans are now reportedly in north Donetsk as part of Russian forces.
    


            “Based on my own experience, I believed that the program was lawful and safe. But I, too, was manipulated and used to create a false impression of legitimacy,” she was quoted as saying.
    


            Zuma-Sambudla reportedly assured that she would fully cooperate with authorities.
    


            The South African police announced that they are investigating whether “any criminality, including possible human trafficking, illegal recruitment, exploitation, or fraud, may have contributed to the movement of these individuals to the conflict zone.”
    


            CNN has requested comments from Russia's military and foreign ministry. In November, however, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated at a press briefing that Russia had no information about the South African nationals and had not yet received any communication from the South African government regarding the matter.
    


            “If there is a request of this kind from Pretoria, we will be ready to consider it in accordance with the existing procedure in the spirit of relations of strategic partnership existing between Russia and South Africa,” she said.
    


            Russian authorities have previously denied pressuring foreigners to enlist in its military.
    


            According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, more than 1,400 citizens from 36 African countries are fighting for Russia in Ukraine. “Most of them are immediately sent to the so-called ‘meat assaults' where they are quickly killed,” he stated last month.
    


            Current information regarding Russia's personnel losses is limited, but Western intelligence agencies estimate that the Kremlin has suffered over 1 million casualties, including more than 250,000 deaths, since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
    


            The United Kingdom's defense ministry estimates that approximately 1,000 Russian soldiers are killed or injured each day.
    


            Recent events in South Africa mirror controversies in Kenya, where authorities are working to secure the release of more than 200 of its nationals involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
    


            Kenya's foreign ministry has indicated that recruitment networks remain active in the East African country. Last week, The Star, a local newspaper, reported that a Kenyan man was killed while fighting for Russia in Ukraine, only one month after arriving for a driving job.
    


In Africa, Russia is swapping a ruthless paramilitary for a replica it can control. What's Putin's game plan?



            Analysts suggest that the recruitment of African mercenaries to bolster Russia's military operations in Ukraine involves not only the Kremlin but also recruiters on social media who often mislead potential candidates about the nature of the job. Those who reveal the job's true nature advertise enticing offers, including quick visas, salaries up to $2,500 per month, and free healthcare.
    


            Paul Mudau, a senior lecturer in Public, Constitutional and International law at the University of South Africa, explained, “Scammers handle the initial lure, often through ads on Telegram or Facebook for ‘jobs' in Russia.”
    


            However, he told CNN, “Once recruits arrive, Russian authorities detain them, force them to sign Russian-language contracts, and deploy them with minimal training.”

25,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community — thank you.

FIFA has pressured multiple European football clubs to pay outstanding transfer fees to Russia, despite international sanctions and banking restrictions, according to an investigation by Follow the Money published on Dec. 5.

Football clubs are forced to pay outstanding fees even if doing so runs the risk of violating sanctions against Russia. 

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the FIFA Football Tribunal has ruled on 13 cases involving clubs claiming payments from other clubs that had lapsed after sanctions were imposed on Moscow, the investigative outlet Follow the Money reported. 

In all cases, clubs were told to pay within 45 days or face a ban for three transfer periods. 

In one such case, the London-based club West Ham United was ordered to pay the sanctioned Russian club CSKA Moscow or face a ban, as West Ham had not paid the full transfer fee of 26 million euros (over $30 million) for the Croatian player Nikola Vlasic. 

West Ham argued it could not complete the payments because CSKA, its owner, managing director, and the financial institutions it banked with all appeared on sanctions lists. Paying the outstanding fees would violate U.K. law, the club argued. 

FIFA ruled that West Ham had to pay anyway. 

According to Follow the Money's investigation, FIFA issued the same ruling in 13 cases — eight involving European teams owing money to Russian organizations, and five involving Russian teams owing clubs in Europe. 

"The existence of sanctions has no effect on the existence and expiry date of a debt," FIFA said in multiple rulings.

West Ham appealed FIFA's decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in May 2025 and won the case, with CAS saying it was "objectively impossible to make payment of the second instalment."

In only one other known instance, the Swedish Djurgardens succeeded in convincing FIFA it could not legally make payments to the Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg due to national and EU law. 

Publicly available documents suggest that the other European clubs have all found ways to pay the Russian teams for fear of facing FIFA penalties, Follow the Money reported. 

FIFA's rulings put the sports governing body at odds with the global sanctions regime against Russia — and run the risk of violating international law. 

While FIFA suspended Russia from all its competitions in 2022 following the launch of the full-scale invasion, the organization has since drawn criticism for actions related to Russia and Ukraine. In December 2024, FIFA sparked outrage when it displayed a map during the 2026 World Cup draw that excluded Crimea from Ukraine. 

In 2023, FIFA also faced backlash when it lifted the ban on participation by under-17 athletes from Russia.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, said its drones hit a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber as past of a series of eight "accurate strikes" on military targets inside Russian-occupied Crimea on Dec. 5.

The Prosecutor General's Office said that the wounded soldier tried to take cover, but the Russian soldier "finished him off with a shot from an assault rifle."





Ukrainska Pravda, citing law enforcement sources, reported that Anna Skorokhod, a lawmaker from the For the Future party, is suspected of taking a large bribe.



A group of Ukrainian children ages 2 to 17 returned to Ukraine from Russian-occupied territories in southern Kherson Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 5. 


European leaders privately insisted they alone should control decisions over immobilized Russian assets, even as the US reportedly lobbied European countries to block plans to lend the cash to Ukraine.

A fire caused damage to facilities at the Temryuk port in Krasnodar Krai, a major Russian hub and oil export terminal. Locals also reported explosions at the Syzran Oil Refinery in Samara Oblast. 

President Vladimir Putin said Russia would continue supplying fuel to India's "rapidly growing economy," calling Moscow a reliable energy partner. 

The More in Common survey shows strong international objections to key parts of the latest peace proposals being put forward by the White House.



The document says that it is in the U.S. interest to "negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine" to enable the country's post-war recovery, stabilization of European economies, and to "reestablish strategic stability with Russia."

The visit comes amid a surge of diplomatic efforts after the U.S. backed a 28-point plan that many viewed as effectively pushing Ukraine toward capitulation in Russia's all-out war.

Football clubs are forced to pay outstanding transfer fees even if doing so runs the risk of violating banking restrictions and sanctions against Russia.

The Associated Press

11:47 JST, December 5, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates around the world to prioritize visa applications from foreigners wishing to visit the United States to either invest in America or attend the 2026 World Cup, 2028 Olympics and other major sporting events.

At the same time, the administration has added new criteria for highly skilled foreign workers seeking a particular visa. The new rules would deny entry to those deemed to have directed or participated in the censorship of American citizens on social media through content moderation initiatives that have sprung up throughout Europe and elsewhere to combat extremist speech.

In a series of cables sent this week to all U.S. diplomatic missions that were obtained by The Associated Press, the State Department said visa applications for businesspeople considering “significant investments” in the United States should be at the top of the list for consideration along with applications from those wanting to travel “for major sporting events which showcase American excellence.”

It is the latest effort by President Donald Trump's administration to crack down on migrants and visitors entering the U.S. But with major sports events planned in the United States, the administration is looking to ensure that fans are able to attend those competitions. The policies are getting heightened attention ahead of Friday's World Cup draw.

As part of a broader initiative to control the entry of foreigners into the U.S., the State Department has said all those who require visas to enter the country would need to submit to an in-person interview and screening to vet them for potential national security risks.

This has led to lengthy wait times at many embassies and consulates for interviews to apply for what are known as “B1” and “B2” visas despite a surge in consular staffing.

Last month, Trump announced a new initiative, dubbed “FIFA Pass,” for foreigners traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup that will allow them to get interviews for visas more quickly. Nonetheless, he still encouraged them to apply for their visas “right away.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration had dispatched more than 400 additional consular officers around the world to handle the demand for visas for the World Cup and that in about 80% of the globe, travelers to the U.S. can get a visa appointment within 60 days — something reflected in the cable.

The new steps in the cable this week go beyond the FIFA Pass initative to expedite applications for those looking to travel to the United States for the Olympics and other major sports events.

Posts “should ensure sufficient appointment capacity to accommodate spectators and other fans traveling for events surrounding the (World Cup) tournament,” said one of the two cables sent Tuesday. “These should take priority over all other B1/B2 applications, except those related to American re-industrialization.”

Others to be prioritized include foreign diplomats, government officials traveling on official business, temporary agricultural workers, religious workers, physicians and nurses, and students attending academic institutions with less than 15% foreign enrollment.

“Posts should ensure that applicants of higher ranked groups get priority over applicants and lower rank groups, regardless of demand by lower ranked applicants,” the cable said. “Posts may significantly reduce the number of appointment slots available to lower rank groups in order to accommodate demand from higher rank groups.”

A second cable sent Tuesday to all embassies and consulates set out new criteria for considering H-1B visa applications, instructing diplomats to “be on the lookout” for those who may have been or are “responsible for or complicit in the censorship of Americans” online and elsewhere.

Those visas allow American companies to bring in people with technical skills that are hard to find in the United States, and President Donald Trump has said he would slap a $100,000 annual fee on them.

The department said evidence of this could lead to visa denial. It defined such information as having “adopting global content moderation policies inconsistent with freedom of expression, complying with global content moderation or censorship demands from a foreign entity and providing access to private data on American citizens in connection with content moderation.”

Proof of this could be obtained from an applicant's resume, employment history, social media profiles and posts, and public statements or writings, the cable said, adding that the State Department was developing tools to make it easier and quicker to conduct these screenings.

It noted that all visa applicants are subject to these criteria, but that H-1B applicants should be looked at most closely “as many work or have worked in the tech sector, including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.”

“You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,” the cable said, adding that “if you uncover evidence and applicant was responsible for or complicit in censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible” for a visa.

Reuters

11:15 JST, December 5, 2025

TOKYO, Dec 5 (Reuters) – American actor and playwright Jeremy O. Harris, known for the Tony-nominated “Slave Play”, was arrested last month at an airport in Japan on suspicion of attempting to smuggle illegal drugs into the country, local authorities said late on Thursday.

Harris, 36, was stopped on November 16 at Naha Airport on Okinawa island after a customs officer discovered 0.78 grams of crystal containing the synthetic narcotic MDMA in his tote bag, an Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson said.

He was immediately arrested on suspicion of violating Japan's Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Act. Local customs officials filed a criminal accusation with the regional prosecutor's office on Thursday to begin formal charging proceedings against Harris.

An official with a police station in Tomigusuku city in southern Okinawa confirmed that Harris remains in custody. The official declined to comment on whether Harris has admitted to the allegations.

Harris' representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear whether he has retained legal representation in Japan.

Harris had arrived in Okinawa for sightseeing purposes, travelling from Britain via Taiwan, where he had a flight layover, the customs spokesperson said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination some 1,500 km (930 miles) southwest of Tokyo, known for its beaches and American military bases.

Japan maintains strict drug laws with severe penalties for possession and smuggling offences. The country has some of the toughest narcotics regulations among developed nations, with even small amounts of illegal substances resulting in criminal prosecution. Punishments, however, are not as harsh as in other Asian countries such as China and Singapore, where drug offenders can face the death penalty.

Foreigners arrested in recent years in Japan for suspected drug offences include former Australian rugby league player Blake Ferguson in December 2021. In 1980, former Beatle Paul McCartney was arrested after arriving in Tokyo with a bag of marijuana and was banned from entering Japan for years.

WASHINGTON, December 5. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump believes that the Ukrainian conflict would be eventually resolved and the United States works "very hard on it."

"We're making peace all over the world," Trump said before the ceremony of the National Christmas Tree lighting at the White House in Washington DC.

"We're settling wars at levels that nobody's ever seen before. Eight of them. We're looking for one more. That's Russia-Ukraine, if that's possible and I think we'll get there eventually. We got to get that stopped, we're working very hard on it," he added.

Washington had previously proposed a 28-point plan for settling the conflict in Ukraine. The document caused discontent among Kiev and its European partners, who tried to significantly revise it. On November 23, the US and Ukraine held consultations in Geneva.

Later, US President Trump said that the initial plan for a peaceful settlement had been revised to take the positions of Moscow and Kiev into account, leaving only a few contentious issues. He also noted that the number of points had been reduced to 22.

On November 30, representatives of the US and Ukraine met in Florida to discuss ways to end the conflict, long-term solutions to economic and security issues, prospects for elections in Ukraine, and the territorial issue.

On December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, businessman Jared Kushner, at the Kremlin. The key topic was the settlement in Ukraine. The conversation lasted about five hours. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, the sides discussed the essence of the proposals from the four documents on the US peace plan.

Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Olga Stefanishina announced earlier that Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, who heads the country's delegation to the settlement talks, would fly to the United States on December 4 for a follow-up meeting with US Presidential Envoy Witkoff.

Soccer balls were not easy to come by when Eneck Louis was a kid growing up in 1970s Haiti. 

Undeterred, he and his friends sometimes played with oranges until the fruit burst and left a streak of juice on the clay pitch. Other times, the boys made do with leftover baseballs from the nearby Rawlings factory.

“We couldn't kick hard, because it would hurt our toes!” recalled Louis.

The country's singular love of soccer has flourished despite the Western hemisphere's worst poverty, generations of dictatorship, coups and natural disasters – including the 2010 earthquake that destroyed a mural to Emmanuel Sanon, hero of Haiti's last trip to the World Cup in 1974, which pictured him alongside Che Guevara. 

Now, the island nation currently paralyzed by gang violence is returning to the World Cup for the first time in more than 50 years. Celebrations rocked the usually deserted nighttime streets of Port-au-Prince after a qualifying victory against Nicaragua in November.

Louis cheered the team from Montreal, where he now works as a taxi driver, part of Canada's nearly 200,000-person Haitian community. But his jubilation, like that of many, is shaded by worry about the country's continuing gang crisis and U.S. hostility that could limit Haitian access to the tournament. 

“Even when we see some light, it's as if it's temporary,” he said. 

Haiti will learn its opponents in Friday's World Cup draw, when the nation will be placed in one of 12 groupings, but won't know where it will be playing until the full schedule is released Saturday. 

Group matches in Mexico and especially Canada would be a relief, because many Haitian fans won't be allowed to enter the U.S. thanks to a months-old travel ban that prohibits entry visas for citizens of their country. Many Haitian-Canadians with dual citizenship are also avoiding the U.S. as a result, for fear of being targeted at the border.

Only team officials, athletes and coaches are exempt from U.S. President Donald Trump's travel restrictions. Also affected by the U.S. travel ban will be Iranian citizens hoping to cheer on Iran's national team, ranked 20th in the world. 

Trump introduced the travel ban in June, as part of restrictions against 12 countries that he said were essential to “protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.” 

The White House says Haiti was included on the list because “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens” have flooded into the U.S., an influx it says harms America because of “increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.” Trump says Iran is on the list because it's a state sponsor of terrorism.

Officials from both countries have flatly rejected the U.S.'s claims and appealed to FIFA. 

FIFA officials, who have sought close ties with Trump, did not respond to requests for comment. 

World Cup draw in Washington is one more play in Trump and FIFA's long game of politics

Hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants in the U.S. are also facing deportation starting in February, just four months before the World Cup is to begin, after the Department of Homeland Security announced the termination of their temporary immigration status. 

That protection, given to Haitians living in the U.S. after the 2010 earthquake, was stripped away after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem decided it was safe for Haitians to return to their country, despite widespread gang violence.

Fedora Mathieu, a Haitian-born immigration lawyer in Ottawa, said many Haitian-Canadians are already avoiding travel in the U.S. because of the immigration policies targeting Haitians. Her office has also been getting flooded with requests from Haitian migrants in the U.S who are trying to get out of the country, she said. 

It's all overshadowing Haiti's Cinderella soccer story, she said, at a time when the country desperately needs some good news.

“It's heartbreaking,” Mathieu said. “Some of these people have lived in the U.S. for 15 years, they have homes there, they have lives there, and now they have to leave. As Haitians, we have not had much to celebrate in recent years, and it's just sad to see this.”

Already the poorest nation in the Americas, Haiti's gang violence and continuing humanitarian crisis have left it feeling like a “war zone,” she said. Even the very infrastructure that supports soccer has been under attack.

In February, armed gangsters took control of the country's national soccer headquarters and training ground for its top players, the FIFA Goal Center, located in one of Port-au-Prince's poorest suburbs. Nicknamed “the ranch,” the centre was once a rural mansion where Haitian dictator Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier built a soccer pitch and barracks – funded by diverted U.S. humanitarian aid the dictator used to help Haiti qualify for the 1974 World Cup, according to government investigators.

The ransacking of the soccer training ground came only a few months after a gang occupied and vandalized Haiti's national soccer stadium, the Stade Sylvio Cator, named after the Haitian Olympian who competed in the 1924 and 1928 Olympics. An employee of the Haitian Football Federation was kidnapped as part of that break-in. 

As a result of the violence, which has displaced more than a million Haitians and killed thousands more since gangs effectively took over the capital in spring 2024, the team has played none of its qualifying matches in Haiti, instead hosting “home” games on neutral ground. Coach Sébastien Migné, a French national, has never set foot in Haiti. 

As FIFA adds constraints to World Cup draw, the possibility for inherent bias remains

Many of the team's leading players were also born abroad, part of Haiti's millions-strong diaspora, including the French-born striker Duckens Nazon and Wolverhampton Wanderers midfield Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. 

Still, some observers believe this improbable group could make a real difference to the struggling country. Soccer has helped catalyze political change in Haiti before, said University of Virginia professor Laurent Dubois, who has written extensively about soccer and Haitian history. 

In 2004, during a time of civil unrest, the Brazilian national team visited Haiti on a peace initiative and the government floated the idea of offering game tickets to fans who would forfeit their firearms. Many Haitians supported Brazil during their own team's years in the wilderness in part because it featured so many great Black players. The disarmament scheme was ultimately scrapped, but the friendly match against Haiti was a success. 

This World Cup will not solve the country's gang crisis, but it may be at least a temporary salve for Haitians at home and abroad who have been bludgeoned by bad news in recent years. 

Paul Toussaint is a Haitian restaurateur in Montreal who grew up playing soccer on the streets of Jacmel, a regional hub. Although he decried Trump for “playing politics” on the visa issue, he said there was “nothing more beautiful” than Haiti's World Cup qualification.

“This gives hope,” he said. “It shows that our people are capable.”

When President Donald Trump suspended the refugee program on day one of his current administration, thousands of people around the world who had been so close to a new life in America found themselves abandoned.

Many had already sold possessions or ended leases in preparation for travel. They had submitted reams of documents supporting their cases, been interviewed by U.S. officials and in many cases already had tickets to fly to America.

As part of Trump's crackdown on both legal and illegal migration, the Republican president has upended the decades-old refugee program that has served as a beacon for those fleeing war and persecution. In October, he resumed the program but set a historic low of refugee admissions at just 7,500 — mostly white South Africans. 

A litany of new restrictions was announced after an Afghan national became the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members last week. The Trump administration also plans a review of refugees let in during the Democratic Biden administration. Trump's administration has cited economic and national security concerns for its policy changes.

About 600,000 people were being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world when the program was halted, according to the administration. Dozens of white South Africans have been let in this year. But only about 100 others have been admitted as a result of a lawsuit by advocates seeking to restart the refugee program, said Mevlüde Akay Alp, a lawyer arguing the case. 

“It's important that we don't abandon those families and that we don't abandon the thousands of people who were relying on the promise of coming here as refugees,” said Akay Alp, with the International Refugee Assistance Project.

The Associated Press spoke to three families whose lives have been thrown into disarray because of the changing policies.

The Dawoods had waited years for the opportunity to come to the U.S. After fleeing civil war in Syria, they settled in northern Iraq. They hoped to find a home that could provide better medical care for a daughter who had fallen from the fourth floor of the family's apartment building.

After they were accepted as refugees to the U.S., son Ibrahim and his sister Ava relocated to New Haven, Connecticut, in November 2024. His parents and one of his brothers were scheduled to fly in January. 

But just two days before they were to board their flight, mother Hayat Fatah fainted at a medical check and her departure was postponed. Mohammed, another sibling, didn't want to leave his parents behind.

“I said: ‘This is it. The chance is gone.' But I had to stay with my father and mother,” Mohammed said.

Nearly a year later, he and his parents are still waiting. Without a residency card, Mohammed can't work or travel outside of their home in the city of Irbil. The family gets by on money sent from relatives abroad.

Mohammed had dreams for his hoped-for new life in America: starting a business or finishing his studies to become a petroleum engineer; getting married and building a family. 

“Whether it was now, a year from now, two years later or four years, I will wait and hope that I will go,” he said.

In America, Ibrahim often wakes up early to tutor people online before going to his job as a math teacher at a private school, and then he takes care of his sister when he gets home. He said his mother often cries when they talk because she wishes she were in America to help care for her daughter. 

Ibrahim said one solace has been the welcome he's received in the U.S. Volunteers have stepped in to take him and his sister to frequent doctor appointments and helped them adjust to their new lives.

“I really appreciate the kindness of the people here,” he said.

Chinese Christian Lu Taizhi fled to Thailand more than a decade ago, fearing persecution for his beliefs. He's lived in legal limbo since, waiting to be resettled in the United States.

Lu said he has long admired the U.S. for what he calls its Christian character — a place where he feels he and his family “can seek freedom.” He said he was disappointed that people like him and his family who applied for refugee status legally face so many difficulties in going to the U.S.

“I oppose illegal immigration. Many are fake refugees, or illegal immigrants, they've never faced oppression. I'm opposed to this,” Lu said. “But I hope America can accept people like us, real refugees who faced real oppression. … It's really disappointing.”

Lu comes from a long lineage of dissent: He was born into a family branded as “hostile elements” by the Chinese Communist Party for its land ownership and ties to a competing political party. A teacher and poet, Lu grew interested in history banned by the Chinese state, penning tributes to the bloody 1989 Tiananmen crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing.

In 2004, Lu was arrested after police found poems and essays he secretly published criticizing Chinese politics and the education system. After his release, Lu became a Christian and began preaching, drawing scrutiny from local authorities. Year after year, officers knocked on his door, warning him not to organize protests or publish commentary criticizing the Party.

With Chinese leader Xi Jinping's rise to power, controls tightened. When Beijing arrested hundreds of rights lawyers in 2015, Lu took his family and fled, worried police would come for him. After traveling across Southeast Asia, Lu and his family settled in Thailand, where they applied for refugee status with the United Nations.

Eight years later, the U.N. notified Lu the U.S. had accepted his application. But their first flight, in April 2024, was postponed because Lu's sons' passports had expired. A second, scheduled for Jan. 22, 2025, was canceled without explanation, and the most recent one, scheduled for Feb. 26, was canceled shortly after Trump's inauguration. His application has been put on hold indefinitely, Lu said. 

Today, Lu is scraping a meager living as a teacher and pastor in Northern Thailand. He's separated from his wife and children in Bangkok, Thailand's capital, but says he has no choice if he wants to earn money and support his family.

“I am very supportive of all of Trump's policies because I think only President Trump can dismantle the CCP,” Lu said, using an acronym referring to the Chinese Communist Party. “So I don't have any complaints. I just wait silently.”

Louis arrived in the United States as a refugee in September 2024. He left his wife and two children in East Africa, hoping they could soon be reunited in the U.S. 

But that dream faded a few months later with Trump's return to the presidency.

Louis, who insisted on being identified only by his first name out of concern that speaking publicly could complicate his case, was told in January that a request he had made to bring his family to the U.S. had been frozen due to changes in refugee policies.

Now, the family members live thousands of miles apart without knowing when they will be reunited. His wife, Apolina, and the children, 2 and 3 years old, are in a refugee camp in Uganda. Louis is in Kentucky.

“I don't want to lose her, and she does not want to lose me,” said Louis, who resettled in Kentucky with the help of the International Rescue Committee. “The hope that I had went slowly down. I thought that we would never meet again,” he said referring to the moment when he received the notice.

Louis and Apolina's families applied for refugee status after fleeing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Louis' application, initiated by his parents, was approved, Apolina's, made separately by her parents, was not. They hoped if Louis applied for family reunification in the U.S., that would ease the way to bring over Apolina and the two children.

Apolina thought that, as the wife of a refugee, it would take her no more than one year to reunite with her husband, who now works in an appliance factory and has already applied for permanent residency. 

The separation hasn't been easy for her and the children, who live in a tent in the refugee camp. The younger one, who was 7 months old when Louis left, cries every time he sees his father in a video call. The older one keeps asking where Louis is and when he will see him.

Apolina fears that as time drags on, the children will forget their father.

“I feel terrible because I miss my husband very much,” said Apolina in a phone interview from Uganda. “I pray for him that God enables him to be patient until we meet again.”

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A federal judge on Friday gave the Justice Department permission to release transcripts of a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of underage girls in Florida — a case that ultimately ended without any federal charges being filed against the millionaire sex offender.

U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith said a recently passed federal law ordering the release of records related to the cases overrode a federal rule prohibiting the release of matters before a grand jury. 

The law signed last month by President Donald Trump compels the Justice Department, FBI and federal prosecutors to release later this month the vast troves of material they have amassed during investigations into Epstein.

When the documents will be released is unknown. The government had asked the court for permission to include the usually secret grand jury records in the files they are required to make public under the new federal law, known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The Justice Department hasn't set a timetable for when it plans to start releasing information, but the law set a deadline of Dec. 19.

However, the law also allows the Justice Department to withhold files that it says could jeopardize an active federal investigation. That's also longstanding Justice Department policy. Files can also be withheld if they're found to be classified or if they pertain to national defense or foreign policy.

One of the federal prosecutors on the Florida case did not answer a phone call Friday and the other declined to answer questions.

The Justice Department had requested the unsealing of documents from three Epstein-related separate cases: the 2006-2007 Florida grand jury investigation into Epstein, his 2019 sex trafficking case in New York and Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking case, also in New York. The Florida request was approved Friday. The New York requests are pending, with the Justice Department facing a Monday deadline to make its final filing — a response to submissions by victims, Epstein's estate and Maxwell's lawyers. The judges in those matters have said they plan to rule expeditiously.

Live Updates


            • Tournament takes shape: The groups are set for the opening stages of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada. Mexico and South Africa will play the opening match on June 11 in Mexico City, kicking off the chase for the ultimate prize in international soccer.
    


            • A spectacle in Washington: President Donald Trump was awarded the newly created FIFA Peace Prize during an opening ceremony that featured celebrity hosts, musical performances and plenty of fanfare in the US capital.
    


            The United States knows two of its three opponents in Group D — and neither is considered a powerhouse.
    


            Mauricio Pochettino's USA squad will face Australia, which is ranked No. 26 by FIFA, and Paraguay, ranked No. 39.
    


            Australia has become a mainstay at the World Cup: The Socceroos reached the Round of 16 in 2022 and 2006 but failed to advance out of group play in 2010, 2014, 2018.
    


            Paraguay is back in the World Cup after failing to qualify in the last three tournaments. Los Guaraníes advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals in 2010.
    


            The final spot in Group D will go to whichever team qualifies from the European Playoffs C.
    


            Now that we know which teams will play each other in the group stage, attention turns to when and where they will face each other.
    


            Fans will have to wait until tomorrow, though, when FIFA will confirm the kickoffs times and host stadiums for the all games.
    


            The full match schedule will be revealed during a live broadcast from Washington, DC which starts at 12 p.m. ET.
    


            The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw ended on a familiar note for events in Washington, DC: “YMCA.”
    


            The Village People came out and sang their hit “YMCA.”
    


            Some people in the crowd, dressed in suits, clapped along to the music. President Donald Trump, who often dances to the song at his events, is in attendance.
    


            Here's the final group list for fans to revel in or stress about. Remember, the sorting was done such that no two teams from the same confederation – except Europe – had to face each other in the first stage.
    


Group A: Mexico, South Africa, South Korea and whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs D
    


Group B: Canada, whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs A, Qatar, Switzerland
    


Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Haiti, Scotland
    


Group D: USA, Paraguay, Australia, whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs C
    


Group E: Germany, Curaçao, Ivory Coast, Ecuador
    


Group F: Netherlands, Japan, whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs B, Tunisia 



Group G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand
    


Group H: Spain, Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay
    


Group I: France, Senegal, whichever team claims the spot from FIFA Playoffs Tournament 2, Norway
    


Group J: Argentina, Austria, Algeria, Jordan
    


Group K: Portugal, the winner of FIFA Playoffs Tournament 1, Colombia, Uzbekistan
    


Group L: England, Croatia, Ghana, Panama
    


            World Cup draws aren't just an exciting look to the future, they can also be incredibly nostalgic.
    


            The country of my birth, Scotland, is back in the World Cup for the first time in 28 years — and they are back with a bang, drawn against Brazil in Group C.
    


            As soon as the draw was made, my mind flashed back to their group game in 1982, when an audacious strike from David Narey gave the Scots the lead. My father jumped from the sofa, shouted, “Goal,” clapped twice and turned up the TV so we could hear better. The mighty Brazil roared back to a 4-1 win.
    


            Again in 1990, and yet again in 1998, Scotland met Brazil, this time in the opening game, when the Scots were beaten again. Scotland hasn't played in the World Cup since then.
    


            This will be the fifth time the national team will play Brazil in the tournament's group stage — and maybe this time they can win! The Tartan Army can only hope, but it's so good to be back.
    


            Curaçao made history as the smallest nation by population to ever qualify for a World Cup and it's got an amazing game to start: European juggernaut Germany.
    


            Both have been drawn into Group E, alongside Ivory Coast and Ecuador.
    


            Those inside the Curaçao camp wanted to play a big team on its debut and it's certainly got its wish.
    


            You've got to love the World Cup draw and its ability to produce some of the best matchups imaginable.
    


            Group I is looking particularly strong already, with France, Senegal and Norway already drawn together.
    


            It means we will see two of the best strikers on the planet go head-to-head, with France's Kylian Mbappé coming up against Norway's Erling Haaland.
    


            Senegal will be no pushover either.
    


            Baseball's Aaron Judge, the New York Yankees' MVP, drew teams from Pot 3 into groups. The sorting was done such that no two teams from the same confederation had to face each other in the first stage.
    


Group A: Mexico, South Africa, South Korea
    


Group B:﻿ Canada, Qatar, Switzerland
    


Group C:﻿ Brazil, Morocco, Scotland
    


Group D:﻿ USA, Paraguay, Australia,
    


Group E: Germany, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador
    


Group F:﻿ Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia
    


Group G: Belgium, Iran, Egypt
    


Group H: Span, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia
    


Group I: France, Senegal, Norway
    


Group J: Argentina, Austria, Algeria
    


Group K: Portugal, Colombia, Uzbekistan
    


Group L: England, Croatia, Panama
    


            South Africa and Mexico will play in the opening match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
    


            Both teams are in Group A. They will play on June 11 in Mexico City to kick off the race for the ultimate prize in international soccer.
    


            Time to take a quick breath.
    


            All the Pot 2 teams have now been drawn out, and this is where we stand:
    


Group A: Mexico, Korea
    


Group B: Canada, Swizterland
    


Group C: Brazil, Morocco
    


Group D: USA, Australia
    


Group E: Germany, Ecuador
    


Group F: Netherlands, Japan
    


Group G: Belgium, Iran
    


Group H: Spain, Uruguay
    


Group I: France, Senegal
    


Group J: Argentina, Austria
    


Group K: Portugal, Colombia
    


Group L: England, Croatia
    


South Korea will go into Group A, joining Mexico there.
    


            Meanwhile, Switzerland will go into Group B, joining Canada.
    


Morocco will join Brazil in Group C, which should be a good match to watch.
    


Australia joins the US in Group D, Ecuador is drawn into Group E joining Germany and Japan will play the Netherlands in Group F.
    


            No team is likely looking forward to a potential matchup with Norway, which is through to its first FIFA World Cup since the France 1998 tournament.
    


            One of the main reasons for that is Manchester City goal machine Erling Haaland. Haaland was born in England and could have theoretically represented the Three Lions.
    


            He plundered a staggering 16 goals in eight qualifying matches. Two of those happened recently in the 4-1 thrashing of four-time World Cup winners Italy.
    


            Haaland is in red-hot form right now, having just become the quickest player to reach 100 Premier League goals in just 111 matches. So keep an eye on the Norwegians in Pot 3.
    


            Haaland is a generational talent who deserves his chance on the biggest global football platform there is. So far, he's netted 55 times for his country in just 48 matches. At the age of just 25, there are surely many more to come.
    


            Spain, the reigning European champion and current world number one, has been drawn into Group H.
    


            Argentina was drawn into Group J, because Spain and Argentina must be in separate pathways, according to the rules.
    


            France will be in Group I and Portugal will be in Group K.
    


            France, led by Kylian Mbappé, was the runner-up in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup.
    


            Meantime, Cristiano Ronaldo will look to guide his team to victory in his last chance at the trophy for Portugal.
    


            Finally, England will go into Group L.
    


            First ball out of the official draw and it's already a team many will want to avoid.
    


            Brazil maintains its record of qualifying for every World Cup competition to date and will be a tough team to beat next year.
    


            Meanwhile, Germany goes into Group D, the Netherlands in Group F and Belgium in Group G.
    


            This part of the draw will be very simple but just wait until we get to the Pot 2 teams.
    


            All the information you need is right here with the draw just minutes away.
    


            Quick reminder, each group will consist of teams from each of the four pots.
    


            We are finally underway with the actual draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup group stage.
    


            The draw proceedings began with a ceremonial selection by the leaders of each of the co-host countries, who drew the ball for their nation. That was followed by another musical performance, more comments from the ceremony hosts, and a couple video features.
    


            But now we're witnessing the real McCoy, and a group of sports icons has taken the stage to begin the draw: hockey's Wayne Gretzky, American football's Tom Brady, basketball's Shaquille O'Neal and baseball's Aaron Judge.
    


            Let's see what the balls reveal.
    


Remember: We already knew which groups Mexico, Canada and the United States would be in, but now, the rest of the world — minus six countries that will be decided in a playoff in March — will find out who they play.
    


This post has been updated to reflect the latest from the ceremony.



            Lauryn Hill, award-winning rapper and songwriter, took the stage at the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw in what has been a spectacle of an event before the larger draw itself even began.
    


            Her debut solo album, ‘The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,” was released in August 1998 and won five Grammys, including album of the year and best new artist for Hill.
    


            Before her performance, the audience at the Kennedy Center heard several other musical numbers, too. Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger sang “Desire,” according to FIFA, and Andrea Bocelli performed a rendiiton of “Nessun Dorma” from the opera Turandot.
    


            Scattered in between the performances and speeches by the leaders of FIFA and the host countries, some hype-inducing videos played on the big screen. Some were about how the sport unites people across the world and another highlighted the host countries — the US, Canada and Mexico.
    


            On top of it all, the event is being hosted by stars Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart.
    


            It's the day that billions of fans around the world have been waiting for.
    


            All eyes are currently on the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington DC for the World Cup group-stage draw, a process which will decide who plays who at next year's tournament.
    


            The 48 countries (only 42 have been confirmed, but we'll get to that bit later) have been split into four equal pots, depending on their world ranking – or status as co-hosts.
    


            In this draw, a team from each pot will be randomly selected into one of the 12 groups, until each group has four teams in it.
    


            However, there are a few constraints.
    


            First, we already know where each of the three co-host nations will go. That's due to where the matches will be played across North America. So we know that Mexico will be in Group A, Canada in Group B and the United States in Group D.
    


            Also, no team from the same confederation can be drawn in the same group, excluding teams from Europe – a maximum of two UEFA nations can be drawn into the same group.
    


            These get a little confusing when you consider the spots reserved for the winners of the playoffs but stick around for how that will work…
    


            It doesn't feel right to say Brazil has been flying under the radar in the run-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but by their lofty standards — to some degree at least — they have been.
    


            Now coached by the legendary Carlo Ancelotti, the 5-time World Cup winners, who are in Pot 1, remain the tournament's most successful nation. They're also the only country to have featured in every World Cup going back to 1930.
    


            Oh, and guess who won the last time the World Cup was played in the US, back in 1994? Brazil, after a penalty shootout victory over Italy.
    


            CNN Sports' Andy Scholes has been busy asking fans about what they're hoping for during this World Cup draw.
    


            Unsurprisingly, everyone wants to avoid facing the best teams during the group stage.

Club for Growth president David McIntosh says deep-pocketed conservative political group ‘will be there to back up' President Donald Trump's push for red states to redraw congressional maps to create more GOP-leaning districts.

The Republican-controlled Indiana House on Friday pushed through congressional redistricting championed by President Donald Trump.

The new map, drawn by a national Republican-aligned group, would create two more right-leaning congressional districts in the solidly red Midwestern state, where the GOP currently controls 7 of Indiana's 9 U.S. House seats.

The vote — coming less than 24 hours after the Supreme Court cleared the way for GOP-dominated Texas to use its newly redrawn map, which creates five more right-leaning House seats — marks the latest front in Trump's aggressive national campaign to reshape congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms, when Republicans will defend their razor-thin House majority. 

The real drama in Indiana will come next week, when the GOP-dominated state Senate, which has resisted Trump's efforts to draw new congressional maps, meets to vote on the redistricting bill passed by the state House.

BIG WIN FOR TRUMP AS SUPREME COURT GREENLIGHTS TEXAS' NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP

The GOP supermajority in the Indiana House passed the redistricting bill 57-41, in a chamber where Republicans outnumber Democrats 70-30.

In debate ahead of the vote, state Rep. Matt Pierce, who is the Assistant Democratic Floor Leader, pointed to his Republican colleagues and argued "you really want to erase the Democratic Party when it comes to Congress."

And Pierce claimed that Trump, by pushing redistricting through red states across the country, is basically saying "I need to cheat to win."

Democratic Rep. Sue Errington also took aim at the redistricting bill, charging that the message from the measure is "voters don't matter."

At the sole public hearing on the bill, held earlier this week, the author of the measure acknowledged the new map was "politically gerrymandered" and drawn "purely for political performance" of Republicans.

DEEP-POCKETED CONSERVATIVE GROUP ‘ALL IN' ON HELPING TRUMP REDISTRICTING PUSH

But GOP state Rep. Ben Smaltz defended the new map from accusations of racial gerrymandering. Partisan gerrymandering is not prohibited under federal law, but racial gerrymandering is illegal.

All but two of the 43 of the members of the public who testified at the hearing spoke out against the bill.

Smaltz, making a final pitch for his bill just ahead of the vote, emphasized that "nothing in the law prevents the legislature from revisiting maps when circumstances demand it. The Supreme Court could not be clearer – states may redraw districts whenever they deem appropriate, provided constitutional and statutory requirements are met."

The measure now moves to the legislature's upper chamber. Despite pressure from Trump and his political team, Indiana Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray has repeatedly said there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting.

DEEP-POCKETED CONSERVATIVE GROUP ‘ALL IN' ON HELPING TRUMP REDISTRICTING PUSH

Trump, in response, repeatedly threatened to back primary challenges against state Republican lawmakers who didn't support his congressional redistricting push.

"A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn't care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity," Trump warned in a recent social media post.

Bray, in announcing that the state Senate would reconvene to take action on redistricting, said "the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state."

Trump has been twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state twice earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting.

TRUMP TARGETS RED STATE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN PUSH FOR CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING

Trump has also taken some jabs at Republican Gov. Mike Braun of Indiana, arguing that the governor "perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes."

While Trump has called Braun "a good man," he has warned he "must produce on this, or he will be the only Governor, Republican or Democrat, who didn't."

But Braun, pointing to the president, has touted that he is "committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress."

Meanwhile, the Trump-aligned conservative outside group the Club for Growth Action, has dished out big bucks to run ads in Indiana supporting redistricting, and along with Turning Point Action, will target Republican state lawmakers opposed to the new map.

The push by the president in Indiana is part of a broad effort by Trump's political team and the GOP to pad the party's razor-thin House majority ahead of the midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.

"We must keep the Majority at all costs," the president wrote recently.

Trump, by championing rare but not unheard of mid-decade redistricting, is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.

Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. State lawmakers in GOP-dominated Florida this week took the first steps towards passing a redistricting measure, and right-leaning Kansas is also mulling redrawing their map.

Two federal judges in Texas last month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state couldn't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. But the Supreme Court on Thursday gave a big thumbs up to the Lone Star State's new congressional map.

Democrats are fighting back.

California voters a month ago overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature.

That is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats.

Illinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.

And in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The 'Fox & Friends' hosts discuss more red states joining President Trump's push to 'Make America Healthy Again' by banning the use of food assistance programs for sugary drinks and junk food.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, grocery, pharmacy, liquor and convenience stores in California will not be able to provide any single-use thin plastic bags or even "reusable" plastic film bags.

The updated law stems from Senate Bill 270, which was first introduced in 2014. It previously allowed the use of reusable bags — which were made of a thicker plastic.

Senate Bill 1053 now "eliminates the distribution of thicker film plastic bags."

As opposed to "single use" bags, thicker plastic bags could be reused up to 125 times, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

Recycled paper bags may be offered to shoppers in the Golden State, but they must be "sold for not less than 10 cents." People on specific food programs may be available to get these for free.

The bill's text says the bags must "contain a minimum of 50% post-consumer recycled materials" to be counted as a paper bag beginning Jan. 1, 2028.

The legislation hopes to "support sustainable and thriving communities and natural environments that are not littered with plastic waste."

NEW YORK (AP) — Netflix struck a deal Friday to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, the Hollywood giant behind “Harry Potter” and HBO Max, in a $72 billion deal that would bring together two of the biggest players in television and film and potentially reshape the entertainment industry.

If approved by regulators, the merger would put two of the world's biggest streaming services under th

e same ownership — and join Warner's television and motion picture division, including DC Studios, with Netflix's vast library and its production arm, which has released popular titles such as “Stranger Things” and “Squid Game.”

“For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world's attention, and shaped our culture,” David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement. “By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.”

The cash and stock deal is valued at $27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, including debt. The transaction is expected to close in the next 12 to 18 months after Warner completes its previously announced separation of its cable operations. Not included in the deal are networks such as CNN and Discovery.

The proposed merger could draw intense antitrust scrutiny, particularly for its effect on streaming subscriptions.




“Netflix is the top streaming service today. Now combined with HBO Max, it will absolutely cement itself as the Goliath in the streaming industry,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company.




One of the big unanswered questions, Proulx added, is whether HBO Max and Netflix would “stay as separate streaming services or combine into a mega streaming service.” 

But either way, he said, customers could see some price relief in the form of a single subscription bill or bundle promotions, which would be a welcome change as streaming prices continue to rise and consumers feel the pinch of paying for multiple services.

Of course, that all depends on whether the deal goes through. Netflix on Friday maintained that the addition of HBO and HBO Max programming will give its members “even more high-quality titles from which to choose” and “optimize its plans for consumers.”

Others warned that a Netflix-Warner combo could create an even bigger entertainment titan with ramifications for both consumers and people working across the film and TV industry.

Gaining Warner's legacy studios would mark a notable shift for Netflix, particularly its presence in theaters. Under the proposed acquisition, Netflix has promised to continue theatrical releases for Warner's studio films, honoring Warner's contractual agreements for movie releases.

Netflix has kept most of its original content within its core online platform. But there have been exceptions, including qualifying runs for its awards contenders, including this year's “Frankenstein,” limited theater screenings of a “KPop Demon Hunters” sing-a-long and its coming “Stranger Things” series finale.

Though the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales, “KPop Demon Hunters” unofficially topped the box office in late August taking in nearly $20 million.

“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix said in a statement, adding that merging with Warner will “give audiences more of what they love.”




Critics say a Netflix-Warner combo would be bad news for people who love to go to movie theaters and for those who work in them. Cinema United — a trade association that represents more than 30,000 movie screens in the U.S. and another 26,000 screens internationally — was quick to oppose the proposed deal, which it said “poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business.”

“Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite,” Michael O'Leary, CEO of Cinema United, said Friday, urging regulators to look closely at the impacts. “Theaters will close, communities will suffer, jobs will be lost.”

Netflix had previously avoided venturing into other parts of the legacy entertainment landscape. As recently as October — when Warner signaled that it was open to a potential sale of its business — Netflix's Sarandos reiterated on an earnings call that the company had been “very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks” and that there was “no change there.”

Warner Bros., which is 102 years old, is one of the “big five” studios left in Hollywood. If the Netflix sale goes through, the remaining legacy studios would be Disney, Paramount, Sony Pictures and Universal.

Friday's announcement arrived after a monthslong bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery. Rumors of interest from Netflix, as well as NBC owner Comcast, started bubbling up in the fall. Skydance-owned Paramount, which completed its own $8 billion merger in August, also reportedly made several all-cash offers.

Paramount seemed like the front-runner for some time — and unlike Netflix or Comcast, was reportedly vying to buy Warner's entire company, including its cable business housing CNN and Discovery.

Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday from The Associated Press.

While Netflix's bid won over Warner's approval, experts stressed that a bumpy regulatory road lies ahead.

“No doubt politics are going to come into play,” Proulx said. He pointed particularly to the Trump administration's relationship with the family of Larry Ellison, whose son David runs Paramount, and reports of that company's frustrations over the sale process — both of which, he noted, “can't be ignored as part of the calculus as to the outcome of all of this.”

Warner announced its intention to split its streaming and studio operations from its cable business back in June, outlining plans for HBO, HBO Max, as well as Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group and DC Studios, to become part of a new streaming and studios company.

Meanwhile, networks such as CNN, Discovery and TNT Sports and digital products such as the Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report would make up a separate cable counterpart called “Discovery Global.” Discovery Global is set to become a new publicly traded company, in a process now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.

Shares of Warner Bros. rose nearly 2% after U.S. markets opened Friday, while shares of Netflix fell nearly 2%. Paramount fell nearly 6%.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration will be expanding its ban on travel for citizens of certain countries to more than 30, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, in the latest restriction to come since a man from Afghanistan was accused of shooting two National Guard members.

The expansion would build on a travel ban already announced in June by the Republican administration, which barred travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and restricted access to the U.S. for people from seven others. In a social media post earlier this week, Noem had suggested more countries would be included. 

Noem, who spoke late Thursday in an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, would not provide further details, saying President Donald Trump was considering which countries would be included. 

In the wake of the National Guard shooting, the administration already ratcheted up restrictions on the 19 countries included in the initial travel ban, which include Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran and Haiti, among others.

Ingraham asked Noem whether the travel ban was expanding to 32 countries and asked which countries would be added to the 19 announced earlier this year. 

“I won't be specific on the number, but it's over 30. And the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” Noem said.

“If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem said.




The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about when an updated travel ban might go into effect and which countries would be included in it.

Additions to the June travel ban are the latest in what has been a rapidly unfolding series of immigration actions since the shooting Thanksgiving week of two National Guard troops in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, has been charged with first-degree murder after one of the two victims, West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, died of wounds sustained in the Nov. 26 shooting. The second victim, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, was critically wounded. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty. 

The Trump administration has argued that more vetting is needed to make sure people entering or already in the U.S. aren't a threat. Critics say the administration is traumatizing people who've already gone through extensive vetting to get to the U.S. and say the new measures amount to collective punishment. 

Over the course of a little more than a week, the administration has halted asylum decisions, paused processing of immigration-related benefits for people in the U.S. from the 19 travel ban countries and halted visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort. 

On Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was reducing the time period that work permits are valid for certain applicants such as refugees and people with asylum so they have to reapply more often and go through vetting more frequently.

LONDON (AP) — The Eurovision Song Contest, which aims to be an upbeat celebration of music and unity, is facing the biggest crisis in its seven-decade history after four countries walked out of the competition over Israel's participation and others weighed whether to join the boycott.

Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Slovenia announced they will not take part in the 2026 contest in Vienna in May after organizers declined to expel Israel over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza. Iceland is considering whether to follow suit.

The walkouts cast a cloud over the future of what's meant to be a feel-good cultural party, dealing a blow to fans, broadcasters and the contest's finances.

Eurovision expert Paul Jordan said Friday “it's unlikely we'll see a mass exodus” but that 2026 will be a “tense year.”

Founded in 1956, in part to help unite a shattered continent after World War II, Eurovision pits acts from dozens of countries against one another for the continent's musical crown.

Overtly political symbols and lyrics are prohibited, but global tensions have often imposed themselves. Russia, for example, was expelled in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Tensions rose again after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people, and Israel's subsequent campaign in Gaza that has left more than 70,000 people dead. The last two Eurovision contests have seen pro-Palestinian protests both outside the venues and inside, forcing organizers to clamp down on political flag-waving. 

A number of performers and countries have called for the exclusion of Israel, which has taken part in Eurovision since 1973, one of a few non-European countries to compete.

The Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union — a group of public broadcasters from 56 countries that runs Eurovision — tried to assuage concerns by tightening rules on contest voting and campaigning in response to allegations that Israel manipulated the public vote in favor of its competitor Yuval Raphael. She came second in this year's contest behind Austrian singer JJ.

The EBU's general assembly approved the new rules Thursday, but did not hold a vote on Israel's participation. It said “a large majority of members” felt the contest “should proceed as planned, with the additional safeguards in place.”

Eurovision Director Martin Green told Swedish television that the meeting reaffirmed “the belief that the Eurovision Song Contest shouldn't be used as a political theater. It must retain some sense of neutrality.”

Immediately after the EBU decision, broadcasters RTVE in Spain, AVROTROS in the Netherlands, RTÉ in Ireland and Slovenia's RTVSLO announced they were pulling out.

RTVE said the situation in Gaza, despite the recent ceasefire, and “Israel's use of the contest for political purposes, make it increasingly difficult to maintain Eurovision as a neutral cultural event.” RTÉ said participation was “unconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza.”

Icelandic broadcaster RUV, which had recommended Israel be barred, said its chiefs will meet Wednesday to discuss whether to join the walkout.

Other countries' broadcasters, including Norway's NRK and Britain's BBC, welcomed the decision to keep Israel in the competition.

“We support the collective decision made by members of the EBU,” the BBC said in a statement. “This is about enforcing the rules of the EBU and being inclusive.”

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said his country opposes a cultural boycott of Israel.

“I am pleased that Eurovision did not give in to pressure, and that France helped prevent a boycott of Israel in this forum,” he wrote on X. “I deeply regret that several European television channels made a different choice.”

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on social platform X that he was “pleased” Israel will again take part and hoped “the competition will remain one that champions culture, music, friendship between nations and cross-border cultural understanding.”

Some Israelis said they were glad their country was participating but felt the debate around them was unfair.

“I'm happy but I'm not dancing in the streets,” Izhar Cohen, who won Eurovision in 1978, told The Associated Press in Tel Aviv. “Eurovision should be a meeting and gathering together with no politics of all the people from all nations,” he said.

Tel Aviv resident Bret Katz said “it's a terrible, terrible thing to ostracize a country and not to understand who was attacked on October 7, 2023.”

The boycotting countries will not send a musical act to the 2026 contest and will not broadcast it. That will likely cut into viewership of a contest that typically draws more than 150 million viewers.

Fans in the boycotting countries should still be able to watch on digital platforms including YouTube, and another Dutch broadcaster, NPO, said it will air the show in the Netherlands.

The boycotts are a financial blow to Eurovision, which is funded largely by participating broadcasters — and to boycotting public broadcasters at a time when many are under financial pressure from government funding cuts and competition from social media.

The EBU does not disclose how much each country pays, but the pullouts include Spain, one of the “Big Five” large-market countries that contribute the most to the contest.

So far, more than two dozen countries have confirmed they will compete in Vienna, including heavyweights like seven-time champion Sweden. The EBU says a final list of participants will be released before Christmas.

The boycott is offset to an extent by the return of Bulgaria, Moldova and Romania to Eurovision after periods of absence because of financial and artistic reasons.

Jordan said viewing figures would be closely watched, “and if they are significantly down, then that'll probably raise alarm bells.

“But I think overall the contest is a sturdy thing,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration has set forth a new national security strategy that paints European allies as weak and aims to reassert America's dominance in the Western Hemisphere. 

The document released Friday by the White House is sure to roil long-standing U.S. allies in Europe for its scathing critiques of their migration and free speech policies, suggesting they face the “prospect of civilizational erasure” and raising doubts about their long-term reliability as American partners. 

At the same time the administration is sharply critical of its democratic allies in Europe and carrying out a pressure campaign of boat strikes in South America, it chides past U.S. efforts to shape or criticize Middle Eastern nations and seeks to discourage attempts for changes in those countries' governments and policies.

The strategy reinforces, in sometimes chilly and bellicose terms, Trump's “America First” philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. 

The U.S. strategy “is motivated above all by what works for America — or, in two words, ‘America First,'” the document said.

This is the first national security strategy, a document the administration is required by law to release, since the Republican president's return to office in January. It is a stark break from the course set by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which sought to reinvigorate alliances after many were rattled in Trump's first term and to check a more assertive Russia. 




Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy “catastrophic to America's standing in the world and a retreat from our alliances and partnerships.”

“The world will be a more dangerous place and Americans will be less safe if this plan moves forward,” Crow said.

The United States is seeking to broker an end to Russia's nearly 4-year-old war in Ukraine, a goal that the national security strategy says is in America's vital interests. But the document makes clear that the U.S. wants to improve its relationship with Russia after years of Moscow being treated as a global pariah and that ending the war is a core U.S. interest to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia.”

The document also accuses America's longstanding European allies, which have found themselves sometimes at odds with Trump's shifting approaches to the Russia-Ukraine war, of facing not just domestic economic challenges but, according to the U.S., an existential crisis.

Economic stagnation in Europe “is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure,” the strategy document said. 

The U.S. suggests that Europe is being enfeebled by its immigration policies, declining birthrates, “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition” and a “loss of national identities and self-confidence.” 

“Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less. As such, it is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,” the document said. 

The document also gives a nod to the rise of far-right political parties in Europe, which have been outspoken in their opposition to illegal immigration and climate policies.

“America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the strategy said.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul acknowledged the U.S. is “our most important ally” in NATO but said questions about freedom of expression or “the organization of our free societies” are not part of alliance discussions.

“We also don't think that anyone needs to give us any advice on this,” Wadephul told reporters.

Markus Frohnmaier, a lawmaker with the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, described the U.S. strategy as “a foreign policy reality check for Europe and particularly for Germany.”

Despite Trump's “America First” maxim, his administration has carried out a series of military strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean while weighing possible military action in Venezuela to pressure President Nicolás Maduro.

The moves are part of what the national security strategy lays out as “a ‘Trump Corollary' to the Monroe Doctrine” to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.” The 1823 Monroe Doctrine, formulated by President James Monroe, was originally aimed at opposing any European meddling in the Western Hemisphere and was used to justify U.S. military interventions in Latin America.

Trump's strategy document says it aims to combat drug trafficking and control migration. The U.S. also is reimagining its military footprint in the region even after building up the largest military presence there in generations.

That means, for instance, “targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades,” it says.

With a shift to the Americas, the U.S. will seek a different approach in the Middle East. 

The U.S., according to the strategy, should abandon “America's misguided experiment with hectoring” nations in the Middle East, especially monarchies in the Gulf, about their traditions and forms of government.

Trump has bolstered ties with nations there and sees Middle Eastern countries as ripe for economic opportunities, and the Arab nations are “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship, and investment,” the document says. 

“We should encourage and applaud reform when and where it emerges organically, without trying to impose it,” it says.

This year, Trump made his first major foreign trip to the Middle East, and his efforts to settle the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza has been a major focus. But the U.S. plans to shift its focus from the region, the administration says, as America is less dependent on its oil supply.

Meanwhile, as the U.S. under Trump has overturned decades of free trade policies with his sweeping global tariffs, its ties with China have been a prime focus. America under Trump is seeking to “rebalance” the U.S.-China relationship while also countering Beijing's aggressive stance toward Taiwan, according to the document.

The Trump administration wants to prevent a war over Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and to which the U.S. is obligated by its own laws to give military support, by maintaining a military advantage over China.

But the U.S. wants allies in the region to do more to push back against Chinese pressure and contribute more to their defense.

“The American military cannot, and should not have to, do this alone,” the strategy says. “Our allies must step up and spend — and more importantly do — much more for collective defense.”

America's vaccine playbook is being rewritten by people who don't believe in them.

The federal government is ending its recommendation that every infant receive a hepatitis B vaccination at birth, the most substantive change to the childhood immunization schedule yet under US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Instead, the Trump administration is leaving the question to “individual decision-making,” according to new guidelines recommended by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday. If the new guidelines are adopted by the CDC, as expected, most parents will be left to decide on their own in consultation with their doctor. (Mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose hep B status is unknown will still be advised to give their baby the shot at birth.)

The new recommendations will suggest, however, that if your child does not receive the birth dose, you should wait until they are at least two months old before giving it to them. At least two members of the committee — Dr. Joseph Hibbeln and Dr. Cody Meissener — argued that there was no scientific basis for the two-month recommendation and that no data had been presented to justify it.

“It's unconscionable,” Hibblen said Friday shortly before the final vote. Nevertheless, the change was approved as part of a 8-3 vote.

The changes are in keeping with Kennedy's track record so far on vaccines, seeking to cast doubt on their value and remove official recommendations for them, leaving decisions instead to individual patients. The CDC already walked back the Covid-19 vaccine recommendations to leave it up to individuals and did the same earlier this fall for a rarely used combination measles vaccine.

But the hepatitis B vaccine is a different case.

It has been universally recommended since 1982, and more than 70 percent of newborns have received it within their first three days of life in the US in recent years. It's also a clear public health win. Before the 1980s, there were about 300,000 new cases of hepatitis B every year. In 2023, there were an estimated 14,000 new cases.

So, why would they do this?

During this week's meeting, the new vaccine committee — whose membership had been completely overhauled by Kennedy Jr. in June to better reflect his own vaccine skepticism — challenged the long-held consensus that every newborn should receive their first dose within days of being born. Presenters argued that the birth dose might not confer long-term protection to patients and that the safety risks of the vaccine hadn't been appropriately studied. They also asserted that, unless a mother is positive for hepatitis B, the risk to a newborn is low.

But, those arguments were quickly challenged, both by some of the committee members and outside experts watching the meeting. “It calls to mind a magician with a sleight of hand,” Chen told me. “They were picking data, whatever it is that supports their argument.” Meissner pressed the presenters on whether there was any confirmed case of somebody who was otherwise healthy and received the recommended hep B birth dose but later developed an infection. CDC staff later said they were not aware of any such case.

Likewise, the presentation on safety risk was largely limited to appealing to an absence of evidence, arguing that the available data was simply too limited. When Meissner pressed on whether there is any real evidence of harm from the birth dose, the presenter, Mark Blaxill, an anti-vaccine activist who has alleged a connection to autism and is now employed at the CDC, replied, “The safety evidence is very limited. I wouldn't want to speculate on safety or harm.”

Nevertheless, the committee pressed ahead with changing the guidance.

This shift in policy represents the victory of anti-public health vibes. Over and over again in this week's meetings, the committee members who wanted to make a change to hep B vaccine guidance acknowledged the limited evidence to justify their decision but argued that, because so many Americans no longer trust public health experts, they had to do something. That something amounts to a piece-by-piece dismantling of decades of scientific consensus.

“I've also been a critic of the CDC for many years,” Blaxill said, “so it's been an honor and a privilege to work on the inside.”

Many of Kennedy's vaccine committee members were specifically selected because they shared fringe views on vaccines that aligned more with Kennedy's, who has long pushed the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, as well as other health problems.

“They are personally motivated by their own internal views, which they voiced for many years,” Chen said. “They now have a soapbox on which they can preach.”And now, they are in a position to actually change government policy.

They aren't going to waste that opportunity — even if there is not an urgent reason to make these changes. While the Trump administration claims to believe in “gold-standard science,” its vaccine experts are clearly willing to skirt the science if it fits their agenda. More than once during this week's meetings, committee members and federal health officials — even some of those who were supportive of the changes — acknowledged a lack of data-based justification for the two-month timeline for the first shot or a new recommendation approved by the committee that parents may administer antibody tests to check their child's immunity before administering later doses.

That is an approach that is likely to further erode trust in vaccines. Many Republicans were already dubious about the government's health guidance, and now Democrats are losing faith, too. If vaccination rates drop far enough, more people may get sick. One doctor who spoke during the public comment period at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting urged panel members to consider the possibility that even a single child could get infected hepatitis B because of this change.

That is the risk they are taking.

The Court's Texas decision is a victory for Republicans, and it is a terrible blow to all gerrymandering plaintiffs.

The Supreme Court reinstated a Texas gerrymander that is expected to give Republicans five additional seats in the US House on Thursday evening, after a lower federal court struck that gerrymander down. As is often the case in politically contentious cases, the justices appear to have voted entirely along party lines, with only the Court's three Democrats dissenting.

The Court's decision in Abbott v. League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) is a victory for the Republican Party. And it is likely to have brutal implications for all future federal lawsuits challenging gerrymandered maps. Though the Court's order in LULAC is brief, it imposes such heavy burdens on gerrymandering plaintiffs that few, if any, such plaintiffs will be able to succeed in future cases.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Indeed, LULAC is so hostile to anti-gerrymandering suits that many civil rights lawyers and plaintiffs may simply decide not to bother challenging illegal maps, because their chances of prevailing in court will be so hopeless.

To understand LULAC, it's helpful to also understand a distinction between two different types of gerrymanders. Often, state legislatures draw maps that favor whichever party controls that legislature. These maps are known as “partisan” gerrymanders. Other times, states may draw their maps to change the racial makeup of various legislative districts, often to give an advantage to white voters. These maps are known as “racial” gerrymanders.

As a practical matter, the line between racial and partisan gerrymanders is often thin. Black Americans, for example, tend to vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. So a map that seeks to maximize Republican power will often closely resemble a map that seeks to minimize Black representation.

Prior to LULAC, however, it mattered a great deal whether courts determined that a particular map was drawn for partisan or racial reasons. In Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court's Republican majority held that federal courts may not hear challenges to partisan gerrymanders. So, if a court determined that a disputed map was drawn entirely for partisan reasons, the map would be upheld.

The Court has also taken several steps to undercut plaintiffs challenging racial gerrymanders, and it is expected to eliminate the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against these gerrymanders later in its current term. But, prior to LULAC, there was still one set of circumstances when a plaintiff challenging a racial gerrymander could prevail. As the Court held in Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP (2024), “if a legislature gives race a predominant role in redistricting decisions, the resulting map is subjected” to the most skeptical level of constitutional scrutiny.

This matters because, before Texas enacted the gerrymander at the heart of the LULAC case, President Donald Trump's Justice Department sent a letter to Texas that essentially ordered it to redraw its maps to change their racial makeup. The DOJ claimed, falsely, that it is illegal for a state to draw any map that includes a district where white people are in the minority, and two other racial groups combine to make up the majority. And it threatened to sue Texas unless the state eliminated districts that fit this description.

As the lower court that struck down the maps explained in its opinion, there is considerable evidence that Texas decided to draw its new gerrymandered maps in order to comply with this letter.

The Supreme Court's order in LULAC doesn't explicitly contest this conclusion. But it faults the lower court for not applying a very strong presumption against plaintiffs challenging a racial gerrymander. “The District Court failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature,” according to the LULAC majority.

Two things can be said about this conclusion. The first is that the Court's Republican majority has said, in Abbott v. Perez (2018) and some later decisions, that state legislatures enjoy a presumption of racial innocence when they draw legislative districts. The second is that, in LULAC, there was in fact considerable evidence supporting both the plaintiffs' claim that Texas drew its lines for racial reasons, and Texas's claim that it drew them for partisan reasons.

But LULAC seems to conclude that, when there is evidence on either side, courts must construe that evidence in favor of the state and uphold the challenged map. It may still be possible for civil rights plaintiffs to challenge racial gerrymanders when the evidence of racial bias is simply overwhelming, but cases like that are exceedingly rare.

LULAC's strong presumption against anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs, moreover, will likely make it nearly impossible to challenge maps that target Black voters. Because nearly any map that seeks to diminish Black representation will closely resemble a map drawn for partisan purposes, there will almost always be some evidence that an anti-Black racial gerrymander was drawn solely to achieve partisan ends.

The LULAC majority also faults the plaintiffs in this case for not producing “a viable alternative map that met the State's avowedly partisan goals.” This line imposes a rigid rule that anyone challenging an alleged racial gerrymander must produce a map that is just as partisan as the one drawn by the state, but that does not divide voters based on race.

The Court did previously say, in Alexander, that a plaintiff's failure to submit such a map “may be dispositive in many, if not most, cases where the plaintiff lacks direct evidence or some extraordinarily powerful circumstantial evidence” that a state drew its lines for racial reasons. But the lower court in LULAC found considerable direct evidence that Texas drew its lines to comply with the DOJ's demand for a racial gerrymander. LULAC, by contrast, says that any plaintiff's failure to produce an alternative map is a “near-dispositive” reason for them to lose their case.

The upshot of this new, “near-dispositive” requirement is that racial gerrymanders will only be vulnerable when it is possible to draw an equally partisan map with fewer racial implications. If the only way for Texas to maximize Republican voting power is to crack up Black and Latino communities, LULAC establishes that Texas may nearly always do so.

Additionally, there's also a troubling line in the Court's LULAC order faulting the lower court for “alter[ing] the election rules on the eve of an election.” It is unclear whether the justices considered the timing of the lower court's order when it weighed the merits of the LULAC case, but the line is still troubling because it is obviously factually false. The lower court did not hand down its decision on the “eve of an election.” It declared the Texas gerrymander unconstitutional on November 18, 2025 — almost a full year before the 2026 midterm elections.

In any event, it is fair to describe the LULAC decision as merely an incremental step towards full lawsuit immunity for states that draw gerrymandered maps. The Court, in cases like Rucho, Perez, and Alexander, already made it very difficult to challenge a gerrymander of any kind. LULAC merely adds new burdens to already beleaguered plaintiffs.

But the cumulative effect of these burdens is likely to prove overwhelming for nearly all litigants who oppose racial or partisan gerrymanders. The Court's Republican majority appears to be washing its hands of responsibility for gerrymandering altogether. And it is loudly signaling to states that they can do whatever they want.

One of Rep. Cory Mills‘s (R-FL) closest friends in Congress is distancing himself from the congressman amid several allegations.

Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), a candidate for Florida governor, called the accusations against Mills “very troubling” and questioned whether he could clear his name.

“The allegations against Cory, to me, are very troubling. I'm concerned about him. I hope he gets his stuff worked out and cleaned up, but it has to go through ethics. And he has to, you know, basically, do that hard work to clear his name, if it can be cleared,” he told NOTUS on Thursday.

The House tried to censure Mills last month. However, the chamber voted to refer the Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC)-introduced censure resolution to the House Ethics Committee. Donalds voted to refer the matter to the Ethics Committee while Reps. Kat Cammack (R-FL) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) voted against referring, joining Democrats.

The allegations against Mills include stolen valor, assault against a woman who wasn't his wife, using “revenge porn” to retaliate against beauty queen Lindsey Langston, and holding improper federal contracts.

Donalds dismissed a reporter's question on Thursday about whether he ever considered Mills as a candidate to be his understudy in the Florida governor's race.

“That was an offhand comment from almost two years ago. It's not serious,” he told LindellTV.

Mills believes the allegations against him will be disproved.

“I believe all the accusations and false things that are being said will be proven to be absolutely false in many ways, and I have the evidence and receipts and look forward to working with them,” he said on the House floor.

The Ethics Committee will pore over Mills's conduct and make a decision on whether to recommend consequences against him, which could include expulsion from the House. Former Republican New York Rep. George Santos was expelled from the House in 2023 after the Ethics Committee released a report concluding he “cannot be trusted.”

Mills could dodge the consequences of an Ethics Committee report if he chooses not to run for reelection next year. Luna has openly said Mills should not seek another term in Congress.

“House leadership exchanged the vote to protect a Republican that's having a lot of issues and should NOT seek re-election,” she posted on X, referencing censure attempts that have fallen flat because of alleged attempts to protect Mills from the same fate.

Donalds has the support of President Donald Trump in Florida's 2026 governor race and is looking like the favorite to win. He's running against right-wing investor James Fishback and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, among others.

Any association with Mills will likely damage Donalds's hopes.

            The White House quietly released President Donald Trump's new national security strategy late Thursday, a 33-page document that elevates his “America First” doctrine and sets out the administration's realignment of US foreign policy, from shifting military resources in the Western Hemisphere to taking an unprecedentedly confrontational posture toward Europe.
    


            The strategy centers on Trump's call for a “readjustment” of the US military presence in the Western Hemisphere to counter migration, drug trafficking and what it describes as the rise of adversarial powers in the region.
    


            It outlines plans for a larger Coast Guard and Navy presence in the region and deployments to “secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force.” The document frames this as part of a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, an 1823 presidential call for European powers to respect the US' sphere of influence in the west.
    


            “The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere as a condition of our security and prosperity—a condition that allows us to assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region,” the document says.
    


            It comes as the administration has pursued a deadly campaign against alleged drug boats in international waters, so far, destroying at least 23 boats and killing 87 people. Outside legal experts and some members of Congress have questioned the legality of the effort.
    


            The strategy's section on Europe represents a more dramatic escalation, warning that European nations face “economic decline” that could be “eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.”
    


            The document goes on to argue that “over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European,” raising what it calls “an open question” about whether those countries would continue to view their alliance with the United States in the same way.
    


            The administration's strategy also asserts that the “Ukraine War has had the perverse effect of increasing Europe's, especially Germany's, external dependencies” and claims “a large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.”
    


            The strategy blames European officials for blocking US-backed efforts to end the conflict and states that an end to “hostilities” is needed to stabilize European economies, prevent war, and reestablish stability with Russia: “It is a core interest of the United States to negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, in order to stabilize European economies, prevent unintended escalation or expansion of the war, and reestablish strategic stability with Russia, as well as to enable the post-hostilities reconstruction of Ukraine to enable its survival as a viable state.”
    


            A salient point in the Europe section of the strategy goes further, explicitly endorsing efforts to influence the domestic politics of US allies, saying the American broad policy toward Europe should prioritize “cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations.”
    


            “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less. … We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” it says.
    


            The chief spokesperson for the European Commission, Paula Pinho, said at a press briefing Friday that European leaders had not yet had “the time to look into (the document)” and were not in a “position to comment.”
    


            The document also reiterates the administration's push for “ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance.”
    


            ​The document formalizes some of the administration's previous criticism of Europe. In a speech in Munich, Germany, in February, Vice President JD Vance told European leaders that the biggest threat to their security was “from within,” rather than from China or Russia.
    


            “What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values,” Vance told a stone-faced audience at the Munich Security Conference.
    


War and Peace by Donald Trump



            The Trump administration's strategy also outlines a dual-track approach to China, pushing to contain Beijing's global influence while preserving economic ties and maintaining the current conditions on Taiwan, saying that “deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority.”
    


            It also calls for “maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship” with China by prioritizing “reciprocity and fairness” and reducing US dependence on the country. According to the document, such a reset is key to sustaining US growth from “a $30 trillion economy in 2025 to $40 trillion in the 2030s.”
    


            The strategy describes alliances as instrumental rather than intrinsic, labeling them “a broad network of alliances, with treaty allies and partners in the world's most strategically important regions,” deployed as tools within a broader framework grounded in Trump's affinity to break with traditional norms.
    


            “President Trump uses unconventional diplomacy, America's military might, and economic leverage to surgically extinguish embers of division between nuclear-capable nations and violent wars caused by centuries-long hatred,” it says.

Fox News' Eric Shawn provides details on the third reported radio outage and the continuing flight delays and cancelations at Newark Airport.

A record 3.1 million travelers were screened by the TSA on the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend.

Now, as Americans prepare to travel across the nation for the Christmas and holiday season, a new study is pinpointing the airport that ranks as "most stressful" of all. 

The study, conducted by Australian travel insurance company iSelect, analyzed 50 major airports around the globe by looking at average departure delays, canceled flights, security checks, baggage claim issues and more.

AMERICA'S TOP AIRPORT SNACKS REVEALED — AND A FAVORITE DOMINATES NATIONWIDE

Coming in first place: Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, which scored an 18.46 out of a possible 100 — making it the "most stressful," according to the study. 

The airport is "a hot spot for travel stress, ranking with the worst check-in score [on] our list," the study says.

The study also noted that Newark Liberty had "the second-worst score for ease of getting to the airport [on] our list."

It was also reported to have an average departure delay time of 21.40 minutes. It scored as the third worst in baggage retrieval.

"The new system will meet an increasing number of travelers and deliver the airport experience they deserve."

In October, construction on a new AirTrain Newark system began — a new $3.5 billion system, the airport says on its website, to replace the existing AirTrain, "which opened in 1996 and has become outdated, over capacity and unable to accommodate Newark Liberty's rapid growth."

The airport is in the midst of ongoing redevelopment, the site says in detail.   

"Newark Airport is the front door to our region — and modernizing the AirTrain system is part of our commitment to reimagining a world-class airport that is worthy of our state," said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in a release.

Its baggage claim was ranked the lowest in the index at 69%. Security check wait times came in at 69%.

Coming in fourth and fifth, respectively, on the "most stressful" list: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City and Chicago O'Hare International.

Newark Airport was also called out in J.D. Power's annual airport satisfaction survey, which ranked "mega" U.S. airports.

The survey looked at ease of travel, airport trust, terminal facilities, airport staff, food and retail options, plus the experience of arriving and departing at airports.

Newark came in last place, reflecting a year of ground delays and flight cancellations.

The saga is emblematic of Trump's most dangerous and self-serving tendencies.

Sign up for Inside the Trump Presidency, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump term.

Like many other components of our constitutional system meant to restrain an overreaching executive, the Senate power of “advice and consent” on the president's nominees is in a state of disrepair. Early in his administration, Donald Trump strong-armed senators to confirm Cabinet appointees; later, unable to get around the objections of a few Democratic senators, he deployed a complicated legal shell game to install a handful of prosecutors to top positions in blue states across the country. Five courts have now rejected this scheme—creating a significant mess for the Justice Department and calling into question the longevity of Trump's strategy to evade congressional checks and hand prosecutorial power to his loyalists.

The two most recent rejections came in quick succession over the past two weeks. On Monday, a panel of appeals-court judges upheld a lower court's ruling that Alina Habba—formerly Trump's personal lawyer—had no authority to lead the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office. The Monday before that, a district judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that Lindsey Halligan—also formerly Trump's personal lawyer—had likewise been unlawfully slotted into the job of chief prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office there.

The specifics of these legal disputes are dry and hypertechnical. But the chaos crystallizes Trump's disregard for rules, distaste for professionalism, and obsessive need to turn the regular work of government into an engine of personal advantage. The U.S. attorneys who head these offices, scattered across 94 federal districts, take the lead in enforcing federal law around the country. For that reason, these illegal appointees are central to Trump's effort to use the Justice Department as a political tool: Without any Senate oversight, the president granted them the authority to harass his enemies. In this way, Trump has contorted an appointments process meant to restrain his power into a means of maximizing it.

Between Habba and Halligan, the latter's disqualification from the job makes for a splashier news story. Appointed to the role as part of Trump's push for vengeance against his political enemies, Halligan briskly secured indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—both of which the court has since tossed out, on the reasoning that Halligan had no authority to bring those charges in the first place. The Justice Department will now have to decide whether and how to navigate the thicket of legal quandaries required to press forward with the president's revenge quest. (Yesterday, a different prosecutor on Halligan's team reportedly failed to convince a grand jury to re-indict James.)

Read: Trump's revenge tour

By contrast, the Habba ruling—which came from a district judge in August—has yet to result in any prosecutions actually being thrown out. Even so, the legal uncertainty around her role led to paralysis and confusion in the New Jersey federal courts. Two other courts have disqualified lead prosecutors in Nevada and Los Angeles, and two more are weighing similar challenges in New Mexico and Albany, New York. Other districts might face similar challenges; Democratic Senator Chris Coons has suggested that the U.S. attorney in his state of Delaware is “probably” serving illegally.

The legal rules that Trump is abusing are so complicated that multiple judges have resorted to bullet points and spreadsheets to explain how the president violated them. It's perhaps easier to understand how things should work, and, by extension, how Trump's evasions are setting that balance askew.

As he does with other Senate-confirmed officials, the president nominates candidates to lead U.S. Attorney's Offices, whom the Senate can then confirm or reject. Alexander Hamilton reasoned in The Federalist Papers that this process “would tend greatly to preventing the appointment of unfit characters” within the executive branch. The president will be less likely to put forward candidates qualified only by his own “favoritism,” Hamilton argued, given the prospect of embarrassment before an unimpressed Senate. Likewise, senators can use the confirmation process as a means of extracting information from the nominee and securing commitments—ensuring that officials are accountable not just to the president but also to another branch of government as well.

That's the Schoolhouse Rock version of events. Practically speaking, this does not always happen with the speed that presidents, senators, and nominees would like. The top job can be left vacant—sometimes for lengthy stretches—either because a president can't decide who should fill the role or because the Senate hasn't had a chance to approve a nominee yet. For this reason, Congress has established alternative means of temporarily filling these positions, which allow another prosecutor to step into the role as either an “acting” or an “interim” U.S. attorney. (The fact that these similar but not identical titles describe similar but not identical routes to filling the office only adds to the difficulty of parsing the relevant laws.) It's not unusual, for example, that a career Justice Department official will step up when the Senate-confirmed prosecutor leaves at the end of a presidential term, minding the shop until the new president can get around to nominating somebody. Anne Joseph O'Connell, a Stanford law professor and an expert in these temporary appointments, describes this legal structure as attempting a “balance between accountability and workability.”

Trump chafed against the confirmation process during his first four years in office, relying heavily on acting officials across government: “I like acting,” he said in 2019. “It gives me more flexibility.” This time around, Republicans in the chamber have proved willing to rubber-stamp nominees obviously lacking in qualifications. Witness the antics of Trump's Senate-confirmed Cabinet members such as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel. But much to Trump's fury, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, continues to recognize so-called blue slips for U.S. attorney nominees. Under this system, senators from the state where a nominee's new office will be located gain veto power over potential appointments.

Trump has therefore been limited in his ability to appoint MAGA prosecutors in the Democratic states through the normal confirmation process. That's a significant problem for his revenge campaign, given that the targets of his ire largely live and work in those blue states and are most easily prosecuted in them. To work around this, he and Attorney General Pam Bondi have exploited the silences and ambiguities of the system for installing temporary appointees, cobbling together questionable legal mechanisms for extending those appointments well past their expiration date.

For months, this strategy of extending temporary appointments produced results that Trump could be happy with. In New Jersey, Habba oversaw charges against Newark's Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka and Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver following a scuffle at an immigration detention center. (The charges against Baraka were rapidly dismissed; McIver is seeking to have her case thrown out.) In New York, the temporary U.S. Attorney John Sarcone subpoenaed Letitia James's office over her past investigations into Trump and the National Rifle Association. The other prosecutors who would soon be questioned in court have, variously, urged the FBI to investigate supposed anti-Trump conspiracies, clashed with judges, and aggressively prosecuted anti-ICE protesters.

Then the judiciary stepped in. Habba was the first prosecutor to face judicial skepticism. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled her appointment illegal in late August, holding that she had been serving unlawfully since July 1. Over the next two months, judges in Nevada and the Central District of California likewise ruled against the administration, disqualifying the U.S. attorneys serving in those districts. Other challenges to the U.S. attorneys in New Mexico and the Northern District of New York were also percolating. In Albany, James challenged the subpoenas sent by Sarcone on the grounds that his original temporary appointment expired in mid-July.

Perhaps, in the midst of this chaos, the administration should have been more careful when it used a similar mechanism to appoint Halligan as the head prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia. But doing so was necessary to satisfy Trump's desire for retribution. After Halligan's predecessor, Erik Siebert, reportedly refused to move forward with spurious prosecutions of Comey and James, Trump pushed him out and installed Halligan, who promptly brought the charges that Siebert had refused. (Siebert had garnered the approval of Virginia's two Democratic senators, a fact the president pointed to when calling for his dismissal.) According to Judge Cameron McGowen Currie, who last week found Halligan's appointment illegal, Halligan is distinguished by having served illegally from the very beginning of her time in the Eastern District of Virginia, thanks to the Justice Department's decision to put her into her role as a backfill for Siebert. (This is distinct from the other prosecutors, who were reappointed to extend their own tenure.)

Although four district judges have now deemed the administration's machinations illegal, the Third Circuit is the first appeals court to consider the array of legal questions raised by Trump's approach. The fact that a higher court so resoundingly—and unanimously—rejected the government's arguments is a serious blow to the president. The opinion is technical and reserved, but definitive: “Habba is not the Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.” The state's two Democratic senators, who had initially objected to Habba's appointment, took a victory lap, announcing, “U.S. Attorneys must be independent and installed consistent with the rule of law, not because of their political loyalty or through political maneuvering.”

After Habba's original disqualification, in August, the Justice Department responded pugnaciously. Bondi decried “activist judicial attacks,” and Habba insisted on Fox that she was the “pick of the president.” But the administration has been a great deal quieter following the appeals court's ruling. It will now have to decide whether to simply let Habba go, or fight it out by asking the Third Circuit to reconsider or appealing directly to the Supreme Court—or, perhaps, choosing to wait and see how other courts handle these questions. In February, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will consider whether Nevada's U.S. attorney is serving legally. Yesterday, a district court in the Northern District of New York heard arguments in Letitia James's challenge to John Sarcone's appointment.

Trump rarely likes to abandon a fight. But the benefit of his appointments strategy, weighed against the headaches it has created for the government, may have finally tipped over in the wrong direction. The Justice Department did not return a request for comment on whether it plans to battle the Third Circuit's ruling on Habba. As for Halligan, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially said that the administration would fight to keep the former insurance lawyer in her current post. Halligan was “legally appointed,” Leavitt insisted, and “extremely qualified.” A week and a half later, however, the Justice Department has yet to file an appeal.

James Beard Award-winning chef Andrew Zimmern tells Fox News Digital that customers need to hold restaurants more accountable when it comes to what's on the menu.

The early-bird special is no longer just for retirees.

Americans of all ages are shifting their dinner plans earlier, as the 5 to 5:30 p.m. time slot becomes one of the hottest reservations of the evening, according to industry experts and insiders.

"What used to be a time slot primarily favored by older guests or pre-theater diners has now become one of the most in-demand hours for a much younger demographic," Michelle Durpetti, managing partner at Chicago steakhouse Gene & Georgetti, told Fox News Digital.

COMMUNAL DINING MAKES GEN Z COMEBACK, BUT OLDER GUESTS PUSH BACK ON 'CHAOTIC' TREND

The shift is happening across the country, according to restaurant-recommendation website The Infatuation, whose team dines year-round at restaurants across the U.S.

OpenTable data from earlier this year found that 53% of Gen Z and 51% of millennials are especially interested in earlier dinner seatings, the Guardian reported. A 2026 report from Chase Travel, meanwhile, declared that "5:30 p.m. is the new 8 p.m."

In New York City specifically, 5 p.m. bookings rose 20%, according to OpenTable.

There, young professionals are booking earlier dinner reservations, primarily between 5 and 6 p.m., according to Dennis Turcinovic, managing partner and owner of Delmonico's Hospitality Group, which operates Delmonico's and Tucci.

From wellness routines to remote work, early dining fits many modern lifestyles. (iStock)

"This shift seems to be influenced by several factors," Turcinovic told Fox News Digital. "More professionals are finding it convenient to meet for dinner before heading home after work, and with many embracing remote work and flexible schedules, earlier dining fits well into their schedules."

Adega Gaucha Brazilian Steakhouse, with locations in Orlando, Kissimmee and Deerfield Beach, Florida, most often finds millennial friend groups looking for earlier reservations to fit wellness routines — or because it's the only time they can get a table, according to co-founder Fabiano Borsato.

"Gen X has shifted earlier as well, but the reasons are different, usually tied to family schedules or wanting a smoother, less rushed dinner," he told Fox News Digital. "They tend to order more wine and premium cuts, so their check averages look a bit higher."

While Turcinovic and Durpetti find that early diners still spend generously, OpenTable's 2026 Dining Trends Report shows happy hour dining between 4 and 5 p.m., when customers can get better value, is up 13% from last year, according to a news release.

Over 60% of Americans say dining out now feels more like a "special occasion," according to the company, which may also be pushing some people toward earlier, less-pricey seatings when early-bird specials are in effect and drink spending tends to be lower.

While earlier reservations are gaining popularity, Turcinovic said they're still more likely to have availability than peak times later in the evening.

And restaurants hope the trend will stick.

"Early dining has helped maximize the number of people through the door," Turcinovic said. "Since Tucci is only open for five or six hours a day, every guest and reservation time slot is important."

Durpetti said the trend has created an extended "prime window" at Gene & Georgetti, giving the restaurant two peak rush periods throughout the night. 

"This requires adjustments in staffing patterns and prep timing, but it also allows us to maximize the dining room in a more balanced way," she said.

She said guests are "embracing it as a lifestyle choice."

"And, if I'm being honest, I am too," she added. "I love eating early."

FBI Director Kash Patel explains how the search for the suspect in connection to explosive devices planted on January 6, 2021, in D.C. unfolded on ‘Fox News @ Night.'

FBI Director Kash Patel on Thursday blasted the Biden administration for its handling of the investigation into who planted pipe bombs at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021.

Patel told "Fox News @ Night Now" host Trace Gallagher that the prior administration "sat on" evidence for four years and failed to make a breakthrough in the case, whereas the FBI under his leadership incorporated cell phone geolocation data to hunt for the suspect.

"We went back and looked at the cellphone tower data dumps. We went back and looked at the providers and what information they provided pursuant to search warrants at the time and asked questions such as why weren't all the phone numbers scrubbed, why aren't they connected and why wasn't there any geolocational data done?" Patel said. "That is either sheer incompetence or complete intentional negligence — and neither of which is acceptable for this FBI."

Santiago/Getty Images; Department of Justice)

Patel was speaking just hours after the FBI arrested Brian Cole Jr., of Woodbridge, Va., for allegedly planting the two pipe bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committees' headquarters around the same time that thousands of protesters a few blocks away began to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, over the 2020 election results.

Patel argued the bureau under Biden failed at basic law enforcement functions.

"This guy… planted bombs at the United States Capitol on camera," Patel said. "And the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the prior four years couldn't find him. Completely unacceptable."

Patel said investigators went back to "good cop basics" and combed through hundreds of tips and interviews to finally identify the suspect.

He said a key item in the investigation was the suspects' Nike sneakers, of which only a limited amount were ever made in the U.S.

"We, the FBI, have the best cellphone capability tracking systems, and we use that to say who was around the area that matches the description, the height, the weight, the size, and who was wearing this sort of sneakers," Patel said. "But on top of that, I can generally say that, you know, some of our biggest breakthroughs always come from cell phone analysis."

Patel said that it was important for investigators to build evidence that will be usable in a court of law.

"We can arrest anyone we want. But we worked with our partners at the Department of Justice, the attorney general and the U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, to leverage countless subpoenas and legal processes before we ever decided to hit the House, like we did this morning," Patel said. "And they hit the suspect's place of business."

Cole is charged with use of an explosive device, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday. The FBI arrested Cole in northern Virginia. He will make his first court appearance on Friday in Washington, D.C.

Bondi echoed Patel's criticism of the prior administration and noted that the bombs Cole intended to use were real.

"This case languished. It sat there for four years collecting dust. No one did anything to solve this," Bondi told "Fox & Friends" Friday. "Both bombs were real… and thankfully they didn't detonate."

She praised Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino for reviving the case and keeping the new investigation under wraps until they were ready to make an arrest. She also stated that she expects more charges to be filed and did not reveal a motive.

"The entire investigation did not leak. It was kept quiet," she said. "They are pouring through evidence… hundreds of agents are on this case."

"They are poring through evidence. You saw hundreds of agents are on this case because this is a very dangerous person."

            As Chad Curry busily ferries his teenage children through the streets of their Chicago neighborhood of West Ridge, he eyes passing vehicles with a skepticism he didn't have just a few months ago.
    


            He knows to carefully clock whether a passing car has darkly tinted windows, out-of-state license plates, or even no plates at all. Some models – Chevy Tahoes, Dodge Chargers, Ford Explorers – give him extra pause. The 52-year-old software consultant also knows what to do if the doors fly open and masked, khaki-clad agents leap out and beeline for one of his neighbors.
    


            After all, he has trained for that very scenario.
    


            Curry is among thousands of parents, teachers, clergy and community organizers who have sought training on what they can legally do when they see an immigration raid unfold. They've learned how to document federal immigration agents' actions and quickly warn migrant neighbors – part of an emerging national blueprint for how concerned residents respond when President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown operations arrive at their doorstep.
    


            Though Trump said the crackdown would target the “worst of the worst,” court documents and federal data show many of those detained have not been convicted of serious crimes – or any crime at all. And while some locals have welcomed the enforcement and applauded the arrests, others have balked at the sudden, and at times aggressive, detentions of immigrants who they see as integral parts of their school, faith and neighborhood communities.
    


            Similar scenarios have played out in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina: ﻿Fearing an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Patrol, or one of several other federal agencies involved in the crackdowns, many migrants retreated into isolation. Local businesses felt the blow as workers stayed home, and classroom seats sat empty as immigrant parents dared not drive their kids to school.
    


            Furious protesters have clashed with federal agents outside ICE facilities and at the scene of arrests, and the Department of Homeland Security has accused some demonstrators of damaging federal property, assaulting agents and impeding law enforcement.
    


            But local resistance efforts have also given rise to an informal national network of people who are looking to each other for lessons on how to push back without confrontation and support their neighbors in the process.
    


            “I want to live in an area of solidarity,” Curry said. “How can we alert our neighbors? How can (we) keep them safe? How do we do it in non-violence?”
    


            As New Orleans and Minnesota's Twin Cities become the next battlegrounds in the fight over immigration, some residents there are already bracing themselves with the help of allies.
    


            “We're not just waiting around to see what happens,” said Mich González, a member of the Southeast Dignity Not Detention coalition. “We're talking to our brothers and sisters that organized in Los Angeles, that organized in Chicago, that are organizing and continuing to protect each other in North Carolina, and we're taking all their lessons.”
    


            But, like every other city that came before them, he said, “We're making it our own.”
    


            Honking car horns and shrill whistles have become the de facto soundtrack of local resistance as some residents have learned to create a cacophony of noise to warn anyone in earshot that immigration agents are present.
    


            Buckets of free whistles have appeared on local diner counters and outside popular shopping centers. They have become a fixture around the necks of some suburban Chicago moms and Charlotte school volunteers.



            It is one of several strategies some city residents are learning in trainings being dubbed “community defense,” “ICE Watch” or “Migra Watch.” In cities targeted by the immigration crackdown, local and national organizers have taught thousands of people how to proactively patrol areas around busy streets, churches, schools and daycares looking for agents.
    


            While Trump's immigration policy continues to draw large support from his GOP base, a November poll from CBS News noted that 54% of people felt immigration agents were stopping and detaining more people than necessary.
    


            On a Friday afternoon in November, more than 400 people logged into a virtual ICE Watch training held by Protect Rogers Park, a Chicago neighborhood group, and States at the Core, a national group that supports community organizers.
    


            Attendees flooded the online chat, saying they were from Alabama, California, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon and more than a dozen other states. A woman from central Texas said she feels like her community is “drowning.” Another person said they were desperate to help but were unsure what to do.
    


            Over the next two hours, trainers laid out a roadmap for how to identify immigration agents, film their actions with cellphones and spread the word that arrests are underway.
    


            During the November training, Jill Garvey, co-director of States at the Core, explained patrols have three goals when they are witnessing an arrest: “document, support, de-escalate.”
    


            “We should be documenting every single thing they're doing,” Garvey told the virtual attendees. “We want to get a better understanding of their tactics. We also want to document their activity that runs afoul of the law.”
    


            The goal of the patrols is not to interfere with an ongoing arrest, Garvey told CNN, but to create accountability for agents.
    


            “We think that ICE agents don't act with as much brutality or impunity if they know they're being recorded, and they know they're being watched,” Garvey told CNN.
    


            Garvey and other trainers offered frank advice during the training: People have the right to “observe and document,” but patrollers should not interfere with agents.
    


            At times, federal immigration arrests in several cities have become tense as protesting crowds swarmed around agents, screamed obscenities and came within feet of law enforcement as they wrestled a person to the ground. But Garvey and other trainers emphasized that ICE Watch is nonviolent. Volunteers should avoid name calling, remind agents of their right to film, and stay several feet away from arresting agents.
    


            The trainings have evolved after federal agents in Chicago were accused of liberally deploying tear gas and pepper balls on protesters and other bystanders, Garvey said. The program was adapted to emphasize volunteers' safety, advising them to wear more protective gear and consider bringing goggles or water to flush chemical irritants out of their eyes.
    


            Garvey has seen an extreme uptick in demand for training as the Department of Homeland Security launched large-scale operations in Chicago and Charlotte, and smaller ones in cities across the US. SATC has given 7,000 virtual trainings this year, more than 80% of which have happened over the last two months, she said.
    


            Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of North Carolina immigrant rights group Siembra NC, said hundreds of volunteers in the state have attended the group's trainings in person.
    


            “Every night (last week) it seemed like there was a packed church of people somewhere in North Carolina getting trained on how to be a part of a safety patrol,” she said.
    


            Siembra encourages its volunteers to monitor popular routes to workplaces and schools. Marín Baena hopes the patrols can ease some of the pervasive anxiety that has gripped immigrant communities in North Carolina since the DHS's operation began there in mid-November.
    


            “Otherwise, there's just this kind of a looming feeling that they might be around at all times,” she said.
    


            While programs like ICE Watch have taken hold in several cities, everyday community members – teachers, parents, clergy – have also adapted lessons from other cities as they look for ways to support migrant neighbors.
    


            On the first school day after immigration agents flooded into Charlotte last month, a resident named Samantha received a text from her husband, a local teacher, with a sobering report: Only five of his students had shown up for class.
    


            On that day, more than 30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.
    


            Hearing that Charlotte would be the next stop on the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, many in the city's deeply rooted migrant community had retreated into their homes, fearful of venturing outside even to go to work, buy groceries or drive their children to school.
    


            Samantha knew that many of the absent children depended on the meals, and like parents in Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis, she began to concoct a plan to get food onto the tables of sheltering migrant families – and get kids back to class. She has asked to use only her first name over harassment concerns.
    


            By the end of the week, she and other neighbors in Charlotte had mobilized. Makeshift food pantries overflowed with stacks of canned milk, cereal and instant oatmeal ready to be delivered. Volunteers armed with plastic whistles patrolled busy bus routes and posted up outside of schools, ready to sound the alarm if ICE or CBP agents approached.
    


            By the following Monday, a group of other parents had organized rides to school for more than 70 children, she told CNN.
    


            “The fact that this is even needed is so frustrating because this is our community, these are our neighbors, these are my kids' friends,” said Samantha.
    


            When she saw school families were being deeply impacted, North Carolina Association of Educators president Tamika Walker Kelly looked to her colleagues in Chicago for advice. The Chicago Teachers Union advised the North Carolina educators on what trainings they had found most useful, and they shared how Chicago parents formed school patrols to make students and families feel safer.
    


            “Having to be on that constant state of alert is one of the things that our educators, both in Charlotte and in Raleigh, are concerned about,” Walker Kelly said.
    


            If educators in New Orleans call looking for advice, Walker Kelly said she is ready to pick up the phone.
    


            Curry, the father in Chicago, said he has seen parents mobilize who may not typically engage in activism. He thinks they are motivated in part by the thought that migrant families face every parent's worst nightmare: being unwillingly separated from their child.
    


            “I went to the training and this woman said, ‘What if I am abducted? What happens to my daughter?'” Curry said. “This is the stuff that just breaks your heart.”
    


            Faith leaders have become some of the most prominent faces of local resistance as they hold prayer at protests, offer up their churches as meeting places, and make (unsuccessful) attempts to deliver communion to detainees.
    


            Though ICE has had a longstanding policy against making arrests in “sensitive locations” such as churches and schools, the Trump administration ended the directive this year.
    


            When Rev. Sara Green, a Unitarian Universalist pastor in New Orleans, heard her city would be the next immigration enforcement target, she knew exactly who to call for guidance.
    


            An old college friend, Rev. David Black, serves as a Presbyterian pastor in Chicago and has experienced a rattling face-to-face with ICE. Black, who is at the center of a class action lawsuit against the Trump administration, was repeatedly shot with pepper balls outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, in October, drawing sharp public criticism over agents' treatment of clergy at national protests.
    


            Black discussed with Green that “as clergy, it's important to be there for the long haul,” Green said. For her, that will likely mean supporting community organizers, holding prayer vigils, and spending long and emotional nights by the sides of families whose loved ones are detained.
    


            “What we can do is be with people in their grief and not just be with them as an unaffected companion, but to grieve with them,” Green said.
    


            Chicago religious leaders from several faiths have formed a coalition called “Faith over Fear” to respond to ICE raids and support congregations through interfaith prayer services and “know your rights” trainings. Coalition member Rami Nashashibi said the group's members have taken inspiration from religious groups in Los Angeles, who rallied around the message “Families are Sacred.”
    


            “Among the things that the Los Angeles faith community did very well, immediately, was demonstrate the power of what it meant to have clergy, what it meant to have faith communities on the front lines with strong, spiritually rooted messaging,” said Nashashibi, who is the executive director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network.
    


            Nashashibi pointed out that “faith and spirituality has undergirded movements for decades,” including the American Civil Rights Movement. But he said, “This moment feels unique.”
    


            Though the playbook may feel familiar, each city adds its unique spin.
    


            In Los Angeles, large-scale protests clogged downtown city blocks for days. Chicago, a historic union city, has leaned on several existing coalitions, including strong ties between Black churches and other faith groups.
    


            As the Trump administration rolls out an operation in the Twin Cities, the mayor of Minneapolis has banned local state and federal law enforcement from using any city-owned parking lots, ramps or garages for immigration enforcement, citing how agents previously used those spaces as staging grounds in Chicago. Though an operation has only just begun in New Orleans, organizers there say music and faith have always played a role in the city's protests.
    


            But while state leaders in Illinois and California have strongly denounced federal raids, the people of Louisiana who oppose immigration enforcement will not find an ally in their governor, Republican Jeff Landry.
    


            Landry is embracing the presence of federal agents, telling Fox News, “I'm welcoming them to come in. We're going to take these dangerous criminals off the streets in Louisiana.”
    


            Neighborhood patrols may also have to contend with a controversial state law making it a crime to “interfere, ignore, or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts.” The FBI and Louisiana State Police have jointly said they will move swiftly to arrest anyone who tries to “obstruct law enforcement actions.” Gonzalez, the local organizer, said the law has created confusion among New Orleanians who want to resist but fear arrest.
    


            Green, the local Unitarian pastor, believes New Orleans already has much of the community organizing experience it already needs, after decades of supporting neighbors through natural disasters, poverty and crumbling city infrastructure.
    


            New Orleans organizers may not need to race to establish community food banks like families in Charlotte did, noted Gonzalez. In a city where nearly 20% of the residents experience food insecurity, mutual aid like community fridges already exist in many neighborhoods.
    


            “Things in New Orleans haven't worked in a long time,” Green said. “I think that means that we have really great organizers who have been taking care of people in lieu of governments, in lieu of working infrastructure.”
    


            “We have people power because we've learned not to rely on people coming to save us, and I think that's going to serve us really well in this moment,” she said.

A highly restrictive area in Green Bank, West Virginia, has introduced Wi-Fi for the first time ever — with visitors continuing to check out the secretive community.

Dubbed the Quiet Zone, the area is home to the U.S. National Science Foundation Green Bank Observatory (NSF GBO).

The observatory houses the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. There is a 13,000 square mile radius around the GBO that limits cell towers and antenna heights — and requires coordination for transmissions, even microwave links.

AMERICANS MUST PAY HIGHER FEE FOR A TICKET TO THE WORLD'S MOST VISITED MUSEUM

The observatory, built in 1956, operates 24 hours a day.

In August, the GBO announced that Green Bank Elementary and Middle School, located next to the observatory's telescope, would be allowed to begin using Wi-Fi.

Residents and businesses may also use 2.4GHz Wi-Fi in the Quiet Zone.

"The radio frequencies that Wi-Fi use[s] to connect with phones, tablets and other devices are the same type of wavelengths emitted by objects in space," a press release notes.

"When Wi-Fi is on at the same time, these frequencies overlap — and hide — what the scientists are looking for," it adds.

Anthony Remijan, NSF GBO director, said in a press release the organization is trying to balance scientific operations with the modern-day reality of Wi-Fi.

"When these Quiet Zones were created in the late 1950s, by the Federal Communications Commission and the state of West Virginia, officials could not have predicted the technology using radio wavelengths that are almost an essential part of our daily lives," said Remijan.

National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) public information manager Jill Malusky told Fox News Digital that while the area hasn't seen an immediate rise in visitors, the public science center hosts about 50,000 visitors a year.

"Observatory leadership worked with the [school's] principal and vice principal on this [recent] change. Information was given to the school IT staff from our [National Radio Quiet Zone] staff for the school staff to implement," said Malusky.

            Heartbreaking pleas for help poured into the Kerrville, Texas, police department's Telecommunications Center as the deadly catastrophic floods swept across Texas Hill Country in the early hours of July 4.
    


            CNN is listening to the more than 20 hours of 911 calls that were released by the Kerrville Police Department on Friday.
    


            The recordings, uploaded in the order they were received, trace the flood emergency minute by minute, the rising terror of people trapped as water climbed first by the inch then by the foot through homes and cabins.
    


            What begins as a cautious warning quickly escalates into panic, as callers plead for rescue while dispatchers, repeating the same urgent directive to get to higher floors, struggle to keep their voices steady.
    


            “We cannot,” one frightened caller replies. “There's water everywhere. We cannot move. We are right upstairs in a room and the water levels rising.”
    


            Together, the recordings form a harrowing portrait of a night when the water rose faster than help could reach.
    


            Police have warned the calls are unredacted and “highly distressing,” especially for families who were impacted.
    


            “Some callers did not survive. We ask that you keep them and their family members, loved ones and friends in your thoughts and prayers,” Kerrville Police Chief Chris McCall said in a video statement Thursday.
    


            The first calls feel almost like premonitions, fragile voices that foreshadow the terror that would soon sweep across the Hill Country. They begin with an eerie calm — soft-spoken warnings from residents who sensed the rising water but could not yet see the catastrophe gathering in the dark.
    


            The devastating flash flooding on the early hours of the Fourth of July killed 136 people, including young children at summer camp, across the region as parts of the Guadalupe River rose from about 3 feet to almost 30 feet in just 45 minutes.
    


            Just two people were on staff at the Kerrville Police Department Telecommunications Center when 911 calls starting coming in at 2:52 a.m. on July 4, according to the chief. Callers quickly overwhelmed dispatchers as the tragedy escalated.
    


            With every new call, the dispatchers repeat the same warning over and over, urging terrified callers to climb to higher ground as deputies tried to make their way to them. The uncertain reassurance hangs in the recordings like a held breath, a testament to both the limits of the system and the unbearable human cost of that night.
    


            “We just needed somebody to know that we were here,” one caller told a dispatcher.
    


            The dispatchers answered a total of 435 calls over the next six hours, the police chief said, including more than 100 between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. The 911 calls are being released to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests, McCall said.
    


            Some of the calls were transferred to a nearby dispatch center to help relieve the call load, as is protocol in high call volume situations, McCall added.
    


            After dispatchers got “the basic critical information” and could no longer help over the phone, they faced “a difficult decision to disconnect and move on to the next call,” McCall said.
    


How the catastrophic Texas flooding unfolded, in maps and charts



            “I'm immensely proud of our telecommunications operators,” he said. “These public safety team members showed incredible perseverance as they faced high call volumes and did their best to provide assistance and comfort to every caller.”
    


            The City of Kerrville issued a statement acknowledging that the 911 calls' release “will bring up strong emotions,” but that it “presents another moment to affirm who we are: a united, resilient community determined to recover and rebuild.” 



            The chief also encouraged those who have struggled with the tragedy to get support, saying all members of the police department have participated in peer support meetings.
    


            The local emergency response to the July Fourth flooding was heavily scrutinized by the community, who alleged local officials were unprepared for the weather event that ripped the rolling countryside to shreds.
    


            Of the 136 flood victims, more than 100 died in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose to 30 feet after four months' worth of rain fell in just hours. The raging floodwaters devastated homes and popular recreation areas, including several summer camps.
    


Clinging to trees, screaming for help: Lawsuits paint heartbreaking picture of girls' last moments at Camp Mystic



            The flooding deaths include 25 girls and two counselors who were swept away from Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp situated along the banks of the Guadalupe River. The families of more than a dozen victims filed lawsuits against the camp and its owners last month.
    


            In September, Texas lawmakers enacted new camp safety laws aimed at addressing gaps in disaster preparedness by strengthening requirements and streamlining the emergency response. The owners of Camp Mystic said this week they plans to exceed those requirements when a portion of the camp reopens next summer, according to The Associated Press.
    


This is a developing story and will be updated.

            Taiwan's government has ordered a one-year block of a popular, Chinese-owned social media app following its failure to cooperate with authorities over fraud-related concerns.
    


            Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, has surged in popularity among young Taiwanese in recent years, amassing 3 million users in the self-ruled democracy of 23 million. But the Instagram-like platform has also stoked concerns among officials that it could be used in pro-Beijing propaganda or disinformation campaigns, which Taiwan says it has been battling for years.
    


            China's Communist Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to annex it by force if necessary.
    


            Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior on Thursday cited Xiaohongshu's refusal to cooperate with authorities as the basis for the ban, claiming that the platform has been linked to more than 1,700 fraud-related cases that resulted in financial losses of 247.7 million Taiwanese dollars ($7.9 million).
    


            “Due to the inability to obtain necessary data in accordance with the law, law enforcement authorities have encountered significant obstacles in investigations, creating a de facto legal vacuum,” the ministry said in a statement.
    


            CNN has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment. It is unclear when the ban will take effect. Users in Taiwan could still access the app on Friday afternoon.
    


            The ban comes amid growing alarm among governments worldwide over cybersecurity vulnerabilities and disinformation campaigns associated with Chinese apps like Xiaohongshu and TikTok that have gained global popularity.
    


            Chinese regulations require companies to store data domestically and allow the government access to that data. Beijing also actively surveils and censors content it deems unfavorable, a practice experts say can sway public opinion.
    


            US Congress passed a law last year that forced TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the platform to an American owner or face a ban, which caused the app to go dark for several hours earlier this year. President Donald Trump later sought to salvage the platform and negotiated a deal with China, though a final agreement has yet to be inked.
    


            India blocked TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps over similar concerns in 2020.
    


            Several Western countries, including the US, the United Kingdom, and European Union nations, have banned TikTok on government devices on national security grounds since 2023. The US state of Texas has also added Xiaohongshu to its ban, pertaining to government-issued devices.
    


            As early as 2019, Taiwan banned Xiaohongshu, TikTok, and its sister app in China Douyin from official devices.
    


            Earlier this week, Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs flagged five apps as posing “significant cybersecurity risks,” including Xiaohongshu, TikTok, X-like Weibo, and China's everything app WeChat. These apps could collect sensitive data and share with third parties without consent, it said. A cybersecurity assessment conducted by the National Security Bureau also found that Xiaohongshu failed all of its evaluations.
    


            However, the ban has already sparked some backlash from users and opposition parties, who described it as an infringement on freedom of speech.
    


            “We once mocked people in China for needing VPNs to access information,” Lai Shyh-bao, a legislator of the main opposition party Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, said on Facebook. “Internet freedom in Taiwan is heading toward a day when people will need VPNs.”
    


            Major international platforms such as Facebook, Google, LINE, and TikTok have all appointed legal representatives in Taiwan, complied with local regulations, and fulfilled their legal obligations, the Ministry of the Interior said.
    


            Taiwan authorities have requested that Shanghai-based Xiaohongshu submit concrete remedial plans, but the company has yet to respond, the ministry added.
    


            “This is not a problem unique to Taiwan. It exists around the world, and even within China itself this platform has repeatedly violated regulations…From our perspective, it is a malicious platform — one that is beyond legal oversight and operates with unclear intentions,” said Ma Shih-yuan, deputy minister of the interior, at a Thursday presser.

Colin Cowherd explains why he is all in on the Dallas Cowboys against the Detroit Lions on TNF.

The Detroit Lions defeated the Dallas Cowboys 44-30 on "Thursday Night Football," cementing themselves as the top challenger for the final seed in the NFC playoffs.

Dallas entered the game riding a three-game winning streak to climb back into the playoff hunt. But the loss drops the Cowboys to 6-6 and into the 10th seed, two and a half games behind the San Francisco 49ers for the final NFC playoff spot.

Detroit improved to 8-5, putting the Lions firmly back into the race just one game behind San Francisco.

Thursday's game was also the subject of criticism against referees on social media. 

Two calls in particular were widely scrutinized: when Prescott was seemingly tackled in his own end zone in the first quarter, but referees did not call a safety, and in the fourth quarter when offensive pass interference was called on Cowboys tight end Jake Ferguson during a crucial red-zone third down — even as many argued Lions defender Alex Anzalone committed the infraction.

Detroit's running backs led the way in the red zone, as Jahmyr Gibbs scored three touchdowns and David Montgomery added another. Lions quarterback Jared Goff threw for 309 yards. 

Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott threw for 376 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. His first interception ended Dallas' opening possession of the second half and set up a Lions touchdown to extend the lead to 27-9. His second interception ended the Cowboys' final drive as they attempted to rally late.

Prescott has now thrown eight interceptions this season. He was considered an MVP contender earlier in the year, but no player has ever won the award without reaching the postseason.

Dallas now has just an estimated 8% chance of making the playoffs.

If the Cowboys fall short, it will mark their 30th consecutive season without a Super Bowl title.

Harvard students claim the university has enabled antisemitic campus protests, allegedly resulting in lenient discipline and a sudden post-Trump era crackdown they say reflects growing national backlash against university radicalism.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Wednesday announced ICE had detained a Harvard Law School professor accused in a shooting outside a synagogue in October. 

Carlos Portugal Gouvêa, a Brazilian national, was arrested Oct. 2 after he allegedly fired a BB gun outside a Boston area synagogue the day before Yom Kippur. 

Gouvêa told authorities at the time he was "hunting rats." 

Gouvea was put on six months of pretrial probation for a misdemeanor charge of illegal use of the air rifle, while his other charges of disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct and vandalizing property were dismissed.

Harvard University suspended the professor pending an investigation. (Associated Press)

HARVARD UNIVERSITY'S FEUD WITH TRUMP AFFECTING STUDENTS, RESEARCH, AND REPUTATION: ADJUNCT PROFESSOR 

The Harvard Crimson first reported Gouvêa was suspended by the university pending the investigation, with synagogue leaders noting in an email the shooting was not "fueled by antisemitism."

Two weeks after the shooting, the Department of State revoked his temporary non-immigrant (J-1) visa.

ICE Boston Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested Gouvêa Wednesday, and he agreed to voluntarily leave the U.S. rather than be deported, according to DHS.

"It is a privilege to work and study in the United States, not a right," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement. "There is no room in the United States for brazen, violent acts of antisemitism like this. They are an affront to our core principals as a country and an unacceptable threat against law-abiding American citizens."

McLaughlin added DHS is "under zero obligation to admit foreigners who commit these inexplicably reprehensible acts or to let them stay here."

"Secretary [Kristi] Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and commit anti-American and antisemitic violence and terrorism should think again," she wrote. "You are not welcome here."

Gouvêa was a visiting professor of law at Harvard, and his full-time position was as an associate professor at the University of São Paulo Law School and CEO of IDGlobal in Brazil.

Senators who viewed a video of the deadly US military strike on a boat allegedly hauling drugs in the Caribbean in early September spoke with reporters afterward. They were briefed by the admiral who ordered the attack that killed survivors of a first strike

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

A Navy admiral told lawmakers Thursday that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but grave questions and concerns remain as Congress scrutinizes an attack that killed two survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters near Venezuela.

Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley “was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing.

While Cotton, R-Ark., defended the attack, Democrats who were also briefed and saw video of the survivors being killed questioned the Trump administration's rationale and said the boat strike was deeply concerning.

“The order was basically: Destroy the drugs, kill the 11 people on the boat,” said Washington Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. Smith, who is demanding further investigation, said the survivors were “basically two shirtless people clinging to the bow of a capsized and inoperable boat, drifting in the water.”

Lawmakers want a full accounting after The Washington Post reported that Bradley on Sept. 2 ordered an attack on the survivors to comply with a directive from Hegseth to “kill everybody.” Legal experts say the attack amounts to a crime if the survivors were targeted.

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz denounced Trump on Thursday for calling Minnesota's Somali community “garbage” and dismissing the state as a “hellhole.”

Walz said Trump slandered all Minnesotans and that his expressions of contempt for the state's Somali community — the largest in the U.S. — were “unprecedented for a United States president. We've got little children going to school today who their president called them garbage.”

Republican legislative leaders stopped short of accepting the governor's invitation to join him in condemnation and countered that the dispute wouldn't have erupted if Walz had acted more effectively to prevent fraud in social service programs.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is imploring his fellow Republicans to stop venting their frustrations in public and bring their complaints to him directly.

“They're going to get upset about things. That's part of the process,” Johnson told reporters Thursday. “It doesn't bother me. But when there is a conflict or concern, I always ask all members to come to me, don't go to social media.”

Increasingly, they're ignoring him.

Cracks inside the GOP conference were stark this week as a member of Johnson's own leadership team openly accused him of lying, rank-and-file Republicans acted unilaterally to force votes and a leadership-backed bill faltered. It's all underscored by growing worries that the party is on a path toward losing the majority next year.

Trump had said at the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony that he had spoken with Andrew Wolfe's family.

After he returned to the White House, he shared on his social media site a photo of Wolfe's family standing around him as he sat as his desk in the Oval Office.

Wolfe is one of two National Guard members who were shot near the White House the day before Thanksgiving. He is recovering in a hospital. Fellow Guard member Sarah Beckstrom died.

Trump said in the post that Wolfe “is in the process of healing.”

“His parents, brother, and all of his friends are praying,” Trump said. “I just met them in the Oval Office — They are fantastic American Patriots!”

U.S. Southern Command has announced that it has conducted another strike against a small boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Thursday following a pause of almost three weeks.

The strike, announced on social media, is the 22nd strike that the U.S. military has carried out against ships in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that the Trump administration claims are trafficking drugs. 

There were four casualties, according to the social media post, bringing the death toll of the campaign to at least 87 people since September when the strikes began.

The strike also comes amid heightened scrutiny over the very first strike, conducted Sept. 2, during which the administration is alleged to have killed two survivors of the initial explosion as they floated in the water.

“The first lady is going to do the honors,” Trump said.

He counted down from five to zero, and Melania Trump stepped forward and pressed a button that made the tree behind them sparkle with gold-toned lights.

“It's a beauty,” Trump said.

In brief remarks, he touched on the peace deal signed earlier Thursday between Rwanda and Congo, mentioned false claims about the 2020 election being “rigged,” and said he's happy his terms weren't consecutive because he will be in office when the World Cup and the Summer Olympics are held in the United States next year.

Trump also offered thanks to those who serve people in need as well as police and other law enforcement officers, first responders and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents.

The president also discussed the two National Guard members who were shot, one fatally, near the White House the day before Thanksgiving.

The Justice Department has failed to secure a new indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James after a judge dismissed the previous mortgage fraud prosecution encouraged by Trump. 

That's according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

Prosecutors went back to a grand jury in Virginia after a judge's ruling halting the prosecution of James and another longtime Trump foe, former FBI Director James Comey, on the grounds that the U.S. attorney who presented the cases was illegally appointed. 

The Justice Department could go back to the grand jury to try again.

Other performers are country music artists Gabby Barrett, Jon Pardi, Alana Springsteen, Brett Young and Warren Zeiders. Christian music singer Matthew West is also scheduled to perform.

Trump administration officials scheduled to attend are Vice President JD Vance and his family, along with the Treasury, Defense, Interior and Health and Human Services secretaries, the White House said.

The attorney general, director of national intelligence and the administrator of the Small Business Administration are also among the expected attendees.

The Supreme Court is allowing the challenged Texas congressional redistricting plan to be used in next year's election, despite a lower-court ruling that the map likely discriminates on the basis of race. 

The map is favorable to Republicans and was pushed by Trump. 

The justices acted Thursday on an emergency request from Texas for quick action because qualifying in the new districts already has begun, with primary elections in March. 

The Supreme Court's order puts the 2-1 ruling blocking the map on hold at least until after the high court issues a final decision in the case. 

The effort to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in 2026 touched off a nationwide redistricting battle.

Kenya's William Ruto was among leaders to descend on Washington for the signing of the Trump-mediated peace agreement between Congo and Rwanda.

Ruto, who was invited to deliver remarks at the ceremony, thanked Trump for his efforts and spoke hopefully that sustained peace between Congo and Rwanda could have a positive impact on the continent.

But as he closed his speech, Ruto turned the spotlight on the Sudan civil war.

“I want to ask you respectfully, Mr. President, that in your quest for global peace to support efforts to resolve the humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan,” Ruto said.

The brutal war in Sudan, which started in April 2023, has pitted the Sudanese Armed Forces against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The fighting there has killed over 40,000 people and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with over 14 million people displaced.

Investigative reports into a series of high-profile Navy mishaps during a U.S.-led campaign against Yemen's Houthi rebels reveal the operation's toll on ships and personnel.

The four reports released Thursday cover a “friendly fire” instance where a ship shot at two fighter jets, downing one, as well as the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman's collision with a merchant vessel and the loss of two more jets to mishaps.

The reports paint a picture of an aircraft carrier not only beset by regular missile attacks that stressed the crew but other operational demands that put pressure on top leaders.

In all, the four preventable mishaps cost the Navy well over $100 million in damage and injured multiple sailors.

Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, called for the entirety of Congress to access video of the attack on alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean Sea that killed two survivors of an initial attack.

Warner said Congress was handling a weighty incident, which legal experts say may have violated the laws of military warfare. He called for the Trump administration to provide more information to Congress and the public about the strikes and its campaign in international waters near Venezuela.

“We all know that our country's record of interventions in the Caribbean and Central America and South America over the last 100-plus years hasn't been a perfect record,” Warner said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says it will limit how long work permits for certain groups like refugees or people with asylum are valid.

The agency said it's taking this step so people have to go through more frequent vetting when they renew their permits.

It's the latest immigration restriction by the administration since the shooting last week of two National Guard members by a suspect who is an Afghan national.

USCIS said instead of waiting five years to renew their work permits, those affected will have to renew them every 18 months.

Other people affected by the change are immigrants with pending asylum applications, or those who don't have asylum but qualify for various protections against deportation.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said the new firm was needed because the project is moving into a new stage.

The firm is Washington, D.C.-based Shalom Baranes, and it has worked on several federal buildings, including the Pentagon and Treasury building, according to its website.

Ingle said the firm's work has shaped the “architectural identity of our nation's capital for decades” and its experience will be an asset to the ballroom construction.

The initial firm, McCrery Architects, remains on the project as a consultant.

The Washington Post was first to report on the development.

For decades, the government has advised that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection right after birth. The shots are widely considered to be a public health success for preventing thousands of illnesses. 

But a vaccine advisory committee formed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist before he became the nation's top health official, is considering whether to recommend the birth dose only for babies whose mothers test positive, which would mark a return to a public health strategy that was abandoned more than three decades ago. The committee plans to vote Friday.

American Oversight said Thursday that it filed its lawsuit in federal court in Washington, D.C., because the Defense Department and Justice Department failed to provide records sought under the Freedom of Information Act.

“According to experts, if survivors of the initial strike were killed as reported, such conduct could amount to a war crime,” a copy of the lawsuit released by the nonprofit watchdog stated.

New York Attorney General Letitia James is challenging the authority of an acting U.S. attorney in Albany who is investigating her. 

Her lawyers argue John Sarcone's appointment was improper, making subpoenas he issued invalid. 

A court hearing Thursday centered on Sarcone's role in investigating cases against Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association. 

James' attorney Hailyn Chen argued that the subpoenas are invalid due to the improper way Sarcone was placed in the position by U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi. In response to a question from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield, Chen said Sarcone should be disqualified from the investigation and the office.

Justice Department lawyers say Sarcone was appointed properly and the subpoenas should stand. Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss argued that disqualifying Sarcone would be “drastic and extreme.”

Schofield did not say when she would rule. 

Trump said the United States was signing bilateral agreements with the Congo and Rwanda that will unlock new opportunities for the United States to access critical minerals. The deals will benefit all three nations' economies.

“And we'll be involved with sending some of our biggest and greatest U.S. companies over to the two countries,” Trump said. He added, “Everybody's going to make a lot of money.”

The region, rich in critical minerals, has been of interest to Trump as Washington looks for ways to circumvent China to acquire rare earths, essential to manufacturing fighter jets, cellphones and more. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world's rare earth mining and controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she planned to discuss trade and the remaining tariffs on imports from Mexico with Trump on the sidelines of the draw for the 2026 World Cup at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

The Mexican leader said she would also meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The three countries are co-hosting next summer's soccer tournament.

“Everything appears to indicate that we are going to have a small meeting” with Trump, Sheinbaum said during her daily press briefing Thursday. She had announced Wednesday that she would be attending the event.

It will Sheinbaum's first face-to-face meeting with Trump. She said she wants to advance negotiations over tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminum. among other things.

The top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services panel is calling on the Pentagon to release video of a U.S. attack that killed two survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters earlier this year.

Reed and the other leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services and intelligence panels viewed the video at classified briefings by top national security officials in the Capitol on Thursday. He said afterward that the Pentagon should release the video and also the legal opinion authorizing the strike in waters near Venezuela.

“The video will I think answer all of the questions that are floating around and the legal opinion will provide the justification for the general operation,” Reed said.

Republicans and Democrats have vowed to investigate the incident. Reed said the video was disturbing but declined to provide any additional details.

Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said even without a direct verbal command from Hegseth or anyone else to “kill them all” the order for the mission was to kill those on board.

“Admiral Bradley was very clear that he did not say ‘kill them all.' However, there were 11 people on that boat, and the order was basically: Destroy the drugs, kill the 11 people on the boat,” Smith told the AP. 

He described the video showing “basically two shirtless people clinging to the bow of a capsized and inoperable boat, drifting in the water — until the missiles come and kill them.”

The Trump administration has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates around the world to prioritize visa applications from foreigners wishing to visit the United States to either invest in America or attend the 2026 World Cup, 2028 Olympics and other major sporting events. 

The administration also has added new criteria for highly skilled foreign workers seeking a particular visa. 

The new rules would deny entry to applicants deemed to have directed or participated in the censorship of American citizens on social media through content moderation initiatives that have sprung up throughout Europe and elsewhere to combat extremist speech. 

The steps were outlined in cables sent this week to all U.S. diplomatic missions and obtained by The Associated Press.

“No one was asking President Trump to take up this task. Our region is far from the headlines,” said Rwandan President Paul Kagame at the signing ceremony. “But when the president saw the opportunity to contribute to peace, he immediately took it.”

Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI, said authorities identified Brian Cole Jr. as a suspect in the Washington, D.C., pipe bomb case based on the FBI's investigation.

“This was not a new public tip that this came from,” Bongino said. “This was our own internal work at the FBI.”

Brian Cole has been charged with use of an explosive device.

“We were going to track this person to the end of the earth. There was no way he was getting away,” Bongino said.

No attorney information was yet available and attempts to reach family and a cellphone listed as Cole's were not answered.

The long-running bromance between the U.S. president and Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, is still going strong. Trump nodded to Infantino at the DRC-Rwanda peace deal signing, calling him a “great leader in sports and a great gentleman.”

Infantino is in town ahead of the World Cup draw on Friday. The event is being held at the Kennedy Center, or the “Trump Kennedy Center,” as the president called it.

“Oh, excuse me — at the Kennedy Center,” Trump jokingly corrected himself. “Pardon me, such a terrible mistake.”

Trump also said ticket sales for next year's World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, have broken records.

“I can report to you that we have sold more tickets than any country, anywhere in the world at this stage of the game,” he said.

FIFA said late last month that nearly two million tickets had been purchased during two phases of ticket sales. The third phase begins Dec. 11.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the bureau and Department of Justice brought in a new team of investigators and experts to sift through existing evidence and chase down leads. He said that was, “Something the prior administration failed to do.”

Patel went on to call the arrest “flawless,” saying no officers were hurt taking down what he characterized as a dangerous suspect.

“We solved it. He will have his day in court,” Patel said.

Presidents Felix Tshisekedi of Congo and Paul Kagame of Rwanda are signing a deal aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Congo and opening access to the region's critical minerals.

Tshisekedi offered a hopeful message about the precarious peace.

“I do believe this day is the beginning of a new path, a demanding path, yes. Indeed, quite difficult,” Tshisekedi said. “But this is a path where peace will not just be a wish, an aspiration, but a turning point.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi says a man named Brian Coles Jr. was arrested Thursday in with the Jan. 5, 2021, pipe bombs left outside the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Cole is charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said during a news conference. She said the investigation is still underway, and more charges could be filed in the future.

“As we speak, search warrants are being executed,” Bondi said.

Trump celebrated a peace agreement between the leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda on Thursday by praising the building hosting the event.

“It's a spectacular building and we all appreciate it,” Trump said. His administration is involved in a court battle over the think tank.

The State Department on Wednesday said that it renamed it as the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace.

“Thank you for putting a certain name on that,” Trump said to Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the event. “That blew up last night.”

The White House is expected to submit plans for its new ballroom to a planning commission later this month, the Trump-appointed head of the panel said Thursday.

“Once plans are submitted, that's really when the role of this commission, and its professional staff, will begin,” Will Scharf, the chair of the National Capital Planning Commission, said.

In Fairfax, Virginia, federal agents gathered outside an office marked “Brian Cole Bail Bonds,” its entrance wrapped in yellow crime-scene tape that flicked in the afternoon wind.

A man in an FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force jacket stood near the entrance, conferring with local officers who were guarding the building.

The business shares the suspect's name. In public records, it appears to be associated with members of his family, though authorities have not detailed the connection.

The Republican and Democratic leaders on the Senate Armed Services Committee offered diverging takeaways from the Pentagon inspector general report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to share sensitive information.

Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair, said in a statement that Hegseth “acted within his authority to communicate the information in question to other cabinet level officials.”

But Wicker said that senior leaders also need more tools to share classified information “in real time and a variety of environments.”

Sen. Jack Reed of Oregon, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Hegseth violated military regulations and showed “reckless disregard for the safety American servicemembers.”

Reed said in his statement that anyone else would have faced “severe consequences, including potential prosecution.”

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney plans to have a brief meeting with Trump while at the Kennedy Center in Washington for the World Cup draw Friday.

Carney's spokesperson Audrey Champoux says Carney will also have a brief meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.

The United States, Canada and Mexico are hosting the 64-nation World Cup next year.

A Navy admiral has told lawmakers that there was no “kill them all” order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

That disclosure Thursday comes as Congress scrutinizes an attack that killed two survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug boat in international waters near Venezuela. 

Sen. Tom Cotton told reporters about what he heard from Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley in classified briefing and Cotton is defending the attack. But a Democratic lawmaker who was also briefed says he's deeply concerned by video of the second strike.

The Pentagon inspector general's report released Thursday criticized the use of unapproved messaging apps and devices across the department.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the authority to declassify the material he shared with others in a Signal chat, the watchdog found. But it also says the release of details about the strike on Houthi militants in Yemen violated internal Pentagon rules about handling sensitive information that could put service members or their missions in danger.

The report noted that the information that Hegseth sent — the quantity and strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory about two hours to four hours before those strikes — “created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.”

Hegseth wrote on social media: “No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission.”






The South Carolina Republican told reporters during a virtual news conference on Thursday that she's going to finish her term but is “100%” frustrated with the slow pace of the House.

Mace was asked about reporting by The New York Times that she is looking to meet with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to discuss following the lead of the Georgia Republican, who has announced she's leaving Congress in January.

Mace said she's expressed her frustrations to House Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she supports and said she expects to outlast recent criticism of his management of the House.

Mace, first elected in 2020, is seeking the GOP nomination for South Carolina governor in next year's elections and is not expected to run for another House term.

Dozens of people protesting a federal immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans, which entered its second day, were forcefully removed from a City Council meeting Thursday.

Protesters held signs that read “No Collaboration with ICE/DHS” and begged city leaders to create “ICE-Free zones” during a City Council meeting Thursday. It was the second day of a federal immigration enforcement operation in the city.

After public comment was suspended, and protesters refused to yield their time at the podium, City Council members paused the meeting and left the room.

As protesters chanted “Shame,” city police officers ordered them to leave the building. While some protesters complied, multiple others were pushed or physically carried out by officers.

Trump administration lawyers on Thursday accused plaintiffs of “throwing in the towel” with “procedural gamesmanship” after they moved to dismiss their lawsuit over the aggressive tactics of federal immigration officers in the Chicago area.

The coalition of protesters and journalists behind the suit called the dismissal a victory, saying the Trump administration's “Operation Midway Blitz” had largely wound down. But the case was on its way to a skeptical appeals court that had already frozen an order limiting agents' use of force.

“The moment they have to explain themselves to an appellate court, they run for the hills,” said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer says a bill Democrats will bring to the Senate floor for a vote next week would allow for a three-year extension of enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of this year.

Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a vote on a proposal of their choosing as part of a path forward to ending the historic, 43-day government shutdown earlier this fall.

Schumer said every Democrat will support the bill. It's most likely to fail, though.

“Republicans have one week to decide where they stand. Vote for this bill and bring health care costs down or block this bill and send premiums skyrocketing,” Schumer said.

A White House official said Trump would be making the trip Tuesday to discuss ending the inflation crisis he says was inherited from his predecessor, Joe Biden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip hasn't been formally announced. It wasn't immediately clear where in Pennsylvania Trump would be visiting.

Last month's off-year elections showed a shift away from Republicans as public concerns about affordability persist. White House officials said afterward that Trump — who has done relatively few events domestically — would put a greater emphasis on talking directly to the public about his economic policies.

The president has said that any affordability worries are part of a Democratic “hoax” and that people simply need to hear his perspective to change their minds — an approach also embraced by Biden, who in early 2024 went to the Pennsylvania borough of Emmaus to take credit for economic improvements after inflation spiked in 2022.

Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff in honor of U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, a West Virginia National Guard member who was shot Nov. 26, blocks from the White House, and later died of her wounds. Trump issued the proclamation “as a mark of respect for the memory” of Beckstrom.

Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, commented after seeing a video of two boat strike survivors in what he said was “clear distress” at a classified morning briefing.

“Admiral Bradley has a storied career, and he has my respect and have the respect of all of us,” Himes said on CNN.

“But what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service. You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel were killed by the United States.”

The Trump administration says it's begun a top-to-bottom review of all ties with Tanzania, citing recent actions by the East African nation that call into question its reliability as a U.S. partner.

The State Department made the announcement shortly before Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the president of Tanzania's neighbor Kenya signed a new global health agreement with Rubio praising Kenya's role as a regional and international leader.

In a statement, the department said the U.S. values is partnership with the people of Tanzania but “recent actions by the Government of Tanzania, however, raise grave concerns about the direction of our bilateral relationship and the reliability of the Tanzanian Government as a partner.”

The statement cited repression of religious freedom and free speech, restrictions on U.S. commercial interests in the country along with “disturbing violence” before, during and after Tanzania's disputed Oct. 29 elections. “These actions have put American citizens, tourists, and U.S. interests in Tanzania at risk, and threatened to undermine the mutual prosperity and security that have defined our partnership for decades,” it said.

President Trump's effort to install political loyalists as top federal prosecutors has run into a legal buzz saw lately, with judges ruling that his handpicked U.S. attorneys for New Jersey, eastern Virginia, Nevada and Los Angeles were all serving unlawfully.

Now, another federal judge is poised to consider an argument by New York Attorney General Letitia James that the administration also twisted the law to make John Sarcone the acting U.S. attorney for northern New York.

A court hearing is scheduled to be held Thursday as James challenges Sarcone's authority to oversee a Justice Department investigation into regulatory lawsuits she filed against Trump and the National Rifle Association.

James, a Democrat, is disputing the legitimacy of subpoenas issued as part of Sarcone's probe, which her lawyers say is part of a campaign of baseless investigations and prosecutions of Trump's perceived enemies.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — As a leader of the College Democrats at Vanderbilt University, Luci Wingo knew the odds of a Democrat winning one of Nashville's three U.S. House seats weren't great. Yet her hope grew as the party mounted an aggressive campaign for its candidate, Aftyn Behn, in a special election to replace a Republican who had resigned.

In the end, high Democratic enthusiasm and millions of dollars in spending weren't enough. Republican Matt Van Epps won Tuesday's vote by 9 percentage points — a closer margin than the district's last election, yet still a victory for the GOP that seemed all but certain based on how the district was drawn. Republicans had split the unified Democratic stronghold of Nashville into three GOP-leaning districts after the last census.

As states wage a mid-decade redistricting battle initiated by President Donald Trump, Tennessee's special election illustrates the power of manipulative mapmaking and provides a window into what lies ahead in the states that are rushing to redraw their congressional maps for next year's midterm elections.

Such gerrymandering can help parties in power maintain and even expand their majorities, but it's also a source of frustration and anger for voters in the minority party who lose the chance to be represented by someone of their choice.

“It's a hard battle to fight because it's so intentional, it's so in your face — and it's hard to not just want to get frustrated and kind of give up,” said Wingo, a college sophomore who grew up in Nashville.




She said she's become accustomed to what she called “purposeful pessimism.”

“We don't try to get our hopes up too much, because we kind of know the outcomes,” she said, adding that Behn's campaign nevertheless created a surge of enthusiasm among local Democrats.

Nashville had been represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper for 20 years when the Republican-controlled state General Assembly decided in 2022 to use the latest census data to carve up the city in a quest to flip his seat to Republicans.

Some parts of Nashville were placed in two sprawling rural districts to the east and west, both represented by Republicans. The portion retaining Cooper's district number was redrawn to twist southward into another rural Republican-leaning area.

Cooper, a moderate-leaning lawmaker, decided not to seek reelection that year, and Republicans won all three seats by comfortable margins.

Republicans carried all three districts again last year. They won by 17 percentage points in Cooper's former 5th District, by nearly 22 points in the westward 7th District — which includes downtown Nashville, well-known historically Black areas and major universities — and by 36 points in the eastward 6th District.




Van Epps' special election victory this week in the 7th Congressional District was close enough to encourage Democrats looking for momentum ahead of next year's midterms. But it also showcased how the district remains reliably Republican thanks to the recent redrawing of its boundaries.

“In this case, gerrymandering worked,” said John McGlennon, a longtime professor of government at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. “But it may be at the price of seats in other places in Tennessee and around the country.”

Kevin Mittelmeier, who says he's in the political middle, cast his ballot for Behn. He said voters' voices won't have much meaning as long as the districts remain the same.

“I can just see from the outside looking in, unbiased, it's actually frustrating how it's being controlled, and how it's being dealt with, and how people of Nashville's opinions really are taken away,” he said.

For some voters, the split-up districts remain confusing. Maggie Tekeli brought three young children to the polls planning to vote for Behn, only to learn her Nashville home wasn't in the 7th District. 

“It's just discouraging from a democratic process standpoint,” she said.

What Republican mapmakers did to Nashville, they now are looking to replicate in other states as Trump pushes for mid-decade redistricting, which he hopes will lead to his party maintaining its majority in the U.S. House next year.

In Texas, the first to answer Trump's call, Republican lawmakers redrew congressional district boundaries in Dallas, Fort Worth and their suburbs to extend a Democratic seat into a Republican region far outside the metro area. 

In Missouri, Republican officials approved a new U.S. House map that shaves off portions of a Democratic-held seat in Kansas City into two rural Republican-held districts and stretches the remainder of the seat eastward into another predominantly Republican area.

Officials in North Carolina and Ohio also approved new U.S. House maps intended to boost Republican chances of winning additional seats.

Democrats countered with their own gerrymandering in California. Voters in November approved a new Democratic-drawn congressional map that merges farming and ranching areas favoring Republicans with some of the state's wealthiest and most liberal coastal communities.

Some residents in each of those states expressed concern about being adequately represented under the new districts. But that didn't deter the politicians from drawing the maps because the stakes are so high. Democrats need a net gain of just three seats in next year's midterms to win control of the U.S. House and break a Republican grip on power that has enabled Trump to advance his agenda.

The splintering of Nashville from one Democratic congressional district into three that favor Republicans is a mirror of what's being debated by Republicans in Indiana, which could be the next state to act on partisan redistricting.

Republicans currently hold seven of the state's nine U.S. House seats. But a proposal in the Republican-led state General Assembly would give the GOP a shot at winning all nine seats.

Under the plan, a congressional district for the state's largest city, Indianapolis, would be split up and grafted onto four Republican-leaning districts. The district has been represented for the past 17 years by Democratic Rep. André Carson, the state's lone Black member of Congress.

His district would be stretched southeast to the border with Kentucky and Ohio, combining residents of the state's largest city with those in its least populated county. Another district would span westward to the Illinois border.

During a public hearing this week, Democratic state Rep. Robin Shackleford warned colleagues that the redrawn congressional districts would “be crippling” for her Indianapolis constituents.

“These maps crack apart historic Black neighborhoods, weakening our voting power and silencing the voices of the very people who are already fighting the hardest for economic stability, safer streets, better schools and access to affordable health care,” she said. 

Yet the revised districts, if approved, appear likely to accomplish their purpose of boosting Republican representation in Congress. 

Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political scientist at the University of Indianapolis, said she had no doubt that there will be enough Republicans in the newly drawn congressional districts to overwhelm the Democratic vote in future elections.

But she added: “When you're connecting some of Indianapolis to some of those very rural areas, both groups are ultimately going to lose out.”

The Harry S. Truman carrier strike group's nine-month deployment, which ended in late May, included four mishaps resulting in the loss of nearly $100 million in equipment. While no U.S. personnel were seriously hurt in any of the incidents, naval investigators acknowledge that there could've been “catastrophic” outcomes had they played out a little differently.

The carrier group deployed in September 2024, first heading to the North Sea, where it participated in NATO exercise Neptune Strike before it entered the Red Sea in mid-December to eventually lead the Pentagon's Operation Rough Rider, the U.S. military's 52-day bombing campaign of the Yemen-based Houthis.

“The Navy's sustained combat operations in the U.S. Central Command area of operations for the past two years demonstrated our battle effectiveness and ability to maintain freedom of navigation,” said Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jim Kilby. “As we reflect on these incidents and ongoing improvement efforts, the Navy remains laser-focused on producing battle-ready Sailors and forces to ensure the Navy provides our nation with the most lethal, combat-credible, and ready force possible.”

During the deployment, the carrier collided with a merchant vessel, shot down one of its own fighter aircraft, lost another one of its fighting aircraft while trying to evade an incoming ballistic missile, and lost a third fighter jet due to an arresting cable failure as the pilot attempted to land on it.

The Navy released the results of the four separate investigations on Thursday. The public versions of the reports, which include heavy redactions, paint a picture of sailors under significant stress and pressure, failing to communicate properly during those high-pressure moments.

A senior Navy official told reporters, “I assure you that accountability actions were taken across all the operators involved in this, and that could be from an administrative reaction to take away someone's watch qualification to have them re-qualify, to administrative procedures in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I don't feel an obligation to publish those results to the world.”

The first of the four incidents occurred on Dec. 21, 2024, when the strike group's guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG-64) fired two Standard Missiles (SM-2) at two F/A-18F Super Hornets embarked on Truman under the belief they were anti-ship cruise missiles. The pilots ejected themselves from the aircraft and were rescued.

The Navy investigation into this incident concluded that the Gettysburg's commanding officer's decision “to engage was neither reasonable nor prudent and could have been prevented by action at multiple levels.”

The next of the four incidents occurred on Feb. 12, 2025, when the USS Harry S. Truman collided with the M/V Besiktas-M near Port Said, Egypt. Investigators ultimately concluded that it was avoidable but also said it could have been much worse.

“A small change in the timing of the collision or the angle of impact could have caused catastrophic results. Had the collision occurred 100 ft forward, the impact would have likely pierced a berthing compartment with 120 sleeping Sailors,” the report said. “As it was, there were eight Sailors in a space less than 10 ft from the impact locations; a 1-degree change in trajectory could have destroyed the space and caused eight fatalities. My team spoke with those eight Sailors, and they will never forget how close they came to losing their lives.”

About a week after the collision, Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of Carrier Strike Group 8, relieved the commanding officer of USS Harry S. Truman, Capt. Dave Snowden, from duty due to “a loss of confidence in his ability to command,” the Navy announced. Capt. Christopher “Chowdah” Hill, commanding officer of USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), assumed the duty as Truman's interim commanding officer.

In mid-March, the U.S. military announced Operation Rough Rider, targeting the Houthis in Yemen due to the group's targeting of commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea. The carrier strike group was the spearhead of the U.S. operation.

“This carrier striker conducted 52 days of 24/7 sustained combat operations,” Kilby told reporters on Thursday.

On April 28, 2025, the Truman had to make an evasive maneuver to avoid an incoming Houthi-fired ballistic missile. However, in doing so, an F/A-18E Super Hornet and a tow tractor that were being moved around in the hangar bay skidded right off the deck. As the aircraft and tow tractor skidded, the investigators' report states that the aircraft director dove for and briefly grabbed the joystick and was dragged toward the edge before letting go.

SECOND US FIGHTER JET FALLS INTO OCEAN IN THE LAST MONTH

Investigators blamed the loss of the aircraft and tow tractor on “inadequate aircraft brake engagement,” finding that the evasive maneuver was not excessive given the circumstances and that “proper communication” could have prevented the aircraft from careening off the carrier. This aircraft cost more than $36 million, and the dolly cost more than $61,000, per the report.

About a week later, the failure of one of the arresting wires as an F/A-18 aircraft tried to land sent it careening off the edge as well. Investigators found that there were “substandard maintenance practices,” and the root cause was the “failure of the ship's force to install the proper clevis washer.”

The aircrew sustained “minor abrasions” in the incident, while their aircraft, per the investigation, was also lost at sea and cost a little more than $60 million.

Rubrik shares soared 25% on Friday after the data management company posted blowout third-quarter numbers and boosted guidance.

The stock, which debuted on the market in April 2024, headed for its second-best day on record. 

Revenue jumped 48% from a year earlier to $350 million, topping the $320 million average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. In its announcement late Thursday, Rubrik reported adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share, while analysts had expected a loss of 17 cents per share. 

The company boosted revenue guidance for the fiscal year to a range of $1.28 billion to $1.282 billion, up from a previous high of $1.237 billion. 

CEO Bipul Sinha told CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime" on Thursday that the company's strength in cyber resilience and its recent move into safeguarding artificial intelligence agents is fueling its rapid growth.

"As businesses are taking on agents, their biggest worry is, they don't know what the hell is going on," Sinha said. "What are these agents doing? Are they hallucinating? Do they have guardrails? And if they do make mistakes, can we undo those mistakes?"

Rubrik had a net loss of $63.83 million, a loss of 32 cents per share, narrowing significantly from the net loss a year ago of $130.91 million, a loss of 71 cents per share.

On an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Sinha said Rubrik is winning business by replacing legacy vendors.

He said one of the largest banks in Asia opted for Rubrik over a long-term vendor, as did a Fortune 250 professional services firm, and the push is due to the growth in AI and the evolving threat of cyberattacks.

"With AI, the cyberattacks have become more prevalent because the attackers are using AI," Sinha told CNBC. "So we believe we are in the early days of a very, very large market and will continue to grow at rapid pace for the foreseeable future."

Movie theater operators woke up Friday to the possibility of a new world order.

Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a deal for the streaming giant to acquire WBD's film studio and streaming service, bringing an end to a months-long bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the assets.

With Netflix as the victor, exhibitors are in a panic. 

Unlike traditional movie studios, the streamer has not adhered to conventional theatrical distribution, and there are fears that big changes could be coming to an industry that is still struggling post-pandemic.

"It's no secret that this was probably the least desired outcome for many theater owners," said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. "There are no two ways around that. This may be one of the most meaningful days in the history of the business, but it could yet be a constructive one for cinema if Netflix honors early indications that it will maintain the theatrical business model of Warner Bros. properties and lean into those unique strengths which are not replicable on the streaming platform."

Cinema United, the world's largest exhibition trade association, came out strong Friday morning against the sale of WBD assets to Netflix.

"The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business," CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. "The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world."

A half dozen movie theater operators who spoke to CNBC shared concerns that Netflix's acquisition of WBD would lead to a significant decline in the number of films made available to cinemas annually and, therefore, hit annual box office ticket sales.

"Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite," O'Leary said. 

Cinema United said the deal "would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office" putting smaller theater chains and independent cinemas, in particular, at risk.

"We are going to be pulling all of the levers we can because we think that a deal of this magnitude and the potential impact that it will have is something that everyone with regulatory and oversight authority needs to look closely at," O'Leary said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Friday. "So, we've already been talking to people at the federal level, at the state level and internationally because this is a significant, significant threat, we believe, to the long-term viability of the theatrical exhibition."

And Cinema United isn't the only group worried about the future of the industry if the Netflix deal is approved.

A collective of top industry players sent an open letter to Congress detailing the potential economic and institutional blowback that could play out if the merger goes through.

The letter, reported by Variety, stated that Netflix would "effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace" and could alter the footprint of theatrical movies and decrease licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows.

Several exhibitors told CNBC that they fear a deal between WBD and Netflix will result in fewer theatrical releases and even shorter theatrical windows for would-be major releases.

Consolidation in the studio space has been a growing issue for the theatrical industry in recent years. When studios merge, they typically decrease the number of films they produce, something the industry saw firsthand when Disney bought 20th Century Fox back in 2019.

The theatrical business has struggled in recent years from pandemic related production shutdowns as well as dual labor strikes that halted film shoots and delayed movie releases. The industry still has not returned to pre-pandemic release numbers or box office ticket sales, and there are worries that it never will.

"If you look historically, when legacy studios are absorbed by other entities, even in the case where those other entities are also legacy studios, the amount of movies produced for theatrical distribution goes down," O'Leary told CNBC Friday. 

Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call Friday morning following the deal announcement that planned Warner Bros. releases "will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros."

Sarandos doesn't plan to alter WBD's current business practices, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Still, he does plan to meet with theater owners in an effort to assuage any concerns and to explain his vision that movies should have shorter exclusive theatrical windows, the person said. 

For exhibitors, shrinking theatrical windows pose a major threat. 

Prior to the pandemic, movies typically played in theaters for between 70 and 90 days before entering the home market. Following Covid shutdowns, studios and cinemas renegotiated these terms, and the average window fell to 30 to 45 days.

Netflix, however, has never followed these guidelines. The company has long held that its content is meant for its streaming subscribers and therefore should be delivered to them at home, on the service as soon as possible. 

If Netflix does release a film in cinemas, it's usually only for the minimum requirement to be eligible for awards contention or for weekend stints as one-off events. 

When Netflix does go to theaters, it doesn't report box office figures publicly. That's left industry analysts wondering if the company will continue WBD's transparency when it comes to ticket sales once the deal is finalized.

"We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in the theaters," Sarandos said during Friday's investor call. "My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly."

"Netflix movies will take the same strides they have, which is some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand, but our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that's what they're looking for," he said. 

Of course, that strategy could shift in the coming years. 

Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush, highlighted in a research note Friday that the theatrical slate has already been negotiated through 2029.

"So any buyer would have to honor those contracts by showing the slated WBD films in theaters for at least the next four years," Reese wrote.

One theater chain operator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid thoughts, told CNBC, "All exhibition can do is take Netflix at their word." 

"In the deal they have pledged to continue to release legacy WB titles to theatres," the operator said. "Now does that mean with a one-week window, a four-week window or no window? Netflix will have to diametrically alter their corporate philosophy of streaming first. We just have to wait to see. It's not great for exhibition."

President Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.

The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.

"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power," the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.

Those boards "wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.

"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members," ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.

The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.

"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency," Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.

"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country," she wrote. "Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent."

Pan added that her colleagues "redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies."

Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does "not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."

They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified "a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials."

Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. 

Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21.

Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have "solely adjudicatory functions," Katsas and Walker noted.

They cited the "War Claims Commission," a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example.

Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on "whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials," they wrote.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. 

The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. 

The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. 

The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. 

The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. 

All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. 

But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. 

The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. 

Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. 

"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused," said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. 

Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. 

"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants," he said. 

Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. 

"We will see hepatitis B come back," he said. "The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule."

In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is "reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine." The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and "creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns."

Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have "never tested" the hepatitis B vaccine "appropriately." 

Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. 

Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.

"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses," said Hibbeln. 

A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.

Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. 

Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is "deeply concerned" by the vote, which it said risks "reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death." The company added that "there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children." 

In a statement, GSK said, "we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact."

The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

Oil prices were steady on Friday, supported by stalled Ukraine peace talks, though gains were offset by expectations of a supply glut.

Brent crude rose 41 cents, or 0.65%, to $63.67 per barrel by 10:07 a.m ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 36 cents, or 0.6%, to $60.03 a barrel.

"It is quite flat today and this week had a narrow trading range," said Tamas Vargas, an oil market analyst at PVM. "The lack of progress in the Ukrainian peace talks provides a bullish backdrop but on the other hand, resilient OPEC production provides a bearish backstop. These two opposing forces make trading seemingly quiet."

The market is also assessing the impact of a possible U.S. Fed rate cut and tensions with Venezuela, both of which could boost oil prices, analysts said.

Of economists surveyed in a November 28 to December 4 Reuters poll, 82% expected a 25-basis-point interest rate reduction at next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. A rate cut would stimulate economic growth and energy demand.

"Looking ahead, supply factors remain in focus. A peace deal with Russia would bring more barrels to the market and likely push prices down," said Anh Pham, a senior research specialist at LSEG.

"On the other hand, any geopolitical escalation will drive prices higher. OPEC+ has agreed to keep production steady until early next year, so it adds some support for prices too," he said.

Markets also continued to brace for a potential U.S. military incursion into Venezuela after President Donald Trump said late last week the U.S. would start taking action to stop Venezuelan drug traffickers on land "very soon".

Rystad Energy said in a note that such a move could put at risk Venezuela's 1.1 million barrels per day of crude oil production, which goes mostly to China.

Prices were also boosted this week by the failure of U.S. talks in Moscow to achieve any significant breakthrough over the war in Ukraine, which could have included a deal to let Russian oil back into the market.

Those factors kept prices supported despite a growing surplus.

Saudi Arabia cut its January Arab Light crude selling prices to Asia to the lowest level in five years amid oversupply, according to a document reviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

The New York Times on Friday filed a lawsuit against Perplexity, alleging the artificial intelligence startup has illegally copied and distributed its copyrighted content. 

The suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, accuses Perplexity of unlawfully scraping The Times' stories, videos, podcasts and other content to formulate responses to user queries. The startup also generates outputs that are "identical or substantially similar to" The Times' content, according to the complaint.

"While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity's unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products," Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. "We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work."

Perplexity did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Founded in 2022, Perplexity is best known for its AI-powered search engine that gives users simple answers to questions. The startup has raised more than $1.5 billion in funding from investors including IVP, New Enterprise Associates and Nvidia, according to PitchBook.

"Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media and now AI. Fortunately it's never worked, or we'd all be talking about this by telegraph," Jesse Dwyer, head of communication at Perplexity, said in a statement.

The lawsuit from The Times on Friday serves as the latest example of how media companies and publishers are working to protect their intellectual property during the AI boom.

The Times is already involved in another ongoing copyright suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, which alleges the companies improperly used The Times' content to train their AI models. That suit was filed in the Southern District of New York in 2023. 

In September, AI startup Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class action lawsuit with a group of authors who claimed that the company had illegally downloaded their books and others from pirated databases.

That settlement makes up the largest publicly reported copyright recovery.

The Trump administration views the proposed $72 billion deal for Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film and streaming assets with "heavy skepticism," a senior administration official told CNBC's Eamon Javers on Friday morning.

Netflix said Friday that it would acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. The deal is subject to regulatory approval.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said, "This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare."

"A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk," Warren said in a statement.

"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption," Warren said. "The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery."

Paramount Skydance had made multiple bids for the entirety of WBD, as opposed to a subset of the company's assets. 

Paramount's final bid, which was received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, CNBC previously reported. 

Comcast also made a bid for WBD's film and streaming properties.

The New York Post on Thursday reported that, "Paramount Skydance chief David Ellison met with Trump officials and key lawmakers in Washington DC on Wednesday to press his case against Warner Bros. Discovery's potential selection of Netflix as its merger partner."

Ellison's billionaire father, Larry Ellison, is close to President Donald Trump.

On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount, in a letter to lawyers for WBD, had warned that a sale to Netflix likely would "never close" because of regulatory challenges in the United States and overseas.

"Acquiring Warner's streaming and studio assets 'will entrench and extend Netflix's global dominance in a matter not allowed by domestic or foreign competition laws,' Paramount's lawyers wrote," the Journal reported.

Netflix's purchase of WBD's assets is expected to close, if approved by regulators, after WBD completes its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which is currently planned to occur in the third quarter of 2026.

Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels. 

A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows that Netflix agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal does not receive approval.

CNBC requested comment from Netflix, WBD, Paramount, and Comcast.

Trump, even before taking office for his first term in the White House, opposed a deal by AT&T to buy Time Warner, saying "it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few." 

After he took office, the Department of Justice in November 2017 sued in an effort to prevent the merger.

The DOJ lost that lawsuit, and the merger was closed in June 2018.

Before the 2024 presidential election, Trump opposed the then-proposed sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan. But after reentering the White House in January, Trump in June signed an executive order approving the merger, after the companies signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government.

The agreement gave the U.S. government a "golden share" in the merged company, which Trump claims gives a president "total control." 

Experts said the share gives the government an outsized say in corporate governance.

Correction: A senior administration official said the Trump administration views the deal with 'heavy skepticism.' A previous version mischaracterized the official.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

Netflix is taking a massive swing at the future of entertainment, and Hollywood will never be the same.

The streaming giant has agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion, the companies said on Friday. It's by far Netflix's biggest acquisition in its history and is one of the largest ever in the entertainment industry.

"Warner Bros. has helped define the last century of entertainment, and together, we can help define the next one," Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos on a call after the deal's announcement.

The seismic cash-and-stock deal, which has a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, will bring together Netflix's streaming platform with Warner Bros.' century-old studio, HBO, HBO Max, and some of the most iconic franchises in film and television.

The acquisition is expected to close after WBD spins off its Global Networks division into a separate publicly traded company, Discovery Global, which includes WBD's TV networks like CNN, TNT, and TBS. The process is expected to take 12 to 18 months, the companies said.

Netflix investors don't seem thrilled with the deal, as its stock slid 3.9% in premarket trading on the news. WBD shares surged 3.3%.

Shares of rival bidders Paramount also retreated by 2.9%, while fellow suitor Comcast's stock was little changed.

Sarandos said the merger strengthens the company's core mission.

He called Warner Bros.' catalog "incredible" and said that bringing together classics such as "Citizen Kane" with Netflix hits like "Stranger Things," "KPop Demon Hunters," and "Squid Game" would allow the company to entertain the world "even better."

Sarandos said this merger would let Netflix give audiences "more of what they love" while helping shape the next century of global storytelling.

Netflix plans to preserve Warner Bros.' existing operations, including its theatrical release pipeline.

Several WBD employees said they were on edge about a Netflix acquisition.

One longtime HBO software engineer said they were worried about their job if the Netflix acquisition went through. Their reasoning was that Netflix already has a top-notch tech platform, so they might not keep many software engineers if the tech giant came out on top and collapsed HBO Max's platform into its own.

Another WBD streaming employee expressed a similar concern about Netflix and their personal job security.

A third WBD streaming employee had a very different take, saying he was rooting for Netflix to win.

"I think Netflix is cooler and more hip than Comcast and Paramount," this person said. They said they weren't too concerned about their job security with a deal, adding that in past transactions involving WBD's assets, reorgs took a long time to come to fruition.

Warner Bros. grants Netflix access to some of the most recognizable titles in modern entertainment, including enduring sitcoms like "Friends" and "The Big Bang Theory," as well as prestige television from HBO, franchises like "Harry Potter," and classic movies like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Casablanca."

While Netflix built its empire on original programming, it has long lacked the kind of heritage intellectual property that more established studios, such as Disney, have.

If regulators approve the deal, Netflix subscribers are likely to get a wider selection of premium content on the platform.

Netflix expects the acquisition to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion in annual cost savings by the third year and to boost earnings by the second year.

WBD shareholders will receive $23.25 in cash per share and $4.50 in Netflix stock, Netflix said. The agreement values WBD at $27.75 per share.

Regulators are expected to scrutinize the deal closely. It still requires approval from the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and WBD shareholders.

Netflix's victory is a surprise for many media industry insiders and a loss for David Ellison's Paramount Skydance.

Netflix already has the largest paid streaming service by both subscribers and engagement, so the consensus among media analysts was that it didn't necessarily need HBO Max and its content.

Paramount was the first bidder for WBD and the only suitor willing to swallow the whole company. Many industry insiders thought Ellison's apparent rapport with Trump could help a Paramount-WBD deal get a headache-free approval process.

Comcast was also in the mix. Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners made the case that Comcast should go all out to buy WBD's studio and streamer, writing that it was time for the company "to make a bold move to change the narrative around Comcast." Without HBO Max, Greenfield said its Peacock streamer would be "stranded without an obvious merger partner and at a meaningful content deficit."

Instead, Netflix appears poised to acquire HBO Max and its large subscriber base. Meanwhile, Paramount+ and Peacock could fall further behind.

In this article

Netflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. 

The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. 

Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. 

The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including "The Wizard of Oz," the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including "The Sopranos" and "Game of Thrones."

"I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers," Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning. 

"We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity," he said. "It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories."

Netflix's initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets was for $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.

The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months. 

CNBC has reached out to Comcast and Paramount for comment.

As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal. 

Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders. 

Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.

The merger could invite regulatory scrutiny given the size of the expansive streaming businesses for each company. Netflix said it surpassed 300 million global streaming subscribers at the end of 2024, the last time it publicly reported its customer count. Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 128 million global subscribers as of Sept. 30. 

Paramount raised the potential for antitrust concerns earlier this week in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management as second-round bids came in, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

The newly merged Paramount Skydance made its initial run at Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process. The David Ellison-run company was the only suitor bidding for the entirety of WBD's portfolio — the film studio, streaming business and TV networks.

Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said. 

Earlier this week, Paramount raised questions about the "fairness and adequacy" of the sale process, contending Warner Bros. Discovery favored Netflix.

"It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder," Paramount attorneys said in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Moscow will take Ukrainian territory by force if Kyiv's troops do not withdraw, signaling rigidity over a key sticking point in peace talks. 

"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms, or Ukrainian troops leave these territories," Putin, who is currently on a state visit to India, said in an interview with India Today. The comments, published by Russian state-controlled media, were translated by news agency Reuters and made in reference to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Russia is estimated to control more than 80% of the Donbas, where fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists started long before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022. The war in the region first began in 2014, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea — a peninsular in southern Ukraine. 

Capturing and officially annexing the Donbas region would enable Russia to create a land bridge to Crimea, a crucial military and trading hub for Moscow. 

Under occupation, so-called referendums have shown up to 99% of residents in parts of the Donbas region voted to join the Russian Federation. Those referendums have been widely criticized as sham votes by the international community. 

Putin's comments came after he held a five-hour meeting with U.S. delegates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner — U.S. President Donald Trump's son in law — in Moscow on Tuesday. 

During Thursday's interview with India Today, Putin said Russia did not agree with some of the points outlined in the reworked U.S. peace proposals for Ukraine, labeling the negotiation process "difficult work."

The original 28-point peace plan — drawn up by Russian and American officials, with no input from Ukraine — reportedly included a requirement that Ukraine concede territory in the Donbas to Russia. It was redrafted following talks between the U.S. and Ukraine, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that any peace deal must honor Ukrainian sovereignty. 

Marnie Howlett, a lecturer in Russian and East European politics at the University of Oxford, told CNBC on Friday that the war would only end when Russia stops attacking Ukraine. 

"Given the Kremlin shows a lack of genuine interest in ending the conflict, no peace agreement is likely any time soon," she said. 

"Russia has failed to take Donbas by force since 2014, as Ukrainians have made clear they will not accept the illegal capture of their territory. No 'deal' is possible without Ukrainians' support, and nearly 12 years of resistance show that they are unwilling to support territorial concessions."

Emily Ferris, a senior research fellow at defense and security thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, agreed that Moscow is unlikely to be truly invested in making peace in Ukraine without land concessions being on the table. 

"Currently, Russia sees no reason to come to the negotiating table because it is making – admittedly small – gains on the battlefield and there is no offer that meets their demands," she told CNBC. "The two sticking points are European military support for Ukraine – the so-called security guarantees and what that actually means – and of course the territorial issue, which Moscow is counting on Ukraine to compromise on."

Speaking at the 2025 Investor Summit conference at the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, Kim Darroch, who served as the U.K.'s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump's first term, said he did not believe an end to the conflict in Ukraine was imminent. 

"I don't think the war is going to end anytime soon, unless the Ukrainians agree to capitulate and give up territory, plus to never join NATO and this kind of stuff which I think is basically impossible to concede and survive politically," he told an audience. 

"So, I think the war will drag on through the winter and beyond, which potentially is very dangerous for Europe, because I think if Trump can't get a deal he may just walk away and stop weapons supplies to Ukraine and tell the Europeans, 'it's your problem, I tried to get a deal, so you do it.' And then I'm not sure we actually have the capacity to provide Ukraine with what it needs." 

Global investors have been closely monitoring developments in the negotiations, with a breakthrough likely to have implications for markets across asset classes. Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 sparked an international sell-off of equities and huge volatility in energy markets as the Western world drastically reduced trade and investment in Russia. Concerns about Russian aggression have also led to a huge defense splurge across Europe, fueling a bull run on regional defense stocks.

Social media giant X has been hit with a 120 million euro ($140 million) fine by the European Commission for breaching transparency obligations, in the latest challenge to a U.S. big tech company by the bloc. 

The Commission on Friday said breaches include "the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark', the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers."

The ruling follows a two-year investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms. The Commission said that failure to comply with the decision may lead to penalty payments.

"Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU," said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy.

"With the DSA's first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users' rights and evading accountability."

X has been approached for comment.

Musk's social network now has 60 days to tell the Commission how it plans to address the issues with "deceptive" blue checkmarks, and 90 days to submit a plan to resolve the issues with its ads repository, and access to its public data for researchers.

"Failure to comply with the non-compliance decision may lead to periodic penalty payments," the Commission said in a statement.

The fine comes a day after the commission announced it would investigate whether Meta breached antitrust rules around a new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp.

In recent months, the US has been pressuring Europe to soften, or abandon, its rules for big tech companies, including the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act and other AI regulations that are under consideration.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has underlined Moscow's willingness to provide "uninterrupted shipments of fuel" to India, as the U.S. pressures New Delhi to give up importing their oil. 

Putin made the offer during a joint address with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, part of his first visit to the country since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which triggered widespread sanctions.

The sanctions forced Russia to seek new customers for its exports. India has become the second biggest buyer of Russian crude oil, after China, with a report Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air showing India bought 38% of Russian crude exports in October.

In October, President Donald Trump sanctioned two of Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. This followed a tariff of 25% on India for buying Russian oil in August. But India has to walk a tightrope because it has close ties to the U.S. while also relying on Russia for fuel and access to military hardware.

Putin questioned U.S. pressure on India in an interview to an Indian television channel on Thursday.

The United States still buys nuclear fuel from Russia for its own nuclear power plants, Putin said in the interview, adding: "If the U.S. has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn't India have the same privilege?" 

While Trump has acknowledged that India has cut back its Russian oil imports, experts told CNBC that this may be a temporary trend. 

Apart from crude oil, Russia's Rosatom is also delivering reactors and reportedly fuel for India's Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, which has a combined capacity of 6000MW. 

India and Russia have an energy partnership, the Russian president said, adding that Moscow had been is reliable supplier of "oil, gas, coal and everything that is required for the development of India's energy".

Last month, India announced a "historic deal" with Washington, in which Indian state-owned oil companies signed a one-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S.

A Delta Air Lines flight to Scotland had to divert after an IT issue halted operations at its destination.

Delta Flight 208 took off from New York on Thursday evening and was supposed to land at Edinburgh Airport around 9 a.m. local time.

However, after a six-hour flight across the Atlantic Ocean, the Boeing 767 then spent about 20 minutes circling just south of the Scottish capital.

It then changed course for Ireland, landing in Dublin just after 10 a.m.

"Due to an IT issue with our air traffic control provider, no flights are currently operating from Edinburgh Airport," the airport said in a statement on X.

Data from Flightradar24 shows 11 flights bound for Edinburgh have been diverted, mostly to nearby Glasgow. 

At around 10:45 a.m. local time, less than an hour after the Delta flight landed in Dublin, flights resumed from Edinburgh Airport.

Delta could not immediately be reached for comment outside US working hours.

Foxconn, a key Nvidia partner in its artificial intelligence buildout, saw its revenue spike 26% year-on-year in November, as demand for servers continued to ramp up amid the AI boom.

The Taiwanese company, also known as Hon Hai, is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and makes the servers that hold chips in data centers, as well as assembling Apple's iPhone. 

Foxconn on Friday reported "strong growth" year-on-year for its cloud and networking products, pointing to "momentum for AI server racks," in its monthly revenue report. It reported revenue of NT$844.3 billion ($27 billion) for November. 

A longstanding partner to many of the world's largest tech companies including Nvidia and Apple, Foxconn has become a key player in the rollout of AI infrastructure in recent times. 

It was announced in May that the company would provide infrastructure to a major AI factory in Taiwan, in collaboration with Nvidia and the Taiwanese government. Two months later Foxconn announced it was taking a stake in data center construction company TECO Electric & Machinery Co.

OpenAI said last month that it would collaborate with the Taiwanese company on design work and U.S. manufacturing readiness for next generation AI infrastructure hardware.  

Foxconn's month-on-month revenue was down around 6%, with the company pointing to its smart consumer electronics segment slightly declining. 

"AI server rack shipments continue to ramp up, and ICT products are in peak season in the second half of the year," the monthly report said in its business outlook for the fourth quarter. 

The company said in November that growth in its AI server business had seen its third-quarter profits jump 17% year-on-year.

Foxconn's share price has jumped 26% since the start of 2025, following a 76% uptick over the previous 12 months.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is done talking about the cloud and is renaming everything after its AI software Agentforce — perhaps even the whole company.

Salesforce slapped the "Agentforce" moniker on many of its products and services recently. And when the company reported earnings this week, there were updated names for several offerings. Sales is now "Agentforce Sales." The Service offering is "Agentforce Service," and Platform became "Agentforce 365 Platform," and so on.

A Salesforce employee recently told Business Insider that the company might change its official corporate name to Agentforce. This was mentioned partly in jest. However, during an interview with Benioff late on Wednesday, the CEO confirmed this is a possibility.

"It might," Benioff he told Business Insider. "That would not shock me."

There's precedent for such radical moves in the industry, as companies shift focus to new technologies or strategies. Mark Zuckerberg famously changed Facebook's name to Meta. Google's cofounders also changed their corporate name to Alphabet. Jack Dorsey's Square became Block.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.

Salesforce was born in the cloud, so that tech buzzword has been attached to many products over the years: Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud.

Now customers don't want to hear about the cloud anymore, Benioff said in the interview. He learned this during recent focus groups ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce conference in October. Instead, clients want to talk about AI agents.

"I dropped the word cloud totally," he said. "I did it at Dreamforce. Did you notice I never used it in the keynote? We learned in focus groups customers don't talk about cloud anymore. They just want to talk about their agentic interface."

Salesforce renamed Data Cloud, its data platform, to "Data 360" and announced the change during Dreamforce. Data 360 is central to the company's 2026 strategic plan, which Benioff also discussed with Business Insider during the interview.

Salesforce has made a huge bet on AI agents. Some insiders have cast doubt on the initiative, but Wednesday's earnings showed some positive signs as the company raised its revenue forecast.

Legal tech startup Harvey this year has bagged $760 million in funding and soared to a valuation of $8 billion. Now it needs to prove that it can actually boost profits for the law firms that pay for its services.

Harvey, which on Thursday announced the close of a $160 million funding round, says its products free lawyers from drudge work so they can spend more time on strategy and client counseling. But at this point, Harvey's ROI shows up in feelings more than spreadsheets.

Law firms want the payoff to show up on financial reports and client bills, says Zach Abramowitz, a former lawyer turned technology consultant for the legal field. Right now, he says, the payoff "inures first and foremost to the user" — the attorney who suddenly feels like they're working with a supercharged second screen.

AI adoption has skyrocketed across the corporate world. Still, few companies are deriving measurable value from it. According to a Boston Consulting Group survey this year of more than 1,250 global firms, only 5% of companies were seeing real returns on AI.

Investors have thrown $3.2 billion at startups in the legal field this year, according to a Business Insider analysis. Harvey alone has scarfed up nearly one in four of those dollars.

Harvey builds software for analyzing and drafting documents using legally-tuned large language models.

The startup has proven that lawyers want what it's selling. Over half of the hundred highest-grossing law firms in the United States have Harvey licenses. And the startup is quietly making inroads with some of the world's largest enterprises, including Walmart and Comcast.

Every organization is seeking to nail down the value of artificial intelligence, said Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive. Time savings, he said, are the "first horizon of measuring ROI."

"The average Harvey customer is saving considerable time by using Harvey regularly," Weinberg told Business Insider in an email. "Longer term, industry-wide, you'll want to see metrics on transformation, profits per partner for firms, and ultimately revenue metrics for in-house teams."

To prove it isn't just selling workplace satisfaction, Harvey recently hired legal-intelligence shop RSGI to run a study of 40 Harvey customers, from A&O Shearman and Paul Weiss to the legal departments of AT&T and National Grid.

Most respondents said Harvey paid off in months, not years, with lawyers churning through work faster. And most said they'd be "upset or disappointed" if the tool vanished. One person joked: "Take away my coffee before my Harvey license."

What eluded firms was a clear way to turn all that enthusiasm into hard metrics.

Only about a fifth of participants — six law firms and two in-house teams — said they had a formal way to track the return on their investment in Harvey tools. Most said they relied on adoption stats and anecdotal "power user" stories to track Harvey's usefulness.

When asked how they measured value, 83% cited internal adoption, 75% intensity of usage, and 58% time savings. Only 18% pointed to cost savings.

One participant shrugged off the question with: "How would you measure the value of Microsoft Word?"

Harvey's customers, at least, seem patient. A third of law firms surveyed said building a formal ROI framework was a lower priority than simply giving lawyers access to Harvey.

Harvey has clearly answered the question: "Do lawyers actually use this?" The open question is whether usage translates into higher profits or just nicer Tuesdays.

For the last century, Caterpillar's calling card has been its trademark macaroni-yellow backhoes and bulldozers. Increasingly, customers are interested in something else: the generators powering the artificial intelligence boom.

At hundreds of data center construction sites across the US, Caterpillar — alongside Cummins, Generac, and Rolls-Royce — supplies dozens of these machines. With some capable of powering more than 1,000 homes, generators ensure that AI models and cloud software can run without interruption.

These hulking devices, it turns out, are cash cows. While the surge in AI demand has fueled hundreds of billions of dollars in spending, much of that hasn't yet flowed to the usual suspects in Big Tech. Instead, it has ended up in the hands of builders, blue-collar laborers, and companies like Caterpillar and Cummins, which manufacture unsexy but crucial equipment.

Both companies have beaten the S&P 500 over the past year — and their stock prices have spiked even more than that of many major data-center customers, including Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Like the California Gold Rush's picks-and-shovels purveyors before them, industrial vendors are cashing in on the AI boom.

Plenty of non-tech companies have benefited from AI spending, including companies like Primoris and Dycom Industries that lay pipes and fiber that connect data centers to natural gas and the internet. Generator companies are particularly well-positioned: As hyperscalers race to build power-hungry data centers, the demand for backup and off-grid electricity has ballooned.

"Power generation is a business that has never seen this kind of scale, in any way, ever," Tom Shepherd, a data center executive at Cummins, told Business Insider.

About a decade ago, Shepherd oversaw a $50 million-a-year regional power-generation business in Oklahoma that largely sold Cummins systems to customers like hospitals and wastewater plants. He recalled just one large data center in his territory, run by Google.

"There just wasn't the scale," he said.

Today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, has more than two dozen data centers online or in development across the US. It has revised its planned capex spending for 2025 upwards every quarter, and now estimates that it will spend at least $91 billion by the end of the year. That's a fraction of the $7 trillion that will be spent on data centers globally by 2030, per McKinsey.

For manufacturing-oriented industrial businesses that have faced threats from tariffs, rising expenses, and persistently high interest rates, data center demand is a welcome bright spot. Business Insider previously used diesel generator air permits to estimate data center growth and found that if all permitted data centers went online, their electricity use could be as much as the entire state of Florida.

Sales of Cummins' signature truck engines have slipped over the past year, but the company sold $2.6 billion of power-generation equipment to the data-center industry last year and expects that number to grow by 30 to 35% this year, CEO Jennifer Rumsey said on a conference call last month.

The power-generation segment of Caterpillar — often shortened to Cat — grew from 8.4% of its total sales in 2021 to more than 14% of its sales in the first nine months of this year. And Rolls-Royce's power-systems unit reported record revenue in February, driven partly by 46% annual growth in data-center sales.

Their stock prices have also soared. Both hit all-time highs this week; Cat closed above $590 a share on Wednesday, topping the previous high set after beating earnings in October, and Cummins shares crossed $507 on Wednesday.

Analysts are generally bullish. According to information tracked by the companies, over the past year, the percentage of analysts who think investors should buy Cat's stock has grown from 41% to 54%; for Cummins, the share has gone from one-third to half.

Some indicators suggest the market took the picks-and-shovels trade too far. In October, Morgan Stanley estimated that Cat's power-generation arm was valued by investors at 60-to-100 times its operating income. At Nvidia, the same multiple was 25 times; at GE Verova, another electrical-equipment business, the multiple was 28 times.

Melissa Busen, who runs the electrical power division at Cat, says she's not worried. The company's $39.8 billion order backlog is almost triple what it was five years ago, and Busen said the largest customers are making plans for years down the road.

If one of them has hardships, she said, another will take its place. She noted that Cat has been supplying the data-center industry since the early 1990s and has "been able to build true partnerships" with the new crop of hyperscalers.

Cat broke ground last year on a $725 million expansion of its engine factory in Lafayette, Indiana, where it currently employs 1,900 people. The expansion will more than double the company's output of the engines that data-center developers are demanding, and is set to come online in 2027. Expansions are also underway at Rolls-Royce plants that build data-center generator parts in South Carolina and Minnesota.

Data center construction in Asia and Europe is also a component of demand, and many generators are manufactured outside the US. Cummins said earlier this year that it planned to invest $200 million across its power-generation manufacturing sites in India, England, and the US. The company plans to double the production capacity of the giant, 95-liter engines that drive data-center generators.

The money isn't just in backup generators that sit idle most of the time, either. In the race for power, utilities aren't able to connect companies to the electric grid fast enough. Increasingly, Cat and Cummins have been called on by Microsoft, Amazon, hyperscalers like Coreweave, and regional players like Joule for natural gas-burning generators and turbines that can run 24/7 for months or even years.

Cat's Busen said customers don't just want to talk about engines and turbines — they want to talk about "a complete, integrated solution" to their electrical needs, including things like batteries, inverters, and control systems.

The biggest limiting factor for now, said Shepherd, is "the physical ability of our society to build this kind of infrastructure."

The "Godfather of AI" thinks it's about time that Google caught up in the AI race.

"I think it's actually more surprising than it's taken this long for Google to overtake OpenAI," Geoffrey Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who previously worked at Google Brain, told Business Insider in a Tuesday interview.

Google is coming off the heels of its widely praised launch of Gemini 3, an update that some in tech said elevated the giant beyond OpenAI's GPT-5. Google's Nano Banana Pro AI image model has also proven to be a hit.

Three years after Google reportedly declared a "code red" after the release of ChatGPT, recent reports indicate it's now OpenAI that is sounding the alarm.

"I think that right now they're beginning to overtake it," Hinton said of Google's position relative to OpenAI.

On top of the successful launch of its latest AI model, shares of Google rose on reports that it might broker a billion-dollar deal to supply Meta with its own AI chips.

Making its own chips is a "big advantage" to Google, Hinton said.

"Google has a lot of very good researchers and obviously a lot of data and a lot of data centers," he said. "My guess is Google will win."

Hinton, who helped pioneer AI research during his time at Google Brain, said that the search giant was once at the forefront of AI but held back.

"Google was in the lead for a long time, right?" he said. "Google invented transformers. Google had big chatbots before other people."

Google was cautious, Hinton said, in the wake of Microsoft's disastrous 2016 launch of its short-lived "Tay" AI chatbot, which it took offline after it posted incredibly racist tweets.

"Google, obviously, had a very good reputation and was worried about damaging it like that," he said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai has previously said that the company held back on releasing its chatbot.

"We hadn't quite gotten it to a level where you could put it out and people would've been okay with Google putting out that product," Pichai said earlier this year. "It still had a lot of issues at that time."

In the past, the company has had some shaky rollouts. Just last year, Google had to pause its AI image generator after some users complained that results showing historically inaccurate images of people of color were too "woke." Its initial AI search overviews generated nonsensical advice, such as putting glue on pizza to prevent cheese from falling off.

Hinton spoke to Business Insider ahead of the announcement that Google was donating $10 million CAD to help establish the Hinton Chair in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Toronto. The university, where Hinton split his time while at Google, said it would match Google's gift.

Hinton left Google in 2023, citing concerns about AI's development. Since then, he has repeatedly spoken out about the risks that AI poses to society, ranging from the potential to outsmart humans to displacing jobs. In 2024, Hinton was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.

"Geoff's work on neural networks — spanning his time in academia and his decade here at Google — laid the foundation for modern AI," Google said in a statement. "This chair honors his legacy and will help the university recruit visionary scholars dedicated to the same kind of curiosity-driven, fundamental research that Geoff championed."

Investors anxious about an AI-driven stock market bubble are focusing on the wrong place, Goldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist said.

David Kostin said on the firm's "Exchanges" podcast published on Thursday that the bubble isn't in the soaring share prices of Nvidia and other publicly traded AI giants.

Instead, it's in the private-market frenzy happening far from Wall Street's daily price discipline.

"I believe in the private markets, the availability of capital, the price is probably unsustainable, which one could take as a synonym for a bubble," said Kostin, who is retiring at the end of the year after 31 years at the firm.

Drawing on legendary investor George Soros's theory that rising prices often attract more capital, Kostin said private AI valuations are feeding on growth expectations rather than fundamentals.

"As these firms are raising capital, the growth rate increases. As the growth rate increases, the valuation increases," Kostin said.

Kostin emphasized that reflexivity is just one issue. He pointed to another risk from "circular financing" or "vendor financing," in which growth depends on outside funding that may not hold up.

"At some point, the vendor doesn't necessarily have the same growth to be able to fund that growth," he said.

That dynamic stands in contrast to the public market, he said, where prices and earnings have moved in lockstep.

He cited the example of AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose share price has increased by 12-fold in the last three years — but its earnings have increased by 12-fold as well.

"So pretty much the price and the earnings have matched each other," he said.

Even broader valuation metrics don't appear to be in classic bubble territory.

The largest companies in the S&P 500 index — many of them AI-linked — trade around 30 times earnings. That is well below the 40 times peak of the largest 10 companies in 2021 and the 50 times multiples seen during the dot-com mania, he said.

Capital-raising trends tell a similar story.

The US has seen about 55 IPOs larger than $25 million this year — a fraction of the 280 in 2021 and nearly 400 in 1999.

"There is capital availability in the public markets, but not necessarily ebullient. It's there but not so dramatic," Kostin said.

Elon Musk says Tesla's Full Self-Driving software will enable users to glance at their phones in certain driving scenarios.

On Thursday, Musk said drivers can use their phones while driving with FSD activated "depending on context of surrounding traffic" after an X user asked if they're able to "text and drive on FSD v14.2."

The only issue: It's still pretty illegal to text and drive.

There are no state jurisdictions that have exceptions for cellphone use if an advanced driver-assistance system is activated. And many state laws are still playing catch-up to address the rise of autonomous cars.FSD is also not considered a fully autonomous system, according to standards set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Tesla attaches "Supervised" to the FSD name to emphasize that the technology requires the driver's full attention.

State law enforcement representatives from Arizona, New York, and Illinois confirmed to Business Insider that there are no exceptions for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and that texting and driving remain illegal. Arizona, New York, and Illinois are among the top 10 states with the highest number of EV registrations, according to data from the Department of Energy.

The only carve-out for cellphone use could be in cases of emergencies, or when a driver needs to dial 911, spokespeople for Illinois State Police and the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.

"In all other cases, texting and driving/talking (while holding a phone) is still illegal, along with using any other portable wireless communication device while driving," a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Public Safety wrote.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla, in recent weeks, released an update to its FSD Supervised software, which Musk previously said in July would see a "step change improvement" as the company integrates some of the "upgrades" seen in the Tesla Robotaxi fleet in Austin. The EV company is currently operating a pilot robotaxi service in the Texas capital with a safety monitor in the front passenger seat.

Tesla has an attention-monitoring system that alerts the driver to keep their eyes on the road whenever it detects they're not paying attention. The vehicle features a safety system that temporarily suspends FSD access if the driver consistently diverts their attention away from the road.

Some users have reported online their frustrations with the monitoring system.

In August, Musk said that FSD version 14 will "nag" the driver "much less" once the system's safety is confirmed.

Tesla also has faced legal challenges around its Autopilot and FSD systems.

In October, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into 2.9 million Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD due to reports of the system violating traffic rules, including "proceeding through red traffic signals and driving against the proper direction of travel on public roadways."

That hasn't stopped some users from putting their full trust in FSD and brushing off basic traffic rules.

Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff told Business Insider last month that he does emails while commuting to work in his Tesla Model Y and that he'd figured out exactly where to position his phone so he could use it without the car pinging him.

"The problem with that is you have to keep it pretty high on the wheel," he said. "So I would say about every other month or two, I get a ticket for being on the phone in the car."

Siminoff said he's talked his way out of some tickets, but that police officers can be skeptical when he says he's not the one driving. "You get a dirty look," he said.

Business Insider's Alistair Barr tested on Thursday whether the latest FSD software on his Tesla would allow him to use his phone while driving.

The vehicle sent two alerts, but the Tesla kept driving, Barr reported.

Most NFTs are admired, traded, and forgotten. Milk Mocha takes a different route by turning digital collectibles into access keys. These NFTs aren't just art; they unlock features, rewards, and experiences inside a rapidly growing ecosystem. From exclusive mini-games to early access to merchandise drops, ownership becomes an active experience instead of passive holding.

It's part of a larger economy powered by $HUGS tokens, aiming to appeal to users looking for emotional value and crypto with high ROI potential. By embedding utility, scarcity, and community governance into each NFT, Milk Mocha offers a blueprint for how digital ownership can feel meaningful, interactive, and rewarding.

The goal of Milk Mocha NFTs isn't just to sit in a wallet and look cute. Each one functions as an access pass. Holders can enter exclusive mini-games, join private in-game events, or unlock areas non-holders can't see. This transforms NFTs from pure collectibles into usable assets. Access to premium merchandise drops, limited digital items, and password-protected experiences is tied directly to NFT ownership. These privileges cannot be bought with traditional currency, only through verified NFT ownership using $HUGS tokens. This shift turns NFTs into participation tools. Instead of simply appreciating in value, they provide ongoing utility. For users exploring crypto with high ROI potential, utility-backed NFTs provide more stability than speculation alone. What Milk Mocha is building isn't an art gallery, it's a membership system where tokens equal access, and access equals value.

Milk Mocha adds a gaming twist to NFT ownership through its burn-to-upgrade system. This feature allows holders to burn $HUGS tokens to upgrade the rarity, traits, or visuals of their NFTs. Instead of relying on luck or blind minting, users can actively improve their digital assets. This mechanism introduces three important outcomes:

This system mirrors game mechanics people are already used to, leveling up, customizing, and earning status. At the same time, it supports a shrinking token supply, which long-term supporters will appreciate. While many projects issue NFTs and move on, Milk Mocha creates a continuous loop where users participate, upgrade, and reinvest within the ecosystem. It's a smart way to blend utility, scarcity, and personal choice into a single mechanism.

One of the strongest parts of the Milk Mocha ecosystem is the direct link between NFTs and the $HUGS token. You cannot buy these NFTs with fiat currency, only with $HUGS. This simple rule creates consistent demand every time someone wants to mint, upgrade, or trade. The system is built to reward active participants and limit passive speculation.



Key demand drivers include:

By linking utility to currency, the project ensures that NFTs aren't optional, they are essential to the user journey. Unlike standard collectibles, these assets fuel both engagement and token velocity. For holders focused on the future of Web3 economies rather than quick trends, this design creates an ecosystem where utility, ownership, and spending are all connected.

What makes Milk Mocha stand out is how the NFTs plug into wider community features rather than existing in isolation. Ownership gives access to governance through the Milk Mocha DAO, where holders can vote on new features, NFT themes, or merchandise lines. In addition, NFTs may unlock early access to charity initiatives, aligning with the brand's message of kindness. This mix of emotional branding and functional design builds user loyalty without forcing hype. There's also the bridge to physical products, certain plushies and collectibles are available only to NFT holders, turning digital ownership into real-world access. While it's not guaranteed to be a crypto with high ROI potential, the project builds real value through utility instead of speculation. Collectors aren't just buying tokens; they're buying influence, experiences, and interaction inside a growing digital world.

Milk Mocha treats NFTs as tools, not trophies. They unlock games, merchandise access, upgrades, and community control. Each utility is tied to $HUGS tokens, creating natural demand and token circulation. The burn-to-upgrade system adds progression and reduces supply over time. It doesn't rely on hype alone, but on practical features people can use and enjoy. While no project guarantees profit, these mechanics may appeal to those exploring digital assets beyond surface-level art. Instead of passive holding, Milk Mocha encourages active participation, creativity, and community decision-making, an approach that could influence how future NFT ecosystems function.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) — Famous-faced robo-dogs excreting NFT portraits offers a spectacle with a serious question beneath it: who controls the algorithms deciding what we see?

Michael Joseph Winkelmann, professionally known as the artist "Beeple," unveiled his newest interactive exhibit, "Regular Animals," to awestruck Art fans at Art Basel in Miami Beach on Wednesday. 

The Bizarre exhibit features hyper-realistic masks of Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and more on flesh colored robo-dog bodies that poop out pictures of the crowd in their respective aesthetics.

Elon Musk's robot pooped black and white photos, Zuckerberg's robot in a blue filter, Picasso in a pixelated "cubism," etc.

But the digital dumps are more than photos; they're Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that serve as free souvenirs for event goers, according to CNN. 

CNN spoke with Beeple in an exclusive interview where he revealed the meaning behind the viral art:

Beeple first hit the headlines during the surge of NFTs in 2021 when he broke records by selling a 5,000 photo collage for $69.3 million at Christie's.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto prices fell sharply again Friday, with Bitcoin diving below the $90,000 mark while Ethereum flirted with a drop below the $3,000 mark—all while crypto liquidations piled up across the board.

Bitcoin fell to $88,420 on Friday morning and was recently trading at $89,215, marking a more than 3% drop over the last 24 hours as the leading cryptocurrency dove from a price above the $92,000 level.

It's the second major plunge for Bitcoin over the last week, after the coin plummeted below the $85,000 mark on Monday before sharply rebounding the following day.

That continues a trend of Bitcoin being especially volatile in recent weeks, including diving to a seven-month low of about $81,000 in late November. That slump came following a new all-time high mark for Bitcoin of $126,080, set in early October. Bitcoin is now down almost 30% since setting that record.

As is often the case, other major altcoins are showing sharper losses on the day. Ethereum is down more than 4% to a recent price of $3,021, while XRP is down 4% to $2.03. Solana has dropped nearly 7% to $132, while Dogecoin is similarly down about 7% to a price below $0.14.

Liquidations over the last day have tallied more than $493 million, as of this writing, according to data from CoinGlass, after sitting right at the $500 million mark not long ago. Bitcoin leads the carnage with $191 million worth of liquidations, and the vast majority—$412 million worth—of the total liquidations were long positions, or bets that an asset's price will increase.

Why crypto prices are falling again isn't immediately obvious, particularly since major stock market indices are slightly green on the day, with the S&P 500 nearing another all-time high as traders increasingly expect a third interest rate cut for this year at next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

Crypto-centric stocks, however, are falling alongside digital assets, with Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) down 8% with others like Bitfarms (BITF) and Hive Digital (HIVE) both falling about 5% on the day. Coinbase (COIN) has fallen less than 1% on the day, with Strategy (MSTR) and Robinhood (HOOD) both showing roughly 3% drops.

The White House's freshly unveiled National Security Strategy reads less like a traditional diplomatic blueprint and more like a call for global fiscal expansion. For the crypto market, addicted to the idea of rapid-fire interest rate reductions in the U.S. and worldwide, this seems to be a cold shower nobody ordered.

The core of the strategy, signed by President Donald Trump, explicitly champions an "America First" agenda backed by significant economic and military reorientation both at home and abroad.

Consider the directives: the strategy mandates that NATO allies raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, a hefty increase from its long-standing mandate of 2%. Japan and South Korea are also expected to spend more.

"Given President Trump's insistence on increased burden-sharing from Japan and South Korea, we must urge these countries to increase defense spending, with a focus on the capabilities—including new capabilities—necessary to deter adversaries and protect the First Island Chain," the strategy says.

It adds further, "We will also harden and strengthen our military presence in the Western Pacific, while in our dealings with Taiwan and Australia we maintain our determined rhetoric on increased defense spending."

The document explicitly calls on U.S. allies to spend far more of their national gross domestic product on their own defense, and on greater American military investment in the Indo-Pacific to strengthen vigilance in that region.

Funding this kind of monumental expenditure inevitably means more government borrowing or bond supply worldwide, which would drive up bond yields, the cost of capital, and inflation, making it harder for central banks to cut rates. In fact, rate cuts may have little impact as increasing bond supply will likely keep yields elevated. 

Moreover, increased borrowing by many of the already heavily indebted advanced nations could raise fiscal crisis risks.

If that's not enough, the strategy explicitly states that the "era of mass migration is over." It means that the U.S. may not import cheap labour at a pace seen in earlier years, which could make wages sticky, adding to inflation.

All this looks like a bullish tailwind for assets seen as inflation hedges and safe havens, such as gold. Bitcoin BTC$89,477.51 is also pitched as “digital gold” by its proponents but has failed to live up to the hype this year.

Gold has surged 60% this year despite the U.S. 10-year yield staying stubbornly above 4%, while BTC is now down nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. Only time will tell if it evolves into digital gold in a world increasingly fiscally emboldened.

The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points next week, pushing the benchmark rate down to 3.5%. But with the security strategy calling for global expansion, the odds of steep rate cuts appear bleak.

The world of crypto moves fast and right now, ethereum rsi now is a phrase you'll see tossed around a lot. Traders and analysts are watching the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Ethereum (ETH) closely. 

This simple tool could hint at whether Ethereum is about to bounce back, or if it might dip further. In this article, we'll walk you through what the charts suggest for ETH's future in plain, easy‑to‑understand language.

 

The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, is a tool that measures how fast and how far a price has moved.

 

 

When RSI is high (often above 70), it can mean Ethereum may be “overbought”meaning many have bought recently and a price drop is possible.

 

 

When RSI is low (often below 30), it can mean Ethereum is “oversold” meaning many sold recently and a rebound might be coming.

 

 

Using these signals helps traders guess when ETH might bounce or fall.

 

Recently, Ethereum's RSI dropped sharply, with some charts showing “oversold” signals for the first time in a while.

 

 

In past cycles, similar low‑RSI readings preceded strong rebounds. For example, when ETH got deeply oversold earlier in 2025, it eventually bounced hard.

Some analysts now suggest that ETH's low RSI could mean the worst of the recent drop is behind us or at least a relief bounce could be nearing.

 

 

This is why “ethereum rsi now” is trending.

 

In April 2025, ETH's RSI had dipped to a low point; soon after, the coin rallied significantly. 

 

 

Historically, when Ethereum's RSI dropped below oversold levels, that often marked a bottom — at least in the short term. Traders use those moments to enter new positions.

 

 

But it's not always smooth: after oversold conditions, Ethereum can bounce, but the rebound might stall if broader market conditions stay weak.

 

 

So while low RSI often signals opportunity, it doesn't guarantee smooth sailing upward.

 

Many traders seem to be watching ETH carefully after recent dips. Some expect a bounce if support levels hold.

 

 

Others remain cautious. If Ethereum fails to hold key support zones, price could dip further regardless of RSI.

 

 

This split between cautious optimism and risk‑awareness reflects just how fragile momentum can be right now.

 

 

In short: momentum is wavering. RSI suggests possible recovery — but nothing is certain yet.

 

Why RSI Alone Isn't Enough Look at the Bigger Picture

RSI doesn't factor in big news, economic events, or external shocks.

 

 

Ethereum's price also depends on broader market sentiment, overall crypto demand, and interest from large investors.

 

 

Sometimes, RSI may show oversold yet price still drops if external conditions worsen.

 

 

That's why many analysts combine RSI with other tools support/resistance levels, moving averages, and on‑chain data to form a fuller picture.

 

Some experts point to a support range around certain levels (e.g. a zone near a major moving average or “Fibonacci retracement”) as critical for a rebound.

 

 

If ETH bounces from those zones while RSI stays low or recovers, that could signal a strong rebound.

 

 

On the flip side, if support fails, look out: price corrections could resume despite bullish RSI signals.

 

 

In short: RSI gives a hint but support/resistance zones might decide the real outcome.

 

Here are a few paths ETH might take depending on how things play out:

Bounce + Rally: RSI stays low, support holds, and price climbs back toward recent highs.

 

 

Sideways Action: RSI improves a little, but weak volume or market hesitation causes a period of consolidation.

 

 

Further Drop: Support fails, external pressures mount, and price dips further — RSI could stay low or even drop again.

 

 

Which scenario plays out depends on many factors not just RSI.

 

If you're a trader looking for short‑term gains, a low RSI and support near a strong zone might look like a buying opportunity.

 

 

If you're a long‑term investor, oversold conditions might offer a chance to accumulate but stay aware of volatility.

 

 

In both cases, don't rely only on RSI. Use it as one tool among several to make informed decisions.

 

 

 

With current chart signals showing low RSI, many feel ETH could be near a turning point. Others remain wary and that split is exactly what makes this moment interesting.

 

Ethereum's recent RSI behavior shows a market at a crossroads. The “ethereum rsi now” condition suggests we could be nearing a bottom, but nothing is certain.

Watch for support zones, broader market signals, and trading volume. If things line up oversold RSI, stable support levels, and renewed interest ETH might rebound.

One thing that confuses many brokers today is how visible WikiFX is on Google. No matter how many times people report inaccuracies, outdated information, or misleading ratings, the platform continues to appear on the first pages of search results. The reason is simple, but the effect it creates is much bigger than expected: WikiFX lists itself as a “review site,” and under Google's policies, review sites fall under permissible content. As long as the page doesn't contain hate speech, illegal content, or explicit harm, Google usually won't remove it.

The two largest publicly traded companies holding bitcoin, Strategy (MSTR) and MARA Holdings (MARA), have each fallen roughly 40% over the past six weeks.

CoinDesk Research has extensively covered the MSTR correction, but MARA, which is down 55% year over year, is also attracting attention as some investors view it as inexpensive at current levels. 

Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, argues that the perception of MARA as cheap is not supported by the data. Sigel argues that the company is actually trading at a premium to it's bitcoin holdings and not a discount.

Sigel highlights MARA's $3.3 billion in outstanding convertible debt relative to its $4.9 billion in bitcoin holdings. Adjusting for the convertible debt leaves just $1.6 billion of net bitcoin value before accounting for any additional liabilities that the mining business incurs. 

That compares with a $4.7 billion equity market cap, which Sigel implies that MARA is in fact trading at a premium once debt is included, rather than at a discount to its bitcoin holdings.

Sigel also addresses MARA's high short interest, which currently stands at 27%. After adjusting for delta hedging related to the company's convertible notes, Sigel estimates that true short interest falls to about 15%, a reduction of 44%. Sigel contrasts this with MSTR, which has more than $8 billion of convertible debt, compared to a $53 billion market cap. 

Once hedge related shorts are removed, MSTR's short interest declines by only 31%, or by roughly 9 million shares. Sigel characterizes MARA's short interest as more structural, compared with MSTR's which he frames as more fundamentals driven.

Sigel argues that over half of MARA's equity volatility stems from its capital structure and financing dynamics rather than from pure bitcoin beta. He concludes that MSTR offers a much cleaner bitcoin duration exposure, while MARA's mining equity performance is dominated by what he describes as a problematic capital structure.

Bitcoin Market Overview

Bitcoin experienced a modest pullback yesterday but continues to hold critical support, remaining inside the daily TBO Cloud in a bullish consolidation mode. Key indicators such as daily RSI are trending higher despite muted volume and weak OBV, suggesting momentum is building for an upside continuation.

The next resistance test is $94,300, aligned with the fan line. A decisive break above this level would target the top of the parallel channel, forming the bear flag's upper boundary, though it may also invite another pullback. Low weekend trading volumes and potential CME gaps warrant caution.

Ethereum Momentum and Altcoin Sentiment

Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, piercing overhead resistance on consecutive sessions and positioning for a short-term target of $3,435 from the October 10 low. While volume remains below its moving average, on-balance volume holds above its MA, and Ethereum rests within the bullish consolidation of the daily TBO Cloud.

Notably, the ETH/BTC ratio continues its ascent, historically a precursor to broader altcoin rallies. Combined stablecoin dominance briefly closed above its daily TBO Cloud but is poised to drop back inside, a bullish sign for altcoins that may be confirmed with a TBO Close Long on the stablecoin dominance chart.



Market Dominance Trends

Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) remains macro bearish as indicated by the TBO Slow line, with expectations for a decline toward 57% and below. When both stablecoin and Bitcoin dominance fall in tandem, historical patterns favor altcoin strength.

Ethereum dominance (ETH.D) triggered a TBO Close Short this week, marking a shift of market share toward Ethereum, while the 'Others' dominance index (OTHERS.D) is forming a second TBT Bullish Divergence on today's candle, suggesting smaller altcoins may follow Ethereum's lead.

Traditional Finance and Macro Indicators

The U.S. dollar index remains unchanged for now, but USD/JPY appears set to decline further, which could pressure the Bank of Japan into intervention. S&P 500 futures display thin volume and a cautious advance above short-term resistance, though the VIX confirmed a TBO Open Short and fell to 15.79, indicating reduced market fear.

The Nikkei 225 is testing highs near 50,390 on subdued volume, trading above the daily TBO Cloud with rising RSI—signs of strength yet potential exhaustion at current levels.

Commodities Outlook

Gold remains relatively flat around $4,200, exhibiting muted volatility. Silver is showing signs of a near-term pullback, confirmed by a TBT Bearish Divergence on the 4-hour chart.

Altcoin Trading Opportunities

Traders should monitor altcoins that have entered the daily TBO Cloud, indicating bullish consolidation. TRX and LINK have recently re-entered their clouds, while SOL's bear flag offers a short-selling setup. ZEC is targeting its TBO Fast line near 450, and FARTCOIN presents a bullish consolidation entry at its daily fast line with supportive volume and OBV.

Additionally, COAI is printing a second TBO Close Short on the 4-hour timeframe, signaling a potential bullish reversal. DASH has formed a cluster of TBT Bullish Divergences on the 4-hour chart, aiming for overhead resistance near 57, and ZORA is developing a daily TBT Bullish Divergence cluster to watch.

Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib announced that Pakistan is set to launch its first “stablecoin” as part of its drive to make virtual assets a part of the economy.

The PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes.

A stablecoin, according to Bloomberg, is a digital token whose value is intrinsically linked to a physical currency, such as the US dollar, making it more stable than other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.­

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, the crypto czar said that Pakistan will “definitely launch” a stablecoin, adding that the country is working on both that and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

“I think it is a great way to collateralise the government debt,” Saqib said. “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening. Why should we be at the tail-end of it when we have the muscle and the adoption?”

The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) said that Saqib also participated in a panel discussion on the future of virtual assets and emerging-market regulation, according to a post on their X account.

“He emphasised that for countries like Pakistan, clear and innovation-friendly crypto regulation is a key driver of economic growth,” the post read. “Pakistan's work on stablecoins, data frameworks, and banking the unbanked can become valuable case studies for the world.”

Earlier this year, Saqib unveiled the country's first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.

In May, the government announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin is starting December on weaker footing as risk assets wobble and the year-end rally narrative gives way to a market working through heavy volatility. BTC has fallen into the mid-$80,000s after trading above $125,000 in early October, leaving the token roughly 30% off the highs and giving back a large portion of its 2025 outperformance.

The tone has shifted from momentum to repair as traders reassess positioning, ETF flows, and macro pressure.

Against that backdrop, we ran Bitcoin through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT.

The model generated a thirty-day outlook based on recent trading action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, Bitcoin traded at $85,068. For the period from Dec. 1 through Dec. 31, the model's base-case projection came out to:

Average predicted price: $79,000

Implied move: about 7.13% lower

Signal snapshot: MACD negative, RSI deeply oversold

The forecast points to further near-term pressure as Bitcoin trades in an oversold but fragile setup. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Bitcoin could reach $864,564.53 by 2030.

For investors looking to position around that kind of long-term outlook, Coinbase offers a straightforward way to trade Bitcoin. New users can earn up to $400 in rewards by completing short educational lessons and making their first qualifying trade.

MACD remains well below its signal line, showing persistent downside momentum. RSI in the low-20s highlights an oversold condition that can precede bounces but also signals continued vulnerability if selling persists. The model reads the tape as tilted lower with elevated volatility.

Bitcoin's drop is tied more to macro stress than to a crypto-specific shock. ETF flows have cooled after a strong first half. Spot bitcoin ETFs that had served as a steady structural bid are now seeing more mixed, inconsistent flows, reducing one of the core supports that helped BTC clear $100,000 earlier in the year.

Technically, BTC sits in a fragile zone. Support sits in the low- to mid-$80,000s, with the risk of a retest toward $80,000 if buyers do not step in. Some chart and on-chain work points to potential extensions into the high-$60,000s if the current phase deepens. A reclaim of the $94,000–$97,000 band would be needed to shift the narrative back toward trend resumption.

Strategists and bulls have tempered expectations. Even long-time optimists who once projected $250,000 have pulled those targets back toward levels above $100,000, signaling confidence in the long-term story but recognition of near-term damage.

Wall Street remains divided. Macro bears focus on ETF outflows and ongoing exchange inflows from large holders, while more constructive traders frame it as high-volatility consolidation after a run from below $40,000.

Viewed against these fundamentals, a forecast calling for a 7.13% decline over the next month aligns with a market struggling to stabilize. The model reflects continued pressure, thin liquidity, and an environment driven more by macro and flows than by crypto-specific catalysts.

For now, the setup suggests a wide range with downside risk, and any recovery toward $100,000 will require a clear turn in ETF flows and broader risk sentiment rather than a crypto-only spark.

Beeple Made Robot Dogs With Musk, Zuckerberg, and Warhol Heads That Poop NFTs

NFTs

Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, has brought NFTs back on the scene at Art Basel with a pack of robot quadrupeds that snap photos of visitors and poop printed artworks that double as crypto collectibles.

The interactive installation, titled “Regular Animals,” is on show through December 7 at the Miami Beach Convention Center as part of Art Basel's program for new digital works, Zero 10.

Each four-legged robot carries a sculpted silicone head based on figures from the worlds of art and tech, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, and Beeple himself.

The robots roam the floor, their cameras capturing scenes from the fair, which are processed into stylized prints tied to the identity on each mask.

Project materials indicate that some of those images contain codes that allow visitors to claim NFTs, linking the physical print to a token on a blockchain. A Luma event description indicates that “1024 free prints and 256 free NFTs” were distributed on Wednesday.

“We're increasingly seeing the world through the lens of how they would like us to see it, because they control these very powerful algorithms, and they have unilateral control over how we see the world in many ways,” Beeple said in a video interview with CNN.

The robots will “only take pictures and develop these memories, and the memories will be logged on a certain blockchain, because I think that's a great use for this technology,” he added.

The robots use a commercial quadruped platform fitted with sensors, cameras, and a compact dye-sublimation printer that produces the images seen on the fair floor, with each unit modified with a hand-sculpted platinum-cure silicone head, according to a technical description from art magazine Whitewall.

“This is AI reinterpreting the images and what the humanoid is seeing. There is an analogy; we're increasingly going to view the world through AI,” Beeple said in an interview with The Art Newspaper.

Artists and tech leaders, like those represented in the robot dogs' heads, continue to “shape what we see, probably more than anybody else,” he added.

Each robot was priced at $100,000, except the one with Bezos for its head, which wasn't for sale at the VIP preview on Wednesday, when all pieces sold out.

Print photos produced by the robot dogs contain a disclaimer describing the artwork as having been “tested and verified as 100% pure GMO-free, organic dogshit originating from a medium adult dog anus.”

Decrypt has reached out to Beeple Studios and Art Basel for comment.

Beeple's latest work arrives more than four years since his record-breaking 2021 sale of “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” a 5,000-image digital collage whose NFT went for a whopping $69.3 million at Christie's.

That auction placed Beeple among the most expensive living artists and helped propel NFTs into the center of a global market boom.

"I'm interested in crazy art projects that I just couldn't do before, but now I can,” Beeple told Decrypt in a June 2021 podcast, when asked about how he plans to spend the money.

The frenzy for NFTs had largely cooled by mid-2022, with volumes and prices falling across most segments. By early 2023, there was still some traction.

“It's crazy to me to think about those times, because NFTs have been hated for so much longer than they were loved,” Beeple said in an October 2024 interview.

By July this year, industry analytics showed that NFT sales have surged 78%, largely due to lower floor prices, although to the detriment of overall trading volume, which took a 45% quarterly plunge.

Bitcoin's latest slide is closely tied to the powerful moves taking place in currency and bond markets. The US dollar has been on a strong upward trend, rising against most major currencies. A stronger dollar tends to pressure assets priced in dollars, and crypto is no exception. When the dollar appreciates, global buyers effectively face a higher cost of entering the market, which reduces demand during already fragile periods.

At the same time, yields on government bonds have been pushing higher. Rising yields signal tighter financial conditions and increase the appeal of safer, income-generating assets. Analysts from QuantExperts Group note that this shift raises the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin.

Higher yields also influence funding costs for leveraged traders, which can trigger forced unwinds during sharp market movements. These combined pressures (rising yields and a firming dollar) form the core macro backdrop behind Bitcoin's current weakness.

Another important factor weighing on Bitcoin has been the broader retreat from risk. Large technology companies, often viewed as bellwethers for investor sentiment, have been under pressure due to slower revenue forecasts, regulatory concerns and ongoing valuation adjustments. Since Bitcoin has become increasingly correlated with these mega-cap tech names, stress in the tech sector tends to spill quickly into crypto markets.

When investors grow cautious, they typically reduce exposure to high-beta assets first. As specialists at QuantExperts Group explain, this behavior creates synchronized selling across tech and crypto, reinforcing downward momentum in both areas. The overall tone has shifted from speculative enthusiasm to a more defensive mindset, and Bitcoin's price action has reflected this shift almost immediately.

Beyond the macro backdrop, day-to-day market mechanics have amplified the declines. Rising bond yields increase the cost of maintaining leveraged positions, leading some traders to reduce exposure earlier than they normally would. During periods of fast-moving deleveraging, liquidity can thin out across major exchanges. Even modest orders can produce outsized price reactions when order books are shallow.

Analysts at QuantExperts Group point out that these structural factors often surface during macro-driven sell-offs. As market makers widen spreads and adjust inventory, short-term volatility can rise sharply. This creates the appearance of exaggerated price swings, even when there is no new fundamental information hitting the market.

The next phase for Bitcoin will depend heavily on whether current macro trends continue. If the US dollar remains strong and government bond yields keep rising, Bitcoin may face ongoing challenges. However, if yields stabilize or the dollar begins to soften, the pressure on crypto could ease, giving the market room to consolidate.

The performance of major tech companies will also play a role. Renewed weakness there could pull Bitcoin lower through correlated risk reduction, while signs of stabilization might help crypto prices find a firmer footing. For now, traders are watching currency moves, bond markets and tech-sector sentiment as key indicators of where Bitcoin might head next.

India is seeing one of the fastest-growing engagements with crypto and Web3 technologies across emerging markets. Tens of millions of Indians, in particular young professionals, developers, and freelancers, seek to understand better the use cases of decentralized platforms, blockchain networks, NFTs, and Web3 applications. This is driven by a population that is digitally confident, very well-connected, and accustomed to using online financial tools.

India's crypto adoption is not a fad; it's an outcome brought about by strong digital literacy, relatively cheap internet access, smartphone penetration, and an innovative ecosystem supportive of learning, experimentation, and entrepreneurship. This paper looks at drivers for this growth, the role of the tech-savvy, and the broader implications this has for India's Web3 landscape.

India has one of the youngest populations in the world, considering it holds more than 65% of those below 35 years of age. This demography has grown with smartphones, online gaming, social media, and fintech platforms, thus becoming naturally comfortable with new digital innovations.

Why Young Indians are Rapidly Adopting Web3:

Familiarity with mobile apps and online payments

Ethereum traders are positioning with more optimism than their Bitcoin counterparts, options data shows.

Despite a broadly cautious investor stance, the divergence suggests that traders see less immediate downside risk for the second-largest crypto by market cap than for Bitcoin.

That outlook aligns with recent spot price performance.

Ethereum is trading just above $3,100, down around 2% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Its year-to-date performance of -3% is slightly better than Bitcoin's -6%, though both assets have declined by double-digits since October, with Ethereum down 19% and Bitcoin down 25%.

For longer-dated options, Ethereum's 90-day skew sits at -1.7%, which is "noticeably more bullish" than Bitcoin's -4%, Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain options platform Derive, told Decrypt. "In other words, traders are more eager to buy insurance for Bitcoin than for Ethereum."

The negative skew for both assets shows a continued greater appetite for protective put options than for bullish calls. However, the depth of that bearishness is where they diverge.

Despite a recent recovery fueled by dovish Federal Reserve sentiment, the market is "very far from the bullish sentiment we saw at the start of Q4," Dawson said. He advises caution in the weeks ahead.

Signals point to a tentative thaw in bearishness for Ethereum specifically.

"We are seeing signs of reduced bearishness in Ethereum options markets, though derivatives traders are still falling short of pricing in a complete 'Santa rally'," Thahbib Rahman, research analyst at crypto research platform Block Scholes, told Decrypt.

The put-call skew for short-dated Ethereum contracts briefly turned positive recently, marking the most bullish positioning since late October, Rahman highlighted. Furthermore, the firm's proprietary BlockScholes Risk-Appetite Index for Ethereum appears to be bottoming, a pattern that has historically preceded sentiment turnarounds.

Rahman drew parallels to the market structure in May 2025, which preceded a significant rally.

"Back then, the rally began on the back of a more positive macro environment, the Pectra upgrade was launched, and in the following weeks, Ethereum spot ETFs had their best run of inflows," Rahman said.

Similar catalysts are in play now, he noted: markets are pricing in a potential December Fed rate cut, Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade went live to improve layer-2 efficiency, and entities like BitMine have made major ETH purchases. The missing component, he said, is a sustained wave of inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs, which would be needed to fuel a more decisive bullish move.

The technical positioning, noted in options market data, underscores a market that, while not expecting a major rally, is cautiously downgrading the probability of an Ethereum-specific downturn.

The perspective from retail prediction markets, however, contrasts with the cautious skew in professional options. Users on Myriad, owned by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan, give Bitcoin a 75% chance of reaching $100,000 before $69,000, a notably more bullish outlook than the 49% chance they assign Ethereum hitting $4,000 before $2,500.

Online magazine about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi, GameFi and other blockchain technologies

December 5, 2025 By Crypto Reporter PR 

The crypto presale landscape continues to evolve as Mono Protocol gains attention for its approach to cross-chain simplicity and unified balances. Interest across the presale crypto space is rising, especially among users tracking top presale crypto projects in the growing blockchain ecosystem.



Many are exploring how Mono fits into the next potential big presale crypto category, particularly as real utility becomes a key focus across cryptocurrency presales and web3 adoption.

Mono Protocol continues to attract interest across crypto presale projects as it introduces chain-abstraction and unified balances for smoother activity across blockchain environments. With $3.75M raised so far, the presale ICO stage has moved into Stage 19 with a current price of $0.0550.

The design focuses on removing friction within DeFi by offering a single per-token balance across networks. Users tracking the best presale crypto 2025 opportunities are observing how this approach simplifies real usage.

The projected token launch price is $0.500, which reflects an estimated ~809% potential profit based on the current stage. As the ecosystem expands, Mono continues positioning itself within the top presale crypto discussions for its focus on practical improvements across web3.

The Rewards Hub serves as the main center where users complete social quests, referral actions, and presale tasks. It plays a meaningful role in the new crypto presale experience by creating a simple path to earn promo codes and redeem them for bonus MONO during the presale.

Users connect their wallet, complete quests, and receive promo codes that unlock additional rewards. Each step is designed to make participation straightforward without adding unnecessary barriers.

This structure supports higher engagement across crypto presales and helps users track their activity easily. As more people explore the crypto presale list for emerging opportunities, the Rewards Hub stands out for its clear workflow and accessible setup.

Mono Protocol focuses on improving transaction flow across blockchain networks by offering faster, cheaper, and more reliable execution. Its chain-abstracted system allows compatibility with all networks, tokens, and transaction types, which reduces friction often seen in DeFi.

A single Mono Balance per token across networks removes the complication of managing funds in multiple places. This level of simplicity aligns with what many users expect from the next potential big presale crypto.

Security receives strong attention as well. Mono Protocol has officially passed its smart contract audit by CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm.

The audit supports confidence in the presale ICO stage and strengthens its placement among trusted crypto presale projects within web3.

MONO plays a central role across the system by covering universal gas payments and protocol fees used for quoting, routing, and Resource Lock functions. This structure improves predictability and helps users navigate multi-chain actions without confusion.

Network operators, including bundlers, observability nodes, and orchestrators, stake MONO to secure the network and earn a share of protocol fees. Staking introduces an additional layer of protection that aligns with blockchain standards for decentralized security.

Routers and solvers also lock MONO as execution bonds to support instant settlement under the Resource Locks model. This ensures dependable performance while maintaining transparent accountability across the network.

These features contribute to Mono's growing presence across cryptocurrency presales and highlight how presale crypto platforms are evolving to support long-term DeFi use cases.

Mono Protocol continues to gain steady attention across the crypto presale market by focusing on real utility, cross-chain reliability, and streamlined balances. Its approach reflects the broader direction of blockchain adoption, where simplicity and practical features matter most. With ongoing development and clear use cases, Mono remains a notable entry on the crypto presale list as users watch the next steps of its roadmap unfold.

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) released a shareholder letter updating its proposed business combination with BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure. The Registration Statement on Form S-4 was filed on Dec 1, 2025 and the transaction is expected to close in Q1 2026, subject to shareholder and NYSE American approvals.

The deal converts Signing Day stock into ~8.5% of the combined company (~$20.0M) and BlockchAIn equity into ~91.5% (~$215.0M), plus an 11.628% earnout if BlockchAIn achieves EBITDA of $25M in 2026. A November 2025 fairness opinion implied an enterprise value midpoint of $646.0M for BlockchAIn (up from a May 2025 midpoint of $329.3M).

BlockchAIn operates a 40 MW South Carolina data center (2024 revenue ~$22.9M, net income ~$5.7M) and plans a 150 MW Texas campus with 34.5kV interconnect for activation in 2027.

SGN is up 6.78% while peers are mixed: ELWS -0.28%, IDAI +2.97%, FTFT +4.58%, SOPA +4.17%, MASK flat. This points to a stock-specific reaction rather than a broad sector move.

Recent news and earnings—often positive or strategic in tone—have been followed by negative 24-hour price reactions, indicating a pattern of selling into news.

Over the last few months, SGN has repeatedly highlighted its proposed business combination with One Blockchain/BlockchAIn and modest operating progress. Updates on the data-center strategy and S-4 filing on Dec 1, 2025 and earlier deal milestones in October 2025 all saw negative next-day moves, as did Q2 and Q3 2025 earnings. Today's AI/HPC-focused shareholder letter continues this strategic narrative against a backdrop of prior sell-the-news reactions.

An effective S-3 shelf dated Aug 29, 2025 registers up to 1,297,322 shares with modeled proceeds between $1.62M and $2.59M. Although not yet effective, this structure allows SGN to raise equity capital relatively quickly once usable, which could support operations or the combination but would be dilutive to existing holders if fully utilized.


    This announcement highlights SGN's proposed combination with a historically profitable AI/HPC data-center platform and clarifies that SGN holders would own about 8.5% of a business valued near the latest $646.0M midpoint fairness estimate. Investors may track progress of the S-4 process, shareholder approvals, and execution on the 40 MW South Carolina and planned 150 MW Texas sites. Attention to SGN's separate liquidity options under its S-3 shelf and ongoing operating performance remains important.

SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Dec.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Signing Day Sports, Inc. (“Signing Day Sports” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGN) today announced the release of a shareholder letter from its Chairman and CEO, Daniel Nelson.

The shareholder letter provides an update on Company management's perspective of the Company's proposed business combination with BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc. (“BlockchAIn Inc.”) and its affiliate, One Blockchain LLC (“BlockchAIn LLC” and together with BlockchAIn Inc., “BlockchAIn”). As previously announced, Signing Day Sports entered into a Business Combination Agreement with BlockchAIn and certain other affiliates of BlockchAIn on May 27, 2025, as amended on November 10, 2025 (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”).

Under the Business Combination Agreement, upon the closing of the business combination, the common stock of Signing Day Sports held by the stockholders of Signing Day Sports immediately before the closing of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive approximately 8.5% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company, a value of approximately $20.0 million, and the equity securities of BlockchAIn LLC held by BlockchAIn LLC's equity securityholders immediately before the closing of the transaction will be converted into the right to receive approximately 91.5% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company before consideration to third parties, a value of approximately $215.0 million.  BlockchAIn LLC's securityholders at closing will be eligible for an earnout equal to an additional 11.628% of the total shares of the combined company before consideration to third parties, if BlockchAIn Inc. achieves or exceeds net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $25 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026.

On December 1, 2025, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”) was publicly filed by BlockchAIn Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Additional information regarding the proposed business combination can be found in the Registration Statement.

Transaction Timing Update

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, the approval of Signing Day Sports shareholders and approval of the listing of the common shares of BlockchAIn Inc. by the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”). 

Letter to Shareholders

As we work toward completing our proposed business combination with BlockchAIn, I want to provide an update on why we believe it positions our shareholders for significant long-term value creation.

Fairness Opinions and Material Valuation Increase

The Signing Day Sports Board reviewed two fairness opinions that were delivered to the Board by Newbridge Securities Corporation.  The most recent fairness opinion, delivered in November 2025, assessed BlockchAIn using updated 2026 revenue projections and comparable company data. This fairness opinion concluded there was an implied enterprise value range of $515.3 million to $776.7 million, with a midpoint of $646.0 million.

The initial fairness opinion, which was delivered in May 2025 prior to the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, assessed BlockchAIn using 2025 revenue projections and comparable companies. This analysis produced an implied enterprise-value range of $280.0 million to $378.7 million, with a midpoint of $329.3 million.

The consideration to be received by the Signing Day Sports stockholders in the proposed transaction remains unchanged even though there has been a significant  increase in valuation for BlockchAIn indicated by the second fairness opinion.

The foregoing valuations are subject to certain limitations, assumptions, and qualifications. You should review the description of such matters, other related disclosures, and the full text of each of the fairness opinions, which are included in the Registration Statement.

AI-Ready Data-Center Infrastructure 

BlockchAIn's value proposition is grounded in its plans to expand its portfolio of high-density compute assets designed for AI applications, bitcoin mining, and potentially other high-performance computing (HPC) applications. BlockchAIn is currently a company with a track record of revenue and profitability that is poised for growth within the HPC and AI-related digital infrastructure markets.

The market for digital infrastructure—including crypto mining, HPC, and AI-related computing—is evolving rapidly as demand for energy-efficient processing power continues to grow. Amid increasing sustainability standards and renewed emphasis on domestic infrastructure, BlockchAIn is positioned to pursue opportunities across a wide range of compute-intensive applications.

Key infrastructure assets include a 40 MW high-density data center in South Carolina, one of the most extensive crypto-mining facilities in the state, and a planned 150 MW data center campus in Texas with favorable economics with 34.5kV of interconnectivity to the grid for activation in 2027. The Texas facility can be modularly built providing flexibility for crypto mining and/or AI and HPC data hosting activities. This capital-efficient and flexible modular business model will provide BlockchAIn with optionality to pursue different revenue mixes. To support the Texas buildout, BlockchAIn LLC also formed Blockchain Nolan LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary is expected to facilitate the development of new data center infrastructure.

Strategic Synergies with Signing Day Sports

The combination may also create meaningful strategic benefits for Signing Day Sports, including to support the launch of new Signing Day Sports platform features, while also enabling potential new revenue streams through third-party data hosting services in adjacent sports technology and education markets. This support would promote Signing Day Sports' strategy to build a comprehensive sports data ecosystem and drive long-term enterprise value.  Signing Day Sports will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary following completion of the transaction, enabling the Company to preserve its mission and brand while benefiting from the combined business's infrastructure, scale, and cash flow profile.

Positioned for Long-Term Value Creation

In light of all of the above, the Signing Day Sports Board believes the proposed business combination offers shareholders access to a historically profitable, scalable AI and HPC data-center platform under favorable terms. The combined company will be larger, more diversified, and better positioned to compete in high-growth technology markets, while maintaining support for student-athletes and college programs. We view this as a compelling opportunity for shareholders to gain exposure at an attractive entry point into the HPC and AI infrastructure sectors.

Thank you for your continued support as we advance this transformative transaction.

Sincerely,

Daniel NelsonChief Executive Officer and ChairmanSigning Day Sports, Inc.

Home > CryptoCurrency News > China Issues $600M in On-Chain Digital Yuan Bonds, Signaling Blockchain Shift

TL;DR

Huaxia Bank has just set a precedent in the trend of financial technology and digital currency. The Chinese entity completed one of the country's first CBDC blockchain bond issuances, distributing commercial bonds valued at over $637 million to customers who paid exclusively with the digital yuan (e-CNY), China's central bank digital currency (CBDC).



The operation was executed through its commercial shipping subsidiary, Huaxia Financial Leasing. They reported that the entire issuance process was recorded in real-time on the blockchain network. This mechanism not only ensures the immutability of all transactions but also allows investors to verify relevant information at any time.

The Chinese bank maintains that, with this technology, the use of blockchain and the digital yuan in this bond placement will eliminate the need for traditional intermediaries. This step could simplify the cost structure and accelerate the path for more Chinese companies to launch loans and financial products powered by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).











The bonds, described as a “national-first” move by the entity, are scheduled to mature in three years and offer an annual yield (coupon rate) of 1.84%. Huaxia Bank's CBDC blockchain bond issuance helped to revolutionize its book-building operations, the process used to gauge investor demand.

The bank initially expected to raise a minimum of $425 million, with an additional $212 million reserved in case of oversubscription. Ultimately, investor appetite proved so high that the entity was compelled to issue all of the bonds.

It is worth noting that, unlike many CBDCs under development, the digital yuan itself does not use blockchain technology. However, its integration into this distributed ledger platform underscores China's willingness to experiment with new forms of financing.

The digital yuan pilot program, which began in April 2021, has already achieved cumulative transactions of $2 trillion and boasts more than 225 million people with open personal digital wallets.

In summary, the Chinese financial entity did not disclose the blockchain network used—likely a private network, given China's strict regulation against cryptocurrency trading—but this initiative undoubtedly sets a bold precedent in the modernization of the country's capital markets.

Indiana lawmakers are hoping to make the state a cryptocurrency leader by allowing the state to invest in digital currencies like Bitcoin for state savings and retirement plans while prohibiting local communities from restricting crypto companies.

The legislation, House Bill 1042, comes as excitement grows over the once obscure digital assets that have made millionaires and wiped-out fortunes. Its supporters now include some of the country's most powerful people, including President Donald Trump and initially hesitant financial institutions, while the first major piece of crypto legislation passed Congress earlier this year. 

Now, Indiana is looking for a slice of the windfall.  The topic was one of just a few to get an earlier-than-usual hearing as lawmakers consider redistricting, signaling it's a major topic of interest among Republicans.

“Crypto policy will become a mainstay of this committee's work for probably years to come,” said bill author Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson, at a House Financial Institutions Committee meeting Dec. 4. 

Though the bill would allow public investment funds to delve into the world of digital currency, it stops short of allowing direct crypto investments.

Instead, the bill applies to cryptocurrency exchange traded funds, or EFTs — a safer, federally regulated fund that tracks crypto prices, either by holding the digital assets or a contract that speculates on prices in the future. 

The state investment programs required to provide such options include the 529 education savings plan and certain retirement funds for teachers, public employees and lawmakers. It also allows other state investment funds to place their assets in crypto EFTs. 

While less volatile than a direct investment, it's not entirely without risk. Because there is less oversight in the underlying crypto market, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned it's difficult to prevent fraud and ensure fairness, even for EFT investors. 

That was a tentative concern for Tony Green, deputy executive director of the Indiana Public Retirement System, at the House Financial Institutions Committee hearing Dec. 4. 

Though neutral on the bill, Green said IPRS would want to ensure there were proper disclaimers about volatility. And while the agency wants to offer choices to their members, he said, those surveyed were generally uninterested. 

Another aspect of the bill limits how local governments and state agencies can regulate crypto, though Pierce said it's only intended to ensure laws don't unfairly target crypto.

Specifically, it would prohibit regulation of an individual or a business' ability to accept digital currency as payment, including by taxing use of the payment method. It also stops local governments from denying crypto mining facilities in areas zoned for industrial use or applying noise restrictions specific to crypto. 

There was some worry about a clause in the bill that bans a public agency from prohibiting a person's ability to “use or accept digital assets as a method of payment for legal goods and services.” 

The bill was welcomed by the founder of the local crypto mining business Megawatt.

Ilya Rekhter, who operates mining facilities in rural areas across the state, said the legislation would help prevent a sudden change in zoning laws after a business has already invested money in a facility, Rekhter said.

“We're not asking for any special treatment," he said, "just the same treatment.” 

The committee won't hold a vote on the bill until January.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has provided an update on its action to tackle cookie compliance, which has brought the vast majority of the UK's most used websites into compliance with rules on the use of advertising cookies. 

This has given an estimated 80% of UK internet users over the age of 14 - equating to around 40 million people - greater control over how they are tracked for personalised advertising.

Our assessment focused on three key areas of compliance:  

As a result of this work, 979 of the top 1,000 websites met the ICO's compliance checks at the time of their most recent test, with only 21 websites identified as still failing.  

Of the sites that were compliant with our testing criteria, 415 passed without any intervention. The remaining 564 improved their practices after initially failing, following direct engagement from the ICO. This involved sending letters to website operators highlighting their shortcomings in compliance and, where this did not lead to change, opening investigations and, in 17 cases, issuing preliminary enforcement notices (PENs). We are pleased that this threat of enforcement action has led to nearly all of the websites concerned bringing themselves into compliance.  

We continue with action in relation to the 21 websites that have still not passed our testing criteria.  

We are committed to upholding cookie compliance and will continue to periodically test the UK's top 1,000 websites, ensuring they meet their legal requirements.

Tim Capel, Interim Executive Director of Regulatory Supervision, said:  

“We set ourselves the goal of giving people more meaningful control over how they were tracked online by the end of 2025. I can confidently say that we have delivered on that promise.  

“Our work does not stop here. We want to ensure that websites that we have brought into compliance with the cookie rules do not simply revert to their previously unlawful practices because they think it will go under the radar. We will continue to monitor compliance and engage with industry to ensure they uphold their legal obligations, while also supporting innovation that respects people's privacy.”

Our action to tackle cookie compliance has seen significant changes that have improved user experiences online, including a greater prevalence of “reject” options on cookie banners and a lower prevalence of cookies being placed before consent has been given or after it has been refused.

Alongside this work, we have also been encouraging better practices by engaging with trade bodies representing the majority of industries who appear in the top 1,000 websites and the consent management platforms (CMPs) that provide consent management solutions to nearly 80% of the top 500 websites. This has led to these CMPs making significant changes to ensure the cookie banner options they provide to their customers are compliant by default.

Going forward, following our consultation earlier this year, we are continuing to work with a range of stakeholders to help us understand whether publishers could deliver privacy-friendly online advertising to users who have not granted consent, where there is a low risk to their privacy. We are working with government to explore how it could amend legislation to reinforce this. The next update on our work will be provided in 2026. 

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a series of enforcement notices and practice recommendations to several public authorities after identifying significant failures to comply with the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000.

The ICO yesterday announced that they will be scrutinising how popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their online privacy.

As a regulator, sometimes we need to intervene directly with organisations to drive change. But our goal is always broader: to raise standards across entire sectors. That means choosing the right regulatory tools to hold decision-makers accountable, set clear expectations, and secure lasting improvements.

We are calling for views on new guidance setting out how we approach investigations and take enforcement action. 

We have issued an enforcement notice to South Wales Police (SWP) over serious delays in handling subject access requests (SARs).

We have fined Carmarthenshire sole trader Bharat Singh Chand £200,000 for sending almost one million spam texts about debt solutions and energy saving grants. 

The government has announced it is slashing the red tape that holds back groundbreaking innovations from coming to market.

Tech & Digitalisation

Commentary5th December 2025

By multiple experts (4)

Governments are facing a dual challenge. Their failure to keep pace with technological change has eroded their ability to deliver – and with it, the trust of citizens who increasingly feel their taxes are not funding a state capable of getting things done.

Sensibly embracing new technologies is one path to tackling both the policy challenge of delivery and the political challenge of trust: rebuilding state capacity and, in doing so, re-establishing belief in the social contract.

But governments cannot simply “plug and play” technologies such as artificial intelligence and expect them to solve deep-rooted problems. As the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) has explored in Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State, AI has the potential to reshape how decisions are made and services are delivered, but it will also expose the fragility of the systems beneath it. Adopted on top of brittle, opaque or siloed infrastructure, AI could automate dysfunction rather than fix it – making services less accountable and citizens more disillusioned.

Building strong digital foundations is therefore essential.

Blockchain – a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT) – is best understood as part of a broader “digital trust stack”: technologies that help actors who do not fully know or trust one another to share data, verify information and coordinate action in reliable, auditable ways.

The political imperative is clear. As governments race to harness AI and other emerging technologies, the strength of this digital trust stack will shape whether technology renews the state's ability to deliver or simply accelerates existing problems. Unlike many other technologies, blockchain does not just require governance – it can enable governance, because auditability and traceability are built into how it works.

This commentary offers a clear-eyed analysis that sets out:

What blockchain is and how it works.

How governments are already using it today – from verifying digital credentials to improving the reliability of cross-border trade.

What policymakers can do now to unlock the long-term value of blockchain and related technologies, from investing in strong data foundations to clarifying governance and regulatory frameworks.

Of course, blockchain is no silver bullet for addressing digital trust. But if properly designed and deployed, it can be a key component of the infrastructure that enables other technologies to be adopted, tested and scaled – creating the foundations of a state that innovates at the pace of the technological revolution.

Amid the global financial crisis of 2008 – a moment when trust in banks and governments was at a low point – a pseudonymous author, Satoshi Nakamoto, published a white paper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.[_] It proposed an electronic cash system that worked without banks, clearing houses or central authorities. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer network where everyone could verify the ledger for themselves.

At the heart of this system is the blockchain: a distributed digital ledger that lives on many computers across a network. Every time something new happens – a financial transaction, a property transfer, the issuance of a credential – the information is bundled into a “block” that is cryptographically linked to the block before it, forming a tamper-evident chain of records: a blockchain.

A useful mental model is a shared notebook. Anyone with the right permissions can write in it, everyone can read it and once something is written, it cannot be quietly rubbed out. Any attempt to alter a past entry leaves a visible mark.

Nakamoto's key innovation was not inventing entirely new technologies, but combining existing tools in a way that created trust without a central authority. Each component replaces a traditional source of institutional mediation with a technical mechanism:

Cryptographic hashes. These are digital “fingerprints” that uniquely represent data. They link blocks together so that changing one record would require changing every subsequent block, making tampering immediately detectable.

Digital signatures. These are cryptographic proofs that a transaction was authorised by the holder of a private key. This allows users to verify authenticity and ownership without exposing sensitive personal information.

Distributed networks. Copies of the ledger are held across many nodes. No single actor controls the system, and there is no single point of failure. If one node is compromised, others can still verify the correct state of the ledger.

Consensus mechanisms. These are rules by which a decentralised network agrees on which transactions are valid and in what order, ensuring a single, consistent version of the truth. In bitcoin, this is a mechanism called Proof of Work, in which nodes compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks. Other systems use alternative mechanisms such as Proof of Stake, which can greatly reduce energy consumption and increase throughput.

Together, these tools solved a problem that had stumped computer scientists for decades: the double-spending problem. In the digital world, information can be copied endlessly. Without a trusted intermediary such as a bank, how do you prevent someone from spending the same £5 twice? Bitcoin showed that a decentralised network, following clear rules, could do this automatically. Digital value could be transacted without a central mint or administrator.

Beyond money, this architecture opened up new ways to create online records and contracts that anyone could verify but no single actor could secretly alter.

When implemented appropriately, blockchain-based systems can provide:

Transparency. Participants can see the relevant part of the ledger or obtain verifiable proofs of its contents. Records need not sit in opaque back-office systems.

Immutability. Once recorded, entries cannot be changed without leaving a trace. This does not mean errors are impossible, but that corrections themselves are visible and auditable.

Decentralisation and resilience. No single ministry, bank or technology vendor can unilaterally manipulate the record, and the system can be more resilient to outages or attacks because it does not depend on a single database.

In the years since the financial crisis, blockchain has therefore been seen not just as a financial innovation, but as an institutional one: a new way of generating and maintaining trust in records and processes.

However, these benefits are not automatic. Blockchain is not always the right tool, and badly designed systems can be costly and cumbersome. The key policy question is: where does a shared, tamper-evident record genuinely add value over existing infrastructure?

The core political and policy question is how blockchain can help governments tackle the twin challenges of delivery and trust. Where multiple parties – ministries, private actors, other states or citizens – need to rely on shared records without fully trusting each other, blockchain components can improve transparency, accountability and resilience.

The best-known application is finance (see our case study for an overview): cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, stablecoins such as USDC and smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum that enable programmable transactions (a digital agreement that automatically does what it is designed to do when certain conditions are met). 

But over the past decade, blockchain has evolved from being seen as a single financial tool to a broader technology stack – a collection of interoperable tools, protocols and ideas that can be combined differently depending on the problem.

Underpinning all these examples is a central idea: because blockchain is inherently transparent and auditable, it can help build more trustworthy digital public services.[_],[_]

Digital wallets built on blockchain infrastructure can be used to deliver payments and entitlements more transparently and efficiently, especially for those without access to traditional banking.

The UN's World Food Programme has used blockchain-based systems to deliver assistance to refugees in Jordan, enabling people to buy essentials using digital identities instead of paper vouchers or cash.[_] This reduced costs, improved speed and strengthened auditability compared with manual reconciliation processes.

Programmable public money – whether via tokenised vouchers, stablecoins or other digital instruments – could enable rapid targeted distribution of aid during crises, such as Oxfam's Unblocked Chain Project in Vanuatu, where programmable rules controlled how and where aid recipients could spend funds (for example, specifying allowable merchants or time limits).[_]

In India, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported pilots that record disbursements of state payments and entitlements on distributed ledgers to improve transparency in welfare programmes such as the Public Distribution System.[_]

These initiatives remain experimental, but they demonstrate how blockchain can make public spending more traceable, reduce leakage and provide real-time visibility over where funds are going.

Modern states depend on data sharing across ministries and agencies. Yet many systems remain siloed, fragile or vulnerable to manipulation. Blockchain and related distributed-trust infrastructures can help log access, prove provenance and reduce single points of failure while preserving privacy.

In Estonia, the X-Road platform underpins secure data exchange between public and private entities, enabling citizens to access more than 1,700 services seamlessly.[_] Hash-based ledger techniques are used to timestamp and tag critical logs and data records, enabling authorities to prove that data have not been altered retrospectively and to verify records across systems.[_]

The European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), an initiative of the European Commission and European Union member states, is building cross-border platforms for verifying credentials, from university diplomas to business registrations.[_] Unlike X-Road, which operates within a single national ecosystem, EBSI is designed for a multi-country environment, extending secure interoperability beyond borders.

Used well, these infrastructures allow governments to maintain verifiable audit trails, reduce the risk of undetected tampering, and make services more portable and user-centric.

Global trade still relies heavily on paper documents, fragmented IT systems and limited visibility across supply chains. This creates delays, costs and opportunities for fraud – problems that particularly harm small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Blockchain can help by acting as a shared ledger for tracking goods and documents, while enabling faster, programmable payments.

TBI has worked with the TWIN Foundation to explore how blockchain-based records can lower barriers to trade in Africa by providing trusted digital documentation accessible to multiple parties.[_]

In Singapore, the government-led TradeTrust framework uses blockchain to authenticate and exchange electronic trade documents across jurisdictions, supporting faster customs clearance and reducing fraud risks.[_]

Major economies such as the EU and China are exploring how distributed ledgers can support digital trade corridors, streamline cross-border documentation and provide near-real-time visibility across ports, carriers and customs systems.[_],[_]

These systems are still in development and many pilots remain small in scale. But the direction of travel is clear: trusted shared records can reduce friction in trade, strengthen resilience and support more inclusive participation in global markets.

Property and land registries are the bedrock of economic security. Yet in many countries, records are incomplete, paper-based or vulnerable to manipulation. Blockchain-related technologies can provide tamper-evident registries where ownership histories are transparent and easier to audit.

In Georgia, the national land registry has experimented with blockchain to record property transactions, aiming to give citizens greater confidence in ownership records and reducing opportunities for fraud.[_]

In the United Kingdom, the Digital Securities Sandbox (run by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority) allows firms to test DLT-based market infrastructure, and the government's Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT) pilot is exploring the issuance and lifecycle management of government bonds on distributed ledgers. [_],[_] These initiatives signal how tokenisation – representing real-world assets as digital tokens – could modernise securities and other asset markets.

Tokenisation can, in principle, allow assets such as land, infrastructure or securities to be divided into fractional digital units, broadening the pool of participating investors and improving market efficiency. But the policy challenges – from investor protection to prudential regulation – are significant and require careful design.

As governments deploy AI, they face growing pressure to ensure systems are transparent, accountable and secure.[_] The integration of AI, blockchain and smart contracts is still nascent but could enable more trustworthy automated decision-making.[_]

In principle, governments could record model versions, key training-data characteristics and performance logs on distributed ledgers, creating tamper-evident audit trails while using privacy-preserving techniques to protect sensitive data. This would support better oversight of how models evolve over time, stronger evidence for regulatory compliance and clearer accountability when decisions are challenged.

Some early pilots – for example in South Korea and within EU-funded research projects – have explored blockchain for AI data governance and digital content authentication, particularly in areas such as disinformation and deepfake detection.[_],[_]

These examples are early and should not be overstated. But they illustrate a broader point: blockchain's institutional significance for policymakers lies less in any one use case, and more in the fact that transparency, reliability and auditability are built into how it works.

Case Study

The Stablecoin Market: Current Landscape

Blockchain technologies are reshaping payments, especially across borders – offering faster and cheaper alternatives to the traditional financial-system actors.

Stablecoins are the most established of the different forms of digital money, now exceeding $300 billion in circulation (up from $200 billion in 2024), with projections of $500 billion (and in some optimistic cases up to $2 trillion) by 2028.[_],[_]

New US regulation has given additional momentum to the stablecoin market this year, with established firms such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup publicly exploring how to participate. The EU, Singapore and Hong Kong have also enacted different models of stablecoin regulation, while in countries such as the UK the stablecoin regime remains in the consultation phase.

At the heart of this varied regulatory landscape lies a complex policy trade-off: regulators are attempting to safeguard consumers and preserve financial stability while also harnessing the potential benefits of digital-asset innovation, including faster payments, financial inclusion and reduced transaction costs.

Key Benefits

Lower cost. Transaction costs can be significantly lower. Cross-border payment fees today average 1.5 to 2.5 per cent (and over 6 per cent for remittances),[_] whereas live stablecoin deployment (for example, MoneyGram's use of the Stellar blockchain to move funds) shows sub-five-second settlement with fees below 0.1 per cent.

Faster settlement. Moving from multi-day correspondent banking to instant or near-instant settlement reduces counterparty risk and releases working capital for businesses.

Programmability (automation and compliance). Stablecoins allow conditional, programmable payments – for example, funds automatically released when shipment or customs data are verified – linking payment, compliance and documentation within a single digital workflow, reducing administrative friction and error.

Resilience through diversification. For some countries, blockchain-based payments provide a credible alternative to legacy cross-border systems that rely on specific countries, supporting national financial resilience and sovereignty.

Financial inclusion. By enabling low-cost, near-instant transfers without traditional intermediaries, stablecoins can expand global market access for SMEs and suppliers, which would be especially powerful for developing economies.

Other Considerations

Blockchain-enabled payment systems support faster, cheaper and more inclusive payments – but only if governments make these systems safe, reliable and economically useful. Governments should focus on three key areas of risk to enable this to happen:

1. Consumer protection

The programmable, borderless nature of blockchain transactions brings powerful advantages, but it also introduces new considerations and risks. Irreversible transfers and a reliance on private platforms – with varying levels of security – expose users to fraud, scams and operational failures. Governments can strengthen user confidence by setting standards for secure custody of backed assets, robust identity-verification rules and clear redress mechanisms so users are protected without stifling innovation.

2. Financial stability

While stablecoins have the potential to strengthen digital financial infrastructure by enabling efficient, programmable and globally interoperable payments, they could also create liquidity pressures or lose their peg during stress events, especially if reserves are opaque or low-quality. To ensure they remain reliable, clear standards around reserve quality, transparency and routine stress testing can help maintain confidence and stability. Well-designed frameworks not only mitigate liquidity risks but also support the development of robust, trustworthy stablecoin markets that complement the broader financial system.

3. Monetary and regulatory integrity

The growing use of stablecoins creates opportunities to modernise payments and expand financial access. However, heavy use of foreign-denominated stablecoins may weaken domestic monetary control, and unclear rules push activity offshore. These risks vary depending on a country's local economic conditions, especially around inflation stability and financial openness. Proportionate, predictable and context-sensitive regulation can help preserve monetary sovereignty while also keeping responsible innovation benefits onshore.

Overall, building simple, secure and low-cost digital payment rails will be central to future economic growth – requiring swift regulatory clarity, continued experimentation with digital currencies and the integration of blockchain into a trusted digital infrastructure.

Governing blockchain technologies does not mean blocking innovation, but enabling productive innovation and high-impact adoption. Three overarching principles should steer this:

Use blockchain only where it adds real value. Governments should adopt distributed ledgers only when doing so would clearly improve trust, auditability or cross-institution coordination. In many cases a well-governed centralised system may be simpler and more efficient, so blockchain should be a deliberate choice, not a default one.

Prioritise integration and data quality. Blockchain systems must connect smoothly to existing infrastructure, and because immutable records can lock in mistakes, strong data governance, correction mechanisms and clear technical standards are essential to keep systems accurate, fair and workable in practice.

Balance performance with clear governance. Newer blockchain architectures improve efficiency but trade-offs remain, so governments need to select technologies with realistic performance characteristics and establish unambiguous rules on liability, responsibility and oversight to ensure systems remain resilient and accountable at scale.

Blockchain is not a cure-all for problems related to data, trust or service delivery. But perfection should not be the enemy of progress. Governments do not need to wait for flawless systems to begin unlocking value.

Drawing on lessons from pilots around the world, four policy priorities stand out.

Technology adoption should be driven by problem-led demand, not by the supply of technology for its own sake. Blockchain is most useful where:

Multiple, potentially mistrusting parties need to maintain a shared record of state, and there is scope for a new intermediary or process to build trust among the transacting stakeholders.

Improved data auditability, programmability and resilience would create measurable public value.

Before choosing a blockchain-based approach, policymakers should ask:

Could a conventional database or API-based integration (coupled with strong identity access management and cyber-security protocols) meet the need more simply?

Who are the parties that need to trust – or verify – the record?

How will users challenge errors, and what recourse will they have?

Publishing short case studies of both successful and unsuccessful pilots can help future teams avoid repeating mistakes and clarify where blockchain genuinely adds value.

Blockchain pilots succeed or fail largely based on the broader digital foundations in which they are embedded. Investment in the following key areas is essential not only for blockchain but for digital government more broadly:

Digital identity: trusted systems for verifying who people and organisations are, and for issuing, storing and verifying digital credentials including decentralised identity solutions.

Foundational registries: reliable Civil Registries and records of land, companies, vehicles and other core assets.

Interoperability and secure data exchange: platforms and standards that allow systems to talk to one another safely.

Cyber-security and resilience: robust protection against breaches and attacks.

Legal recognition of digital records and signatures: clarity on the evidentiary status of digital documents.

Governments are uniquely positioned to provide these shared infrastructures. They can also adopt open standards that allow multiple vendors and solutions to interoperate, preventing lock-in and enabling local innovators – especially SMEs and startups – to build services without hoarding user data in proprietary formats.

Many blockchain initiatives remain stuck in pilot mode, with lessons lost in internal reports or private vendor decks. To build institutional capability, governments should:

Establish simple, standardised frameworks for pilot design and evaluation.

Require public documentation (even if brief) covering:

Purpose and scope. What problem was the pilot meant to solve, and for whom?

Technical design and integration. How did it connect to existing systems? What interoperability challenges emerged?

Cost and resource use. What budget, skills and infrastructure were required?

Governance and accountability. Who was responsible? What legal or regulatory questions arose?

Data governance. How were data quality, integrity, privacy and links between on-chain and off-chain systems managed?

Outcomes and metrics. What worked? What failed? What conditions would be needed for scaling?

Publishing even short summaries can have outsized benefits. For example, UK pilots in areas such as digital trade documentation and regulatory reporting have highlighted not only the promise of distributed ledgers, but also the importance of legal recognition of electronic documents and the difficulty of translating complex legal rules into code.[_] Sharing such insights avoids repeating mistakes and refines future designs.

Blockchain introduces new roles (validators, token issuers, node operators), new risks (from immutability of incorrect data to novel financial instruments) and new regulatory questions (for example, applications operating across borders, as we highlight in the case study).

Governments should:

Clarify responsibilities, liabilities and the legal standing of on-chain records, including how they interact with existing laws on contracts, evidence and data protection.

Ensure that regulatory frameworks are technology-neutral but capable of accommodating decentralised architectures, cryptographic proofs and privacy-enhancing technologies.

Provide guidance and, where necessary, regulatory sandboxes (for example, safe-harbour environments) where public bodies and firms can test blockchain-based systems under supervision.

Interpret privacy and accountability principles in a way that enables privacy-by-design, for instance through encryption, zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure, rather than seeing blockchain and data protection as inherently in conflict.

Done well, regulation can be an enabler of responsible innovation rather than a barrier to it, providing the certainty that serious public-sector deployments require.

Blockchain is best understood as part of the infrastructure of digital trust. Combined with strong digital-identity ecosystems, interoperable data platforms and sound governance, it can help governments deliver faster, fairer and more accountable services – while strengthening the integrity of markets and cross-border flows.

The choice facing governments is not whether to “adopt blockchain” in the abstract. It is whether to build the institutional, legal and technical foundations that allow tools such as blockchain to be used where they add genuine value – and to say no where they do not.

Jurisdictions that focus on real problems, adopt principled yet innovation-friendly regulation and invest in shared digital foundations will be best placed to turn promising pilots into lasting institutional capability. In doing so, they can not only harness new technologies, but also rebuild the trust and effectiveness on which the social contract ultimately depends.

Cryptoassets are very high risk and you should be prepared to lose all your money before you invest

It has been a wild ride for cryptos this week. Bitcoin plunged on the first day of December, shedding as much as $18,000 (£13,500), its biggest dollar loss since May 2021, dragging other cryptos such as Ether and Solana down with it. 

According to Bloomberg, the sell-off erased nearly $1 trillion in fresh leveraged bets on bitcoin. Monday's bond market declines weighed on riskier non-yielding assets such as bitcoin, plus it had already been largely trading in a downward trajectory since the peak in October, landing the crypto in negative territory year-to-date. 

However, on Tuesday, bitcoin rebounded 6% breaking back above $90,000 and rallied further on Wednesday to a two-week high, partly thanks to Vanguard's decision to allow crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be traded on its platform. Plus, opportunistic investors have been jumping on the opportunity to snap up crypto at a discount, supporting its price. Nonetheless, bitcoin is still down around 25% off the October highs amid concerns about overvaluations in risky assets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptos. 

Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile and while they can deliver impressive gains, they can also leave investors nursing painful losses. 

Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) shares skyrocketed over 8% on Tuesday on the back of comments from Ming-Chi Kuo, a respected supply chain analyst from TF International, who said the company could start building Apple's M processors for its MacBook Air and iPad Pro in early 2027. Kuo said the chances of Intel becoming an Apple chip supplier “has recently improved significantly”. 

Shares are up almost 20% over the past week and are up by more than 80% over the last three months. The Trump administration invested $8.9 billion into Intel's stock in August as part of the White House's plans to back the US chip manufacturing industry. 

However, analysts are unsure about the outlook for Intel with an average ‘hold' recommendation on the stock and a target price of $35.91, down 17% from the current share price.  

It looks like Anthropic could be preparing for an IPO. According to the Financial Times, the AI safety and research company and major rival to OpenAI, held talks with major investment banks and has tapped law firm Wilson Sonsini to start working on its potential stock market flotation, which could take place as early as next year. The FT report said the company behind the Claude chatbot is in talks for a private funding round that could lift its valuation above $300 billion. Anthropic hired Krishna Rao who worked at Airbnb for six years and focused on its IPO. 

Although OpenAI has not provided official confirmation, there have been several recent media reports to suggest the company behind ChatGPT could also be laying the groundwork for an IPO. OpenAI reportedly reached a valuation of $500 billion in October after completing a $6.6 billion share sale in October.

Both companies could be looking to go public in an attempt to raise huge amounts of capital to fund their costly expansion plans and gain global credibility. 

The Bank of England has said: “risks to financial stability have increased during 2025”. The central bank warned that “many risky asset valuations remain materially stretched”, particularly for AI tech companies, which “heightens the risk of a sharp correction”. It said financial stability consequences could arise if AI progress “does not deliver the returns expected by investors”.  

This adds to a series of warnings from top voices and institutions across the global economy that have raised concerns about fears of an AI bubble.

Source interactive investor, 1-3 December 2025.

Snowflake Inc Ordinary Shares (NYSE:SNOW) reported fiscal third-quarter revenue of $1.21 billion, beating analysts' expectations for $1.18 billion. The cloud data analytics firm forecast Q4 product revenue of $1.19 billion to $1.20 billion, slightly ahead of forecasts for $1.18 billion. However, shares fell sharply as investors were hoping for an even bigger beat in terms of its current quarter top line guidance. 

Meanwhile, Snowflake and Anthropic announced a $200 million partnership to bring agentic AI to global enterprises. The multi-year agreement will make Anthropic's Claude models available in the Snowflake platform. 

Shares in Snowflake have sharply outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, surging more than 70%. On the back of Wednesday's update, Deutsche Bank, TD Cowen, Stifel and Bernstein raised their target price on the stock. 

Strategy Inc Class A (NASDAQ:MSTR) has been caught up in the bitcoin volatility. Shares are down almost 25% over the past month. 

However, it is the most-bought tech stock on the ii platform so far this week, outpacing even tech giants NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in second and third place respectively. 

Strategy Inc said it created a $1.4 billion reserve fund so that it does not have to sell some of its $56 billion crypto holdings to cover dividend payments. However, the announcement spooked investors, with Strategy's shares falling sharply on Monday. Strategy has become a popular proxy play on bitcoin via the public markets. However, investors have suffered lately, with shares sliding around 60% from the recent peak this summer.

Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) will announce its second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings after the market close on Wednesday 10 December. According to Refinitiv, earnings per share (EPS) is expected to hit $1.64 and revenue is forecast to rise to $16.2 billion. In September, Oracle announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI, and Deutsche Bank notes the company “getting little, if any, credit” for this tie-up. However, shares have fallen sharply since September's peak, caught up in the market's concerns about an AI bubble. 

In its previous quarterly earnings release three months ago, new cloud contracts resulted in impressive growth forecasts, sending its share price soaring. Investors were able to shrug off a miss on the top and bottom lines, with adjusted EPS hitting $1.47 on revenues of $14.93 billion. Cloud computing division revenue jumped 28% year-on-year, while software revenue fell 1%. 

Shares are up 27% year-to-date and analysts are positive, with a consensus buy on the stock and an average target price of $336.82, up 62% from the current share price. This week, Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the stock with an overweight rating and a target price of $280.

Key takeaways:

Falling DEX volumes, muted ETP flows and macro uncertainty are pressuring SOL prices and limiting appetite for bullish positions.

New spot ETFs for rival altcoins increase competition, though expected government stimulus may reignite demand for Solana.

Solana's native token SOL (SOL) dropped 6% after getting rejected at $147 on Thursday. Investors became more risk-averse following the release of weak US job market data and soft consumer sentiment. 

Traders worry it may take longer than expected for SOL to revisit the $200 mark, especially after leverage traders were wiped out in October and November, while Solana network activity continues to decline. 

Solana's total value locked (TVL) fell to $10.8 billion from $13.3 billion two months earlier. Several of the ecosystem's top projects, including Kamino, Jupiter, Jito and Drift, saw deposit declines of 20% or more. Adding to the pressure, trading activity on Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) also dropped sharply.

Even so, Solana kept its position as the second-largest network by TVL. Ethereum, however, remained dominant with $73.2 billion in deposits. Its layer-2 ecosystem —featuring Base, Arbitrum and Polygon — continues to attract meaningful capital. Ethereum's Fusaka upgrade on Wednesday improved scalability and wallet management, reducing incentives for users to migrate funds to competing networks such as Solana.

Solana DEX volumes reached $19.2 billion in the seven days ending Nov. 30, a 40% drop from the $32 billion recorded four weeks earlier. With reduced onchain activity, investors fear weaker demand for SOL, creating a potential feedback loop as traders leave the Solana ecosystem in search of better opportunities. The newly launched layer-1 blockchain, Monad, for example, posted $1.2 billion in DEX volumes during its first week.

Layoffs and tighter consumer credit add pressure to SOL sentiment

SOL traders also reacted to a report from the global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, citing 71,321 corporate layoffs in November, a level seen only twice since 2008. Further uncertainty arose from the consumer financing sector after multiple US state attorneys general offices requested details from “buy now, pay later” providers regarding consumers' ability to repay those loans.

A PayPal survey showed that half of shoppers plan to take personal loans during the holiday season, raising concerns about tightening credit conditions. 

Demand for bullish leverage in SOL futures remains very low, with the annualized funding rate at 4%, below the neutral 6% mark. Part of this weak conviction stems from the lack of inflows into Solana exchange-traded products. According to a Dec. 1 CoinShares report, Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP ETPs saw a combined $1.06 billion in inflows over the same period.  

Other altcoins, such as XRP (XRP), Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), recently had their spot ETFs approved in the US, creating new competition for institutional flows. Several other Solana competitors are expected to receive spot ETF approvals in the coming months.

The bearish momentum has also reduced the odds of listed companies issuing new shares to expand their SOL reserves. Forward Industries (FWDI US), for instance, holds 6.91 million SOL, which are currently trading below its initial investment, according to CoinGecko data. Issuing shares at prices that imply a SOL cost below their reserve level would dilute existing shareholders' claim on those holdings.

SOL's path back to $200 depends heavily on reduced macroeconomic uncertainty, but SOL bears might be taken by surprise as traders expect governments to adopt stimulus measures, which could provide the catalyst needed for a broader altcoin rally.

Clues have emerged that reveal a much hotter history than we thought.

Whatever your stance is on climate change (it's real, let's move on), it's impossible to have missed the near-ubiquitous call to action to “keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.” Over the past few years, the somewhat bureaucratic phrase has become a rallying cry for the climate conscious. 

This ambitious target first surfaced following the Paris Climate Agreement, and describes a sort of climate threshold—if we pass a long-term average increase in temperature of 1.5 degrees Celsius, and hold at those levels for several years, we're going to do some serious damage to ourselves and our environment. 

Well, a paper from the University Western Australia Oceans Institute has some bad news: the world might've blown past that threshold four years ago. 

Published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the paper reaches this conclusion via an unlikely route—analyzing six sclerosponges, a kind of sea sponge that clings to underwater caves in the ocean. These sponges are commonly studied by climate scientists and are referred to as “natural archives” because they grow so slowly. Like, a-fraction-of-a-millimeter-a-year slow. This essentially allows them to lock away climate data in their limestone skeletons, not entirely unlike tree rings or ice cores. 

By analyzing strontium to calcium ratios in these sponges, the team could effectively calculate water temperatures dating back to 1700. The sponges watery home in the Caribbean is also a plus, as major ocean currents don't muck up or distort temperature readings. This data could be particularly useful ,as direct human measurement of sea temperature only dates back to roughly 1850, when sailors dipped buckets into the ocean. That's why the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) uses 1850 and 1900 as its preindustrial baseline, according to the website Grist. 

“The big picture is that the global warming clock for emissions reductions to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change has been brought forward by at least a decade,” Malcolm McCulloch, lead author of the study, told the Associated Press. “Basically, time's running out.”

The study concludes that the world started warming roughly 80 years before the IPCC's estimates, and that we already surpassed 1.7 degrees Celsius in 2020. That's a big “woah, if true” moment, but some scientists are skeptical. One such scientist, speaking with LiveScience, said that “ it begs credulity to claim that the instrumental record is wrong based on paleosponges from one region of the world … It honestly doesn't make any sense to me.” Other experts expressed wanting to see more data before completely upending the IPCC's climate goalposts, which say the Earth is currently hovering at a long-term temperature change of around 1.2 degrees Celsius.

Unfortunately, even if the sponges are wrong, there's mounting evidence that we are in the process of crossing that 1.5 degree threshold as we speak. This January was the hottest on record, clocking in at 1.7 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures. According to New Scientist, that means we've been above 1.5 degrees of change for at least a year. That doesn't jump the long-term average over the 1.5-line, but it's certainly a sign we're getting close fast.

Regardless of the percentage, one thing is certain: climate change is an all-hands-on-deck crisis. In order to save the planet for future habitability, humans need to curtail emissions immediately—after all, the sea sponges are telling us so.

CDC Vaccine Panel Scraps Guidance for Universal Hepatitis B Shots at Birth

New guidance from the CDC's vaccine advisory panel would do away with a decades-old universal birth dose recommendation for hepatitis B that helped cut infections by 99 percent in the U.S.

On Friday an influential vaccine advisory panel voted to change the recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Under the new guidance from the panel, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention almost always adopts, parents would need to consult with a health care provider about when to give a baby their first dose of the vaccine—so long as the person who gave birth to the baby tested negative for the disease. That would scrap current CDC policy that all babies receive the hepatitis B vaccine hours after birth. The vote passed with eight in favor and three against.

The new Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance recommends that the three-dose vaccine regimen begin at no earlier than two months of age for those infants. ACIP members also passed a second vote to recommend that parents discuss subsequent doses with a health care provider based on blood tests of the newborn's immunity levels (protective antibody titers).“I will just say: we have heard that do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording. And I vote no,” said ACIP member Cody Meissner, a pediatric infectious disease epidemiologist, during the first of three votes presented at today's meeting.

The CDC didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Scientific American.

Public health experts have expressed concern about the lack of data to support the proposed timing of vaccination and have cautioned that delaying the initial dose would increase vulnerability to hepatitis B infection.

That two-month period “is time that a child is at risk for a vaccine-preventable disease,” says Helen Chu, a physician and immunologist at the University of Washington and a former ACIP member.

The decision comes after several meetings filled with heated debate and admitted confusion among members on what they were voting on. The panel had tabled the vote twice, first at a September meeting and again on Thursday. Deliberations ignited a “public outcry,” Chu says. Many public health experts and medical societies are “pretty clear that they do not want to eliminate the birth dose," she says.

At the meetings, several ACIP members argued that newborns whose birthing parent tested negative for the virus are “low risk” for the disease—and that deciding to vaccinate should be an individual right. Currently, states require people receive certain vaccines in order to attend public school or participate in certain jobs. Some members also raised concerns over adverse effects and limited data on vaccine safety, despite dozens of studies and CDC reviews that have demonstrated that the hepatitis B vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infections in infants.

Today's vote moves away from a vaccine policy established in 1991 that has dramatically reduced hepatitis B rates in children, according to a review of 400 studies published earlier this week.

“The vaccine has essentially virtually eliminated childhood hepatitis B from the United States, and so it is really devastating to think about losing that,” says Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatrician at the Stanford University School of Medicine and a former ACIP member.

ACIP's decisions directly affect vaccine access. Vaccines for kids are covered either through private health insurance or Vaccines for Children (VFC)—a federal program that approximately half of the children in the U.S. are eligible for. Private and public insurers, including VFC, fully cover vaccines ACIP recommends under shared clinical decision-making. But public health experts have expressed concern that ACIP's discussion and new shared decision-making recommendation will still ultimately weaken people's ability to receive the vaccine.

“When you remove the strength of that recommendation, pregnant women may or may not be offered that vaccine,” said Rochelle Walensky, former director of the CDC and now a senior fellow at Harvard University, in a press call on Thursday. “They may or may not have a discussion about how important it is for their newborn to be vaccinated. And that may fall off the radar in terms of the access.”

Hepatitis B is a very contagious viral disease that damages the liver. Chronic cases can lead to liver disease or liver cancer. The virus spreads through bodily fluids, including blood and semen. The disease has been stigmatized because people associate it with unprotected sex and injection drug use, but the virus can also be transmitted during pregnancy and through childbirth and close contact of bodily fluids after birth.

“In my career, I have seen children with hepatitis B. I've seen children die of liver failure, which is a horrible death. I would never wish this on anybody,” Maldonado says.

About 18,000 infants and children were infected with hepatitis B annually before the vaccine was recommended to all newborns in the U.S., according to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The guidance called for three vaccine doses: the first has been given to infants at birth, the second has been given at one to two months old and the third has been given between six and 18 months. The birth dose helps prevent infection in the first weeks to months of life, Maldonado says. And the regimen has been effective: cases from 1990 to 2019 dropped by 99 percent.

Delaying the first dose to the second month of age for infants born to pregnant parents who test negative for the virus or whose infection status is unknown could cause 1,437 more childhood infections, 304 liver cancer cases and 482 hepatitis B-related deaths, a recent preprint paper suggests.

Public health experts note that the updated recommendation's success is contingent on effective screening for hepatitis B in pregnant people. The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be tested for hepatitis B, preferably in the first trimester. But that testing can fail because hepatitis B can be “a silent infection,” Maldonado says.

Only 84 to 88 percent of pregnant people get screened for the virus in the U.S.; more than 80 percent of people are unaware that they're infected. False negatives can occur if the test is performed incorrectly or if a person was very recently infected. And other caregivers, such as family members and daycare workers, who might not be screened could also carry the virus, Maldonado says.

“The simplest, safest, most effective way to protect all of the babies in this country is to give them that birth dose, along with the subsequent two doses, which is going to keep them protected for virtually their entire young adult life,” she adds.

How old is your pup in human years? This method is much more accurate than simply multiplying by 7.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists have gained insight into the epigenetic clock that controls how dogs age and have devised a new formula to pinpoint exactly how old that good boy or girl in your life is.

The researchers studied DNA methylation, or chemical modifications to certain DNA segments, within the genomes of 104 labrador retrievers, all ranging between 4 weeks and 16 years of age. It turns out we age in similar ways, the team reports in a study published in Cell Systems.

In humans, DNA methylation—the addition of organic compounds called methyl groups to specific segments of our DNA—can reveal the impact of disease, lifestyle, and genetics on our DNA. Using this information, scientists have been able to create an epigenetic clock, of sorts, to better understand how we age. Scientists have learned that other animals like mice and wolves experience DNA methylation. Now, they're using this research to understand the process of aging in man's best friend. 

Ultimately, certain regions of both the labrador and human genome—areas with high rates of mutation—show similar rates of methylation. A dog's life stages largely sync up with our own; puppies and babies start teething at roughly equivalent ages, for example. 

Whether you have a pitbull, pug, or Pembroke Welsh corgi, your pup will reach puberty at around 10 months and will likely die before turning 20. (Yes, it pains us to write that, too.) Scientists have long known that dogs are susceptible to many of the same age-related diseases that we are, such as cancer, arthritis, and heart disease. 

The researchers also devised a new way to calculate a dog's age, but it's arguably more complicated than simply multiplying by seven. To calculate the age, you'll have to multiply the natural logarithm of your pup's age by 16 and then add 31. Here's the equation:

16 x ln(your dog's age in human years) + 31

Super simple, right? (The researchers also a included a handy conversion tool here.) If you're wondering why your 2-year-old dog clocks in at around 40 human years, it's because his epigenetic clock ticks a bit faster than yours, but slows down as he ages.

The team hopes to expand its research to include additional dog species, and there are plenty of other research teams that are diving into a dog's genome to unlock even more secrets.

Scientists didn't expect this twist in evolution.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Modern dog breeds haven't quite caught up to the wolf when it comes to the size of their brains, but that size discrepancy is shrinking. The modern dog's brain is growing larger, and it could be thanks to their interactions with humans.

A study published in the journal Evolution investigated brain size in both modern and ancient dog breeds. The research team found that dog brains are getting larger the further genetically that they have evolved away from a wolf. 

That was a startling finding. “The results show that the breeding of modern dog breeds has been accompanied by an increase in brain size compared to ancient breeds,” Enikó Kubinyi, a senior research fellow at the Department of Ethology at ELTE Institute of Biology, says in a news release. “We couldn't explain this based on the tasks or life history characteristics of the breeds, so we can only speculate about the reasons.”

In the study, a team from Hungary and Sweden used CT images of over 850 dogs representing 159 breeds to reconstruct different individuals' brains and determine their brain volume. They compared the findings to 48 wolf specimens.

The data showed that a dog with a similar weight to a wolf had a brain volume about three-quarters the size of the wolf's. This confirms past research that domestication decreases brain size by about 20 percent, as animals no longer need to hunt or fend for themselves—nor do they face as much peril as they do in the wild.

“There is no need to sustain the energetically costly large brain, and the freed-up energy can be directed toward other purposes, such as producing more offspring,” László Zsolt Garamszegi, an evolutionary biologist at the Ecological Research Centre in Hungary, says in the news release, “which is important for domesticated animals.”

But in a twist of expectations, the further a dog breed was genetically from a wolf, the larger its relative brain size was. And it didn't matter if the dog had energy-sucking responsibilities, such as herding or guarding.

“Perhaps the more complex social environment, urbanization, and adaptation to more rules and expectations have caused this change,” Kubinyi speculates, “affecting all modern breeds.”

The study says that functional category, skull shape, longevity, and litter size all had no association with relative brain size.

The team believes that the findings are further bolstered by the independence seen in ancient breeds—specifically, their propensity to bark less and react less to human cues than modern breeds. 

“Different dog breeds live in varying levels of social complexity and perform complex tasks, which likely require a larger brain capacity,” Niclas Kolm of Stockholm University, says in the news release. “Therefore, we hypothesize that the selective pressures on the brain can vary within the dog species, and we may find differences in brain size among breeds based on the tasks they perform or their genetic distance from wolves.”

Mitochondria can lose power like batteries, but they can potentially be regenerated—a promising development than can be used in future treatments.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Think of cells as the biological answer to battery-powered electronics. Mitochondria are the batteries that supply them with enough energy to keep going. Unfortunately, just like the two standard AAs in your remote control, they eventually run out of power and die—but (much like actual batteries) they can also be recharged and replaced.

Breakdown of mitochondria causes cells to glitch. Wear and tear can happen with age, usually from years of exposure to free radicals that cause oxidative stress and inflammation, but can also be caused by injury from degenerative diseases or mitochondrial toxicity from certain drugs and other harmful substances. When there is damage to the cell, mitochondria begin to lose their capacity to generate energy. Losing mitochondria is detrimental to cell function. This is why biomedical engineer Akhilesh Gaharwar and his research team at Texas A&M University have come up with a way to regenerate them.

There is a repair mechanism already built in. While healthy cells can transfer some mitochondria to replace what was lost in ailing cells, much like an emergency run to the hardware store, this process is far from efficient when it comes to replacing all the dead batteries. Dysfunctional mitochondria are not only the result of neurodegenerative, cardiovascular or metabolic disorders, but can also be part of the cause. Gaharwar was able to fast-forward intracellular mitochondrial transfer by creating nanostructures which were then implanted into human mesenchymal stem cells. 

“Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display a particular propensity for initiating mitochondrial transfer to nearby cells; their mitochondria enhance cellular respiration, induce cell reprogramming, and repair metabolic function in recipient cells,” he said in a study recently published in PNAS. 

Because they have strong immune capabilities and do not burn as much energy as many other types of cells, mesenchymal stem cells were ideal for the team to experiment on in vitro. The few methods that exist to boost mitochondrial transfer require an immense amount of effort and still face obstacles. Gaharwar got around this by creating “nanoflowers” out of molybdenum disulfide, a biomaterial that has also been used to eliminate free radicals that cause cell degeneration. What sound like alien blossoms are actually structures with vacancies that encourage the formation of mitochondria in the stem cell. 

Mesenchymal stem cells are already known for their ability transfer mitochondria. The presence of nanoflowers activated a pathway that increases the production of mitochondria, and pushed stem cells to generate up to twice the number of mitochondria they normally would. Boosted cells were then introduced to cells whose batteries were losing power. More mitochondria meant faster transfer. They made their way from donor cells to recipient cells via intracellular structures used specifically for this purpose. Despite the weakness of cells on the receiving end, they were recharged by their new batteries.

There are added benefits to mitochondrial transfer. Smooth muscle cells found in the walls of blood vessels, especially arteries, need high energy levels and respiration efficiency for vascular contraction, a process which narrows blood vessels and helps control blood pressure. Gaharwar and his team wanted to see how these cells would react to an influx of mitochondria. Not only were they supercharged by the transfer, but the researchers think that it actually induced changes to the cell transcriptome, which is all of the RNA molecules, or transcripts, reflecting active genes that have been transcribed into a cell from the genome. Mitochondrial metabolism was also enhanced.

For now, this method has yet to be tried in vivo, but Gaharwar plans on future animal studies to test it before seeing how well it translates to humans. He thinks that individuals in the early stages of degenerative diseases have the greatest chance of seeing results.

“Our MoS2 nanoflower-based strategy offers a broadly applicable platform for pathologies requiring mitochondrial repair and replacement,” he said. “By enhancing mitochondrial transfer and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, this nanomaterial approach holds promise as a therapeutic tool for managing mitochondrial dysfunction.”

People who frequently include foods and beverages rich in polyphenols, such as tea, coffee, berries, cocoa, nuts, whole grains and olive oil, may experience better heart health over time.

A team from King's College London reported that individuals who followed dietary patterns high in polyphenols had lower predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Polyphenols are naturally occurring plant compounds associated with a wide range of health benefits, including support for the heart, brain, and gut.

Long-Term Findings From a Large UK Cohort

The study, published recently in BMC Medicine, tracked more than 3,100 adults from the TwinsUK cohort for more than ten years. It found that diets rich in certain groups of polyphenols were linked to healthier blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which contributed to lower CVD risk scores.

For the first time, the researchers also assessed a large set of urine metabolites that appear when the body processes polyphenols.

These biomarkers showed that people with higher levels of polyphenol metabolites (especially those linked to flavonoids and phenolic acids) had lower cardiovascular risk scores. They also tended to have higher HDL cholesterol, also known as 'good' cholesterol.

A New Scoring Tool to Measure Polyphenol Intake

To better understand dietary patterns, the researchers used a newly designed polyphenol dietary score (PPS). This score reflects intake of 20 common polyphenol-rich foods in the UK, including tea, coffee, berries, olive oil, nuts, and whole grains.

The PPS demonstrated stronger links to cardiovascular health than estimates of total polyphenol intake. The team suggested that this may be because the PPS captures overall eating habits rather than focusing on single compounds. This supports the idea that looking at the full diet provides a clearer picture of how polyphenol-rich foods collectively contribute to long-term heart health.

Expert Perspectives on Heart Benefits

Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos, senior author and Professor of Human Nutrition at King's College London, said: "Our findings show that long-term adherence to polyphenol-rich diets can substantially slow the rise in cardiovascular risk as people age. Even small, sustained shifts towards foods like berries, tea, coffee, nuts, and whole grains may help protect the heart over time."

Dr. Yong Li, first author of the study, added: "This research provides strong evidence that regularly including polyphenol-rich foods in your diet is a simple and effective way to support heart health. These plant compounds are widely available in everyday foods, making this a practical strategy for most people."

Connection Between Aging and Cardiovascular Risk

The researchers noted that although cardiovascular risk naturally increases with age, participants with higher polyphenol intake experienced a slower rise in risk across the 11-year follow-up period. They also highlighted the importance of future dietary intervention trials to confirm and expand on these findings.

While excavating at the ancient fort of La Loma in the northern Iberian Peninsula, archaeologists found the shattered remnants of a skull.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Maybe Game of Thrones is not exactly the best reflection of history, but there is some truth in that ghoulish scene where (spoiler alert) Ned Stark's decapitated head was skewered on a pike and displayed outside the gates of King's Landing. The ancient Romans apparently did the same with the heads of their enemies.

This was not out of the norm for Roman legions. They were known to expose severed heads, hands, feet, and even entire corpses to the elements and onlookers as an intimidation tactic that possibly doubled as a public display of victory. Rome relentlessly fought formidable Celtic warriors known as the Cantabri towards the end of the first century B.C.E. With an eye on capturing the Iberian Peninsula, they pursued the Cantabri, who lived in what is now northern Spain, in a series of conflicts known the Cantabrian Wars. It was at the fortress of La Loma that the Romans finally conquered them—and left a grisly reminder. 

Excavations at the crumbling fort revealed a lone skull lying between walls that had long since collapsed at the hands of the Roman army under emperor Augustus. He was already aware of complaints about the Cantabrians from different ethic groups within the empire, and that was all the fuel he needed to wage war against them so he could claim the Iberian Peninsula. Unlike the aforementioned fictional Ned Stark, the head of this unfortunate casualty remains nameless. While there is no evidence of it being raised on a pike, it was displayed above the wall as a ghoulish reminder of what would happen if anyone else tried to take down the Romans. 

“His intention was to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula by defeating the last two Celtic nations to remain outside the control of Rome in western continental Europe,”  archaeologist Santiago Domínguez-Solera, director of Heroica Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, said of Augustus in a study recently published in Journal of Roman Archaeology. “He utilized some of his best generals, mobilized many of his legions, and made enormous investments of time, materials, and human lives in this effort.”

Domínguez-Solera, who led a team of researchers in excavating the La Loma site, discovered the skull among ruins covered in ash from a Roman fire and littered with arrowheads, bladed weapons, jewelry, and fragments of armor. He thinks cuts and bruises on many of these pieces are possible evidence of bloody hand-to-hand combat. The skull was not found in one piece. What remained of it was scattered, possibly broken when it fell from collapsing walls of the fort and was then crushed by them. When these pieces were brought back to the lab and dated, the age of the skull aligned with the siege of La Loma during the Cantabrian Wars. Some of the missing parts included the mandible.

Without a name or anything close to identifying information, the only way the skull could speak was through physical and genetic analysis. Bone fragmentation made it difficult to figure out an age or sex from physical remnants alone. An assessment of the cranium came up with an age range of anywhere from 32 to 58 years. It also became more obvious that the skull had been left outside when the researchers examined damage to the bone caused by weathering, such as cracking, flaking, splitting, and whitening. Thankfully, its DNA was more intact. Because the skull had held on to 53% of its DNA, it was possible to recover its entire mitochondrial genome.

Genetic evidence said more than any physical characteristics could. This individual's sex was determined to be male based on the ratio of X to Y chromosomes. His ancestry goes back to ancient peoples of the Iberian peninsula, as was evidenced by haplogroups that are associated with the area, including a haplogroup on his paternal side that dates to the early Bronze Age and is still indigenous to the Basque region of the Iberian Peninsula. Further genetic analysis placed him in the north of Spain near other ancient individuals from Iron Age populations.

But genetic analysis alone could not answer one pressing question: why did he meet such a ghoulish end?

“The symbolism of the military trophy was materialized not only in the display of weapons taken from defeated foes, but also in acts of violence,” Domínguez-Solera said. “In Roman contexts, these punitive acts may have been part of strategies of intimidation rather than ritual practices related to victory or recognition of the courage of enemies as a form of warrior prestige.”

Heads still haunt Roman history. Egyptians who murdered Pompey the Great on Pharaoh Ptolemy's orders presented his head and ring to Caesar. After Cicero was executed for being an enemy of the state for his rivalry with Mark Antony, his dismembered head and hands were displayed. The shattered skull found at La Loma may still keep some secrets, but what was once a trophy is now a reminder that if anyone tried to oppose one of the most powerful empires in the world, heads would quite literally roll.

The Jomon people—who eventually settled in what is now Japan—share little, if any, genetic connection to the Denisovan population that's spread throughout Eurasia.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Researchers recently found a rare, intriguing deviation in the lineage of what is now Japan's ancient Jomon population—they were virtually devoid of any Denisovan ancestry (which is extremely common across Eurasian lineages). And in fact, according to the study published by the team on this discovery in in Current Biology, they were the only East Asian lineage to lack significant DNA from the Denisovans. The discovery had researchers scratching their heads, theorizing how the Jomon people avoided something that all other strains of East Asian ancestry had in common. 

“This implies different dispersals for modern humans into East Asia and suggests that Denisovans were sparsely distributed in the region,” the authors wrote.

In their attempt to develop a broad and deep understanding of the dispersal of ancient Denisovans over time, the team found “varying levels of Denisovan ancestry in Eurasians.” For instance, East Asian lineages had very high percentages of Denisovan DNA across the ages, while Western Eurasian lineages had very low percentages. But the Denisovans somehow missed intertwining with the Jomon people, who formed the basis of the modern population of one of East Asia's biggest islands, almost entirely. 

“Surprisingly, we found that individuals in the Japanese archipelago from the prehistoric Jomon period [from around 16,000 to 3,000 years ago] carried the least Denisovan ancestry among ancient and present-day East Asians,” the authors wrote. 

The team has two competing theories as to why this may have occurred. Either the Jomon people partially descended from a separate lineage and only later engaged with an ancestry chain that included Denisovan DNA, or the addition of Denisovan ancestry came later in the development of that particular lineage (a period that the Jomon population could not have been a part of). 

The team compiled ancient genomes from across Eurasia, and data indicated that many shared Denisovan DNA segments originated from a common episode of contact shared among East Asians. This compilation allowed researchers to use Denisovan ancestry to track population movement. But even though the Jomon population had the same origin as mainland populations, they lacked those distinctive Denisovan markers. 

“This indicates that gene flow occurred from a source with less or no Denisovan ancestry and diluted the Denisovan ancestry of early East Asians,” Stephane Peyregne, co-supervisor of the study, said in a statement. “Denisovan DNA represents a powerful marker to reconstruct population history.”

Cosmic Magnification Is One of the Universe's Weirdest Optical Illusions

In our topsy-turvy universe, sometimes the farther away an object is, the bigger it seems to be

It's always amazing, and more than a little humbling, when the universe reminds us that our “common sense” is provincial, falling apart on cosmic scales.

If you're on the surface of Earth—and I'm betting you are—there are many ways to reliably estimate the distance to some object. One we use almost subconsciously is to compare an object's apparent size with how big we know it to be. For example, you have a good feel for the size of, say, a typical human. So if you see someone looming large in your vision, you can reckon they're nearby, whereas if they appear very small, they must be much farther away.

Of course, some humans are larger or smaller than average, but you can still account for that to get a decent distance estimate. And the overall trend is crystal clear: the farther off an object is, the smaller it appears. The trend is so obvious, in fact, that we can see the rate of change is linear: Double the distance, and the object will appear to be half its previous size. Look at it 10 times farther away, and it will seem to be one tenth as big.

This all works great for familiar objects up to a few kilometers away, but astronomers are notoriously unsatisfied with these relatively tiny scales. We want to know the distances to objects that are trillions of kilometers away—or even billions of times farther than that!

In deep images of the sky from giant telescopes, galaxies abound. Some may be relatively close to us—merely some tens of millions of light-years distant—while others may be billions of light-years in the background. Just by looking at the image, how could you tell?

You might assume the galaxies that appear smaller are farther away, in keeping with our earthly intuition, but this won't work; like humans, galaxies come in a range of sizes. When you examine an image, you might be looking at a massive galaxy nearly at the edge of the observable universe—or a tiny dwarf galaxy right in our cosmic backyard. Just judging by the image, it's impossible to tell.

It's possible there could be some standard physical scale to galaxies, some way to gauge their distance by linking details of their structure to their overall size, but such scenarios are apparently too simple for the universe's true complexity.

It turns out that the standard linear scaling we use on Earth would only apply at cosmic scales if our universe were static—unchanging in size over time—which it isn't! Instead the universe is expanding, growing larger every day. This phenomenon brings with it a whole slew of bizarre consequences, but a surprising one is that beyond a certain threshold of separation from us, farther-off galaxies appear to get bigger with distance! As so often happens, the cosmos really is a lot odder than you think.

This seemingly paradoxical effect is a consequence of cosmic expansion coupled with the finite speed of light.

When we say a galaxy is, for example, 12 billion light-years away, what we usually mean is that the light from that galaxy took 12 billion years to reach us. But during that light's time in transit, the universe has gotten bigger all the while. That means it was smaller in the past, and the objects in it were much closer together. When the light left that galaxy 12 billion years ago, the galaxy was closer to us, so it appears bigger than expected for that distance once its light arrives here!

This is certainly counterintuitive and, frankly, weird. Still, it's borne out by the equations governing how the universe works. The effect holds for all galaxies but is imperceptibly small for those relatively nearby; their light travel time is minuscule compared with the age of the universe, so the universe wasn't all that much smaller when they emitted the light we now see. Their apparent size isn't affected enough to detect.

But the effect ramps up with distance and begins to dominate for objects with a light travel time of about 9.5 billion years. Around that point, we're looking so far back in time—so far back in the universe's history of expansion—that the galaxies are effectively magnified, appearing larger than they otherwise would. The exact distance where this effect really kicks in depends on many complicated factors, including how rapidly the universe expands and how much matter it contains. In fact, if we could precisely measure this apparent growth in size, we could then use it to better determine these important cosmological parameters.

Unfortunately, because galaxies don't come in standard sizes, that's quite a difficult task. Worse, this cosmic magnification effect confusingly makes some galaxies look dimmer: if they appear bigger, their light is more spread out, so they become fainter and even more difficult to observe!

As surprising as this effect is, what may be even more astonishing is that we've been able to see far enough to detect it at all from our planetary perch in the backwaters of the Milky Way. Its very existence is one of many reasons astronomers put up a Herculean struggle to determine distances to extremely remote objects. Doing so can reveal information about such objects, of course, but also about the universe around them and the way that it behaved when it was very young. Provided, of course, that we take to heart this hard lesson: once we start talking about distances measured in billions of light-years, our own parochial evolution utterly fails us, and we have to be very careful not to extrapolate willy-nilly from our own experience on Earth.

Engineered virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising technology for in vivo gene editing of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here we design and test two different VLP envelopes for human HSPC editing in vitro and in vivo. The first is an optimized version of the baboon envelope BaEVTR, which efficiently transduces human HSPCs in vitro. We show that the optimized BaEVTR VLP enables in vivo editing of β2 microglobulin in long-term human HSPCs (31% at 8 weeks after dosing) and editing of two hemoglobinopathy-relevant loci, BCL11A and HBG1/2 (26% and 7.5%, respectively, at 5 days after dosing), inducing fetal hemoglobin. Our second VLP design uses a CD133-targeted envelope designed to reduce the transduction of mature blood cells and achieves higher in vivo specificity for HSPCs compared to the optimized BaEVTR VLP. As avoiding delivery in filter organs such as the liver would enhance efficiency and safety, we also demonstrate that both VLPs avoid human hepatocytes in a humanized liver model.

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can sustain lifelong production of a diverse range of blood cell types through a hierarchically organized continuum of cell states1,2. Over the past two decades, ex vivo HSPC gene therapy (GT) has become an established treatment for various hematological and metabolic diseases3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 but faces challenges related to the high cost and complexity of autologous gene-modified cell manufacturing, as well as safety concerns regarding conditioning regimens before transplantation9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. A systemic injection of a vector delivering in vivo HSPC GT directly to the natural cellular niche would overcome many limitations by eliminating the need for complex cell manufacturing, prolonged hospitalization and bone marrow (BM) conditioning. An ideal in vivo delivery system should be capable of efficiently reaching long-term multipotent HSPCs in their natural BM while avoiding off-target cells in main filter organs such as the liver.

A recent study described the delivery of genetic payloads in vivo into murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulating an mRNA targeted to CD117, a stem cell factor receptor expressed on murine HSPCs19. However, the in vivo studies were limited to mRNA delivery to induce Cre-lox recombination in reporter mice and underscored that current retargeted LNP delivery systems20 retain substantial biodistribution in off-target filter organs such as the spleen and the liver. This was also seen in another study using a nontargeted LNPs in nonhuman primates21. LNPs are also currently limited in their capacity to incorporate complex gene-editing protein cargos.

In contrast, virus-like particles (VLPs), an envelope-based delivery system lacking a viral genome, can package and deliver complex gene-editing payloads through linkage to the viral capsid protein (gag)22,23,24. These particles offer specific advantages over other delivery systems. First, VLPs can accommodate large ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which, because of their shorter half-life compared to mRNA-encoded editors, can potentially reduce the chances of off-target editing in vivo23. Additionally, delivering RNP instead of mRNA makes editing independent of the transcriptional activation state of target cells, which is especially important when targeting quiescent long-term multipotent HSPCs25. Retargeting of VLPs can be achieved through the engineering of envelope glycoproteins, as achieved for lentiviral vector (LV) constructs26,27,28. To our knowledge, VLPs envelopes have not been engineered for efficient in vivo gene editing of human HSPCs. In this study, we tested two VLP designs.

We first chose the modified Baboon endogenous viral envelope glycoprotein (BaEVTR) because it has a 20-fold higher propensity than the most commonly used vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) to transduce human HSPCs in vitro under conditions of low cytokine activation24,29,30,31,32. BaEVTR is resistant to human complement inactivation and there is no prior exposure to the Baboon endogenous virus in the general human population, which reduces the chances of strong immunogenicity upon the first systemic administration31. We implemented several modifications to BaEVTR. Further engineering the protease site of the BaEVTR cytoplasmic domain could enable a more efficient removal of the R peptide sequence that normally inhibits virus-to-cell fusion31. Because RetroNectin enhances viral-mediated gene transfer to target cells expressing the integrin receptors VLA-4/5 such as human HSPCs33, designing moieties that bind the same integrins could further enhance BaEVTR affinity for human HSPCs. We designed and tested such modifications and demonstrated higher on-target potency in vitro and in vivo.

However, because BaEVTR binds to the widely expressed ASCT1/2 solute carriers, it also transduces mature peripheral blood (PB) cells. To increase specificity to HSPCs by redirecting VLP tropism to a receptor of interest26,34,35, we leveraged Nipah virus (NiV) envelopes because of the modular structure of their fusogen complex36. Engineering of the NiV receptor binding complex to recognize specific cell-surface molecules has been used to target LVs to HSPCs35 but comprehensive in vitro and in vivo validation of this retargeting system is still lacking. We, therefore, equipped VLPs with a newly designed NiV fusion complex, retargeted with custom-engineered binders to the CD133 molecule, and tested this envelope extensively in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating enhanced specificity for human HSPCs compared to BaEVTR.

Lastly, we showed that both engineered envelopes avoid human hepatocytes upon systemic administration in vivo in a humanized liver mouse model, a feature that would be beneficial in clinical application.

For our initial tests, we leveraged LV constructs carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene under the control of a spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter and pseudotyped with two envelope proteins commonly used to transduce ex vivo human HSPCs: VSV-G and BaEVTR (Fig. 1a). To best simulate in vivo delivery scenarios, we used an in vitro protocol designed to test transduction of human HSPCs without cytokine stimulation (Supplementary Information and Extended Data Fig. 1a–f). We performed transductions with varying dilutions of VSV-G LV or BaEVTR LV co-delivered with the Vectofusin-1 (VF1) adjuvant37 for 24 h. In line with previous findings in low cytokine stimulation conditions37, the BaEVTR LV demonstrated significantly higher potency on transducing resting CD34+ cells as compared to the VSV-G LV (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). To show that BaEVTR can access all HSPC subtypes in resting conditions, we sorted five distinct progenitors using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Supplementary Information Fig. 1) and exposed each HSPC subpopulation to BaEVTR LV using the same transduction conditions used for the bulk CD34+ population. As shown in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2b, we achieved equivalent levels of transduction in all progenitor subtypes at multiplicities of infection (MOIs) 32 and 158, respectively, including HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (average: 18% and 61%). This result demonstrates the potential of BaEVTR to access a population of cells endowed with long-term multilineage potential in their resting state.

We next sought to develop BaEVTR envelope variants with increased in vivo potency and affinity for human HSPCs. Firstly, we swapped the cleavage site used by the murine leukemia virus (MLV) protease to cleave the cytoplasmic tail of the BaEVTR molecule with a MA/CA (MACA) cleavage site, which is recognized by a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease38 (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, we added a custom-designed surface molecule encompassing the VLA-4-binding and VLA-5-binding domains from the C-domain and CS-1 site, respectively, of the RetroNectin recombinant fibronectin fragment39,40 (Fig. 1e). We tested this construct, called codisplay (CoD), in LV vectors. As shown in Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2e, we could measure increasingly higher titers in vitro in resting CD34+ cells, adding the MACA cleavage site first and then the CoD construct to our BaEVTR LV. Overall, the resulting BaEVTR-CoD LV (defined from this point on as including both MACA and CoD modifications; Fig. 1g) showed higher on-target potency in vitro versus the standard BaEVTR LV construct.

We next aimed to validate the potency these envelopes in vivo using NOD.Cg-Kit−41JTyr+PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/ThomJ (NBSGW) mice41 humanized with mobilized PB CD34+ cells. In this short-term humanized experimental design (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Fig. 2) human HSPCs reside almost exclusively in the BM and are not yet heavily skewed toward lymphoid progenitors (LPs). In this scenario, we observed that administering AMD3100 before particle dosing did not induce HSPC egress to the PB but enhanced transduction of HSPCs within the BM niche (Supplementary Text, Extended Data Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 2). Addressing the volumetric limitations of intravenous (IV) dosing in mice, we tested a dosing schedule over three consecutive days achieving 7.5% transduction of BM human CD45+ (huCD45+) cells with a BaEVTR LV 5 days after the last dose (Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e).

To compare the performance of our vector designs in vivo, we then administered three consecutive doses of a BaEVTR LV or BaEVTR-CoD LV in short-term humanized NBSGW mice (Fig. 1h) and followed up treated animals for 16 weeks. To monitor BM engraftment dynamics over the course of the study, we characterized the changes in relative contribution of four populations enriched in primitive (P, CD34+CD13/CD33+), myeloid (M, CD34−CD13/CD33+), LP (CD34−CD13/CD33−) and L (CD34−CD13/CD33−) cells (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Fig. 3). Confirming the in vitro results, we detected a significantly higher percentage of GFP+ cells at week 16 in the BM huCD45+ cell compartment of mice treated with the BaEVTR-CoD LV versus the standard BaEVTR LV (Fig. 1i). Over time, we observed a higher percentage of transduced HSPCs in the BaEVTR-CoD LV group (Fig. 1j). Similar dynamics were detected measuring the percentage of GFP+ cells in the four BM fractions described above, particularly concerning the LP and L cell populations (Fig. 1k). Accordingly, the BaEVTR-CoD LV displayed higher long-term transduction levels in the PB not only in the long-lived mature CD19+ lymphocytes but also in the PB CD13+CD33+ M cell population (Fig. 1l), reflecting the output of gene-modified long-term multipotent stem cells. These transduction levels were also confirmed molecularly by vector copy number (VCN) evaluation (Extended Data Fig. 3f). A similar percentage of GFP+ cells was observed in the spleen-resident huCD45+ cell progeny again showing superior long-term transduction using the BaEVTR-CoD LV over the BaEVTR LV (Fig. 1m). Histology performed on sterna collected from treated animals at different time points after infusion showed colocalization of human nuclei and GFP signals both in proximity of sinusoidal vessels and in the endosteum, confirming the stable transduction by both vectors not only of committed progenitors but also of long-term HSCs, which are more likely to reside in the endosteal niche (Supplementary Fig. 4). Overall, these data support the use of the MACA and CoD modification in combination with the BaEVTR envelope in an LV construct.

To incorporate these envelopes into VLP constructs, we first generated a BaEVTR VLP carrying a β2 microglobulin (B2M) guide RNA (gRNA) (Supplementary Information Table 1) and a CRISPR–Cas9 editor covalently fused with a MLV capsid22(Fig. 2a). We chose to target the B2M locus because it provides a surrogate flow cytometry (FC) readout for gene editing, as exemplified in Fig. 2b. In vitro on resting HSPCs (same protocol as described in Extended Data Fig. 1a), the efficiency was 75% B2M− cells as measured by FC, corresponding to up to 93% of edited alleles, as measured by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the B2M locus (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2). We next isolated five HSPC fractions and exposed them individually in resting conditions to the BaEVTR VLP. This particle was capable of efficiently editing all HSPC subtypes including HSC (6.7% and 38% editing at MOI 16 and 28% and 61% at MOI 83 as measured by FC and HTS, respectively; Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4a). These results underscored that the FC assessment of B2M− cells tends to underestimate the editing efficiency of our VLP, particularly in the more quiescent HSPC subtypes such as HSCs and MPPs. When measuring the relative proportion of editing variants in each HSPC subtype, we could observe that the predominant fraction was constituted by deletions. Notably, the granulocyte/macrophage progenitor fraction hosted a substantially higher number of insertion events as compared to the other subpopulations, suggesting that more committed progenitors may be biased toward resolving edits by insertion (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Once dosed in vivo in a pilot short-term study, our BaEVTR VLP achieved 20% and 47% B2M− cells (as measured by FC) corresponding to 47% and 71% B2M editing, as measured by HTS, 5 days after one dose and three doses, respectively (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 5a–d). Repeating the single-dose arm of this study in an NBSGW mouse at 9 weeks after humanization, where BM is fully humanized (~85% huCD45+), yielded comparable levels of B2M− HSPCs (Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 5e–g).

Next, we conducted a comprehensive long-term study to assess permanent editing of long-term human HSPCs, with a terminal readout at week 16 (Fig. 2f). Firstly, we could confirm that 6.4% of edited huCD45+ cells could still be detected by FC readout in the BM of the treated animals 16 weeks after dosing (Fig. 2g). Over time, we noticed a substantially higher initial fraction of B2M− cells (48%), dropping from week 4 to week 8, which may have resulted from the exhaustion of edited short-living progenitors. This level remained stable at ~8% from week 8 through the end of the study (Fig. 2h). These data were reflected by similar editing levels at week 16 in several HSPC subtypes including the HSC and MPP population (Fig. 2i). Examining the editing levels in the four main human BM cell fractions over time, the largest drop in B2M− cells between week 4 and week 8 was indeed observed in the L and LP subpopulations (Fig. 2j), representing the most active progenitors during this phase of human cell engraftment in the mouse BM. We observed comparable dynamics in the mature human PB progeny over time with final readouts at week 16 showing an average of 3.5%, 2.5% and 3.9% B2M− cells in the huCD45+, huCD13+CD33+ and huCD19+ fractions, respectively (Fig. 2k). The spleen displayed a similar level of HSPC edited cells at week 16 as compared to the BM (Fig. 2l).

Because we showed that the FC readout tends to underestimate the level of B2M editing, we next performed a comprehensive analysis of molecular editing at all time points by HTS. Results showed a discrepancy with the FC readout in the PB, whereby the editing efficiency measured by HTS at week 4 was 71% (versus the 45% measured by FC) and, at week 16, the percentage of edited alleles was still 27% (versus the 3.5% measured by FC) (Fig. 2m). Comparable results were observed from HTS conducted on the four BM fractions reflecting the dynamics measured by FC but highlighting higher levels of editing (Fig. 2n). This was mirrored by the preservation of 28% edited alleles in the least differentiated MPP fraction, which overall resulted in the maintenance of 29% editing of the total huCD45+ cell population measured by HTS at the end of the study (versus the 6.4% measured by FC) (Fig. 2o). The discrepancy between FC and HTS data suggested that the most differentiated cells could carry monoallelic edits or editing variants whose effect on B2M expression is not easily identifiable by FC. Looking at the selection of editing variants in PB cells over time, we noticed that, while the percentage of deletions remained relatively stable over time (21% at week 4 versus 17% at week 16), the relative fraction of insertions dropped from 43% at week 4 to 7.4% at the end of the study (Fig. 2p). We observed a similar negative selection for insertions events over time across all BM fractions (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overall, these data showed that the BaEVTR VLP achieved high editing in resting human HSPCs in vitro and in long-term BM HSPCs in vivo, which was maintained for at least 16 weeks after vector dosing.

Next, we designed and produced a BaEVTR-CoD VLP (Fig. 3a) and tested it in vitro on resting huCD34+ cells. The data show progressively higher titers in vitro in resting HSPCs adding the MACA cleavage site and the CoD as compared to the original BaEVTR VLP construct (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b), similarly to what was shown for the LV constructs. For an 8-week in vivo study in mice, we administered three consecutive IV doses of a BaEVTR VLP carrying the MACA cleavage site, with or without CoD, on days 7–9 after humanization to overcome single-bolus dosing volume limitations (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In line with the results obtained in vitro, we detected a significantly higher percentage of B2M− cells, measured by FC on BM huCD45+ cells at week 8, in the group treated with the BaEVTR-CoD VLP versus the BaEVTR VLP design (Fig. 3b). A similar trend was observed when looking at the B2M− cell contribution in the BM HSPC compartment (Fig. 3c), in all BM fractions (Fig. 3d), over time in all main PB populations (Fig. 3e) and in the BM progeny found in the spleen on the day of takedown (Fig. 3f). We could confirm the superior in vivo performance of our BaEVTR-CoD VLP construct when measuring the levels of molecular edits by HTS in the PB over time (Fig. 3g) and in the BM at takedown (Fig. 3h,i). We also show that the introduction of the CoD did not alter the in vivo detection of the editing variants observed in the B2M locus with respect to what was observed with the BaEVTR VLP design (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Next, we studied editing at loci of therapeutic relevance for human hemoglobinopathies (Fig. 3j). One BaEVTR-CoD VLP was designed to carry a cargo composed by an ABE8e adenine base editor (ABE)42 fused to the MLV gag protein and gRNA for editing the GATA1-binding site of the human BCL11A gene. A second BaEVTR-CoD VLP was produced to deliver a CRISPR–Cas9 nuclease and a gRNA for disrupting the BCL11A-binding site in the HBG1/2 promoter region. An overview of guide targets and designs is provided in Fig. 3k and Supplementary Table 1. Upon in vitro titration in resting CD34+ cells, we confirmed by HTS the ability of these two cargos to either induce an A>T to G>C conversion in the GATA-binding site of the BCL11A locus (average titer of 4.4 × 105 with 82% editing at top dose) or to disrupt the BCL11A-binding site of the HGB1/2 locus (average titer of 4.9 × 104 with 26% editing at top dose), although the efficiency of editing was lower than that achieved with an identical construct targeting the B2M locus. We next tested these two VLPs in short-term humanized NBSGW mice and measured by HTS the editing efficiencies in the human BM fraction at the two loci 5 days after vector dosing (Extended Data Fig. 6e). We obtained, in BM huCD45+ cells, 26% A>G base conversion in the BCL11A target site and 7.5% editing of the HBG1/2 locus (Fig. 3l). When looking at the editing variants obtained with the ABE cargo, we observed 59% conversion of A>G at both target nucleotides and 40% conversion of the A nucleotide immediately downstream of the GATA-binding site (Fig. 3m, left). On the other hand, the relative contribution of the editing variants introduced by the CRISPR–Cas9 editor in the HBG1/2 locus was in line with that observed for the B2M gene (Fig. 3m, right).

Lastly, we assessed effects of the edits on inducing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) upon erythroid differentiation of the gene-edited HSPCs. We isolated CD34+ cells from the BM of the mice dosed in vivo with our VLPs and performed a colony assay in a semisolid medium containing cytokines promoting erythroid differentiation. We observed similar proportions of granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colony-forming units (CFU) and erythroid cell burst-forming units (BFU) in all treated animals as compared to the untreated group (Extended Data Fig. 6f). However, when looking at the HbF expression in our colonies by FC, we detected a higher percentage of HbF+ cells and a higher HbF mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the mice dosed with our VLPs, as compared to the untreated animals (used as controls for the expected background HbF induction resulting from this in vitro assay) (Fig. 3n,o). Overall, these data demonstrate that our BaEVTR-CoD VLP is effective with different editors and gRNAs and in loci of therapeutic relevance.

To restrict tropism to HSPCs by targeting HSPC-specific receptors, we also explored the potential of engineering the binder component of the NiV fusogen (Fig. 4a) to recognize the CD133 molecule expressed on human HSPCs. We chose CD133 as target because this receptor is absent from the surface of mature blood cell lineages43 while it is expressed on HSPCs at higher density than CD117 (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

We tested the system first with LV vectors. We generated two CD133-targeted LV constructs (NiV-CD133) carrying the engineered fusogen alone or in combination with a CoD (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Material). In human HSPCs in vitro in the same conditions used above for the BaEVTR LV, we found that NiV-CD133 LV and BaEVTR LV showed similar titers on resting CD34+ cells (Fig. 4b). Comparing CD34+ cells (expected to express the CD133 target molecule) and CD3+ T cells (which are instead CD133−) to the broadly tropic VSV-G LV and BaEVTR LV as controls, we found that NiV-CD133 vectors efficiently transduced CD34+ HSPCs in both stimulated and resting conditions while exhibiting negligible levels of T cell transduction even upon cytokine activation. These results were obtained using NiV-CD133 at a higher physical particle concentration compared to the VSV-G LV or the BaEVTR LV (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Testing NiV-CD133 LV against HSPCs or T cells in vitro at different dilutions, we confirmed that the specificity for CD133+ HSPCs was maintained at all doses, irrespective of the presence of the CoD (Fig. 4c). In vitro tests in immortalized cell lines confirmed the tropism of our NiV-CD133 construct for CD133+ cells (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Fig. 6). The addition of CoD preserved the behavior of the engineered particles while increasing on-target titers with respect to the NiV-CD133 construct without CoD (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We next expanded our specificity analysis to a broader set of human primary cells, including endothelial cells, epithelial cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). All vectors were equivalently tolerated at all doses by the primary cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 7). The results highlighted again the high selectivity of the NiV-CD133 LV for CD34+ cells relative to other CD133− cell types (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Importantly, while enhancing transduction, the introduction of VF1 did not alter the overall tropism of the NiV-CD133 constructs (Supplementary Information Fig. 7). Across the remaining test panel, varying degrees of transduction were observed. The RNA-seq analysis underscores the correlation of these results with the expression levels of genes encoding known target receptors for VSV-G (LDLR) and BaEVTR (ASCT1/2), as well as CD133 and the CoD target molecules VLA-4 and VLA-5 (Supplementary Text, Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Data 2–4). Taken together, these data show the specific tropism of our NiV-CD133-CoD construct for human HSPCs.

We next compared NiV-CD133-CoD LV and BaEVTR LV in the NBSGW model. Both the density of CD133 and the frequency of CD133+ cells change rapidly during early human engraftment (Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), making this experimental setting suboptimal for testing CD133-targeted particles. Therefore, we dosed our NiV-CD133-CoD LVs immediately after the infusion of CD34+ cells when the surface expression of the CD133 marker in huCD34+ cells would still be at physiological levels (Fig. 4e). To test specificity for HSPCs over mature blood cells, we infused a group of mice with a mix of 5.0 × 105 CD34+ cells diluted in 1.0 × 107 huCD133− human PB mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the same donor. This was immediately followed by dosing of BaEVTR LV or NiV-CD133-CoD LV at 3.3 × 108 transduction units (TU) per mouse and 7.8 × 107 TU per mouse, respectively. We then measured transduction efficiency on day 12, comparing the results to the group of mice infused only with huCD34+ cells.

As expected, on day 7 and day 12 after infusion, the mice dosed with CD34+ PBMCs showed a substantially higher fraction of mature PB blood cells, including CD3+ T cells, acting as a potential off-target cell population compared to the mice dosed with CD34+ cells only (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8c). The BaEVTR LV showed higher transduction of total huCD45+ cells in the CD34+ PBMC-infused group (24%) as compared to the NiV-CD133-CoD LV-treated mice (19%), although this difference was not significant (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Conversely, in the same group, we observed a significantly higher transduction of HSPCs in animals dosed with the NiV-CD133-CoD LV (20%) versus the BaEVTR LV (14%) (Fig. 4g). The NiV-CD133-CoD LV also showed higher specificity for BM CD133+ cells compared to the BaEVTR LV, regardless of the presence of human PBMC at the time of dosing (Fig. 4h,i). Concordantly, we detected more GFP+ cells in the P and LP cell fractions of animals receiving the NiV-CD133-CoD LV as compared to BaEVTR LV, which instead transduced the more mature M and L cell populations with higher efficiency (Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 8e). Moreover, in the CD34+ PBMC-infused group, the NiV-CD133-CoD LV displayed significantly lower transduction of mature PB cells on day 12 compared to the BaEVTR LV (Fig. 4k). We further discuss the results obtained in this experimental setting and in a related experiment using short-term humanized mice in the Supplementary Text (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). Overall, these data show the higher in vivo specificity of the NiV-CD133-CoD construct for human HSPCs compared to a broadly tropic vector.

We next explored whether this engineered envelope could be efficiently incorporated in a VLP. We tested multiple versions of an NiV-CD133 VLP (Fig. 5a), combining this envelope design with the CoD construct and an MLV or HIV capsid. All NiV-CD133 VLPs were able to efficiently edit resting CD34+ in vitro, although their titers were substantially lower than what was observed with the BaEVTR VLP design (Fig. 5b). The VLP showing the highest editing potency at higher dilutions was the NiV-CD133-CoD VLP combined with HIV gag. Therefore, we assessed the on-target potency of this construct in vivo. We used the same experimental conditions described above, dosing a BaEVTR VLP (at 1.8 × 107 editing units (EU) per mouse) or the NiV-CD133-CoD VLP (at 5.7 × 106 EU per mouse) immediately after CD34+ cell infusion (Fig. 5c).

Source data

Despite having dosed the NiV-CD133-CoD VLP at a threefold lower functional dose as compared to the BaEVTR VLP, we achieved similar levels of editing in PB huCD45+ cells in both groups over time up to week 8 after dosing (Fig. 5d). While we did not observe significant differences in the percentage of PB edited huCD45+ cells at the end of the study (Fig. 5e, left), in the BM, we detected almost twofold higher editing with the BaEVTR VLP formulation (Fig. 5e, middle). However, when gating on the few CD133+ cells detectable in the BM at week 8 after humanization, the percentage of edited cells was comparable in the two treated groups (Fig. 5e, right). This was the result of a significantly higher enrichment of CD133+ cells within the B2M− cells generated with the NiV-CD133-CoD VLP versus the BaEVTR VLP (Fig. 5f), underscoring that the CD133-retargeted VLP displays a higher specificity for CD133+ cells as compared to BaEVTR. Measuring the editing efficiency by HTS, we could again highlight that the FC readout tends to underestimate the actual editing levels obtained over time with the two VLPs (Fig. 5g). The HTS data obtained on BM huCD45+ cells at week 8 confirmed that the two constructs reached a comparable editing efficiency (5.6% with the BaEVTR VLP versus 5.5% with the NiV-CD133-CoD VLP; Fig. 5h). Overall, these data demonstrate that our NiV-CD133-CoD VLP enables sustained in vivo gene editing in human hematopoietic cells, reflecting efficient delivery of gene-editing cargos to long-term HSPCs, even at low doses, because of its specificity for CD133+ cells.

Both BaEVTR-CoD and NiV-CD133-CoD LVs showed a potential to transduce PHHs in vitro (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7). To investigate this aspect, we exploited the Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− (FRG) mouse model, which can host a liver humanized with PHH44,45. At 84 days after liver humanization, we injected FRG mice with three IV doses of BaEVTR LV (1.3 × 109 TU per mouse per dose), BaEVTR-CoD LV (1.3 × 109 TU per mouse per dose), NiV-CD133-LV (7.3 × 108 TU per mouse per dose) or NiV-CD133-CoD LV (2.2 × 108 TU per mouse per dose), resembling the dosing schedule and levels used in the NBSGW mice (Fig. 5i). As a positive control, we dosed a group of animals with one single dose of a VSV-G LV (2.7 × 109 TU per mouse per dose), which is known to transduce human hepatocytes. Unlike the in vitro measurements, we observed negligible transduction of both human hepatocytes and mouse nonparenchymal cells (NPCs; including Kupffer cells) in the humanized liver of the FRG mice 14 days after treatment with either the BaEVTR or the NiV-CD133 LVs with or without CoD compared to the transduction observed in the VSV-G LV-treated group (Fig. 5j).

These data were confirmed by liver histology for measuring colocalization of human nuclei and GFP signal (Extended Data Fig. 10). The contrasting findings with the in vitro titration experiment described above arise from the artificial perturbation of the physiological expression profile of the ASCT2 gene in PHH upon in vitro culture (Supplementary Text and Extended Data Fig. 8f–h). Thus, both BaEVTR-CoD and NiV-CD133-CoD envelopes avoid human hepatocytes upon systemic administration.

We developed and tested envelope-engineered particles that enable efficient, specific gene editing in HSPCs both in vitro and in vivo while avoiding human hepatocytes.

To assess the potency and tropism of our engineered envelopes, we used LV vectors, which allowed for easy measurement of GFP expression using FC and histology, with the latter providing detailed insights into biodistribution in the BM (Supplementary Fig. 4) and liver (Extended Data Fig. 10). We first engineered BaEVTR, modifying the protease site and adding the CoD surface molecule. These modifications were tested in vitro and in vivo resulting in unaltered tropism but improved on-target potency. In this regard, the in vivo data shown in Fig. 1 indicate that the CoD construct may enhance access to long-term HSCs, as evidenced by higher transduction at late time points in all compartments in the BaEVTR-CoD LV-treated group.

The observation that AMD3100 boosts transduction even without relying on HSPC egress into the PB (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c) opens possibilities for further research. Potential mechanisms include enhanced HSPC proliferation, alterations in the BM microenvironment facilitating vector penetration, increased receptor expression on HSPCs or temporary disruption of the adhesion of HSPCs to their niche46,47.

After validating BaEVTR constructs in vitro and in vivo with LV vectors, we incorporated the envelope moieties into VLPs carrying gene-editing cargo. To our knowledge, no published study has assessed baboon-derived envelopes for in vivo gene editing in human HSPCs. The introduction of CoD in the BaEVTR VLP improved in vitro and in vivo potency similarly to the LV design. The results in Fig. 3e show an almost twofold higher editing efficiency in the PB CD13+CD33+ population 1 week after vector dosing using the BaEVTR-CoD VLP versus the BaEVTR VLP (47% versus 25%, respectively). At the same time point, the two VLP configurations displayed similar editing levels in the early PB L population (61% versus 60%, respectively). This suggests that CoD might have facilitated gene editing of M progenitors or multipotent stem cells during the early phases of BM engraftment.

To improve specificity for human HSPCs, we also engineered NiV fusogens to recognize the CD133 molecule. When paired with the CoD modification and tested in vivo in the presence of PB mature cell sinks, the retargeted NiV-CD133-CoD LV displayed significantly higher specificity for HSPCs as compared to BaEVTR vectors. The NiV-CD133-CoD VLPs exhibited lower in vitro potency than BaEVTR VLP, suggesting that further optimization is needed. Nonetheless, the lower in vitro titers were balanced in vivo by the higher specificity for HSPCs of the NiV-CD133-CoD VLP, resulting in editing efficacy similar to that of the BaEVTR VLP.

Upon systemic delivery in FRG mice hosting human hepatocytes, we observed minimal transduction of this key population by both engineered envelopes compared to the results obtained using a standard VSV-G formulation. To our knowledge, no previous data on the uptake of BaEVTR or Nipah particles by human hepatocytes in vivo have been published.

By studying two different envelope configurations, we demonstrated the modularity of VLPs for in vivo HSPC GT, showing that the CoD modification enhances particle potency across different envelope architectures and that hepatocyte avoidance can be achieved with multiple envelope designs. Accumulation in the liver is a limitation of current LNP systems. Moreover, using information available in Li et al.48, we estimate that LNP doses targeting HSPCs are typically much higher than the particle doses used in our study (~2.0 × 1016–2.0 × 1017 LNPs versus ~3.0 × 1012 VLPs). Further studies are needed to compare VLPs and LNPs, given their differences in biodistribution, cellular uptake and gene delivery efficiency.

Another important topic for future research is the immunogenicity of our modified vectors. Pseudotypes and other viral components have been assessed for compatibility with in vivo delivery on the basis of the expected human immune recognition of these particles. For instance, while measles virus and NiV share similar glycoprotein subunits, NiV components have minimal neutralizing antibodies in the human population, in contrast to measles35,49. Additionally, LV vectors have been dosed systemically in immunocompetent nonhuman primate studies without adverse events, although immunosuppressants were sometimes used50. We anticipate that the human immune system could respond to BaEVTR-derived or NiV-derived envelopes, potentially limiting on-target bioavailability and redosing possibilities. Both BaEVTR-derived and NiV-derived envelopes appear resistant to human complement inactivation31,35,51.

Lastly, from a translational standpoint, our finding of stable gene editing in 27% of long-term HSCs achieved with VLPs may provide a basis for developing a gene-editing system for treating sickle cell disease52 and other hemoglobinopathies. In this regard, we demonstrated that VLPs are versatile and capable of carrying base editors and/or delivering gRNA for editing clinically relevant loci in human HSPCs.

Amino acid sequences for VSV-G, BaEVTR31 and BaEVTR_MACA variant were codon-optimized, synthesized (ATUM or Twist) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (VSV-G) or pTwist-CMV-β-globin (BaEVTR) plasmid backbones. Nipah G and F amino acid sequences were similarly codon-optimized and cloned into pCAGGS backbone. Blinded Nipah G protein (four point mutations in head) was engineered with binders through a flexible 3×G4S linker at the C terminus. G and F proteins also incorporated cytoplasmic tail modifications to enable pseudotyping35. Single-domain antibodies targeting huCD133 were obtained from the literature. Anti-CD133 scFv sequences were obtained from the literature and cloned into the blinded Nipah G protein C terminus (ATUM). The RetroNectin CoD sequence was determined by screening a library of constructs with combinatorial optimizations of the retronectin CS-1 and C-domains, transmembrane anchor domains and linkers between the different segments. These amino acid sequences were codon-optimized and cloned into pTwist-CMV-β-globin plasmid backbone. The lead sequence was selected on the basis of the highest titers on resting CD34+ cells. When Nipah G and F proteins were used in the context of retargeting to the huCD133 receptor, additional G cytoplasmic tail and linker modifications and F modifications were screened for improved on-target titers with this composition. Briefly, for the Nipah G modifications, cytoplasmic tails from related paramyxoviruses or from unrelated viruses that were identified to pseudotype retroviral vectors with high titers were synthesized and cloned into the G protein along with diversification of the linker between the G head and the binder (ATUM). Linker length and flexibility were varied according to sequences in the literature. The Nipah G variant library was screened for improvements in on-target versus off-target cell line titers. The top 20 variants were then screened in combination with the top Nipah F variants that were separately screened in the same manner. Lead G and F combinations were then made at larger scale and concentrated, followed by testing on primary CD34+ cells in vitro.

HEK-293T Lenti-X cells were obtained from Takara (632180) and maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10569-044) with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10437028). Suspension HEK-293T clones were generated and screened for highest titer production of BaEVTR LV vectors or MLV Gag–Cas9 VLP vectors. Briefly, the parental HEK-293T clone was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CRL-3216). After adaptation to suspension culture and growth in serum-free medium, the top clones were tested for the production of LV vectors. The top ten clones with the highest p24 concentration in pg ml−1 and functional titer were then furthered screened for the highest functional titer of BaEVTR LV vectors or BaEVTR MLV VLP vectors. The top clone (SCC4180) was then further used for production and maintained in LV-MAX medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A4124004) when culturing. HEK-293T Lenti-X cells were engineered to overexpress huCD133 by standard LV transduction. Briefly, transfer plasmids were constructed to express full-length codon-optimized huCD133 (NP_006008.1) coding sequences, followed by an IRES–puromycin cassette. VSV-G-pseudotyped LV vectors were produced with transfer plasmid and HEK-293T Lenti-X cells were transduced at multiple vector doses. Then, 3 days after transduction, cells were treated with 1 μg ml−1 puromycin and assessed for huCD133 expression by FC after ten more days. Conditions with the appropriate expression levels were expanded and clonally sorted into 96-well plates. Clones were grown for 2–3 weeks and checked for expression stability by FC. Clones that maintained a high and tight expression level (HEK CD133 overexpression), with minimal silencing, were chosen for future experiments.

For LV vectors produced from adherent 293T Lenti-X cells, fusogen plasmids were combined with psPAX2 and a transgene vector containing enhanced GFP under the control of an SFFV promoter in the pSF backbone at a 0.2:0.3:0.5 ratio of fusogen, packaging and transgene, respectively. Plasmids were complexed with TransIT-293 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, MIR 2706) and added to producer cells that were seeded the day prior, reaching 60–80% confluency at the time of transfection. The next day, a full medium exchange was performed. On the second day after transfection, the cell supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min to pellet any producer cells. After passing through a 0.45-µm filter, crude material was aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C. For 100× or 300× concentrations, vectors were concentrated by 90-min ultracentrifugation over a sucrose cushion, followed by resuspension in formulation buffer. Concentrated LV vectors were aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C for later use. For LV vectors produced from suspension 293T clones, fusogen plasmids were combined with pALD-GagPol and pALD-Rev packaging plasmids (Aldevron), along with the pSF-SFFV-GFP transgene plasmid, at a 0.16:0.21:0.11:0.52 ratio of fusogen, Rev, GagPol and transgene, respectively. Plasmids were complexed with PEIpro transfection reagent (Polyplus/Sartorius) and added to producer cells that were seeded at 2.5 × 106 cells per ml 1–2 h before transfection. For Nipah fusogens, the G and F plasmid ratio was optimized for the highest titer depending on the targeting binder. The next day, 5 mM sodium butyrate was added to the culture. On the second day after transfection, cell supernatant was harvested as described above and crude or concentrated LV vectors were obtained. For VLPs produced from suspension 293T clones, fusogen plasmids were combined with MLV-based or HIV-based GagPol and Gag–Cas9 plasmids, along with the gRNA plasmid at a 0.475:0.36:0.115:0.05 ratio of gRNA, MLV GagPol, MLV Gag–Cas9 and BaEVTR, respectively, or 0.364:0.238:0.238:0.128:0.032 ratio of gRNA, HIV GagPol, HIV Gag–Cas9, Nipah F and Nipah G, respectively. The Gag–Cas9 fusion strategy was adapted from a previously described protocol22,24. For 100× or 300× concentrations of LV or VLP vectors, freshly harvested crude supernatant was concentrated by 90-min ultracentrifugation or overnight (20–24 h) centrifugation at 4,100g over a sucrose cushion, followed by resuspension in formulation buffer. Concentrated LV vectors were aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C for later use. All absolute particle calculations reported in the manuscript for LVs and VLPs were performed on the basis of the results of ELISA assays for p24 (QuickTiter lentivirus titer kit, lentivirus-associated HIV p24) and p30 (QuickTiter MuLV core antigen ELISA kit), respectively.

To determine functional titer (TU per ml for LVs or EU per ml for VLPs), cell lines were seeded in 96-well tissue culture-treated plates (30,000 cells per well for all HEK-293T lines) and then crude or concentrated vectors were serial diluted onto the cells 2–4 h after cell seeding. In the case of NiV-CD133 constructs, titers were determined on the HEK CD133 overexpression cell line (generated as described above) because of the low permissiveness for transduction by CD133-targeted vectors of the parental HEK-293T cell line, which expresses low endogenous levels of huCD133. For LVs, cells were analyzed for GFP 3–4 days after vector addition. For VLPs, cells were analyzed for B2M knockout 6–7 days after vector addition. GFP and B2M were both analyzed by FC. Cells were harvested from the 96-well plates, washed and incubated with Draq7 viability dye to determine live cells before assessing GFP expression. For B2M readout, cells were blocked in cell stain buffer (Biolegend, 420201) and stained with anti-B2M antibody (1:100; Biolegend, 316306). After washing, cells were incubated with Draq7 and analyzed by FC. Functional titers were calculated from the vector dilution at which the percentage GFP+ or B2M− values were in the 5–20% range. When LVs or VLPs were dosed on the basis of MOI, specific calculations were used. The cell line titer that was determined above was used to calculate the total number of TUs in the given volumetric dose of vector to the cells in vitro. The total number of TUs applied was divided by the number of cells in the well at the time of vector delivery to determine the MOI.

Cryopreserved granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and Plerixafor-mobilized PB-derived CD34+ cells (Allcells) were thawed in StemSpan SFEM II medium (StemCell Technologies, 09065) supplemented with Glutamax (Thermo Fisher, 35050061) and penicillin–streptomycin (PS; Thermo Fisher, 15140122). Then, 100 μl of cells were plated in a round-bottom 96-well plate at 2 × 105 viable cells per mL. After overnight rest in a 37 °C incubator, 100 μl of diluted vector + vectofusin (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-111-163) was added at a final concentration of 12 μg ml−1. After 24 h of transduction, StemSpan SFEM II medium containing 2× CC110 cytokine cocktail (StemCell Technologies, 02697) was added. After 6–7 days in culture with cytokines, we assessed the degree of transduction by GFP expression on a BD Fortessa instrument. The CC110 cytokine cocktail was excluded from media in the experimental groups described in Fig. 1c,d. To assess the off-target risk, cells were seeded at 100 µl according to the number from Supplementary Table 1 in flat-bottom 96-well plates before transduction. The vectors were normalized to receive 1 TU per cell on the basis of their titers on CD34+ primary cells. Vectors were prediluted on culture medium and vectofusin (Milteny Biotec, 130-111-163) was added to them to a final concentration of 12 µg ml−1. Then, 100 µl of the vector–vectofusin mix was added to the cells. Human PB pan-T (StemCell Technologies, 70024) and CD34+ cells were tested for transduction efficiency on their activated versus unactivated (resting) phase. The activated pan-T cells received interleukin 2 (IL-2) cytokine (StemCell Technologies, 78036.2) and CD3/CD28 activator beads (StemCell Technologies, 10991), whereas the activated CD34+ cells received a CC110 cytokine cocktail (StemCell Technologies, 02697) before transduction. The resting arms were activated 24 h after transduction with the same activation cocktail. A medium change was performed on day 4. The analysis of the transduction efficiency was performed by FC and VCN assay on day 7 after transduction. SupT1 (ATCC, CRL-1942), Raji (ATCC, CCL-86) and KG1A (ATCC, CCL-246.1) cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium + 10% FBS. HEK-293 Lenti-X cell lines were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. Caco-2 cell lines (ATCC, HTB-37) were cultured in EMEM + 10% FBS. Hulec-5a cell lines (ATCC, CRL-3244) were cultured in MCDB131 medium, without L-glutamine, supplemented with 10 ng ml−1 epidermal growth factor, 1 μg ml−1 hydrocortisone, 10 mM glutamine and 10% FBS. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; ATCC, CRL-1730) were cultured in Vasculife medium + vasculife supplement. For primary cell culture, activated and resting pan-T cells were cultured in Immunocult supplemented with 10 ng ml−1 IL-2 and PS. Human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (ScienCell, 3200) were cultured on lysine-coated plates in alveolar (AEpiCM) medium supplemented with FBS, endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) and PS. Human renal epithelial cells (ScienCell, 4120) were cultured on lysine-coated plates in EpiCM medium supplemented with FBS, ECGS and PS. Human lymphatic endothelial cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated plates in endothelial cell medium supplemented with FBS, ECGS and PS. Human aortic endothelial cells (ATCC, PCS-100-011), human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (ATCC, PCS-100-022) and human coronary artery endothelial cells (ATCC, PCS-100-020) were cultured in Vasculife medium + supplement. PHHs (Lonza, HUCPI) were cultured in hepatocyte basal medium + supplement.

For in vivo studies, we used two FC panels. For the lineage-positive panel, cells were washed in PBS, incubated with Human TruStain FcX receptor block (Biolegend, 422302; 1:20 in BSA stain buffer (BD Biosciences, 554657)) and stained with an antibody cocktail consisting of CD34 PE (BD Biosciences, 348057), CD15 AF700 (Biolegend, 323026), CD14 APC (Biolegend, 367118), CD3 BV421 (Biolegend, 344834), CD19 PE/Cy7 (Biolegend, 302216), CD33 BV650 (Biolegend, 303430), CD13 BV650 (BD Biosciences, 740567), huCD45 BV711 (Biolegend, 304050), msCD45 BV605 (Biolegend, 103140) and CD41 PE/Dazzle 594 (Biolegend, 303732). Immediately before running the samples on FC, cells were stained with 7-AAD (Biolegend 420404). For the lineage-negative panel, cells were washed in PBS and stained with live–dead fixable near-infrared dead cell stain kit for 633-nm or 635-nm excitation (Invitrogen, L10119). Subsequently, cells were incubated with Human TruStain FcX receptor block (Biolegend, 422302; 1:20 in BSA stain buffer (BD Biosciences, 554657)). The lineage-negative antibody cocktail consisted of the following fluorescent antibodies: huCD45 PE/Cy7 (Biolegend, 304016), msCD45 BV605 (Biolegend, 103140), CD34 APC (BD Biosciences, 345804), CD38 PE/Cy5 (Biolegend, 103149), Pacific Blue anti-human lineage cocktail (CD3, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20 and CD56; Biolegend, 348805), CD15 Pacific Blue (Biolegend, 980504), CD90 PE/CF594 (BD Biosciences, 562385), CD45RA BV711 (BD Biosciences, 740806), CD7 AF700 (BD Biosciences, 561603), CD10 BV785 (Biolegend, 312238), CD133 PE (Biolegend, 372804) and CD117 BV650 (Biolegend, 313222). For the detection of B2M− cells upon in vitro titration experiments, we used a B2M PE antibody (Biolegend, 316306). For in vivo readouts, we added to both panels a B2M FITC antibody (Biolegend, 316304). For FACS sorting of CD34+ cell subtypes, approximately 106 total CD34+ cells (StemCell Technologies, 70008) were stained in an antibody cocktail containing CD34 APC (BD Biosciences, 340441), lineage cocktail Pacific Blue (Biolegend, 348805), CD15 Pacific Blue (Biolegend, 980504), CD38 PE/Cy5 (Biolegend, 303508), CD90 PE/CF594 (BD Biosciences, 562385), CD45RA BV711 (BD Biosciences, 740806), CD7 AF700 (BD Biosciences, 561603), CD10 BV605 (Biolegend, 312222), CD135 PE (Biolegend, 313306) and DAPI (Thermo Fisher, D1306). Cells were sorted into various HSPC subpopulations using a BD Symphony S6 cell sorter.

All husbandry and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab. NBSGW mice (Jackson Labs, strain 026622) were used. Mouse age at the time of study start was 6–9 weeks. On the day of cell dosing, huCD34+ cells (double-mobilized by 100 μg ml−1 G-CSF and 5 mg kg−1 AMD3100) were thawed from cryovials stored in liquid nitrogen, washed with sterile PBS and resuspended at 300,000–500,000 cells in 200 μl of PBS. For the PBMC spike-in study, 500,000 CD34+ cells and 107 PBMCs from the same donor were mixed in 200 μl of PBS and dosed IV. On the day of LV or VLP dosing, LV or VLP was thawed and kept on ice. LV or VLP was premixed with vectofusin (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-111-163) at a final concentration of 12 µg ml−1 exactly 10 min before dosing in vivo. At study completion, mice were anesthetized using CO2 and organs were collected for processing and downstream FC and histopathology analysis. Tissues were processed as follows. For PB, 75–100 µl of whole mouse blood was added to a V-bottom 96-well plate. Then, 75–100 µl of PBS (Gibco, 10010-023; 1:1 ratio with the blood) was added to the wells containing blood samples. Samples were pipetted up and down to mix the blood and PBS. The 96-well plate containing the blood–PBS mixture was spun at 1,000g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. Next, 200 µl of ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A10492-01) was added to each well that contained a blood pellet. The pellets were mixed well in the ACK buffer by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Cells were spun again at 1,000g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. Next, 200 µl of 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) was added to each well. Cells were spun again at 1,000g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. Then, 200 µl of ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A10492-01) was added to each well a second time. The pellets were mixed well in the ACK buffer by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Cells were spun again at 1,000g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded. Next, 200 µl of 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) was added to each well. Cells were spun again at 1,000g for 2 min, the supernatant was discarded and cells were resuspended in 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and transferred over to a 96-well U-bottom plate for staining for FC. For BM, muscle and residue tissue was removed from the femur and tibia with sterile forceps and scissors. Bones were transferred into a sterile mortar containing 5 ml of ice-cold 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and smashed with a pestle. The crushed bones were filtered through a 40-µm nylon cell strainer to remove solid fragments, the volume of the filtrate was brought up to 10 ml of PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and the filtrate was centrifuged at 300g for 10 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and filtered through a 40-µm nylon cell strainer. The filtrate was centrifuged for 5 min at 350g (4 °C). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1× PBS for staining for FC. Spleens were isolated from mice and stored on ice in 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023). To start tissue processing, spleens were placed into 2 ml of ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A10492-01). Spleens were dissociated by repeatedly crushing between two frosted sides of a glass microscope slide. The dissociated splenic tissue was incubated at room temperature in 2 ml of ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A10492-01) for 10 min. The dissociated splenic tissues were then filtered through a 40-µm nylon cell strainer to remove solid fragments, the volume of the filtrate was brought up to 10 ml in PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and the filtrate was centrifuged at 350g for 5 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010-023) and filtered through a 40-µm nylon cell strainer. The filtrate was centrifuged for 5 min at 350g (at 4 °C). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1× PBS for staining for FC.

The FRG humanized liver mouse model was used to assess vector potential to transduce human hepatocytes in vivo. Mice were maintained and the study was conducted by Yecuris. FRG mice have an FAH−/− mutation, which enables ablation of the murine hepatocytes, creating a niche for engraftment of donor hepatocytes. They also have Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− immunodeficiency mutations, which allow persistence and expansion of engrafted human hepatocytes. The NPCs of the liver (Kupffer cells and endothelial cells) remained of murine origin. After confirmation of >80% humanization by human albumin levels (>3.5 mg ml−1), mice were dosed with ~300× concentrated vector at a 5 ml kg−1 dose. Unless otherwise noted, mice were killed 14 days after injection and livers were isolated for tissue dissociation and FC analysis of the human and murine cell populations. For FC analysis, hepatocytes were stained using hASGR1 AF647 (R&D Systems, FAB43941R, clone 950203), mCD81 PE (Biolegend, 104906, clone Eat-2) and eBioscience eFluor780 viability dye (Thermo Fisher). NPCs were stained with F40/80 PE (Biolegend, 123110, clone BM8), CD31 APC (Biolegend, 102410, clone 390) and eBioscience eFluor780 viability dye (Thermo Fisher).

Cells were washed with PBS once to get rid of the media. Suspension cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded before washing. DNA was extracted using QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (BioSearch Technologies, QE0905T) by incubating the cells with solution at 65 °C for 6 min, followed by 98 °C for 2 min. They were then diluted at least threefold with ultrapure water to avoid the inhibition of PCR because of the abundant presence of the extraction solution. A PCR master mix was prepared at a final volume of 20 µl containing ddPCR Supermix for Probes, no UTP (Bio-Rad, 186-3024), delU3 primer/probe mix (DelU3 forward primer, 5′-GGAAGGGCTAATTCACTCCC-3′; DelU3 reverse primer, 5′-GGTTTCCCTTTCGCTTTCAGG-3′; DelU3 probe, 5′-/56-FAM/TGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTG/3IABxFQ/-3′) and ArX primer/probe mix (ArX forward primer, 5′-TATGTTCAGATGCCCATTAGGG-3′; ArX reverse primer, 5′-CTTGCTCAAAGGACTGTGATTTC-3′; ArX probe, 5HEX/AGTGCCTTT/ZEN/CAGATGGAAACGGGT/3IABkFQ/). Then, 5 µl of the diluted DNA was added to the PCR master mix. A Bio-Rad QX200 AutoDG droplet generator was used to generate droplets. The droplets were then subjected to PCR at 95 °C for 10 min, with 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 60 °C for 60 s and 98 °C for 10 min. The PCR-amplified material was then read on the droplet reader.

Genomic DNA was purified using QIAamp DNA micro kit (Qiagen, 56304) according to the manufacturer's manual. Purified genomic DNA was first amplified with primer pairs spanning around 200–300 bp at the target edited regions using Q5 hot start high-fidelity 2× master mix (Qiagen, M0494L) for 35 cycles (98 °C for 60 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 66 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final step of 72 °C for 2 min, before holding at 4 °C). Second amplifications were performed with indexed primer pairs using Q5® hot start high-fidelity 2× master mix (Qiagen, M0494L) for 12 cycles (98 °C for 60 s, followed by 12 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final step of 72 °C for 2 min, before holding at 4 °C). Pooled indexed libraries were cleaned up by AMPure XP solid-phase reversible immobilization reagent (Beckman Coulter, A63881) and measured with a 4150 Tapstation system (Agilent) using D5000 DNA ScreenTape assays (5067-5588/89, Agilent) for size range and a Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with high-sensitivity dsDNA assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33231) for quantification before clustering on Illumina sequencers. Forward and reverse primers complementary to sequences upstream and downstream of the region of interest were designed with 5′–3′ overhang adaptors. A subsequent limited-cycle amplification step was performed to add multiplexing indices and Illumina sequencing adaptors. An amplicon of ~200 bp was amplified by the primer pair. Libraries were normalized, pooled and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq or NextSeq depending on throughput required and availability: forward overhang, 5′ CTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT-[locus-specific seq]; reverse overhang, 5′ CTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT-[locus-specific seq] (additional details in Supplementary Information Table 2). The amplicon sequencing data were used to characterize and quantify the nuclease editing activity at the intended, on-target genomic target loci. The paired-end FASTQ files were trimmed for readthrough of the Illumina TruSeq adaptor and amplicon primers using Cutadapt version 2.10. Quality filtering (≥Q30) and quality control were performed with fastp version 0.20.0. FASTQ files were aligned to the human genome reference (GRCh38) using Minimap2 version 2.24. Reads that had a mate overlap a 15-bp window around the target site were included. The R version 4.0.3 package CrispRVariants version 1.18.0 was used to characterize and quantify editing. Read pairs were classified as follows: wild-type reads, reads identical to the reference genome; single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), reads that only included mismatches to the reference; indel-containing reads, reads that included single contiguous insertions or deletions; complex variant, reads containing complex variants, multiple indels and/or SNVs; other, reads containing more complex structural rare variants. Percentage editing served as an estimate of overall measure of nuclease activity at a given target and was calculated as ((total reads – SNV-only reads – wild-type reads)/total reads) × 100. Similarly, the percentage of editing variants was calculated as (total reads carrying a given editing variant/total reads) × 100. For the samples dosed with the BCL11A ABE cargo, reads that contained an exact match to the 7 bp upstream and downstream of the guide were quantified for the presence of the two A>G mutations in and directly after the GATA1-binding site. Read counts for each of the motif variants (TTTATCG, TTTGTCA and TTTGTCG) were obtained for the four BCL11A ABE-edited samples.

For RNA-seq analyses of PHH and FRG-derived PHH cells (Extended Data Fig. 8), samples were sent to GENEWIZ (Azenta Life Sciences) where total RNA was extracted from each sample, followed by library prep according to Illumina specifications and sequencing with 150-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq platform. The resulting raw sequencing reads were checked with MultiQC version 1.14 and trimmed with Cutadapt version 4.4 and fastp version 0.23.2. The trimmed reads were mapped to the human genome reference (GENCODE GRCh38 v43) using the STAR version 2.7.10b aligner and quantified with salmon version 1.9.0. The PHH FRG samples were mapped to the human genome reference and the mouse genome reference (GENCODE GRCm39 v32) and only the human genes were used in subsequent analyses for these samples. Genes with ≤2 counts in <3 samples were filtered from subsequent analyses. Differential expression analyses for pairwise comparisons were processed using DESeq2 version 1.40.2. Differently expressed genes were defined with |log2FC| > 2 and adjusted P value < 0.01. Multiple groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction with α = 0.05. Genes that passed the correction threshold were visualized in R version 4.3.0 with pheatmap version 1.0.12.

For the HEK-293 Lenti-X, Hulec-5a, HUVEC, Raji, SupT1 and human primary cells (Supplementary Fig. 9b), sample processing and sequencing for RNA-seq were completed by GENEWIZ (Azenta Life Sciences) with 150-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq platform. The RNA-seq reads were processed by GENEWIZ, where the reads were mapped to the human genome reference (GRCh38) using STAR aligner. A single representative sample was chosen from publicly available data for each of the Caco-2 and KG1A cell lines and is indicated in the legend information in Supplementary Table 3 (refs. 53,54). The log2-transformed CPM normalized counts (edgeR version 3.42.4) were visualized in R version 4.3.0 with pheatmap version 1.0.12 for the immortalized and primary cell lines with the six genes of interest (LDLR, ASCT1, ASCT2, CD133, VLA-4 and VLA-5). No statistical analyses were conducted in this context.

The insertion site analysis shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e,f was performed as previously described55. Briefly, the protocol was based on the fragmentation by sonication of genomic DNA isolated from CD34+ cells, followed by ligation of a linker cassette (LC) containing a known sequence and a unique molecular identifier (UMI) for abundance estimation. Each ligation product underwent two rounds of exponential PCR amplification using long terminal repeat-specific and LC-specific primers. An additional PCR step was carried to introduce into each sample Illumina adaptor sequences and a known sample index sequence for multiplexing. A pooled sample library was then loaded on a MiSeq System (Illumina) and the sequence analysis was performed using the IS-Seq computational pipeline55. For the bubble plot generation and the Shannon diversity index calculation reported in Extended Data Fig. 1e,f, we used UMI counts as the insertion site abundance quantification method.

All immunohistochemistry was performed on the Leica Bond RX fully automated staining instrument running Bond 6.0 software. Antibodies were all diluted in SignalStain antibody diluent (Cell Signaling Technology, 8112). Dual chromogenic staining of human nucleoli (Abcam, 190710, clone NM95) at 1:4,000 dilution was performed using the bond polymer refine detection system (Leica Biosystems, DS9800) with EDTA antigen retrieval using bond epitope retrieval 2 (Leica Biosystems, AR9640) for 20 min at 90 °C. Staining of GFP (Cell Signaling Technology, 2956, clone D5.1) at 1:50 dilution was performed using the bond polymer refine red detection system (Leica Biosytems, DS9390) with EDTA antigen retrieval using bond epitope retrieval 2 (Leica Biosystems, AR9640) for 20 min at 90 °C. Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin from the bond polymer refine red detection system (Leica Biosytems, DS9390). Slides were air-dried, submerged in xylene and cover-slipped using CV mountant (Leica Biosystems, 14070936261). Whole-slide imaging was performed on the Leica Versa 200 microscope at ×40 magnification. TIF files were extracted from the Leica SVS scan files using Leica Aperio Imagescope version 12.4.6.5003. Sternum and liver samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Epredia, 534801) for 48 h at room temperature. Following fixation, sternum samples were decalcified overnight using Formical-2000 decalcifier (StatLab, 1314). Both sternum and liver samples were processed on the Leica Pearl tissue processor through a graded ethanol series (Fisher, A962P4) as follows: 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 100% and 100%. This was followed by three xylene solvent steps (Fisher, X3P) and three paraffin steps (Paraplast, Leica, 39601006) using the default 12-h protocol. Samples were embedded using the Leica HistoCore Arcadia embedding center and sectioned at 5 µm on the Leica HistoCore Multicut microtome.

CD34+ sorted human HSPCs harvested from mouse BM were seeded at 5 × 102 cells per tube in Methocult classic (StemCell Technologies, 04444, lot 1000138489). Two plates were seeded per animal from the same Methocult tube. Cells were incubated in StemSpan SFEM II medium with PS (Gibco). On day 14, cells were removed from the incubator and counted for BFU/CFU and GMs. Flow analysis was performed using antibodies CD71 BB700 (BD Biosciences, 746082, clone M-A712), HbF PE (BD Biosciences, 560041, clone 2D12) and CD235a PE/Cy7 (BD Biosciences, 563666, clone HIR2).

In 2022 a large-scale test of a commercial deep-sea mining machine was undertaken on the abyssal plain of the eastern Pacific Ocean at a depth of 4,280 m, recovering over 3,000 t of polymetallic nodules. Here, using a quantitative species-level sediment-dwelling macrofaunal dataset, we investigated spatio-temporal variation in faunal abundance and biodiversity for 2 years before and 2 months after test mining. This allowed for the separation of direct mining impacts from natural background variation, which we found to be significant over the 2-year sampling period. Macrofaunal density decreased by 37% directly within the mining tracks, alongside a 32% reduction in species richness, and significantly increased community multivariate dispersion. While species richness and diversity indices within the tracks were reduced compared with controls, diversity was not impacted when measured by sample-size independent measures of accumulation. We found no evidence for change in faunal abundance in an area affected by sediment plumes from the test mining; however, species dominance relationships were altered in these communities reducing their overall biodiversity. These results provide critical data on the effective design of abyssal baseline and impact surveys and highlight the value of integrated species-level taxonomic work in assessing the risks of biodiversity loss.

Proposals for deep-sea mineral extraction, first discussed in the mid 1960s1, include the mining of seafloor massive sulfides found at hydrothermal vents2, mining of cobalt-rich crusts found on deep seamounts3 and the extraction of polymetallic nodules found on abyssal plains (3,000–6,000 m depth)4. Of these, nodule mining currently receives the most attention from the nascent deep-sea mining industry, with efforts focused on the Clarion–Clipperton Zone (CCZ)—a 6 million km2 area of the central Pacific Ocean, estimated to hold over 21 billion tonnes of nickel-, cobalt- and copper-rich polymetallic nodules4.

Extensive baseline biodiversity surveys conducted over the last 50 years in the CCZ have predominantly focused on the metazoan invertebrate fauna living in or on the abyssal sediments5,6,7,8,9. The best-studied component of the benthic assemblage is the sediment macrofauna—animals typically ranging in size from 0.3 mm to 2 cm, dominated by annelid worms, peracarid crustaceans and molluscs. Despite low abundance and biomass these macrofaunal communities have relatively high biodiversity, with higher species diversity than found in comparable deep-sea sedimented communities10, and an estimated 90% of the collected taxa being undescribed11. While the abyssal plains may have once been assumed to host homogenous, static and depauperate communities12, studies have since shown these habitats to be home to biodiverse and heterogenous communities which can vary markedly across small spatial13,14,15 and temporal16,17,18 scales.

Tests of nodule-mining vehicles have been carried out in both the Pacific and Indian Ocean since the 1970s, as well as seven published disturbance experiments designed to try and understand the potential environmental effects of seabed mining before commercial-scale operations19,20,21,22. These studies have produced mixed results: while some report no impact on infaunal (macrofauna and meiofauna) abundance between 2 years and 44 years following disturbance22,23,24,25, others have found significant reductions in macrofaunal abundance immediately following disturbance26, with residual community-level changes still visible 7 years later27. Only one of these studies followed a full-scale contemporary mining test23, and all have certain methodological limitations such as low statistical replication and lack of pre-impact baseline data.

In October 2022, Nauru Ocean Resources (NORI) a wholly owned subsidiary of The Metals Company (TMC), together with the company AllSeas, conducted an extensive trial of a large-scale prototype polymetallic nodule collection vehicle within the NORI-D contract area of the CCZ (hereafter termed the collector test). This collector tracked over 80 km of abyssal seafloor, within a 2 × 4 km test field, and recovered over 3,000 t of nodules using a riser-pipe—the largest of its kind thus far. Here we report on the results of a large species-level quantitative abyssal sediment-dwelling macrofaunal dataset, collected over 2 years, including the combined analysis of both natural temporal variation and the effects 2 months following a large-scale nodule mining test (Fig. 1). Following a modified Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, we investigated the variability of macrofaunal density and diversity, to distinguish between natural spatiotemporal changes and those directly resulting from mining impacts, providing a critical evidence-base to inform conservation planning and effective management of deep-sea mining.

A total of 4,350 sediment macrofauna (sensu stricto) were sorted from 80 boxcore samples across four sampling campaigns (from November 2020 to December 2022), from which 3,826 specimens (88%) could be identified to a total of 788 species. The dataset used for statistical analyses included all samples from the Collector Test Area (CTA) – which included two subcategories ‘plume' and ‘track' taken after impact—and two control sites, Far Field West (FFW) and Near Field East (NFE) (Fig. 1). Samples from the Far Field East (FFE) and Preservation Reference Zone (PRZ) sites were excluded from statistical analyses because of low temporal replication, although they are presented in all figures for visual comparison. The analysed data included 67 boxcore samples, containing 3,519 specimens, from which 3,089 individuals (87.8%) were identified to 692 species. As is typical for abyssal sediment communities, polychaete annelids were the most abundant taxa across the dataset (44.5% of specimens), closely followed by peracarid crustaceans (isopods, tanaids and amphipods; 37.5%) and molluscs (13.7%). Other phyla including Echinodermata, Nemertea, Bryozoa and Cnidaria occurred at much lower abundances, comprising less than 4% of the total faunal abundance. Mean macrofaunal density across all samples was 217.5 ± 72 individuals per m2 (ind.m−2) (mean ± s.d.) (Table 1).

A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) found evidence of a statistically significant interaction between site and time on macrofaunal density (ind.m−2) when including the track samples in the time series, but not when including the plume (track, F(6,50) = 8.81, P < 0.001; plume, F(6,45) = 2.52, P = 0.04) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1; for discussion of P values see Methods). We found evidence of significant natural temporal declines in macrofaunal density across all sites during the pre-impact period of November 2020 to September 2022 (Fig. 2; see Supplementary Table 2 for all one-way ANOVA results and Supplementary Table 3 for results of pairwise t-tests). Similar patterns of change were observed across all phyla (Extended Data Fig. 1). The relationship between macrofaunal density and the multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index (MEI), a potential driver of food availability, is visualized in Extended Data Fig. 2 and indicates a decrease in macrofaunal abundance with an increasingly negative MEI index.

Boxes indicate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentile) and whiskers indicate lower and upper quartiles. Shaded area highlights samples taken following the collector test. Sample sizes (n): C5A FFE = 4, C5A FFW = 2, C5A NFE = 4, C5A PRZ = 5, C5A CTA = 4, C5D FFE = 4, C5D FFW = 3, C5D NFE = 4, C5D CTA = 4, C7A FFW = 5, C7A NFE = 5, C7A CTA = 10, C7B FFW = 5, C7B NFE = 5, C7B plume = 5, C7B track = 10.

Following the work of Underwood28,29, we consider an ‘impact' to be a difference in the change of mean abundance/diversity, or time course of mean abundance/diversity, in a defined ‘impacted' area (in this instance, the mining track or plume) from before to after the disturbance, compared with such changes that occur from before to after in the control locations. Immediately before the collector test (September 2022), there was no evidence for significant spatial differences in macrofaunal density between the control sites and the CTA (ANOVA, F(2,17) = 3.01, P = 0.076). However, following the collector test, significant differences in density between sites were observed (ANOVA, F(3,21) = 12.4, P < 0.001). Samples collected from within the mining track had significantly lower macrofaunal densities than NFE (t-test, P < 0.001) and FFW (t-test, P = 0.002) and non-statistically significant lower densities than those sampled from within the plume area (t-test, P = 0.087) (Table 1). Samples taken within the plume area were not statistically different in density than the control sites (Supplementary Table 3).

Macrofauna within the mining tracks were 37% lower in density than 1 month before the collector test (t-test, P < 0.001). In comparison, there was no significant change in density observed at NFE (t-test, P = 0.489) or at FFW (t-test, P = 0.06) across the same period. Densities within the plume were not significantly different from those found in the CTA pre-impact (t-test, P = 0.788).

A total of 788 species were identified across NORI-D. Despite this high number of species, rarefaction curves did not reach asymptotes when rarefied by either specimens or number of boxcores (Extended Data Fig. 3). Extrapolation analyses estimate needing to sample over 15,000 individuals or over 400 boxcores (equivalent to 100 m2) before the complete diversity of the area is captured. Non-parametric extrapolation analyses predict the total number of macrofaunal species within NORI-D to be between 1,148 and 1,391 (Supplementary Table 4), of which an estimated 521–647 species are polychaete worms.

Spatiotemporal changes in macrofaunal species richness and diversity were examined in the same manner as for macrofaunal density (Methods). There was a statistically significant interaction between site and time on macrofaunal species richness (species per 0.25 m2) when including the track samples, but not when including the plume site (two-way ANOVA, track, F(6,50) = 8.69, P < 0.001; plume, F(6,45) = 2.73, P = 0.02). Results of all two- and one-way ANOVAs can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Concomitant with the observed reduction in macrofaunal density between sampling periods, we found significant natural temporal changes in diversity for both the CTA and NFE sites, but not for FFW. The CTA also showed significant natural temporal changes in evenness, which were not found in NFE or FFW (Supplementary Table 2). From September 2022 to December 2022, following the collector test, NFE significantly increased in species richness and Gini-Simpson diversity, while there were no significant changes observed in FFW (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Table 3). At 1 month before impact, species richness within the CTA was 32.5 ± 6.26 (mean ± s.d.), which significantly decreased within the mining tracks by 32% to a mean of 22.2 ± 7.24 (t-test, P = 0.003) (Fig. 3a). Samples from within the plume site had a mean species richness of 32.6 ± 10.36, which was not significantly different from before impact (t-test, P = 0.985). The same pattern was seen for Gini-Simpson diversity in the CTA (Table 1 and Fig. 3b), with diversity significantly reduced within the tracks, but not significantly different within the plume (Fig. 3b). In comparison, samples taken in the tracks were significantly more even than before impact (t-test, P = 0.026), while evenness per 0.25 m2 within the plume was not significantly different from the pre-impact CTA (Fig. 3c).

For clarity, only sites sampled after test-mining impact in December 2022 (C7B) and the pre-impact collector test area (C7A CTA) are shown. For full curves see Extended Data Fig. 4. Sample sizes (n): C5A FFE = 4, C5A FFW = 2, C5A NFE = 4, C5A PRZ = 5, C5A CTA = 4, C5D FFE = 4, C5D FFW = 3, C5D NFE = 4, C5D CTA = 4, C7A FFW = 5, C7A NFE = 5, C7A CTA = 10, C7B FFW = 5, C7B NFE = 5, C7B plume = 5, C7B track = 10.

Increased variability in diversity and composition is often an indicator of disturbance within benthic communities30 and so Levene's tests were used to examine changes in variance of diversity between sites over time. Gini-Simpson diversity within the mining tracks was significantly more variable than the control sites following mining impact (track-NFE: Levene's test, F(1,13) = 6.45, P = 0.025; track-FFW: Levene's test, F(1,13) = 7.96, P = 0.014) and significantly more variable than the CTA 1 month before impact (Levene's test, F(1,18) = 9.05, P = 0.007) (Supplementary Table 5).

Individual-based rarefaction curves did not reach asymptotes at the local scale for any site at any time (Fig. 3d). For clarity, a reduced number of curves have been presented, including the track and plume, the CTA 1 month before impact (C7A CTA) and the two control sites following the impact (C7B FFW and C7B NFE) (Fig. 3d,e); however, full curves for each site separated by time can be found in Extended Data Fig. 4. When considering individual-based rarefaction—a measure of species accumulation independent of sample size—the communities found within the mining tracks were not notably lower in diversity than other sites. The expected number of species from a random draw of 100 individuals (ES(100)) within the track was 80.5 ± 3.2 (estimated value ± s.e.) compared with a range of 75.1–81.6 from the other sites and time points (Table 1). In comparison, samples taken within the plume area were lower in diversity, with an ES(100) of 73.6 ± 3.2 (Fig. 3d and Table 1). This pattern was also visible when using non-parametric diversity estimators, where the plume has an overall lower number of estimated species than nearly all other sites (Supplementary Table 4).

Alternatively, when looking at sample-based rarefaction curves the track was notably lower in diversity than other sampled sites (Fig. 3e, Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3b). The expected number of species from a random draw of four boxcores within the track was 77.5 ± 16.1, compared with an estimated 105.19 ± 20.63 species within the CTA before the collector test (Table 1).

Percentages of species dominance were largely similar between sites and times, with the top ten most-dominant species comprising between 15% and 25.2% of the total abundance at each site (Supplementary Table 6). When plotted on k-dominance curves (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4c), the plume is less diverse than other sites, with a greater percentage of common species, a similar pattern as seen in the specimen-based rarefaction (Fig. 3d).

Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to examine differences in multivariate community composition, we found both site and time to have a significant effect, with no significant interaction between the two, when including both the track and the plume samples in analyses (site: track, pseudo-F = 1.487, P < 0.001 and plume, pseudo-F = 1.375, P < 0.001; time: track, pseudo-F = 1.273, P = 0.002 and plume, pseudo-F = 1.261, P = 0.002) (Supplementary Table 1e). Pairwise PERMANOVA comparisons found significant natural and impact-related temporal changes in community composition within the CTA, including from 1 month pre-impact to 2 months post-impact within the mining tracks (pseudo-F = 1.364, P = 0.021), while there was no such change observed within the plume (Supplementary Table 3e). No significant temporal changes in community composition were observed for either of the control sites. Following the test-mining impact, community composition within the mining tracks and plume was not significantly different to controls (Supplementary Table 3e).

When visualized using a non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) ordination, there is a large overlap between most sites at each time, with the PRZ as the most distinct from all other sites (Fig. 4a). Samples taken from within the tracks are widely dispersed across the entire plot, overlapping with other sites and times. The multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions was tested using the PERMDISP2 procedure and visualized using a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot (Fig. 4b). We found significant variation in multivariate dispersion between sites (permutation test, permutations = 9,999, F(15,64) = 9.87, P < 0.001), of which, communities within the tracks were significantly more dispersed than all other sites at all time points (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 3).

The bars and circles indicate medians and data points, respectively. Outliers are denoted by stars. Boxes indicate the interquartile range (25th–75th percentile) and whiskers indicate lower and upper quartiles. Sample sizes (n): C5A FFE = 4, C5A FFW = 2, C5A NFE = 4, C5A PRZ = 5, C5A CTA = 4, C5D FFE = 4, C5D FFW = 3, C5D NFE = 4, C5D CTA = 4, C7A FFW = 5, C7A NFE = 5, C7A CTA = 10, C7B FFW = 5, C7B NFE = 5, C7B plume = 5, C7B track = 10.

When examining the overall community composition, there is no clear difference in relative proportion of phyla or annelid families between sites and times (Extended Data Fig. 5). Within the mining track, there were lower relative abundances of the families Maldanidae, Nereididae and Sabellidae than there had been in the CTA pre-impact (September 2022) and higher relative abundances of Paraonidae, Spionidae and Phyllodocidae. Indicator species analysis found no significant associations of any taxon to within the mining tracks, either for polychaete family groups or for class-level identifications (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 7). Echinoids (sea urchins), however, were significantly associated with the plume (indicator value (IndVal) = 0.571, P = 0.01). For polychaete families, the Orbiniidae were found to be significantly associated with the plume (IndVal = 0.542, P = 0.033).

Cells represent square-root transformed relative abundance of each taxonomic group across all sampled sites. Symbols to the left show significant associations of taxa to specific sites or sampling periods, as identified by Indicator Species Analysis.

Only two species were found at all sites at all sampling times: a tanaid crustacean, Stenotanais sp. [NHM_6880_TH_TAN_1] and a benthic serpulid polychaete Serpulidae sp. [NHM_271]. The PRZ, which was only sampled on one occasion and is located 120 km to the northeast of the other sites, had the highest percentage (27.3%) of species unique to the area (Table 1). Of the species found within the track, 13.4% were found nowhere else, while the percentage of unique species at each other sites and time points (excluding the PRZ) ranged from 10.7% to 21.2%. Venn diagrams depicting the number of species overlaps between the CTA pre- and post-impact and the CTA, FFW and NFE sites can be found in Extended Data Fig. 6. The plume site had the highest relative overlap with the track and pre-impact CTA. NFE had more unique species (153) than the CTA (118) and FFW (103) when grouping samples from all time points.

Deep-sea mining within the CCZ is at a critical juncture, as the industry looks to move beyond the exploration phase and into commercial exploitation31. Consequently, there is a clear need for direct assessment of the impacts of mining on faunal abundance and biodiversity at the seafloor. Our results show that against a background of strong natural variation we can determine significant impacts of a large-scale deep-sea mining test on several aspects of benthic abundance and diversity. While past studies of smaller disturbances have also been able to show significant effects21,22,27, this study attempts to disentangle direct mining impacts from the natural variation inherent in abyssal ecosystems via the creation of a temporal baseline.

Immediately following impact, macrofaunal densities decreased significantly by 37% within the path of the nodule collector, while densities within the control sites either increased or remained unchanged. This is in line with patterns seen in previous smaller deep-sea disturbance experiments which have reported 38–63% decreases in macrofaunal density26,32,33. Most abyssal infauna occur in the top 2 cm of sediment8—within our dataset, 74% of individuals were found in this top layer. As such, the observed reduction in faunal density is unsurprising given that nodule mining machines will directly disturb the top layers of sediment during the nodule-removal procedure.

Sediment plumes generated by nodule mining vehicles have been predicted to cause significant adverse effects on benthic fauna, including damaging gills and feeding structures and increasing mortality due to toxicity from elevated metal concentrations34. While some impacts have been demonstrated for megafauna35, there is limited empirical or in situ data evaluating these effects on macrofauna. Here we found no significant change in macrofaunal abundance or species richness 2 months following sediment plume deposition, as also reported for meiofauna23 and macrofauna24 by previous studies. Interestingly, while species richness within the plume area was unchanged, diversity as measured by evenness was reduced across the community as a result of a change in dominance relationships—a similar ecological response to that seen in benthic communities impacted by turbidity flows36. Indicator species analysis also found a significant association of the polychaete family Orbiniidae within the plume. Orbiniid species are known to increase in density in response to pollutants or organic enrichment in shallow waters37 and the Antarctic benthos38. While our sample numbers for individual families are low, it is an interesting observation that certain deposit-feeding taxa may respond to the deposition of mining plumes. This follows results from the DISCOL experiment which found a consistent association of a scavenging polychaete species in the family Sigalionidae with plume-impacted areas27. What cannot currently be established is whether this response is caused by the competitive advantage of more resilient species, the mortality of less robust species, or a combination of both. Longer-term sampling and analysis of the impacted site would provide a better assessment of the ecological succession in the community after disturbance.

The impacts of the test mining on faunal density and diversity were observed against the backdrop of significant natural temporal changes. This highlights the importance of collecting temporal data across several control and impact sites to accurately measure the impacts of deep-sea mining. The most likely driver of change in benthic animal abundance is food availability, driven potentially by shifts in the ENSO (MEI)39. Macrofaunal densities in NORI-D decreased in parallel with the MEI over the 22-month study period. Significant seasonal variations in benthic communities have been recorded from across the abyssal Pacific16,40, with trends extending across interannual periods where food supplies are higher or lower41. Without repeated sampling at shorter intervals over longer timescales it will remain unclear as to whether the observed variations in NORI-D are part of stochastic or seasonal variation, or a progressive trend related to longer-term climate change42. These data will be crucial to the understanding of long-term recovery rates in disturbed sediments, as significant climate-related changes may have cumulative effects on already impacted communities43.

Parallel with the observed reduction in faunal abundance, we found a significant decrease in species richness and diversity within the mining tracks. The observed number of species within a sample is intrinsically linked and sensitive to underlying differences in abundance44. Therefore, the significantly lower abundance of macrofauna within the mining tracks is the most likely driver of the reduced diversity per sample unit. While previous studies have recorded recovery of macrofaunal abundance after disturbance22,27, none has published species-level data for the full community. Therefore, there is currently very limited data on whether diversity can or will completely recover following nodule mining. Seven years after the DISCOL disturbance experiment (involving a plough-harrow which did not remove any nodules) the diversity of polychaetes remained reduced with lower evenness and less singleton species27. High diversity in abyssal sediments is thought to be maintained through a variety of processes including niche diversification over periods of long-term stability and patch-mosaic dynamics45. Given that physical disturbance within the CCZ has been shown to persist over decades22 and is predicted to last for centuries, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the removal of nodules and associated sediment disturbance will result in persistent long-term decreases in species diversity in the mined areas, as has been demonstrated to occur in benthic habitats impacted by bottom-fishing46.

Contrary to this local reduction in species diversity per unit area, diversity measured using sample-size independent accumulators was not significantly reduced within the collector test tracks. All rarefaction curves, at both local and regional scales, indicate that NORI-D remains under-sampled for diversity—extrapolation analyses estimate needing to sample over 15,000 individuals or 400 boxcores (equivalent to 100 m2) before curves begin to reach asymptotes. This hinders the conclusions that can be drawn about differences in diversity. Rarefaction assumes that the area being sampled represents a single habitat44, whereas the abyssal seafloor is known to be both physically and biologically heterogenous12,14,47. As more microhabitats within an area are sampled, the estimated number of species found per number of individuals rises, further exacerbating the ‘under-sampling' effect. It is therefore difficult to ascertain if biodiversity within the track is truly in line with unimpacted sites. Reported changes in species diversity following disturbance have been shown to be scale-dependent, with declines more prominent when examined across larger areas48. Monitoring changes in diversity patterns from commercial-scale mining operations will require a specifically designed survey to account for this effect. We suggest that such a sampling design should aim to cover representative sites of differing environmental variables such as nodule type and density, both of which have been shown to influence the community composition of different faunal size classes8,49. This should occur at sufficient replication both temporally and spatially to encompass natural premining variation, an aspect that has been highlighted as often lacking in deep-sea mining environmental impact assessments50. Here we were able to statistically detect variation between sites and time points with two to ten boxcore samples per site/time; however, to improve the robustness of analyses we would recommend a minimum of five, and ideally ten, cores per site and time with samples spatially randomized within strata51.

Following the collector test we found significantly higher variability in both diversity and multivariate community composition within the mining track. Increased ecological variability is common following disturbance and is caused by the destabilization of community dynamics, as loss in abundance across populations and the redistribution of resources leads to altered competitive interactions and spatial aggregation of species52. The observed even reduction in abundance across broad taxonomic groups, and similar dominance patterns and percentage of singleton species between the track and controls suggest that the collector test caused an equal removal of individuals across the top sediment layers, rather than disproportionately impacting specific taxonomic groups. Such species-specific effects may only be detectable at longer timescales following impact.

While dependent on several ecological and environmental parameters, recolonization and recruitment is a primary determinant of the extent and persistence of disturbance impacts52. Knowledge of this is currently very poor in both the CCZ and the broader abyssal ecosystem53. Increased spatial variability is exacerbated when species are patchily distributed and when recolonization primarily occurs through lateral migration of adults and juveniles rather than larval settlement, both of which are thought to be the case for abyssal infauna14,27. We can therefore hypothesize that in a commercial-scale nodule mine covering 8,500 km2 of seafloor54, community heterogeneity may persist over long timescales. This has already been demonstrated in other deep-sea settings, with elevated variance-mean ratios still observed in the DISCOL area 7 years after impact27. Disturbed deep-sea sediments experience highly localized colonization patterns, creating a spatiotemporal mosaic of patches in various stages of succession55. Longer-term monitoring of the impacted sites would enable better evidence on rates of recovery. This is particularly relevant for the areas impacted by plume settlement, where ecological changes may occur more slowly than in directly impacted sites and so should be a focus of future environmental impact studies.

In conclusion, through a replicated spatio-temporal sampling programme we detected significant changes in sediment-dwelling macrofaunal density, diversity and community composition in response to a large-scale test of a polymetallic nodule mining machine. This sets a standard for baseline ecological data in the CCZ and further highlights the importance of integrated species-level taxonomic work56 in assessing ecological responses to disturbance and the risks of biodiversity loss.

The study was conducted in the exploration contract area NORI-D, licenced by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI). The NORI-D contract area is located in the southeastern CCZ, occupying an area of approximately 27,000 km2 and with water depths of 2,959–4,602 m (Fig. 1). In October 2022, NORI, a wholly owned subsidiary of TMC together with the company AllSeas, conducted a trial of a prototype polymetallic nodule collection vehicle within the NORI-D contract area of the CCZ. This collector test tracked over approximately 80 km of abyssal seafloor within a 2 × 4 km test field and removed over 3,000 t of nodules using a riser-pipe.

The full extent of environmental impacts following a disturbance event can only be accurately detected and assessed when sufficient data are available to disentangle the effect of interest from natural spatial and temporal variability. Considering this, we used an asymmetrical Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) style experimental design28,29 with several control sites, following the principles outlined by Etter 51 that formed the basis of the first set of ISA exploration regulations57.

A random stratified sampling design was used, with data collected from four control sites (FFE, FFW, NFE and PRZ) chosen to be spatially equivalent to the area being impacted by the mining disturbance and one impacted site, referred to as the CTA. Sites varied in depth from 4,121 m to 4312 m. Samples were collected at three time points before the collector test (November 2020, May 2021 and September 2022) and again 2 months following the collector test (December 2022). Following the impact, samples taken in the CTA were split into ‘track' and ‘plume' categories. The track samples were collected directly within the mining track. The plume samples were taken 400 m from the mining track. Currently, the sedimentation depth from the impact is not yet published either from modelled or empirical studies58. Examination of autonomous underwater vehicle footage taken in the region by the National Oceanography Centre UK team has provided an image of the seafloor in the region of our plume site. This shows a clear veneer of sediment covering the seafloor and the nodules (Fig. 1e). While we do not know the exact depth of the sedimentation, we can confidently state that the plume site 400 m from the track has been impacted by a plume and thus report the impacts on the macrofauna at that distance from the mining track. This will be useful information going forward as further studies are published. A summary of samples taken can be found in Fig. 1, with full details in Supplementary Table 8.

Samples were collected across four expeditions to the NORI-D area spanning a total period of 2 years. Campaign 5A (C5A) took place from October to November 2020 aboard the Maersk Launcher and campaign 5D (C5D) took place from April to June 2021 also aboard the Maersk Launcher. Campaigns 7A (C7A) and 7B (C7B) both took place on the MV Island Pride, from August to September 2022 and November to December 2022, respectively.

Macrofaunal samples were taken with a USNEL Spade Box Core (Ocean Instruments BX-650 and BX-750) with a sample dimension of 50 × 50 cm (BX-650) or 75 × 75 cm (BX-750). Samples taken with the BX-750 were subsampled using a stainless-steel insert frame of 0.25 m2 (the same equivalent area as the BX-650, the standard size used on previous CCZ surveys listed above). To ensure boxcores were taken inside the caterpillar tracks created by the collector test, the ‘track' cores were visually guided using a remote operated vehicle. The full deployment protocol and subsequent processing of samples followed ref. 59.

In short, following recovery and quality assessment, surface water above the sediment was removed with a hose and passed through a 300 µm sieve. Biota visible to the eye on the sediment surface were removed and fixed separately. All nodules were removed from the sediment surface and washed with cold-filtered seawater (CFSW) over buckets to retain the sediment, which was then included with the 0–2-cm live-sorted layer. The sessile fauna directly attached to the nodules were treated separately and will be the subject of a separate paper. A 15 × 15 cm subcore of sediment was taken and sliced in two layers, 0–2 cm and 2–5 cm, before being transferred to CFSW, sieved through a 300 µm sieve and then taken to the at-sea laboratory where individual animals were picked, identified and photographed from the sediment and preserved individually in 80% non-denatured ethanol for high-quality DNA and morphology. All remaining sediment was sliced in layers of 0–2 cm, 2–5 cm and 5–10 cm and sieved on 300 µm sieves in CFSW, before being bulk fixed in 100% non-denatured ethanol. Sediment residues from the 15 × 15 cm live-sorted fraction were returned to respective bulk-fixed depth layers following the removal and processing of animals. The specimens and data from the live-sorted sample are also subsequently merged into the entire boxcore for analysis.

A total of 80 boxcores were fully quantitatively assessed. All samples were initially sent to the Natural History Museum, London (NHMUK), where the bulk-fixed sediment residues were sorted under stereomicroscopes. Arthropods and annelids were only counted if the head was present, and echinoderms only if the oral disc was present. Sessile animals such as bryozoans (excluding Ctenostomatida, which are free-living within the sediment), brachiopods, crinoids and sponges were separated and sorted, however were not included in subsequent analyses as they are considered nodule fauna (due to their dependence on the substratum) and not sediment fauna. Serpulid polychaetes were excluded from analyses for the same reason, except for certain species which were determined to be free-living. To minimize systematic error in the sorting process, a subsection (approximately 10%) of sample residues were re-sorted by different experts to ensure no fauna were missed.

Once sorted, individual groups were split between institutions for subsequent identification by taxonomic experts, with annelids and molluscs sent to the University of Gothenburg (Sweden), arthropods to the National Oceanography Centre (Southampton, UK) and all other groups remaining at the NHMUK.

There are no published field guides to the fauna of the CCZ and approximately 90% of the known species are considered undescribed11. As such, ‘identification' of the species by traditional methods is not possible (for example, comparison with published literature). Taxonomic assignments therefore considered information drawn from both molecular and morphological investigation of every specimen. Using a morphology-based approach, every specimen was assigned to the lowest operational taxonomic unit (OTU; hereby simply referred to as ‘species'), each representing a species. In cases where several specimens were identified as the same species, the voucher code of the best-preserved specimen was used as the identifier of that species, for example: Ophiohelus sp. [NHM_8098]. This avoids confusion with the use of sp. A, sp. B, sp. C and so on, where informal and confusing synonyms can easily arise. Open nomenclature was used following ref. 60 and species authorities can be found on WoRMS61. At least one representative from each species, and specimens which could not be assigned by morphology to a species, were then DNA barcoded using standard genetic markers (for example: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, 16S ribosomal DNA) for different taxa (for example, refs. 62,63,64,65,66). These data have been and are being published in a series of taxonomic publications separate to this study (for example, refs. 63,67,68). The genetic sequences generated were compared against an internal reference database to further guide identifications.

A macrofauna sensu stricto concept was used when defining the specimens to be included in analyses, this included any metazoan retained on a 300 µm sieve, but excluded traditionally considered meiofaunal taxa such as Ostracoda, Copepoda, Nematoda and Halicarida, as well as known sessile nodule fauna (the subject of a separate study) and pelagic or likely pelagic contaminants (such as Hyperiid amphipods). This approach allows for the greatest comparison with published data. Processing of boxcore samples with regards to sliced layers differs between studies7,8,9,16,69 and, as such, the data from all layers (0–10 cm) are summarized together for all analyses. All specimen data used for analyses can be found in Darwin Core (DwC) format in Supplementary Table 8.

All analyses were conducted using R v.4.4.1., using the packages vegan70, SpadeR71, iNEXT72, BiodiversityR73, indicspecies74 and rstatix75.

Following the work of Underwood28,29, we consider an ‘impact' to be defined as a difference in the change of mean abundance/diversity, or time course of mean abundance/diversity, in a defined ‘impacted' area (in this instance, the mining track or plume area) from before to after the disturbance, compared with such changes that occur from before to after in the control locations. While the same sites were sampled at several time points, we do not consider them to be part of a ‘repeated measures' sample design. Boxcores were randomly taken within the predefined areas and as deep-sea macrofaunal community composition can vary at the centimetre scale14 we consider samples to be independent. Samples from the PRZ and FFE sites are included in all figures for visual comparison, however, were excluded from statistical analyses because of a lack of temporal replication.

To examine differences in total faunal abundance the full dataset was used, including specimens which could only be identified to higher taxonomic levels (for example, genus or family level, such as ‘Polychaeta indet.'). Faunal abundances were transformed into densities (individuals per m2) before all calculations.

A two-way ANOVA with site and time as fixed factors was used to assess if there were significant interactions between site and sampling time on macrofaunal abundance. As the plume and track sites were nested within the CTA, the two-way ANOVA was conducted twice, excluding the plume or the track, to examine changes over time within the CTA. Where significant factor effects were found, one-way ANOVAs were conducted on site at each level of time and time at each level of site. These were followed by pairwise t-tests to test for significant differences between sites at each time point and between time points for each site. No adjustment of P values was performed, as the argument in favour of adjusting for type I errors applies to random distributions, which is seldom the case when studying living systems76,77.

Before each analysis, normality and homogeneity of variances were checked with Shapiro–Wilkes and Levene's tests, respectively. Levene's tests were performed on data within each time point and within each site across all time points. Transformation could not stabilize significantly heterogeneous variances in all identified cases and so untransformed data were analysed. Where significant heterogeneity of variance was found, a non-parametric Welches ANOVA was performed in place of the specific one-way ANOVA. For the two-way ANOVA, results were considered robust if not significant (at P > 0.05), since the probability of type II error is not affected by heteroscedasticity, or significant at P < 0.01 (instead of P < 0.05), to compensate for increased probability of type I error78. For all other analyses a significance level of 0.05 was used.

As increased variability can be an indicator of disturbance in marine communities30, pairwise Levene's tests were performed between samples to identify significant differences in variance.

For biodiversity analyses, we examined both species richness (the total number of species, irrespective of abundance) and species diversity, measures including both the number of species and degree of evenness or dominance. A reduced dataset was used for these analyses, including only specimens identified to species level, either a formally described species (for example, Vesicomya galatheae) or an identified OTU (for example, Acrocirridae sp. [NHM_559]).

On the basis of abundance data from an assemblage, calculation of species richness (both observed and estimated) is statistically difficult, especially for highly diverse assemblages with many rare species, as is typically the case for the abyssal benthos10,79. As such, we examined biodiversity and the way it varies both spatially and temporally in several ways at different scales, considering species richness and diversity, diversity accumulators and sample-size independent measures.

To compare biodiversity between sites and time points in terms of the observed diversity per unit area, species richness (S), Gini-Simpson (1-D) and Simpson's evenness (E1/D) indices were calculated for each boxcore sample. To detect spatial and temporal changes in richness and diversity both before and after test mining, these measures of diversity were analysed using two-way and one-way ANOVAs, pairwise t-tests and Levene's tests, as described for abundance data. Indices were also calculated for the communities as a whole, grouping all boxcores into one sample.

Both individual-based and sample-based rarefaction curves were computed for each sampled area and time point, to provide sample-size independent measures of diversity based on accumulation rates. On the basis of these data, the expected number of species was calculated for 100 individuals (ES(100)) from each area and the expected number of species to be sampled from four boxcores (ES(4bc)). In addition, non-parametric species richness estimators were computed for each area to represent local diversity. While rarefaction compares observed richness among samples, richness estimators evaluate the total richness of a community. Abundance-based estimators included Chao180 and Chao1-bc (Chao1 bias-corrected)81. Incidence-based estimators included first- and second-order Jackknife82.

To visualize the dominance structure of species within communities, k-dominance curves were plotted. k-dominance, or cumulative curves, are the cumulative relative abundance of species plotted against the species rank, where the most elevated curve has the lowest diversity83.

Community composition analyses used the same reduced ‘species-level' dataset as used in diversity analyses. Analyses were based on a resemblance matrix using the Bray–Curtis similarity index after square-root transformation of abundance data. This transformation procedure allows for all species, including singletons, to contribute to the similarity matrix while giving the most common species greater weight. Multivariate differences in community structure between sites and time points were determined graphically using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and quantified using PERMANOVA84, with P values obtained by 9,999 permutations of the residuals. PERMANOVA tests were configured as described for univariate analyses, with site and time as fixed factors. Following PERMANOVA analysis, pairwise comparisons between communities were made using pairwise.adonis2, a wrapper function for multilevel pairwise comparison using adonis2 from the package vegan85. Significant differences in multivariate dispersion were tested for using the betadisper function in the package vegan, which implements the PERMDISP method of ref. 86, a multivariate analogue of a Levene's test, to analyse multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions. This was followed by a permutation test for significance and pairwise t-tests to identify significant differences in dispersion. Multivariate dispersion has been used previously to detect disturbance responses in deep-sea benthic communities33.

Indicator species analysis87 was performed using multilevel pattern analysis88 to determine if any taxa were significantly associated with any site or time point. The IndVal index measures the strength of association between a taxonomic unit and a site group and is based on the product of the mean abundance and relative frequency of occurrence of each group within a given dataset. Statistical significance of the relationship between taxa and site is tested using Monte Carlo randomizations with 9,999 permutations87. Analysis was conducted using abundance data for polychaete families and for taxa identified to Class level (or higher) to improve statistical power, due to the low abundances of each species. The full dataset, including all specimens, was used for this analysis.

Quantum state tomography typically requires exponentially many copies of a quantum state, due to the complex correlations present in large systems. We show that, for bosonic systems, the scaling is completely determined by the nature of these correlations. Motivated by the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and boson sampling, we define Gaussian-entanglable (GE) states, produced by generalized interference between separable bosonic modes. GE states greatly extend the Gaussian family, encompassing separable states, multi-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes, entangled cat states, and boson-sampling outputs—resources for error correction and quantum advantage. We prove that any pure GE state of m modes can be learned efficiently, requiring only poly(m) copies, via a protocol based on Gaussian unitaries, local tomography, and classical post-processing; for boson-sampling states, no Gaussian unitaries are needed. For states outside GE, we define an operational monotone—the minimal number of ancillary modes needed to make them GE—which exactly characterizes the exponential tomography overhead. We also show that deterministic generation of NOON states with N ≥ 3 via two-mode interference is impossible.

People love chewing these soft pieces of ice, and they're found everywhere—in fast food drinks, healthcare facilities, and even your home.

Chewing ice has long been considered an example of poor manners, perhaps second only to sucking futilely at those last few drops at the bottom of your cup. Biting down on hard ice cubes can be both a noisy and a potentially painful experience. Maybe some people still think chewing ice is rude, but the invention of airy little ice nuggets has made the practice both irresistible—and useful at times.

Scotsman Ice Systems invented the first nugget ice maker in 1981. Sonic popularized the shape by plopping this ice into its soft drinks, and people loved it so much that they would purchase bags of ice from the drive-through restaurant to take home. Today, nugget ice is common in many restaurants, not just in fast-food joints.

The tiny, cylindrical nuggets have also long been the best ice for health care facilities due to their easily chewable texture, fast melting in the mouth, and moldability for use in therapeutic cold packs. Ice-machine companies caught onto the popularity of nugget ice quickly, and now you can even make your own at home with countertop nugget ice makers.

So what makes nugget ice so soft, chewy, and tempting? 

Ice nuggets are not the same as crushed ice, which is simply a larger block of ice broken into smaller, unevenly shaped pieces. The main difference between a nugget ice maker and an ice-cube maker is that the latter first collects water before freezing it into cubes; these are separate processes. Meanwhile, a nugget ice maker employs a feed of water that it continually chills and forms into nuggets, Ben Miller, a technical expert in ice making for GE Appliances, tells Popular Mechanics. 

To start, water enters the bottom of a cylindrical reservoir. Similar to your freezer at home, the unit evaporates a liquid refrigerant inside copper tubing, a process that pulls heat out of the surrounding water. The rapidly cooling water forms ice crystals on the inside surface of the reservoir. An auger—essentially a large turning screw—scrapes the ice and pushes it to the top of the reservoir as it turns. As they travel, both ice crystals and liquid water form a frozen slurry, a kind of ice and water emulsion. When it reaches the top, the slurry passes through small holes in a metal lid, compressing it into a cylindrical shape; think of a play dough or pasta extruder, pushing out material into a particular shape. The mechanism breaks the frozen slush into small, chewable nuggets, barely 1 centimeter long, and they end up in a bin, where they're ready for scooping.

“The holes the slurry pushes through are a reverse cone shape, with the top diameter smaller than the bottom. That shape is what compresses the ice through the hole,” Miller explains. The speed and the shape of the extruder help determine the hardness of the ice.

Generally, nugget ice can be made softer, containing about 25 percent water and 75 percent ice, or harder, with only about 15 percent water, Scotsman Ice Systems' Jeff Biel tells Popular Mechanics. The texture depends on the end use. For example, convenience stores like to use the harder form, because softer nugget ice tends to congeal into a ball that no longer dispenses well if the machine isn't used for a while. On the other hand, a hospital might want to use softer ice for easier chewing, says Biel, who works as vice president of marketing and product development at Scotsman. 

At this point, the question may be: who doesn't love nugget ice? It has so many fans.

“If you were to pick up a handful of nugget ice and squeeze it, water would come out. Whereas if you did that with ice cubes that were in your freezer, there's really no water that's gonna get squeezed out. They're solid and pretty much 100 percent ice,” Biel says.

Its fast-melting quality makes nugget ice appealing for health care applications. Not only is it hydrating when you can't drink liquids before receiving anesthesia, but it's a safer alternative for people like seniors, who could have problems swallowing. “It really has a value in senior care. As soon as it hits your mouth, there's no chance of ever having it lodged in your throat and causing a problem breathing,” John Ardente, senior director of facilities operations for Jefferson Health Northeast in the Philadelphia region, tells Popular Mechanics. It helps that this form of ice is easier to chew, too. Nugget ice has played an important role for patients in senior centers and hospitals over at least the past 25 years Ardente has worked in health care, he says. 

Malleability is another convenient property of nugget ice, he adds. When compressed, a mass of ice nuggets has reduced surface area, so the inside is insulated from quick melting. This makes the ice ideal for molding into comfortable cold packs that can wrap around a knee or elbow, Ardente says.



The way they are assembled means these ice nuggets also contain air pockets, making them a tasty bonus treat when you get to the end of your soft drink. “When you put it in Coke, the Coke rushes into the ice air pockets, and displaces the air. You end up with a flavored nugget,” says Biel. For this same reason, nugget ice blends easily into smoothies and slushies. Its softer qualities cause less wear-and-tear on blender blades, too.

Restaurants and health care facilities aren't the only customers of nugget ice. Schools, factory floor break areas, and offices use them, too. Since they're so satisfying to chew, some people buy nugget ice makers for home use.

Still, there are some places where nugget ice is definitely not ideal. Since the nuggets melt faster than regular ice cubes, they water down alcoholic drinks, so you'd do better with solid chunks of ice in your gin and tonic. And, because they are still somewhat hard, ice nuggets may damage delicate seafood displays, which are better off with finer, flake ice.

Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting Friday played out as if on a split screen: executives describing a future where AI cures diseases and secures networks, and shareholder proposals warning of algorithmic bias, political censorship, and complicity in geopolitical conflict.

One shareholder, William Flaig, founder and CEO of Ridgeline Research, quoted two authorities on the topic — George Orwell's 1984 and Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot — in requesting a report on the risks of AI censorship of religious and political speech.

Flaig invoked Orwell's dystopian vision of surveillance and thought control, citing the Ministry of Truth that “rewrites history and floods society with propaganda.” He then turned to Copilot, which responded to his query about an AI-driven future by noting that “the risk lies not in AI itself, but in how it's deployed.”

In a Q&A session during the virtual meeting, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company is “putting the person and the human at the center” of its AI development, with technology that users “can delegate to, they can steer, they can control.”

Nadella said Microsoft has moved beyond abstract principles to “everyday engineering practice,” with safeguards for fairness, transparency, security, and privacy.

Brad Smith, Microsoft's vice chair and president, said broader societal decisions, like what age kids should use AI in schools, won't be made by tech companies. He cited ongoing debates about smartphones in schools nearly 20 years after the iPhone.

“I think quite rightly, people have learned from that experience,” Smith said, drawing a parallel to the rise of AI. “Let's have these conversations now.”

Microsoft's board recommended that shareholders vote against all six outside proposals, which covered issues including AI censorship, data privacy, human rights, and climate. Final vote tallies have yet to be released as of publication time, but Microsoft said shareholders turned down all six, based on early voting. 

While the shareholder proposals focused on AI risks, much of the executive commentary focused on the long-term business opportunity. 

Nadella described building a “planet-scale cloud and AI factory” and said Microsoft is taking a “full stack approach,” from infrastructure to AI agents to applications, to capitalize on what he called “a generational moment in technology.”

Microsoft CFO Amy Hood highlighted record results for fiscal year 2025 — more than $281 billion in revenue and $128 billion in operating income — and pointed to roughly $400 billion in committed contracts as validation of the company's AI investments.

Hood also addressed pre-submitted shareholder questions about the company's AI spending, pushing back on concerns about a potential bubble. 

“This is demand-driven spending,” she said, noting that margins are stronger at this stage of the AI transition than at a comparable point in Microsoft's cloud buildout. “Every time we think we're getting close to meeting demand, demand increases again.”

LAS VEGAS — Our toaster has arrived.

Amazon's Zoox robotaxi service launched in Las Vegas this fall, and a few members of the hard-working GeekWire Studios crew joined me to try it out for a ride to dinner after a long day at AWS re:Invent. Zoox was nothing short of a hit with our group.

The consensus: it was a smooth, futuristic shuttle ride that felt safe amid the Las Vegas chaos, with per-seat climate control, and customizable music. (Somehow we landed on Cher, but in this vehicle, we felt no need to turn back time.) Most of all, the face-to-face seating made for a fun group experience, rather than a retrofitted car like Waymo. 

Zoox, founded in 2014, was acquired by Amazon in 2020 for just over $1 billion, marking the tech giant's move into autonomous vehicle technology and urban mobility. Zoox operates as an independent subsidiary, based in Foster City, Calif.​​

Unlike competitors that retrofit vehicles, Zoox designed its robotaxi from scratch. It's a compact, 12-foot-long electric pod, bidirectional, without steering wheel or pedals.

The experience of calling the Zoox vehicle on the app was seamless and quick. The doors opened via a button in the app after the carriage arrived to pick us up at a designated station between Fashion Show Mall and Trump International Hotel. 

Inside, our nighttime ride featured a starfield display on the interior ceiling of the cab, adding to the magical feel, with functional seats comfortable enough for a drive across the city.

A few of us had experienced Waymo in California, so it was natural to make the comparison. One thing I missed was the live virtual road view that Waymo provides, representing surrounding vehicles and roadways, which provides some reassurance.

Emergency human assistance also seemed more accessible in the Waymo vehicles than in the Zoox carriage. And unlike the Waymo Jaguar cars that I've taken in San Francisco, the build quality of the Zoox vehicle felt more utilitarian than luxury.

For this current phase of the Vegas rollout, one major downside is the limited service area — just seven fixed spots along the Las Vegas strip, like Resorts World, Luxor, and AREA15, requiring walks between hubs rather than seamless point-to-point hails. It's more of a novelty for that reason, rather than a reliable form of transportation.

But hey, the rides are free for now, so it's hard to complain.

And the ability to sit across from each other more than made up for any minor quibbles. (Our group of five split up and took two four-person carriages from Fashion Show Mall to Resorts World.) Compared to the Waymo experience, the Zoox vehicle feels less like sitting in a car and more like sharing a moving living room.

GeekWire Studios host Steph Stricklen was initially skeptical — wondering if Vegas would be the right place for an autonomous vehicle, given the chaotic backdrop and unpredictable traffic patterns on the Strip. But she walked away a believer, giving the ride a “10 out of 10” and saying she never felt unsafe as a passenger. 

“It felt very Disneyland,” said GeekWire Studios host Brian Westbrook, citing the creature comforts such as climate control that seemed to be isolated to each seat. Along with music and other controls, that's one of the features that can be accessed via small touch-screen displays for each passenger on the interior panel of the vehicle.

GeekWire project manager Jessica Reeves said she almost forgot that there wasn't a human driving. Despite rapid acceleration at times, the ride was smooth.

“It didn't feel like I was riding in an autonomous vehicle, maybe it was just the buzz of experiencing this new way of transportation,” Jessica messaged me afterward, reflecting on the experience. “The spaciousness, facing my friends, exploring the different features, it all happened so fast that before I knew it, we were there!”

Holly Grambihler, GeekWire's chief sales and marketing officer, was impressed with the clean interior and comfortable seats.

“It felt less like a vehicle and more like a mobile karaoke studio with the customized climate control and ability to choose your music — Cher in Vegas, perfect!” Holly said. “It felt safe with our short ride. I don't think I'd take a Zoox on a freeway yet.”

On that point: Zoox's purpose-built pod is engineered to reach highway speeds of up to about 75 mph, and the company has tested it at those velocities on closed tracks. In Las Vegas, though, the robotaxis currently stick to surface streets at lower speeds, and Zoox hasn't yet started mixing into freeway traffic.

The Vegas service launch marked Zoox's first public robotaxi deployment, offering free rides along a fixed loop on and around the Strip while gathering data for paid trips. Zoox followed with a limited public launch in San Francisco in November.

For Amazon, the technology represents a long-term bet, with the potential to contribute to its logistics operations. It's not hard to imagine similar vehicles shuttling packages in the future. But for now the focus is on public ridership.

The company has flagged Austin, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Seattle as longer-term potential markets for the robotaxi service as regulations and technology mature. We've contacted Zoox for the latest update on its plans.

If our own ride this week was any indication, the company's biggest challenge may simply be expanding the robotaxi service fast enough for more people to try it.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

A newly proposed payroll tax would add new costs for large businesses in Washington state. But Rep. Shaun Scott, a Seattle Democrat sponsoring the bill, argues it would protect the basic services that help companies recruit and retain talent.

“People are looking to the state legislature for leadership on protecting the programs that make our state actually a healthy climate to do business in,” Scott told GeekWire this week. 

House Bill 2100, pre-filed this week in Olympia, would create the “Well Washington Fund” and levy a 5% payroll expense tax on “large operating companies” for employee wages above a $125,000 threshold. The bill defines a “large operating company” as one with more than 20 employees and more than $5 million in gross receipts or sales, among other criteria. Employers with total employee wages under $7 million in the prior year would be exempt.

Scott is pitching the bill as a state backstop against federal cuts hitting Medicaid, higher education, housing and other programs. He said it would generate more than $2 billion annually and impact the about 4,300 businesses — including Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant Microsoft and telecom behemoth T-Mobile, headquartered in Bellevue.

Seattle-based companies such as Amazon that already pay the city's JumpStart payroll tax would be exempt.

Scott said there is a “corollary effect” on corporations from policies that benefit “everyday people.”

“My sense of it is that the public is on our side on this issue,” he said. “They understand that when you have very well-funded higher education, what that means is a well-trained workforce that could seek employment at a place like Microsoft or Amazon — and the company would benefit as a result.”

“When you have people who have very good housing options, that makes Washington that much more of a competitive place to come and do business,” he added.

Business groups are wary of the proposal. Rachel Smith, the new CEO of Washington Roundtable, called it a “tax-first, plan later” idea. She also cited the state's recent tax increases impacting businesses — passed in part to help address a $16 billion budget shortfall — and broader economic uncertainty. 

“If a job is cheaper somewhere else, and a company has an operational environment that allows them to deploy that job somewhere else, of course that's going to be something they consider,” Smith said in an interview with GeekWire.

Lawmakers tried to pass a similar statewide payroll tax this year, but the bill did not advance. In March, Microsoft President Brad Smith criticized that tax proposal and said it would increase prices for consumers, reduce jobs, and hurt the tech industry.

Microsoft declined to comment on Rep. Scott's proposal when contacted by GeekWire this week. 

Rep. Scott said it's “disingenuous” that critics raise alarms about companies leaving when the state talks about funding the safety net, but don't ask similar questions when companies cut jobs on their own. He said the relocation question “does not come up when we see large tech firms investing in artificial intelligence, which is designed to divest from human labor.”

Washington is one of a few states without a personal or corporate income tax. Most state revenue comes from sales, property, and B&O taxes — a system critics say disproportionately burdens lower-income residents.

Gabriella Buono, interim president and CEO at the Seattle Metro Chamber, said that “raising taxes in an affordability crisis will mean higher prices on everyday essentials, fewer job opportunities, and more closures in sectors that are already on the edge.”

“Voters across the political spectrum are clear: they want smart spending, transparency, and results, not new taxes that make it harder to live and work in this state,” Buono said in a statement.

Revenue from the proposed bill would initially go to the state general fund in 2026, then split beginning in 2027, with 51% directed to a dedicated Well Washington fund account and 49% to the general fund. A new oversight and accountability board would guide priorities and report annually. Spending from the account would be limited to higher education, health care — especially Medicaid — cash assistance, and energy and housing programs.

The launch of Hamlet was quite personal for Sunil Rajaraman.

Back in 2022, he ran for city council in a small California town. He lost, but the moment forever changed the way he saw the place — and local governments, for that matter. 

“I was trying to become a better candidate,” he recalled to TechCrunch. “I wanted to understand how my city actually worked, what decisions had been made, why, who said what. And I couldn't figure it out. It's a total black box, and almost intentionally opaque.”

Since COVID, towns across the nation have started recording and posting their city meetings online. That gave Rajaraman an idea: a company that helped people understand what was happening in local governments. That same year, in 2022, he launched Hamlet to do just that.

“We use AI to process thousands of hours of city council and planning commission meeting videos and turn them into intelligence they can actually use,” he said. He said these videos are better than meeting minutes because those documents are just someone's interpretations of what happened. “The video doesn't lie.”

At first, he thought it would be a media company, but then real estate developers and political action committees started reaching out. Rajaraman realized that private companies have to deal with local governments, too, and they also want more insight into what is happening in those city council meetings.

For enterprise customers, the company helps track agendas and alerts them when relevant topics are addressed across target cities. It also synthesizes what happened after meetings, so they don't have to watch hourslong videos, and it lets them search the video archive to see, for example, when and how a competitor was mentioned in a local government setting.

Hamlet has raised around $10 million in venture funding to date, from backers including Slow Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Banana Capital, and Kapor Capital. “We want to become the ‘Bloomberg' of this space, so to speak,” Rajaraman said.

On Friday, Rajaraman announced he is expanding the company to launch Hamlet TV as a way to help keep regular citizens informed of what is happening inside their governments. The streaming channel is on TikTok, YouTube, AppleTV, and Instagram, and will spotlight important moments from council, commission, and school board meetings.

Rajaraman said his company has processed thousands of hours of government meetings for government customers.

“We've seen meetings that have lasted 15-plus hours without recess,” he said. He and his team started curating funny moments from those meetings, and they thought it was a good idea to use humor to get people more invested in the U.S. democracy. “If you show people procedural videos, they are just not going to care. But if you show them the funny stuff, they'll watch.”  

The most surprising thing he and his team have seen so far on Hamlet TV has been someone dressing up as a cockroach to address their city council about a pest problem. But it's not the funny stuff that surprises him, he said. “It's how consequential these meetings are and how invisible they remain.”

He cited an example from earlier this year when the Tucson city council rejected Amazon's $3.6 billion data center. He said that the decision came after months of planning, but only a few people likely watched those videos to understand why it happened.  

This isn't Rajaraman's first time running a business — or a media outlet. He co-founded the analytics platform Scripted and was twice the Entrepreneur in Residence at Foundation Capital. He also ran a publication called The Bold Italic and then sold it to Medium.

He knows Hamlet TV probably won't be a moneymaker and reiterated that he's doing this to get people more involved with the state of the country's democracy. He also plans to give away the Hamlet tool to local journalists for free. “Data is great, but context matters so much,” he said.

Next, the Hamlet company is looking to work with government affairs, advocacy organizations, and renewable energy developers. “Democracy works better when people are watching,” he said. “We're trying to make watching possible.”

The New York Times filed suit Friday against AI search startup Perplexity for copyright infringement, its second lawsuit against an AI company. The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the Chicago Tribune, which also filed suit this week.

The Times' suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.” 

The lawsuit — filed even as several publishers, including The Times, negotiate deals with AI firms — is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism.

Perplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a Publishers' Program last year, which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, Perplexity also launched Comet Plus, allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images.

“While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity's unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.”

Similar to the Tribune's suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity's method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant. 

“Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads. “Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or near-verbatim reproductions, summaries, or abridgments of the original content, including The Times's copyrighted works.”  

Or, as James put it in his statement,  “RAG allows Perplexity to crawl the internet and steal content from behind our paywall and deliver it to its customers in real time. That content should only be accessible to our paying subscribers.”

The Times also claims Perplexity's search engine has hallucinated information and falsely attributed it to the outlet, which damages its brand.

“Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media, and now AI,” Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity's head of communications, told TechCrunch. “Fortunately it's never worked, or we'd all be talking about this by telegraph.”

(Publishers have, at times, won or shaped major legal battles over new technologies, resulting in settlements, licensing regimes, and court precedents.)

The lawsuit comes just over a year after The Times sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity demanding it stop using its content for summaries and other output. The outlet claims it has contacted Perplexity several times over the past 18 months to stop using its content unless an agreement could be negotiated.

This isn't the first fight The Times has picked with an AI firm. The Times is also suing OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the two trained their AI systems with millions of the outlet's articles without offering compensation. OpenAI has argued that its use of publicly available data for AI training constitutes “fair use,” and has shot its own accusations at the Times, claiming the outlet manipulated ChatGPT to find evidence. 

That case is still ongoing, but a similar lawsuit directed against OpenAI competitor Anthropic could set a precedent in regards to fair use for training AI systems going forward. In that suit, in which authors and publishers sued the AI firm for using pirated books to train its models, the court ruled that while lawfully acquired books might be a safe fair use application, pirated ones infringe on copyrights. Anthropic agreed to a $1.5 billion settlement. 

The Times' lawsuit adds to mounting legal pressure on Perplexity. Last year, News Corp — which owns outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and the New York Post — made similar claims against Perplexity. That list grew in 2025 to also include Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster, Nikkei, Asahi Shimbun, and Reddit.

Other outlets, including Wired and Forbes, have accused Perplexity of plagiarism and unethically crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don't want to be scraped. The latter claim is one that internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare recently confirmed. 

In its suit, The Times is asking the courts to make Perplexity pay for the harm allegedly caused and ban the startup from continuing to use its content. 

The Times is clearly not above working with AI firms that compensate for its reporters' work. The outlet earlier this year struck a multi-year deal with Amazon to license its content to train the tech giant's AI models. Several other publishers and media companies have signed licensing deals with AI firms to use their content for training and to feature in chatbot responses. OpenAI has inked deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, Vox Media, The Atlantic, and more.  

This article has been updated with comment from Perplexity.

I wouldn't say the problem is hostility. It's complete non-interest. Apple wisely allowed us to load a non-chain-of-trust OS while maintaining the chain of trust in macOS, which is an incredible advancement still unmatched by other manufacturers.And that's it. They have done zero work to accommodate Linux. At all. Perhaps if Microsoft ever figures out that NT used to run on more than one arch, Apple will revive Boot Camp for Windows and deem it useful to include Linux this time?

Save you a click or two. Looking at this I have so many questions. Am I buying a mainboard? It is not clear. It lists ports: it only supports 2 ports? You have four options with 16/32gigs and 1tb of storage? Is the storage soldiered? If so, what is the storage? emmc? Soldiered memory seems to be a given in the ARM ecosystem, but the storage is completely unacceptable on a framework mainboard.The only difference between the pro and the regular is that the second port is a usb-c over an hdmi? I am assuming this is the mainboard even supporting framework extension cards.No listed Linux compatibility support. Forget if the NPU even works in Linux; I do not even know if this will boot Linux because the company did not bother to submit devicetree patches to the kernel for their SOC. No listed Windows support even.This company's copy is absolutely terrible.

EDIT: Sorry, not SnapdragonX - apparently I can't read.Also, who is "MetaComputing" and can I trust them with my money? Something about the big "Web 3 Integrated Devices" branding on their landing  page makes me less than enthusiastic. Otherwise I'd be hovering over 'buy'

Meta has signed commercial AI data agreements with news publishers to offer real-time global, entertainment, and breaking news on Meta AI, its AI chatbot. Now, when users ask Meta AI news-related questions, it will surface information and links that draw from different content sources to help users discover timely and relevant content, the company announced on Friday.

These responses will also include links to articles, so users can visit publishers' websites to learn more. The company says this will allow its partners to reach new audiences. 

Meta is partnering with CNN, Fox News, Fox Sports, Le Monde Group, the People Inc. portfolio of media brands, The Daily Caller, The Washington Examiner, and USA Today.

The company plans to add new partnerships in the future.

The move comes as Meta shifted away from making its platforms hubs for news. For example, it killed Facebook's “News” tab in 2024. Additionally, Meta stopped compensating news publishers in 2022, but is now doing so to help supercharge its AI chatbot with real-time access to news.

“We're committed to making Meta AI more responsive, accurate, and balanced,” Meta wrote in the blog post. “Real-time events can be challenging for current AI systems to keep up with, but by integrating more and different types of news sources, our aim is to improve Meta AI's ability to deliver timely and relevant content and information with a wide variety of viewpoints and content types.”

The company is looking to attract more users to its AI chatbot as it faces increasing competition from rivals. Meta is also looking to stay relevant in the AI race after the controversial release of Llama 4, which was met with complaints of poor performance earlier this year.

Meta AI is available in over 200 countries and can be accessed through the company's apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as through the standalone Meta AI app.

One of the longest and least stable will-they-or-won't-they relationships isn't between two people, but all Americans and small cars. And while newly proposed changes to federal fuel economy standards mostly leave the door open for more polluting, bigger gasoline-only vehicles in the future, there was a veiled attempt to widen the types of vehicles available in the US.

The President thinks that includes very small cars, too. It doesn't, and it doesn't mean they'd go mainstream here anyway.

During the announcement of the plan to roll back US fuel economy standards to those of a decade ago on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he wanted very small cars as widely seen in some parts of Asia, called kei cars in Japan, to come to this country and also be built here, saying that people told him they'd do well but that this country's regulations wouldn't allow it. 

What Trump was most likely referring to is a car that's defined by Japanese regulations as a vehicle that's no longer than 3.4 meters (11.15 feet), has an engine capacity no greater than 0.66 liters, with no more than 63 horsepower, and can seat no more than four people. By comparison, the smallest gasoline-powered car sold in the US today is the Mini Cooper 2-Door, which has a 2.0-liter engine, 156 horsepower, four seats, and is 3.9 meters (12.71 feet) long.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy backed this up by describing the changes necessary because under the previous standards, “consumers were denied the choice of what is best for their needs,” directly targeting any deadlines for required electrification. But the following morning, Duffy recalled the days of the 1970s woodgrain-paneled station wagon as the default vehicle of middle America, a vehicle typically powered by a V8, in excess of 18 feet long, and weighing about 5,000 pounds. That sounds a lot like a four-door, full-size pickup truck like the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, or Ram 1500, all among the best-selling vehicles in the country in the 21st century.

How does a kei car, many of which have top speeds around 80 mph, compete against a three-ton vehicle that's not only exponentially more powerful but also much taller and wider?

We've been down this road a few times before with only temporary relief. The 2007-2008 financial crisis brought economic uncertainty, credit crunches, and erratic gas prices that made it untenable to buy and operate large SUVs and pickup trucks. Companies tried turning Americans onto smaller vehicles like the Smart Fortwo and Mini, while they simultaneously manufactured popular higher-end versions of compact cars and SUVs like the Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze, and Dodge Dart that included features like heated steering wheels and rear seats, navigation systems, and commanded nearly $30,000. All of those except the Mini have since been discontinued in the US; most Minis sold today are not the traditional two-door hatchback but instead the not-small Countryman SUV.

In the 1950s and 1960s, tiny cars like the original Fiat 500 and Mini, as well as the front-door-ed BMW Isetta landed in the US in numbers as small as their footprint. They couldn't match the demand of the far more popular, usable, and sometimes less expensive Volkswagen Beetle and early models from Datsun and Toyota.

The most notable tiny car was the Subaru 360, first imported in 1968 with a two-cylinder engine, weighing in at less than 1,000 pounds and thereby skirting any formal crash regulations at the time. It was memorably eviscerated in a Consumer Reports review the following year, citing insufficient crash protection and performance, but the bigger issue was the indication that a car like the Subaru was a bridge too far for the most common vehicles on the largest American roads, despite good fuel economy, relatively low base price, and urban compatibility.

Interestingly, Subaru attempted the same thing roughly 40 years later with the introduction of the Smart to the US amid surging fuel prices and a push for “affordability.” Two four-seat Subaru kei cars were imported to the company's US headquarters in New Jersey in 2007, according to a 2019 story from The Drive, but were ultimately deemed unsuitable for mainstream sales because they were too small, partly because of the driving conditions, but also because American people were too big for them.

All of this reinforces the idea that what the American people, the EPA, NHTSA, and other agencies consider to be a small car is what many other countries think of as a large one. Other heavily or densely populated countries also tax drivers on a vehicle's engine size, carbon dioxide emissions, and, in Japan, width, in addition to insurance and registration, and whatever local taxes are involved in parking and fuel. 

What's more, these tiny cars, in a bid to stay lighter and cheaper, stick predominantly to small gas-powered engines. Even though some are now available as EVs or hybrids, packaging requirements and price targets adversely affect the smallest cars on sale in every market. Trump and Duffy's argument is that smaller cars are automatically cheaper and that will keep more money in American wallets, and that doesn't pencil out in the proposed changes.

Last week, US Senators confirmed a January meeting with auto executives about why new cars are so expensive, and, according to The Wall Street Journal, they believe the mandated safety technology, such as automatic emergency braking and backup cameras, is the culprit, and more efforts should be put into autonomous vehicles. Small, less expensive cars could once again lack standard driver assistance systems that minimize the risk of crashes and injuries not just to people in cars, but those outside of them.

It's not like Americans don't have small-engined and compact cars available today, or even that they're not popular. More than 200,000 Honda Civics and roughly the same number of Toyota Corollas have been sold through this year, along with more than 170,000 three-cylinder-powered Chevy Trax small SUVs. They might be considered midsize cars everywhere else in the world, but they take up far less space than many popular cars sold in the US.

The enthusiasts who've imported little Subarus, Mitsubishis, Nissans, and other kei cars to the US and have kept them running over the years are admirable for making them work and making those of us wishing for a smaller vehicle on certain streets envious. The same goes for all the people who've kept their Minis, Fiats, and Smarts on the Manhattan and San Francisco streets after they weren't the flavor of the month in much of the rest of the country. They can prioritize what they need to own a car to do and focus less on what they think they might need it to do.

Americans already have a lot of choices, not just in cars, but in how to get around at all, what fuel powers their choice, and how much fuel is needed. Trump's proposal won't change the way the country currently and historically thinks about small cars. For kei cars to ever have a chance in the U.S., it's going to take more than some lip service from a President who is desperate to show he has any policies that make life more affordable.

The European Commission (EC) has imposed its first fine under Europe's landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), and it's against Elon Musk's X.

The EC is taking issue with the fact that X has been allowing anyone to buy a “blue checkmark,” the platform's long-standing symbol which used to indicate that a user has been verified to be who they are claiming to be.

Calling the design of the blue checkmark system “deceptive,” the European Union's executive arm on Friday imposed a fine of €120 million (about $140 million) on X, saying the company had breached its transparency obligations under the DSA. 

The Commission said other breaches of the law include a lack of transparency of X's advertising repository and failure to provide researchers access to public data.

Before Musk bought the company, Twitter used to issue blue checks to journalists, celebrities, politicians, and public figures on the platform after it had verified their identity. Musk did away with that policy in 2023, and all the “verified” blue check today indicates is that a user subscribes to X Premium, and that they meet certain eligibility criteria, like having a profile photo, a display name, and have linked their account to a phone number.

“X's use of the ‘blue checkmark' for ‘verified accounts' deceives users,” the Commission wrote in a statement. “This violates the DSA obligation for online platforms to prohibit deceptive design practices on their services. On X, anyone can pay to obtain the ‘verified' status without the company meaningfully verifying who is behind the account, making it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and content they engage with.”

The Commission added that such a system exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud, and manipulation.

The regulator also found that X's advertisement repository doesn't comply with DSA requirements for transparency and accessibility, saying the company imposes excessive delays in processing requests for access. The Commission also said the ads repository doesn't house important information like the content or topic of ads, as well as who paid for those ads.

“This hinders researchers and the public to independently scrutinise any potential risks in online advertising,” the Commission wrote.

Access to public data is another area of concern for the EU. The DSA mandates that public platforms allow researchers access to public data to study systemic risks, and the EC's investigation has found that X does not allow researchers to independently do that.

“Moreover, X's processes for researchers' access to public data impose unnecessary barriers, effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union,” the EC wrote.

The decision comes two years after the EC launched an investigation into the company on the suspected breach of rules linked to risk management, content moderation, dark patterns, advertising transparency, and data access for researchers.

“Deceiving users with blue checkmarks, obscuring information on ads, and shutting out researchers have no place online in the EU,” Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy at the European Commission, said in a statement.

X now has 60 days to outline how it intends to address the complaint about the blue checkmarks, and 90 days to respond with an action plan for addressing the breaches relating to ads and public data transparency and accessibility.

Confirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.

In one of the most groundbreaking deals the streaming world has ever seen, Netflix announced on Friday its acquisition of Warner Bros. with an enterprise value of $82.7 billion. 

This agreement involves both HBO Max and the HBO studio, marking one of the largest mergers in Hollywood's history. By making this move, Netflix is not just solidifying its top position but also significantly enhancing its content library, gaining access to well-known franchises such as DC Comics, “Game of Thrones,” and “Harry Potter.” 

While Netflix boasted over 300 million paying subscribers in January, HBO Max, in combination with Discovery+, currently has around 128 million subscribers.

Additionally, the scale of Netflix's offer is notable, as the streaming giant is investing $72 billion, which exceeds Warner Bros.' entire market valuation of $60 billion.

However, this merger isn't without its challenges; it could face antitrust scrutiny. 

In November, senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal expressed concerns regarding the potential sale. The trio sent a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division indicating that any agreement would be viewed “under a cloud of political favoritism and corruption.”

Additionally, various industry players are expressing their views. According to Variety, an anonymous group reportedly sent a letter to Congress urging them to publicly oppose Netflix's offer.

Warner Bros. Discovery officially put itself up for sale in October, burdened by debt and disappointing streaming growth. The company attracted interest from several suitors, with Paramount seen as the frontrunner.

The acquisition is expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2026, after Warner Bros. Discovery follows through with its plan to separate from Discovery Global, which includes its collection of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN.

The companies estimate that the transaction, a mix of cash and stock, will be completed within 12 to 18 months.

Looking more moped than ebike, the GoTrax Mustang electric bike appears to share more DNA with old-school dirt bikes than it does modern electric bicycles. At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it's ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things.

However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax, is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it's easy to forget that it's a bicycle basically built on a moped platform.

Before we get into the personality of this bike, let's lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike's rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren't versed in torque ratings, rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6' 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings' words—90 Nm flattens the hills.

All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification, which will help you sleep better at night.

Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

Those rotors and Tektro brakes combined to not only give all 300 pounds of Mike-and-bike plenty of stopping power, they also allowed me to feather my speed with extreme precision as I wound my way down the curvy hill toward home.

Like most new ebikes, the Mustang—which employs a generic Shimano seven-speed thumb-shift gearset—features five pedal assist levels and has an independent thumb-based throttle, allowing the rider to fully avoid pedaling should they chose (at the sake of draining your battery even faster, of course). It sits on wheels that are small in diameter (20 inches … think a BMX bike) but massive in width (4 inches, so wider than your average mountain bike).

Those wheels combined with a front suspension system that appears to offer around 100 mm of travel make for a comfy ride. It also features a massive LED headlight, which did plenty to illuminate the road in front of me. It's an essential element during the midwinter, when the sun goes down before most people's workdays end.

And though it only has a one-sided kickstand as opposed to a scooter-style underframe stand, the bike's aforementioned short wheelbase means it never felt unstable when I hopped off and kicked the stand down. It also comes with a nifty little setting that'll give you a little extra boost while walking the bike. Again, if you're pushing a ~50-pound bike uphill, you might need some extra oomph.

Other than the ultra-cool, deep-red-logo-on-flat-metallic paint job, the real showstopper on the Mustang is its control system, which features a stunning, full-color LCD display that shows in real time your speed, remaining battery, pedal assist level, odometer, and how much of the motor's available 750 watts are being used at any given moment.

Remember those 86 miles I mentioned before? The ones you can reportedly get on a single charge? Well, that's probably only if you live in a flat area and keep your Mustang on the lowest power setting. The product page on GoTrax's website has a handy little chart that tells you about how far each mode is estimated to get you on a full charge.

But here in Chapel Hill (which, rest assured, is aptly named), I got closer to 28 miles on a single charge, constantly switching back and forth between all five power modes plus an often-wide-open throttle. Granted, 28 miles is not bad, especially if, like me, you use your e-bike to commute just a few miles to and from work or school.

While there are mounts on the downtube for a decent-sized (and innovative-ly positioned) basket, there don't appear to be many other mounts for front- or rear-rack options, panniers, or additional seating. It all gives the sense that the Mustang, like those dirt bikes of 1980s yore, is really only meant to be ridden by one person at a time. If you're in search of a family hauler or something more adept at replacing your car for everyday errands, the Mustang probably isn't the bike. Rather, it seems to be built almost exclusively for zipping from Point A to Point B and back.

Speaking of seating, the biggest issue I had with the Mustang was the fact that it appears to only be available one size with a seat that is not adjustable. Again, for someone who stands 6' 4”, it made it all but impossible to ride comfortably. In the dozen or so hours I spent riding the Mustang, it felt like I was riding my kid brother's BMX bike, as my knees splayed out from the bike (a position that any cyclist can tell you could lead to minor pain at best, and lasting knee injury at worst).

Digging around GoTrax's site, there appears to be neither a height chart to recommend how tall riders should be in order to enjoyably ride a GoTrax, nor any options for different frame sizes. Meanwhile, the bike's bench-style saddle is not adjustable, meaning the Mustang is a one-size-fits-all bike. The only problem is, it's one size doesn't fit all.

While I didn't manage to get multiple friends of different sizes on the Mustang, I'd be hard pressed to imagine anyone bigger than 5' 9” or 5' 10” being able to comfortably pedal a Mustang for more than a few minutes. All in all, it's a pretty affordable bike. However, I might recommend seeing if you can find anyone in your town who owns GoTrax's popular Ranger model, whose dimensions are similar to the Mustang, to check if you can fit first.

Missed out on all the Black Friday and Cyber Monday fun? You're in luck. MSI's MP273L E14 is a slick 27-inch FHD monitor which promises a neat blend of features suitable for productivity, such as a blue light filter and anti-glare tech, with support for the MSI Power Link feature to turn on a compatible MSI mini-PC. It's also well-equipped for gaming, with its 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync support. Currently priced at $89.99 (an all-time low at $40 off). You'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal now that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are over. But it likely won't last for long, so be sure to grab it while you can.

This budget-friendly 1920 x 1080 120Hz IPS panel offers solid value as an entry-level gaming monitor (office monitors can be almost anything). Key features include support for 102% of the sRGB color gamut, a dedicated gaming mode, and handy "Eye Saver" tech to cut down on blue light. It's also HDR ready, if you're willing to go through the rigmarole of managing Windows' HDR capabilities. The IPS panel also sports 1ms (MPRT) and 4ms (GtG) response times to minimize ghosting, while AMD FreeSync support prevents screen tearing when running titles at a variable frame rate.

Connectivity is limited to a single HDMI 2.0 port and a legacy D-Sub (VGA) connector. Unsurprisingly, it lacks DisplayPort, a headphone jack, or USB ports. But what we expect for the price. Just note that you'll only be able to get the full 144Hz refresh rate by using the HDMI input.As far as aesthetics go, the MP237L E14 has ultra-thin bezels, a sleek design, and would look great on any office desk. The back of the monitor has a standard 100x100 VESA design to mount the monitor on an arm, or you can attach a mini PC (like MSI's Cubi Series) to the rear, allowing for a delightfully clean setup. If you choose an MSI Cubi Mini PC for this monitor, MSI's Power Link Support lets the mini-PC be powered on by the monitor's button for ease of use.

All-time low price 

Get the MSI Pro MP273L E14, a double-threat office and gaming monitor for $89.99/$40.00 off. Get it soon, as this deal expires in under 24 hours.

Moving from 60Hz to 144Hz is an absolute game-changer. I'll never forget making that jump. And at $89.99, you won't find a better deal on a 144Hz IPS panel. If you're in the market for a new budget monitor that has accurate colors and is good for office work during the day and want to play games after hours without ghosting and screen tearing, the MSI Pro MP273L E14 is the monitor to get right now. It's on sale for a limited time, so be sure to act fast before you miss out.

I had a plan. I was going to build my own version of Valve's Steam Machine using traditional PC parts, then stuff it all into my childhood PC case installed with SteamOS for the ultimate combination of convenience and nostalgia. But I waited too long. The price of RAM has skyrocketed so high that even previous-generation PC components are now sitting at two, three, or four times as much as they were only two months ago. Building any size PC is more untenable than even back during the pandemic-era GPU shortage. Gamers everywhere are looking for an alternative to play their PC game library, and—unfortunately—one of the last remaining avenues demands a less-expensive-but-still-pricey cloud gaming subscription.

My original plan was to heap my PC full of hand-me-down, used, and last-gen parts to get the best deal I could. Currently, even older selections of DDR4 RAM sticks as small as 16GB cost close to $110, whereas the same component sat at $50 as recently as September. Newer DDR5 sticks now cost five times as much. And it's only going to get worse. On Wednesday, Micron, which owns the major DRAM (dynamic random access memory) brand Crucial, announced it made the “difficult decision” to kill its consumer-facing brand altogether. Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, made it clear this was to focus on fulfilling the insatiable demand for memory from AI data centers.

Micron held 25.7% of the DRAM market share by the time it exited the scene, according to TrendForce data. The next biggest player, Nanya, held 1.1%. There are few scenarios where this doesn't impact the price of computer parts even more. So where does that leave gamers who were too late upgrading their PC or who find they need new hardware to play their games? I hate to say it, but there are options for those with solid home internet connections and a willingness to remain beholden to a subscription service.

Last month, Xbox claimed the number of playtime hours on its Game Pass Cloud Gaming service was up 45% year over year. That 45% comes specifically from cloud streaming on consoles, but the service was seeing 26% more playtime on “other devices.” Xbox didn't break down how big a portion “other devices” made up PC, or perhaps former PC gamers. Earlier this year, Xbox raised the price of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription from $20 to $30 a month. At the same time, it gave access to cloud gaming for people spending $15 or $10 for lower tiers on select titles. The service can now stream games up to 1440p resolutions as well.

The uptick in playtime may be related to recent games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 coming out on Game Pass, though that can't be the whole story. Gamers are looking for the best deal, and even a more expensive subscription service will be far cheaper than high-end 64GB RAM that costs close to $800 from some brands. For PC gamers who want to play their own games, the other option is to pay for GeForce Now. Nvidia recently updated its subscription service to enable some games to run on a more recent Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU instead of an older RTX 4080 Super or RTX 4080. You have to pay $20 a month to access that feature as well as 4K streaming.

Not all games will run on the RTX 5080. Nvidia has added more over time; most recently titles like Enshrouded and Fallout 76. Nvidia also lets subscribers play a few extra games that don't appear on GeForce Now's supported list through the Install-to-Play feature. You can rent out extra server space for a few more bucks a month to have instantaneous access to those games.

I've used both Game Pass and GeForce Now extensively enough to know that streaming is not a 1-to-1 replacement for a PC. Even with fast internet speeds and low latency, there is a distinct difference in visual quality between games that are rendered on-device and those streamed over the internet, even at 1440p or 4K. Anybody who used to be a native PC gamer will recognize the quality difference after a mere few minutes of play. And PC gamers are rarely the type to accept such tradeoffs.

These PC component price hikes will inevitably price out some gamers. While we hope that we'll see more relatively inexpensive (though still costly) PC gaming devices like the Steam Machine, we can't hold out hope that gaming-ready laptops won't demand extra cost.

Crucial was busy posting ads for its gaming-ready SSDs (solid state drives) as recently as the day prior to the company's announcement. Events are moving fast, and we won't have time to blink before the news gets worse. Market analyst firm TrendForce reported Micron was the number three DRAM supplier in the world, behind SK Hynix and Samsung. Those two companies are similarly retooling their business to focus on making memory for AI data centers. Transcend, another major consumer-end memory maker, wrote to customers in a notice shared online that Samsung and Sandisk delayed their latest shipments of NAND, which is used for flash memory. Transcend has been without NAND supply since October.

“The situation worsened in Q4 due to increased demand from large data centers and hyperscalers driven by major cloud service providers' expansion plans. All major chip manufacturers are prioritizing supply for these customers, which has led to price increases and extremely… pic.twitter.com/q5Wp6N38dm

— Jukan (@jukan05) December 3, 2025



These major tech brands have hinted the run on DRAM prices may last well past 2028. Korean language news site Hankyung reported Samsung and SK Hynix are both imagining their focus on AI data centers will last through the start of 2028. That sounds like magical thinking, but it shows just how willing memory makers are to leave the PC industry in the cold. Which means the consumer is going to need some alternatives, and soon.

Nvidia won't send customers replacement parts to fix their cards themselves, but apparently, Nvidia will send them replacement units, even if the customer is at fault for the damage.

Last month, we covered a story where a customer's $10,000 RTX Pro 6000 graphics card's PCIe component got split in half after the customer accidentally forgot to remove the card from their machine before shipping it to another location. Now, NorthridgeFix has provided an update, revealing that Nvidia is providing the customer with a replacement card, despite the customer technically breaking the original card. Additionally, Nvidia also wants the customer to return the damaged RTX Pro 6000 to them so its technical team can troubleshoot the card.

This is the second time that we have seen Nvidia replace a customer's GPU, even though the original damage was caused by user error. The first time we saw this was when a customer of an RTX 5090 Founders Edition accidentally damaged their card after attempting to install a waterblock on it (and voiding the card's warranty in the process). After NorthridgeFix published a video on the customer's 5090 FE, and complained that Nvidia did not provide replacement parts needed to fix the card, Nvidia replaced the customer's card anyway.

 




This latest story is an even worse tale revolving around Nvidia's $10,000 RTX Pro 6000 workstation graphics card. A customer of this card accidentally left the GPU inside their PC as they were shipping the system to another location, causing the PCIe component to snap in half. Again, NorthridgeFix complained that the card was unrepairable and that they could not source parts from Nvidia to fix it.

These two incidents reveal that Nvidia is apparently very lenient on its graphics card replacements, particularly for its OEM cards (not third-party cards from other vendors). Even if the customer is at fault for damaging their OEM Nvidia GPU, we now know that Nvidia won't rule out shipping the person a new graphics card (regardless of warranty). More encouragingly, Nvidia seems at least somewhat interested in examining the old card, possibly to check for structural weaknesses or flaws in the design.

This is great for consumers of these cards since NorthridgeFix reports that Nvidia refuses to provide replacement components for its GPUs, even though its Blackwell-based dual-fan OEM graphics cards have modularity in their design. The PCIe finger and four rear display outputs on these Blackwell cards are connected to the GPU with their own independent boards, theoretically making these components easy to fix if either component breaks. All you would have to do is replace the bad board(s) with a new one, if only Nvidia provided the parts. Though ironically, you can source the PCIe finger for these particular cards in China for just $25, but this option won't be available for everyone.

Amazon's Trn3 Gen2 UltraServer beats Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 in FP8.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Amazon Web Services this week introduced its next-generation Trainium3 accelerator for AI training and inference. As AWS puts it, the new processor is twice as fast as its predecessor and is four times more efficient. This makes it one of the best solutions for AI training and inference in terms of cost. In absolute numbers, Trainium3 offers up to 2,517 MXFP8 TFLOPS, which is nearly two times lower compared to Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra. However, AWS's Trn3 UltraServer packs 144 Trainium3 chips per rack, and offers 0.36 ExaFLOPS of FP8 performance, therefore matching the performance of Nvidia's NVL72 GB300. This is a very big deal, as very few companies can challenge Nvidia's rack-scale AI systems.

The AWS Trainium3 is a dual-chiplet AI accelerator that is equipped with 144 GB of HBM3E memory using four stacks, which provides peak memory bandwidth of up to 4.9 TB/s. Each compute chiplet, allegedly made by TSMC using its 3nm-class fabrication process, contains four NeuronCore-v4 cores (which feature an extended ISA compared to predecessors) and connects two HBM3E memory stacks. The two chiplets are connected using a proprietary high-bandwidth interface and share 128 independent hardware data-movement engines (which are key for the Trainium architecture), collective communication cores that coordinate traffic between chips, and four NeuronLink-v4 interfaces for scale-out connectivity.

A NeuronCore-v4 integrates four execution blocks: a tensor engine, a vector engine, a scalar engine, a GPSIMD block, and 32 MB of local SRAM that is explicitly managed by the compiler instead of being cache-controlled. From a software development standpoint, the core is built around a software-defined dataflow model in which data is staged into SRAM by DMA engines, processed by the execution units, and then written back as near-memory accumulation enables DMA to perform read-add-write operations in a single transaction. The SRAM is not coherent across cores and is used for tiling, staging, and accumulation rather than general caching.

Perhaps the most interesting component of NeuronCore-v4 is the GPSIMD block, which integrates eight fully-programmable 512-bit vector processors that can execute general-purpose code written in C/C++ while accessing local SRAM. GPSIMD is integrated into NeuronCore because not everything in real AI models maps cleanly to a tensor engine. Modern AI workloads contain a lot of code for unusual data layouts, post-processing logic, indexing, and model-specific math. These are hard or inefficient to express as matrix operations, and running them on the host CPU would introduce latency and costly data transfers. GPSIMD solves this by providing real general-purpose programmable vector units inside the core, so such logic runs directly next to the tensors at full speed and using the same local SRAM.

 




In short, NeuronCore-v4 operates as a tightly coupled dataflow engine in which tensor math, vector transforms, scalar control, and custom code all share a local 32MB scratchpad and are orchestrated by the Neuron compiler rather than by a warp scheduler used on Nvidia hardware.

Performance-wise, Trainium3 outperforms its direct predecessor in FP8 compute (well, MXFP8) by almost two times and hits 2.517 PFLOPS per package (clearly ahead of Nvidia's H100/H200, but behind Blackwell B200/B300) and adds MXFP4 support. However, Trainium3's BF16, TF32, and FP32 performance remains on par with Trainium2, which clearly shows that AWS is betting on MXFP8 for training and inference going forward. To that end, it does not develop its BF16 (which is widely used for training nowadays) and FP32 capabilities, as it seems to feel comfortable with the performance it has, given that these formats are now used primarily for gradient accumulation, master weights, optimizer states, loss scaling, and some precision-sensitive operations.

One interesting capability that Trainium3 has that is worth mentioning is the Logical NeuronCore Configuration (LNC) feature, which lets the Neuron compiler fuse four physical cores into a wider automatically synchronized logical core with combined compute, SRAM, and HBM, which could be useful for very wide layers or big sequence lengths that are common with very large AI models.

Much of Nvidia's success in the recent quarters was driven by its rack-scale NVL72 solutions featuring 72 of its Blackwell GPUs. Supporting a massive scale-up world size and an all-to-all topology, which is especially important for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and autoregressive inference. This gives Nvidia a massive advantage over AMD and developers of custom accelerators, such as AWS. To enable this capability, Nvidia had to develop NVLink switches, sophisticated network cards, and DPUs, a massive silicon endeavor. However, it looks like AWS's Trn3 UltraServers will give Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 a run for its money.

Trn3 UltraServers, powered by Trainium3 AI accelerators, will be offered in two sizes: one configuration packs 64 accelerators and presumably an Intel Xeon CPU, while the larger variant brings together 144 accelerators and an Arm-based Graviton in a single rack-scale solution. In the larger system, the 144 Trainium3 accelerators are distributed across 36 physical servers with one Graviton CPU and four Trainium3 chips installed in each machine. In many ways, such an arrangement resembles Nvidia's NVL72 approach, which uses Nvidia's CPU, GPU, and connectivity silicon, highlighting AWS' direction of building vertically integrated AI platforms.

Within a server, Trainium3 accelerators are linked through a first NeuronSwitch-v1 layer using NeuronLink-v4 (at 2 GiB/s per device, though it is unclear whether we are talking about a single direction bandwidth, or aggregated bidirectional bandwidth), and communication between different servers is routed through two additional NeuronSwitch-v1 fabric layers, again carried over NeuronLink-v4. Unfortunately, AWS does not publish aggregate NeuronSwitch-v1 bandwidth across the domain.

From a performance standpoint, the larger configuration with 144 Trainium3 delivers 362.5 MXFP8/MXFP4 PetaFLOPS (dense) performance, which (on par with GB300 NVL72), 96.624 PFLOPS of BF16/FP16/TF32 throughput, and 26.352 PFLOPS in FP32. The system is also equipped with 21 TB of HBM3E memory, featuring an aggregate memory bandwidth of 705.6 TB/s, leaving Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 behind in this metric.

In general, Trn3 Gen2 UltraServer appears very competitive against Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 in terms of FP8 performance. FP8 is about to get more popular for training, so betting on this format makes a lot of sense. Of course, Nvidia has an ace up its sleeve in the form of NVFP4, which is positioned both for inference and training, and armed with this format, the company's Blackwell-based machines are unbeatable. The same applies to BF16, which got faster compared to Trainium2, but not enough to beat Nvidia's Blackwell.

Overall, while the AWS Trn3 Gen2 UltraServer with 144 Trainium3 accelerator looks quite competitive when it comes to FP8 compared to Nvidia's Blackwell-based NVL72 machines, Nvidia's solution is more universal in general.

In addition to rolling out new AI hardware, AWS announced a broad expansion of its AWS Neuron software stack at its annual re:Invent conference this week. AWS positions this release as a shift toward openness and developer accessibility, so the update promises to make Trainium platforms easier to adopt, let standard machine learning frameworks run directly on Trainium hardware, give users deeper control over performance, and even expose low-level optimization paths for experts.

 




A major addition is native PyTorch integration through an open-source backend named TorchNeuron. Using PyTorch's PrivateUse1 mechanism, Trainium now appears as a native device type, which enables existing PyTorch code to execute without modification. TorchNeuron also supports interactive eager execution, torch.compile, and distributed features such as FSDP and DTensor, and it works with popular ecosystems including TorchTitan and Hugging Face Transformers. Access to this feature is currently restricted to select users as part of the private preview program.

AWS also introduced an updated Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) that gives developers direct control over hardware behavior, including instruction-level programming, explicit memory management, and fine-grained scheduling, exposing Trainium's instruction set to kernel developers. In addition, the company has released the NKI Compiler as open source under Apache 2.0. The programming interface is available publicly, while the compiler itself remains in limited preview.

AWS also released its Neuron Explorer, a debugging and tuning toolkit that lets software developers and performance engineers improve how their models run on Trainium. This is done by tracing execution from high-level framework calls, all the way down to individual accelerator instructions, while offering layered profiling, source-level visibility, integration with development environments, and AI-guided suggestions for performance tuning.

Finally, AWS introduced its Neuron Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) to integrate Trainium directly into Kubernetes without the need for custom schedulers. Neuron DRA relies on the native Kubernetes scheduler and adds hardware-topology awareness to enable complete UltraServers to be allocated as a single resource and then flexibly assign hardware for each workload. Neuron DRA supports Amazon EKS, SageMaker HyperPod, and UltraServer deployments, and is provided as open-source software with container images published in the AWS ECR public registry.

Both Neuron Explorer and Neuron DRA are designed to simplify cluster management and give users fine-grained control over how Trainium resources are assigned and used. In a nutshell, AWS is moving closer to making its Trainium-based platforms much more ubiquitous than they are today, in an effort to make them more competitive against CUDA-based offerings from Nvidia.

This week, Amazon Web Services released its 3rd Generation Trainium accelerator for AI training and inference, as well as accompanying Trn3 UltraServers rack-scale solutions. For the first time, Trn3 Gen2 UltraServers rack-scale machines will rely solely on AWS in-house hardware, including CPU, AI accelerators, switching hardware, and connectivity fabrics, signalling that the company has adopted Nvidia's vertical integration hardware strategy.

 




AWS claims that its Trainium3 processor offers roughly 2X higher performance and 4X better energy efficiency than Trainium2 as each accelerator delivers up to 2.517 PFLOPS (MXFP8) — beating Nvidia's H100, but trailing B200 — and is accompanied by 144 GB of HBM3E with 4.9 TB/s of bandwidth. Meanwhile, Trn3 Gen2 UltraServers scale to 144 accelerators for about 0.36 ExaFLOPS FP8 performance, which brings it on par with Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution. Nonetheless, Nvidia's hardware still looks more universal than AWS's.

To catch up with Nvidia, Amazon also announced major updates to its Neuron software stack to make Trainium-based platforms easier to use, allow standard machine-learning frameworks to run natively on the hardware, give developers greater control over performance, and open access to low-level tuning for experts.

Hanneke Faber argues that dedicated AI devices have yet to justify themselves as Logitech focuses on practical integrations.

Logitech's chief executive officer is questioning the widsom of rushing into standalone AI hardware. In an interview with Bloomberg, marking her second anniversary in the role, Hanneke Faber made comments have following several high-profile attempts at screenless or companion-style AI devices struggling to establish a market, while Logitech pulls revenue back to pre-pandemic levels and expands its AI features inside more traditional peripherals.

Faber argued that the wave of AI-first gadgets released over the past year remains untethered from a clear purpose. Products such as the Humane AI Pin — acquired by HP in February — and Rabbit R1 launched with the promise of replacing parts of the smartphone experience, only to draw criticism for slow performance, limited features, and subscription-driven pricing.

Their reception has shaped the debate around whether a general-purpose assistant belongs in a dedicated device at all. According to Faber, these early efforts solve little that a phone or PC cannot already handle, which is a view that has gained traction as both devices incorporate larger on-device models and tighter integrations with cloud assistants.

So, rather than building a new class of hardware around conversational AI, the company has been introducing features that sit inside established categories. Its webcams already use subject-aware framing and noise filtering, and the recently announced MX Master 4 mouse includes shortcuts that tie directly into ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot. Faber framed this as a matter of discipline: the company ships roughly three dozen products each year and follows a roadmap planned for several cycles ahead, so additions must justify themselves within familiar workflows.

The interview also touched on supply chain stability and pricing. Logitech raised prices early in the year following tariff changes, but does not expect further increases now that it has stabilized its supply chain across China and five additional countries. Faber described the diversification as a factor in restoring consistency across the firm's 13 product categories, most of which have returned to volumes near their pandemic peaks. Growth in China has been particularly strong, helped by a locally led product strategy that the company adopted to arrest previous market share losses.

Faber's comments on AI devices come as other large firms explore their own hardware concepts. OpenAI's acquisition of a startup co-founded by Jony Ive has fuelled speculation about a consumer device built around generative models. Whether that will avoid the pitfalls that dogged earlier launches is unclear, but Faber's assessment underlines how difficult it is to create demand for a standalone assistant when multifunction devices continue to carry out the same capabilities.

George Foote still has vivid memories of the day operatives from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency arrived at the headquarters of the United States Institute of Peace. The outside general counsel for USIP, he's been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED's Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco.

The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn't sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.”

The Trump administration's interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings, tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn't have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters.

Still, this week Trump's name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump's right to remove them from office.

Foote was one of several people on a panel, hosted by WIRED senior writer Vittoria Elliott, on the fallout from the move-fast-break-things ethos of DOGE. Foote was joined by former Social Security Administration commissioner Leland Dudek, and former DOGE engineer Sahil Lavingia, who announced during the panel that he's back in government at the Internal Revenue Service.

As WIRED reported on Tuesday, many of the young technologists DOGE sent to various US agencies are still working with federal government entities. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, Akash Bobba, Ethan Shaotran, Marko Elez, and Gavin Kliger all still seem affiliated with DOGE or the US government. DOGE has “just transformed,” one IRS employee told WIRED.

As the effects of DOGE ripple out, Foote noted, it's important for people to keep an eye on what's happening. He's confident the USIP directors will win in court, even if the process is long. “The rule of law doesn't matter if the people don't stand up to defend it,” he said.

Does everyone in Seattle hate AI?

That's one of the surprising questions to arise this week in response to a viral blog post penned by Jonathon Ready, a former Microsoft engineer who recently left the tech giant to pursue his own startup. 

In the post, Ready describes showing off his AI-powered mapping project, Wanderfugl, to engineers around the world. Everywhere from Tokyo to San Francisco, people are curious. In Seattle, “instant hostility the moment they heard ‘AI,'” he said. 

“Bring up AI in a Seattle coffee shop now and people react like you're advocating asbestos,” he wrote.

The culprit, Ready argues, is the Big Tech AI experience — specifically, Microsoft's. Based on conversations with former colleagues and his own time at the company, he describes a workplace where AI became the only career-safe territory amid widespread layoffs, and everyone was forced to use Copilot tools that were often worse than doing the work manually.

The result, Ready says, is a kind of learned helplessness: smart people coming to believe that AI is both pointless and beyond their reach.

His post drew hundreds of comments on Hacker News and other responses on LinkedIn. Some felt he hit the nail on the head. Trey Causey, former head of AI ethics at Indeed, said he could relate, recalling that he would avoid volunteering the “AI” part of his job title in conversations with Seattle locals. He speculated the city might be the epicenter of anti-AI sentiment among major U.S. tech hubs.

But others said the piece paints with too broad a brush. Seattle tech vet Marcelo Calbucci argues the divide isn't geographic but cultural — between burned-out Big Tech employees and energized founders. He pointed to layoffs that doubled workloads even as AI demand increased, creating stress levels beyond simple burnout.

“If you hang out with founders and investors in Seattle, the energy is completely different,” Calbucci wrote.

Seattle venture capitalist Chris DeVore was more dismissive, calling Ready's post “clickbait-y” and criticizing what he saw as a conflation of the experiences of Big Tech individual contributors with Seattle's startup ecosystem.

That dovetails with GeekWire's recent story about “a tale of two Seattles in the age of AI”: a corporate city shell-shocked by massive job cuts, and a startup city brimming with excitement about new tools.

Ryan Brush, a director at Salesforce, put forth an intriguing theory: that any anti-AI sentiment in Seattle can be traced to the city's “undercurrent of anti-authority thinking that goes way back,” from grunge music to the WTO protests. 

“Seattle has a long memory for being skeptical of systems that centralize power and extract from individuals,” Brush commented. “And a lot of what we see with AI today (the scale of data collection, how concentrated it is in a few big companies) might land differently here than it does elsewhere.”

Ready ends his post by concluding that Seattle still has world-class talent — but unlike San Francisco, it has lost the conviction that it can change the world.

In our story earlier this year — Can Seattle own the AI era? — we asked investors and founders to weigh the city's startup ecosystem potential. Many community leaders shared optimism, in part due to the density of engineering talent that's crucial to building AI-native companies.

But, as we later reported, Seattle lacks superstar AI startups that are easy to find in the Bay Area — despite being home to hyperscalers such as Microsoft and Amazon, as well as world-class research institutions (University of Washington; Allen Institute for AI) and substantial Silicon Valley outposts. 

Is it because Seattle “hates AI”? That seems like a bit of a stretch. But this week's discussion is certainly another reminder of the evolving interplay between Seattle's tech corporations, talent, and startup activity in the AI era.

A United States Inspector General report publicly released today found that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth could have put US troops and military operations at risk by using the consumer messaging service Signal to share sensitive, real-time details in March about a planned attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen. The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday.

The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command's classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.”

The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate, because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security.

The IG report notes that Hegseth is the “head original classification authority in the DOD” and therefore decides what information needs to be classified and whether to declassify information.

“We concluded that the Secretary sent sensitive, nonpublic, operational information that he determined did not require classification over the Signal chat on his personal cell phone,” the IG wrote in the report. "However, because the Secretary indicated that he used the Signal application on his personal cell phone to send nonpublic DOD information, we concluded that the Secretary's actions did not comply with DOD Instruction 8170.01, which prohibits using a personal device for official business and using a nonapproved commercially available messaging application to send nonpublic DOD information.”

The report states that Hegseth “declined to be interviewed” for the inspector general's report and instead submitted a written statement about the Signalgate events.

In response to WIRED's request for comment, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said: "This Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along—no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”

Signal is the gold standard secure messaging app for consumer use. It end-to-end encrypts messages and calls so only the sender and recipients can access them—not outside eavesdroppers or even Signal itself. And Signal also collects very minimal metadata, so the company knows almost nothing about its users and has nothing to turn over if it receives law enforcement requests. No matter how excellent Signal is, though, the “threat model” and use case of individual consumers is very different than that of high-ranking government and military officials.

UCLA scientists have characterized the structure and function of a key survival protein in breast cancer cells that helps explain how these tumors resist environmental stress and thrive in acidic, low-oxygen environments that would normally be toxic to healthy cells.

Breast cancer cells rely on a transporter protein called NBCn1 to bring alkali ions into the cell and maintain a favorable internal pH. Using advanced cryo-electron microscopy combined with computational modeling, the researchers showed that NBCn1 moves two sodium ions and one carbonate ion through an efficient "elevator-like" motion that minimizes energy use. This allows NBCn1 to achieve a high transport rate of approximately 15,000 ions per second, helping tumor cells maintain an internal pH that promotes survival, division and resistance to acidic stress. 

Tumor microenvironments are often acidic due to low oxygen levels and high metabolic activity. Healthy cells struggle to survive under these conditions, but cancer cells adapt by regulating their internal chemistry. NBCn1 is a plasma membrane transporter known to help control cellular pH, but until now, little was understood about its precise structure or how it achieves such efficient ion transport.

To understand how this protein works, the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to capture the first atomic, three-dimensional structure of human NBCn1. They then applied computational modeling to study the protein's dynamics and how it interacts with ions. This combined approach allowed the team to visualize NBCn1's structural changes and identify the pathways ions take as they pass through the transporter.

By understanding the structure and function of NBCn1, the study provides a blueprint for designing drugs that could potentially block this transporter and disrupt the internal chemical balance that cancer cells depend on. Targeting this protein in cancer cells specifically could offer a precise way to weaken tumors while minimizing harm to normal tissue.

This work advances the field of cancer cell metabolism and membrane transport biology by providing the first atomic-level model of NBCn1, a major regulator of cellular pH. By linking the protein's structure, ion energetics, and function, the study shows how small molecular motions can generate high transport efficiency. These insights bridge a critical knowledge gap between basic biophysics and cancer therapeutics and lay the groundwork for new strategies that target pH regulation as a vulnerability in tumor cells."

In a study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, new research from Johns Hopkins Medicine adds to existing evidence that smoking fewer cigarettes does not eliminate cardiovascular disease risk, and quitting entirely is the most effective strategy for improving health.

Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease, death and disability in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 16 million Americans are living with a smoking-related disease, making cigarette smoking a major public health concern.

In an effort to further address this issue, researchers sought to demonstrate the relationships among smoking burden, intensity and cessation duration across multiple heart and vascular-related health conditions. These findings, published Nov. 18 in the journal PLOS Medicine, add important evidence underscoring the urgent need to encourage early smoking cessation.

Previous research established that cigarette smoking increases cardiovascular disease risk, but the exact relationship between smoking intensity and health outcomes remained unclear, especially for light-intensity smoking." 

Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research, Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and study's corresponding author

Researchers used baseline variables from a standardized data set developed by the Cross-Cohort Collaboration-Tobacco Working Group, which combined data from 22 cohort studies involving 323,826 adults, following participants for up to 19.9 years and documenting more than 125,000 deaths and 54,000 cardiovascular events. Researchers then applied Cox proportional hazard models to assess associations among overall smoking history, cigarettes per day and years since cessation in relation to cardiovascular outcomes.

Of the more than 323,000 adults, with an average age of about 60, most participants were women (76%). Among them, 14% were current cigarette smokers, 36% had never smoked and 49% were former smokers of conventional cigarettes.

A multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity and education status. A second multivariable model was adjusted for nine harmonized covariates, including body mass index, diabetes, history of coronary heart disease at baseline and any alcohol use. The reference group for all analyses was individuals who had never smoked.

The results of this study present one of the largest and most detailed analyses to date of the effects of different smoking measures on cardiovascular, cause-specific and all-cause mortality outcomes. "This study shows that even low levels of smoking - for example, only a few cigarettes a day - carry substantial cardiovascular risks," says Blaha. Quitting completely - not just cutting back - provides the greatest health benefit."

Additionally, these research findings provide specific estimates showing how much risk former and current smokers face, especially those who smoke only a few cigarettes per day, with the use of three factors - how long someone has smoked, how many cigarettes they smoke per day and how long it has been since they quit - each related to the risk of heart disease and death.

"Our findings illustrate the complex relationship between how much someone has smoked over time and how long it has been since they quit," says Blaha. "These results, which highlight the strong predictive value of longer time since quitting, reinforce the critical need to educate the public and promote early smoking cessation as one of the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of this deadly disease."

The study was led by Erfan Tasdighi, M.D., who conducted the research while at Johns Hopkins Medicine and is now a resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.

Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Real progress in oral health doesn't come from expensive gadgets, but from better daily habits. That is the conclusion of dentist- periodontist Tim Thomassen in his dissertation Oral Disease Prevention, which he will defend on 12 December at the University of Amsterdam. In his research, he examines how effective different types of toothbrushes are and how much impact the actual time people spend brushing has on oral health.

Worldwide close to 3,5 billion people suffer from oral diseases, such as cavities and gum diseases. Dental plaque often plays a major role in these problems - which is why good brushing is the standard advice. But what does 'good' actually mean?Thomassen investigated various aspects of preventing tooth and gum diseases, including the effectiveness of toothbrushes, brushing duration, and oral hygiene instructions. He reviewed dozens of international clinical studies, combined them in systematic reviews, and conducted several experiments of his own.

Expensive technology plays a much smaller role in preventing cavities and gum diseases than many people think. Because the differences between products are often minimal in practice, it is people themselves who ultimately make the biggest difference."

Tim Thomassen, dentist- periodontist

An oscillating-rotating toothbrush, a high-frequency sonic toothbrush, or just a manual one? The price differences are significant, but does that also apply to how well they clean our teeth?'For removing dental plaque, a powered toothbrush performs better than a manual one,' says Thomassen. 'But the difference between the two main powered types is negligible in everyday use.' According to Thomassen, manufacturers would be better off investing in user education and affordable, sustainable designs rather than launching yet another - and often even more expensive - model.

The global recommendation is clear: brush twice a day for two minutes to effectively remove dental plaque. Thomassen's research confirms that two minutes of brushing removes more plaque than one minute. He then examined whether brushing for three minutes works even better. It doesn't - the added benefit is minimal.

People who use a manual toothbrush, still the majority worldwide, brush for less time: on average just under 1.5 minutes. 'We know brushing works, and fortunately the average brushing time has been increasing in recent years, but many people still don't brush long enough,' Thomassen says.Users of powered toothbrushes do reach the two-minute mark more often, and even exceed it, brushing for almost 2.5 minutes on average. 'Built-in timers may help people brush longer,' he notes.

Finally, Thomassen analzed the brushing advice provided by dental organizations around the world. Only one-third offer clear instructions online. 'That needs to improve,' he says. 'Good oral care starts with accessible, understandable, and practical information that people can apply immediately.'He therefore advocates for practical guidelines tailored to people's lifestyles, abilities, and budgets so that good oral care becomes achievable for everyone. 'There is a clear need for a national oral-care guideline that is evidence-based and adapted to different needs and preferences. Such a guideline would help bridge the gap between research and everyday practice, supporting both patients and oral-health professionals.'Thomassen hopes that his research can contribute to this goal. Preparations for such a guideline are already underway - the next challenge he is committed to taking on.

Ripple Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company developing polymer-free sustained release drug delivery systems, has entered into an evaluation and licensing option agreement with an affiliate of Bausch + Lomb.

Ripple's proprietary technology platform is based on the discovery that drugs can be chemically engineered into controlled-release prodrugs without relying on polymers, a component often associated with inflammation. These prodrugs utilize a surface erosion mechanism, enabling zero-order release kinetics, and can be precisely engineered to control both drug dose and duration.

As part of the agreement, Bausch + Lomb will fund early-stage feasibility and preclinical evaluation of a selected target molecule. The company also holds an option to license any of the formulations evaluated under this collaboration. Licensing would be subject to additional financial terms, including milestone payments and royalties.

This collaboration aims to advance sustained-release ophthalmic therapies that may offer improved safety profiles and extended treatment duration.

That said, with the challenge in ocular disease remains in the delivery method itself, the collaboration sheds light on the importance of the 4th Ophthalmic Drug Delivery Summit, where 80+ leading ocular experts including Re-Vana, J&J, Genentech, Merck, BI, 4DMT, Abbvie and more will be gathering to connect and discuss in tackling the toughest delivery hurdles limiting the impact of cutting-edge therapeutics.

Wendy Neimark, Co-Founder and CTO from Ripple Therapeutics, will be speaking at the Panel Session on “Unlocking Biotech-Pharma Collaboration: How Agile Small Teams & Experienced Pharma Combine Strengths to Accelerate Innovation & Deliver Real-World Impact”, focusing on strategies to leverage the speed and innovation of biotech startups alongside deep experience and resources of pharma giant AbbVie and more.

Find out more about Ripple's session and about the meeting happening this coming January 27-29, San Francisco, CA.

A new USC study shows teens with higher blood levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) measured before bariatric surgery had smaller improvements in blood sugar over five years, including fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which measures average blood sugar levels over the past 60-90 days. Blood sugar is a key marker of the surgery's success-and the differences were large enough that the metabolic benefits of the surgery could fade within a decade. The results, published in the journal Environmental Endocrinology, suggest that PFAS exposure may help explain why metabolic outcomes differ among patients.

PFAS are a class of industrial chemicals used in consumer products that accumulate in the body over time. They have been detected in the blood of nearly all U.S. adults and have been linked to a number of health problems, including kidney and liver problems and several types of cancer. A growing body of evidence now suggests that PFAS could also play a role in metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes.

The study was led by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC's Southern California Superfund Research and Training Program for PFAS Assessment, Remediation and Prevention (ShARP) Center, which is funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to identify the health effects of hazardous chemicals and use those insights to drive prevention and policy.

Recent findings from the USC team showed that teens with higher blood levels of PFAS also tend to regain more weight after bariatric surgery. Broadly, the team is studying what factors influence why some patients do better than others. Their research could help guide a more targeted approach to treatment, taking into account how environmental toxins like PFAS may affect patient outcomes. For example, screening for PFAS before surgery could identify patients who need extra monitoring or additional interventions to keep their blood sugar healthy over time.

Our findings show that it's important for environmental epidemiologists and physicians to collaborate. Targeted precision medicine based on our growing knowledge of PFAS and environmental health may help ensure patients have the greatest success with this weight loss intervention."

Brittney Baumert, PhD, MPH, postdoctoral research fellow in population and public health sciences, Keck School of Medicine and study's joint first author

Patient data for the study came from the Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS), which tracks outcomes among adolescents who have undergone the weight loss procedure. In 186 teens, aged 19 or younger, the researchers measured levels of eight types of PFAS before patients had surgery.

After surgery, the researchers tracked each patient's metabolic health at six months, 12 months, 36 months and five years. To measure short- and long-term blood sugar levels, they collected data on fasting glucose and HbA1c. They also measured insulin and estimated insulin resistance, or how hard the body has to work to keep blood sugar under control.

Overall, most Teen-LABS patients had significant improvements in metabolic health after surgery. But teens with higher exposure to all eight PFAS together showed a smaller improvement in long-term blood sugar, with their HbA1c rising, on average, 0.27 percentage points three years after surgery. (For context, a normal HbA1c is under 5.7%, so this increase is considerable.)

One PFAS in particular, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), had an outsized impact. Teens with higher PFHxS exposure before surgery had average annual increases of 0.15 percentage points in HbA1c, a rate that could move someone from normal blood sugar to prediabetes-or from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes-within a few years.

PFHxS was also linked to rising fasting glucose, about one milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) per year. At that rate, a patient who initially improved by 10 mg/dL after surgery could see those gains reversed within a decade. Researchers did not observe a clear association between pre-surgery PFAS levels and post-surgery insulin levels and say more research is needed on that link.

The Teen-LABS study allowed researchers to explore metabolic outcomes related to diabetes, even though diabetes was not its primary focus. Future research could build on these findings by including gold-standard diabetes tests, detailed dietary data and larger patient populations, the researchers said.

"This is another step toward understanding the relationship between PFAS and type 2 diabetes, including differences between types of PFAS and the role of patient age, sex and lifestyle. But many questions remain unanswered," said joint first author Elizabeth Costello, PhD, a research scientist at the Brown University School of Public Health who was a postdoctoral researcher at the Keck School of Medicine when the study was done.

Baumert is now leading a follow-up study to investigate biological mechanisms that may explain why some patients have better outcomes after bariatric surgery. She will use metabolomics and proteomics, which measure small molecules and proteins in the body, to understand how PFAS exposure might influence metabolism and recovery.

This study adds to growing evidence that PFAS can interfere with the body's ability to regulate glucose, even after substantial weight loss, said last author Vaia Lida Chatzi, MD, PhD, professor of population and public health sciences and pediatrics and director of the ShARP Center at the Keck School of Medicine. The findings underscore that metabolic recovery is shaped not only by clinical treatment but also by environmental factors. The ShARP Center aims to uncover these hidden barriers and generate solutions that protect metabolic health during the critical period of adolescence.

Researchers at Helmholtz Munich, the Technical University of Munich and the LMU University Hospital Munich uncovered a mechanism that protects nerve cells from premature cell death, known as ferroptosis. The study provides the first molecular evidence that ferroptosis can drive neurodegeneration in the human brain. These findings open up new avenues for developing future therapies – particularly for severe early-onset childhood dementia.

Why do neurons die in dementia – and can this process be slowed down? An international team led by Prof. Marcus Conrad, Director of the Institute of Metabolism and Cell Death at Helmholtz Munich and Chair of Translational Redox Biology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), now describes in Cell how neurons protect themselves against ferroptotic cell death.

Central to this defense mechanism is the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). A single mutation in the gene that encodes GPX4 can disrupt a crucial, previously unknown component of the enzyme's function. In affected children, this leads to severe early-onset dementia. When fully functional, GPX4 inserts a short protein loop – a kind of "fin" – into the inner side of the neuronal cell membrane, enabling the enzyme to neutralize harmful substances known as lipid peroxides.

GPX4 is a bit like a surfboard. With its fin immersed into the cell membrane, it rides along the inner surface and swiftly detoxifies lipid peroxides as it goes."

Prof. Marcus Conrad, Director of the Institute of Metabolism and Cell Death, Helmholtz Munich

A single point mutation found in children with early-onset dementia alters this fin-like protein loop: the enzyme can no longer insert into the membrane properly to perform its cell-protective function. Lipid peroxides are then free to damage the membrane, triggering ferroptosis and cell rupture, and the neurons die.

The study started with three children in the United States who suffer from an extremely rare form of early childhood dementia. All three carry the same change in the GPX4 gene, known as the R152H mutation. Using cell samples from an affected child, the researchers were able to study the effects of the mutation in more detail and reprogrammed the cells back into a stem-cell-like state. From these reprogrammed stem cells, they then generated cortical neurons and three-dimensional tissue structures resembling early brain tissue – so-called brain organoids.

To understand what happens at the whole-organism level, the team then introduced the R152H mutation into a mouse model, thereby specifically altering the GPX4 enzyme in different types of nerve cells. As a result of the impaired GPX4 function, the animals gradually developed severe motoric deficits, with dying neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and pronounced neuroinflammatory responses in the brain – a pattern that closely mirrors the observations in the affected children and strongly resembles neurodegenerative disease profiles.

In parallel, the researchers analyzed which proteins change in abundance in the experimental model. They observed a pattern strikingly similar to that seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease: numerous proteins that are increased or decreased in Alzheimer's were likewise dysregulated in mice lacking functional GPX4. This suggests that ferroptotic stress may play a role not only in this rare early-onset disorder, but potentially also in more common forms of dementia.

"Our data indicate that ferroptosis can be a driving force behind neuronal death – not just a side effect," says Dr. Svenja Lorenz, one of the first authors of the study. "Until now, dementia research has often focused on protein deposits in the brain, so-called amyloid ß plaques. We are now putting more emphasis on the damage to cell membranes that sets this degeneration in motion in the first place."

Initial experiments also show that cell death triggered by loss of GPX4 can be slowed in cell cultures and in the mouse model using compounds that specifically inhibit ferroptosis. "This is an important proof of principle, but it is not yet a therapy," says Dr. Tobias Seibt, nephrologist at LMU University Hospital Munich and co-first author. Dr. Adam Wahida, also a first author of the study, adds: "In the long term, we can imagine genetic or molecular strategies to stabilize this protective system. For now, however, our work clearly remains in the realm of basic research."

The study is the result of a research network that has grown over many years bringing together genetics, structural biology, stem cell research, and neuroscience, with several dozen scientists at multiple sites worldwide. "It has taken us almost 14 years to link a yet-unrecognized small structural element of a single enzyme to a severe human disease," says Marcus Conrad. "Projects like this vividly demonstrate why we need long-term funding for basic research and international multidisciplinary teams if we are to truly understand complex diseases such as dementia and other neurodegenerative disease conditions."

Researchers at Mass General Brigham have modified a herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) that stimulates the immune system to attack glioblastoma cells. A single dose of the modified virus increased T-cell, natural killer cell, and myeloid cell responses in the tumor microenvironment and increased the overall survival in preclinical models. Results are published in Nature Cancer.

Glioblastoma is among the most aggressive and treatment-resistant brain tumors. Previous attempts to stimulate the immune system to attack tumor cells in the brain have shown limited benefit, in part because glioblastoma cells release multiple molecules that dampen immune responses.

To overcome the barriers, researchers modified an HSV-1 virus to recognize markers found only on glioblastoma cells. They engineered the virus to express five different immunomodulatory molecules to help reprogram the tumor environment, including IL-12, anti-PD1, a bispecific T cell engager, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and anti-TREM2. Researchers also added safety mutations, or "off-switches," that prevent the virus from spreading to neurons or healthy central nervous system cells. So that the reach of the virus could be visualized on PET scan, the team inserted a gene that expresses a protein capable of trapping a PET-tracer molecule.

Mice treated with the virus showed increased infiltration of tumor-fighting T cells, as well as reduced T-cell exhaustion markers. Mice injected with the virus also lived longer than glioblastoma-harboring mice not injected with the virus.

We engineered a safe and traceable oncolytic virus with strong cytotoxic and immunostimulatory activities for glioblastoma immunotherapy. This platform offers a multipronged approach-precise tumor targeting, local delivery of immunotherapeutic payloads, and a built-in safety system to protect normal brain cells."

Francisco J. Quintana, PhD, Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology and senior author

Future research will focus on evaluating the safety and efficacy of the oncolytic virus in human trials as well as adapting the viral platform to remodel the tumor microenvironment in other cancers.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of nearly 10,000 long-lasting chemical compounds that stay in the environment and have been linked to adverse health effects on humans, including pregnant women and their unborn children. Although the placenta plays an important role as a protective barrier for the fetus, previous studies have not adequately assessed the true extent of foetal exposure to PFAS during early pregnancy. Researchers at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ), in cooperation with the Dessau Municipal Hospital, have now further developed a 3D placenta model so that it can be used to better analyse the risks of PFAS exposure during pregnancy. Their findings, which have been published in Environmental Research, show that PFAS disrupt the functioning of the placenta – especially in the early phase of pregnancy, which is critical for the baby's development.

The placenta regulates the exchange of nutrients, gases, and metabolic products between a pregnant woman and the fetus, thereby ensuring healthy development. The first 90 days of pregnancy are particularly important, because the baby's organs begin to develop during this sensitive period. Although the placenta has barrier mechanisms designed to prevent the passage of dangerous substances into the baby, PFAS can accumulate in the body, interfere with foetal development, and, in severe cases, increase the risk of miscarriage. "For an accurate risk assessment, it is important to document PFAS exposure more precisely, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy", says UFZ reproductive scientist Dr Violeta Stojanovska, author and principal investigator. So far, little is known about this because most reproductive studies rely on PFAS detection in the blood or the placenta obtained in the final months of pregnancy or on experiments performed in simplified cellular models that use individual PFAS compounds rather than mixtures.

In their study, conducted together with the Dessau Municipal Hospital, an academic hospital of the Brandenburg Medical School, the UFZ researchers chose a different approach and extracted six PFAS compounds (perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid and perfluorodecanoic acid) from first trimester placental tissue of 31 women. "These PFAS were relevant for our investigations because we detected them in high concentrations in placenta and there was literature indication that they might trigger pregnancy complications", says doctoral candidate and lead author of the study Yu Xia. These six compounds were then used to obtain a placenta-relevant PFAS mixture that later was tested in a 3D trophoblast model to simulate placental exposure.

Trophoblasts are placental cells that invade maternal tissue early in pregnancy and establish contact with the mother's bloodstream. "The main advantage of the 3D models is that trophoblast cells grow in a spherical structure, which closely mimics the cell organisation seen in early placental development, unlike the flat arrangement in 2D cultures", says Stojanovska. With these 3D models the research team was able to investigate various placental functions, including hormone production and invasiveness.

Exposing the 3D trophoblast models to the PFAS mixture interfered with the optimal placenta function. The placental cells showed disrupted ability to invade. This invasiveness is crucial for optimal foetal growth by facilitating nutrient transfer from the mother.

Gene expression analysis revealed that apoptosis (programmed cell death) and proliferation (the cell growth needed for placental development), processes important for the development of the placenta, are also impaired by PFAS. "The two processes are kept in natural balance during the development of the placenta. However, this balance is disturbed when the placenta is exposed to high PFAS concentrations", says Stojanovska.

The research team also found that PFAS exposure reduces β-hCG production, which is the first hormone produced by the placenta and a key regulator of pregnancy: it stimulates progesterone production, which creates healthy uterine lining, and helps prevent fetus rejection. Reduced production of β-hCG could therefore indicate hormone regulation disorders. "These minor changes haven't received much attention so far, but taken collectively might cause significant impact on pregnancy progression", says Stojanovska.

The study emphasizes the harmful effects of the PFAS mixture on trophoblast function and thus the potential risks to placental health and the outcome of the pregnancy."

 3D trophoblast models are extremely helpful because they provide a more comprehensive understanding of PFAS risk assessment.

When someone walks into an emergency room with symptoms of a stroke, every second matters. But today, diagnosing the type of stroke, the life-or-death distinction between a clot and a bleed, requires large, stationary machines like CT scanners that may not be available everywhere. In ambulances, rural clinics, and many hospitals worldwide, doctors often have no way to make this determination in time.

For years, scientists have imagined a different world, one in which a lightweight microwave imaging device, no bigger than a bike helmet, could allow clinicians to look inside the head without radiation, without a shielded room, and without waiting. That idea isn't far-fetched. Microwave imaging technology already exists and can detect changes in the electrical properties of tissues - changes that happen when stroke, swelling, or tumors disrupt the brain's normal structure.

The real obstacle has always been speed.

The hardware can be portable. But the computations needed to turn the raw microwave data into an actual image have been far too slow. You can't wait up to an hour to know if someone is having a hemorrhagic stroke."

Stephen Kim, Research Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, NYU Tandon

Kim, along with BME Ph.D. student Lara Pinar and Department Chair Andreas Hielscher, believes that barrier may now be disappearing. In a new study published in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, the team describes an innovative algorithm that reconstructs microwave images 10 to 30 times faster than the best existing methods, a leap that could bring real-time microwave imaging from theory into practice. 

It's a breakthrough that didn't come from building new devices or designing faster hardware, but from rethinking the mathematics behind the imaging itself. Kim recalls spending long nights in the lab watching microwave reconstructions crawl along frame by frame. "You could almost hear the computer groan," he said. "It was like trying to push a boulder uphill. We knew there had to be a better way."

At the heart of the problem is how traditional algorithms work. They repeatedly try to "guess" the electrical properties of the tissue, check whether that guess explains the measured microwave signals, and adjust the guess again. This is a tedious process that can require solving large electromagnetic equations hundreds of times.

The team's new method takes a different path. Instead of demanding a perfectly accurate intermediate solution at every iteration, their algorithm allows quick, imperfect approximations early on and tightens the accuracy only as needed. This shift, which is simple in concept, but powerful in practice, dramatically reduces the number of heavy computations.

To make the process even more efficient, the team incorporated several clever tricks: using a compact mathematical representation to shrink the size of the problem, streamlining how updates are computed, and using a modeling approach that remains stable even for complex head shapes.

The results are striking. Reconstructions that once took nearly an hour now appear in under 40 seconds. In tests with real experimental data, including cylindrical targets imaged using a microwave scanner from the University of Manitoba, the method consistently delivered high-quality results in seconds instead of minutes. 

For Kim and Hielscher, who have worked collaboratively for decades on optical and microwave imaging techniques, the speed improvement feels like a long-awaited turning point. "We always knew microwave imaging had the potential to be portable and affordable. But without rapid reconstruction, the technology couldn't make the leap into real clinical settings," Hielscher said. "Now we're finally closing that gap."

The promise extends far beyond stroke detection. Portable microwave devices could one day provide an accessible alternative to mammography in low-resource settings, monitor brain swelling in intensive care units without repeated CT scans, or track tumor responses to therapy by observing subtle changes in tissue composition.

The team is now focused on extending the algorithm to full 3D imaging, a step that would bring microwave tomography even closer to practical deployment. But the momentum is palpable. "We're taking a technology that has been stuck in the lab for years and giving it the speed it needs to matter clinically," Kim said. "That's the part that excites us: imagining how many patients someday might benefit from this."

For breastfeeding women who have HIV, consistently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for their own health and the health of their infants. New long-acting (LA) injectable ART options, such as LA cabotegravir with rilpivirine (CAB/RPV), can help women suppress the HIV virus within their bodies - keeping them healthy and reducing transmission to their infants. Instead of daily oral pills, the injection is received every two months, making it easier for women to sustain treatment during the postpartum period and keep their medical diagnoses private.

Our study focused on Zimbabwe, a country with high maternal HIV prevalence where LA-CAB/RPV is not yet available outside of research settings. We used microsimulation modeling to evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of offering this potentially game-changing therapy to postpartum women.

Q: What questions were you investigating?

There were two main questions we set out to answer:

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) model to simulate how HIV is passed on and how it progresses. This framework enabled us to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes for a hypothetical group of women and their babies undergoing different treatment strategies - in this case, LA-CAB/RPV versus daily oral ART. 

Q: What did you find?

Compared to oral ART, LA-CAB/RPV could prevent up to 160 infant infections per year in Zimbabwe. For women whose HIV has not been fully suppressed by their daily pills at the time of delivery, switching to LA-CAB/RPV could be cost-saving if priced at $156/year or lower. For women whose HIV has already been suppressed at the time of delivery, but who face challenges in adhering to oral ART, switching to LA-CAB/RPV would offer slightly less value, but could be cost-effective if priced at $84/year or lower.

Q: What are the implications?

Long-acting ART formulations hold tremendous promise - especially for people living with HIV who struggle with daily oral regimens, and therefore with viral suppression. We propose that these formulations should be made available globally at an affordable price to ensure they reach the people who may benefit from them most. 

Q: What are the next steps?

Looking ahead, we'll build on this important work by evaluating the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of newer long-acting ART formulations, such as long-acting cabotegravir with lenacapavir, among pregnant and breastfeeding women.

Women who report high levels of psychosocial stress, such as from caregiving and lack of emotional support, show signs of early heart tissue changes associated with cardiovascular disease – an association not observed in men, a new study reveals.

The results support the notion that there are sex-specific ways in which stress affects cardiovascular health and that risk-assessment processes should take psychosocial factors and mental wellness into account, the researchers said.

From an epidemiological point of view, we have known for about two decades that stress is an important risk factor in cardiovascular health for people born female. But with this research stream, we're really aiming to understand how stress physiologically impacts the heart."

Dr. Judy Luu, Assistant Professor, Division of Clinical and Translational Research, McGill Faculty of Medicine and principal investigator of the study

The team, comprising researchers from McGill and Concordia universities, published a paper earlier this year linking early signs of heart inflammation and perceived social status in women.

In the current study, the researchers examined MRI heart scans of 219 adult participants (ages 43 to 65), around half of whom were female. The scans measured two markers (called T1 and T2) in the heart muscles, which are linked to signs of cardiac disease. In addition to demographic and basic physiological data, they also collected information such as perceived stress, responsibility for caregiving within the household and perceived emotional support.

The participants, who were part of the Courtois Cardiovascular Signature Program at McGill University Health Centre, were divided in two groups: individuals presenting at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (for example, diabetes, hypertension or smoking) but without actual heart disease, and healthy control subjects.

In both groups, the scans of female participants who reported high psychosocial stress revealed significantly higher values for one of the markers (T1) than did the scans of low-stress female participants. A significant difference in female participants was also observed for the second marker (T2), in the at-risk group only. In both cases, no significant difference was observed between high- and low-stress male participants.

Though the T1 and T2 values didn't quite pass the clinical thresholds for abnormal values, said Luu, they were still at an elevated level that calls for further investigation. She added that down the road, higher values portend worse prognosis.

According to the professor, the sex differences observed are not only a social question, but also a biological question.

"Research points to the fact that there are biological differences in the way females physically handle stress," said Luu.

The next phase of the research will focus on blood markers and other biological explanations, such as hormones, she said, adding that the team hopes the research can lead to better interventions to advance women's heart health.

A new multi-site study led by researchers at CU Anschutz shows that people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who start the triple-drug therapy elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) can safely reduce many of their daily lung treatments while maintaining good health for years.

The study was published today in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis.

This is incredibly meaningful for individuals and families living with CF. For decades people with CF have spent hours every day managing their disease. Our findings show that many have stepped back from some of those time-consuming therapies thanks to ETI."

Scott Sagel, MD, PhD, lead author, professor of pediatrics-pulmonary medicine at the CU Anschutz School of Medicine and director of the University of Colorado Cystic Fibrosis Center

ETI helps the malfunctioning protein that causes CF work more effectively, allowing the lungs to function better from the inside rather than simply treating symptoms like thick mucus or frequent infections. As more people with CF are being treated with ETI, researchers have been eager to understand whether long-standing respiratory therapies such as inhaled antibiotics and mucus-thinning treatments are still being used at the same level.

To explore this question, the team followed more than 600 children and adults after they began ETI. Children ages 6 to 11 were tracked for up to three years. Adolescents and adults were followed up to four and a half years. Across all age groups, use of chronic respiratory therapies including hypertonic saline, dornase alfa, inhaled antibiotics and oral azithromycin fell steadily over time. Teens and adults cut their use of these treatments by nearly half and younger children showed similar trends.

A key finding was that stopping multiple daily therapies did not appear to lead to loss of lung function or more respiratory symptoms. This was true across age, sex, and baseline lung function. Those who discontinued therapies tended to have higher lung function at the start of ETI and were less likely to be infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common CF-related lung infection. Because the study did not capture individuals' reasons for stopping therapies, Sagel stresses the importance of discussing any changes with a CF clinician.

"For many families, the daily time commitment required for CF care can be overwhelming," Sagel said. "Seeing people maintain good health while doing fewer respiratory therapies is incredibly encouraging. A reduction in treatment burden can have a profound impact on quality of life."

Sagel emphasized the need for personalized care in those on long-term ETI therapy.

"The opportunity to simplify daily treatment is exciting but decisions to stop or continue therapies should be made through shared decision-making with a clinician who understands each person's overall health," said Sagel.

Next, researchers will investigate whether some therapies may still be useful when used only during respiratory illnesses and whether mechanical forms of airway clearance remain necessary for people who no longer depend on inhaled mucus-thinning medications.

"The goal is to help people with CF and their care teams maintain strong long-term health while easing daily treatment demands," said Sagel.

The study was part of PROMISE, one of the largest long-term projects examining how this therapy works in everyday care at CF centers across the United States.

Additional authors from the following institutions were involved in the study: Seattle Children's Research Institute, the University of Washington, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Washington University in St. Louis, and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto.

A study from the University of East Anglia is helping scientists better understand how our brains remember past events - and how those memories can change over time.A new paper published today explores episodic memory - the kind of memory we use to recall personal experiences like a birthday party or a holiday.The team say their work has important implications for mental health, education, and legal settings where memory plays a key role.Working collaboratively with the University of Texas in Dallas, the team show that memories aren't just stored like files in a computer.Instead, they're made up of different parts. And while some are active and easy to recall, others stay hidden until something triggers them.Importantly, the review shows that for something to count as a real memory, it must be linked to a real event from the past.

But even then, the memory we recall might not be a perfect copy.It can include extra details from our general knowledge, past experiences, or even the situation we're in when we remember it.Memories of older events often go through a process called re-encoding, which means the brain updates or reshapes the memory over time. This creates a chain of connections from the original experience to the version of the memory we can access now.This work helps us understand why our memories aren't always reliable and how they can be influenced by time, context, and even our own imaginations."

Prof. Louis Renoult, lead researcher from UEA's School of Psychology

The team looked at almost 200 psychology and neuroscience studies about memory representations, as well philosophical papers and recent studies using animal models.Prof Renoult said: "We wanted to suggest a new way of looking at things by combining ideas from different fields. The goal was to make sense of problems that haven't been solved yet and spark fresh research."A key part of the study focused on how the brain physically stores memories, highlighting the role of the hippocampus - a part of the brain that helps form and organise memories.The research explains how memory traces in the brain can lie dormant and only become conscious representations when something - typically a cue from the environment - activates that memory trace."These conscious representations of our past are typically a combination of retrieved information of the original experience, generic knowledge about the world and information relevant for the current situation," explained Prof Renoult."While memories need to have a causal link to past events to count as memories, they may differ each time they are retrieved."This means that memories can and do change. They might become less accurate or include new information, making them feel different from the original event.A crucial part of our daily lives"Understanding how memories are formed, stored, and reshaped over time is crucial because memory underpins so much of our daily lives - from learning and mental health to decisions made in courtrooms."By revealing that memories are dynamic rather than fixed, this research helps us better understand why they can change and how that impacts the way we think, feel, and act," he added.'The cognitive neuroscience of memory representations' is published in the December edition of Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews.

The day is finally upon us: the day of the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup Draw, and the program has started.

Though the tournament itself won't kick off until June 2026, the draw lays the foundation for the dramaticsto come. By the end of the day, the tournament's 12 groups will be set in stone, and we will have a general sense of which teams will beplaying in which cities (at least for the 72 group stage games).

We know fans from around Massachusetts, and the world, will be curious about who is coming to Gillette Stadium, which will be called Boston Stadium, and this story will be updated throughout the day.

The ceremony, which is taking place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., will serve as a multi-hour celebration of soccer. You'll have to sit through a slurry of speeches and some political posturing, but at the end of the day, the biggest sporting event of the year's initial stage will be set in stone.

Exact schedules, locations and kickoff times will be confirmed tomorrow on Saturday, Dec. 6.

Sam Pausman

Boston will host matches between teams from Group C, Group I and Group L. Here are the teams that were drawn into each of those groups. The official schedule — and location of the matches — will be announced on Saturday, Dec. 6. (We'll have coverage so check back tomorrow.)

Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Haiti, Scotland

Group I: France, Senegal, [Winner of Play-off 2*], Norway

Group L:England, Croatia, Ghana, Panama

*The winner of Play-off 2 will be one of Iraq, Bolivia and Suriname

The United States Men's National Team, which is in Group D, now knows its opponents for the group stage of competition. Here's a look at every team in the group:

The group stage is the first round of competition for the tournament. It's the only stage where every nation is guaranteed matches (three games to be exact).

There are12 groups, with four teams in each. Each team plays the other teams in its group exactly once. If you win a match, you get three points. If you tie, you get one. The loser gets zero points. The first and second-highest point-getters in each group qualify for the round of 32. Additionally, the eight third-place teams with the highest points also qualify.

Once every team has played its three allotted matches — and a total of 16 teams have been eliminated — the next round (the Round of 32) will be set in stone. (Scroll down through this article for more details.)

Group stage matches make up most of the tournament's gameplay. Of the 104 total matches in the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup, 72 of those will be in the group round.

Janson McNair

Cape Verde, which has a large population of immigrants in the Brockton area, was drawn to Group H, meaning they will play at least one game in Miami Stadium, Atlanta Stadium, Houston Stadium and Estadio Guadalajara.

Janson McNair

Haiti also has a prominent population in the Brockton area and throughout Massachusetts.

Luckily, Haiti was drawn to group C,bringing their pool of potential locations down to New York New Jersey Stadium, Philadelphia Stadium, Miami Stadium, Atlanta Stadium and Boston Stadium for the group stage round. Haiti will play at least one of its games in one of these five locations.

Janson McNair

Portugal has a considerable fan base in the Brockton and Southcoast area of Massachusetts. The team was drawn to Group K, along with Colombia.

This means the team will play at least one of its group stage games in Houston Stadium, Mexico Stadium, Estadio Guadalajara, Atlanta Stadium and Miami Stadium.

Sam Pausman

Brazil was drawn in Group C — which will play two of its matches in Boston. France was drawn in Group I, and that group will also play two matches in Boston.

In Group L, England was drawn from Pot 1. However, there will only be a single Group L match played in Boston Stadium.

Janson McNair

Drawing officially began around 1:27 p.m. at the group stage final draw.

Rio Ferdinand, legendary English defender, took the stage alongside American soccer player Samantha Johnson as they prepare to host the drawing segment of the show.

They welcomed former hockey player Wayne Gretzky, Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge, former NBA center Shaquille O' Neal and former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to draw the teams.

Brady drew thefirst team, which was Brazil, which was placed in Group C in position 1. This means they will play at least one of its games in Boston Stadium, Atlanta Stadium, Philadelphia Stadium, New York New Jersey Stadium or Miami Stadium in the group stage.

Sam Pausman

*Group will play matches at Gillette Stadium, aka Boston Stadium. The game schedule will be announced tomorrow (Saturday), starting at noon Easterntime.

Sam Pausman

The former New England Patriots quarterback has officially taken the stage to help pull teams out of their pots.

"Certainly incredible to have this incredible event coming to North America," Brady said, who played at Gillette Stadium for 20 seasons. "We're all counting down the days. There's huge anticipation always for this event."

Brady is one of four celebrities touted to help with the draw. He is joined onstage by Aaron Judge, Shaquille O'Neal and Wayne Gretzky.

According to the stadium, the venue has a seating capacity of 64,628.

United States: 10 cities

Mexico: 3 cities

Canada: 2 cities

Unsurprisingly, no teams have been drawn yet.

However, hosts Kevin Hart and Heidi Klum kicked off the ceremony with some speeches and Andrea Bocelli, Nicole Scherzinger and Robbie Williams introduced thefestivities with some songs.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino then gave a speech welcoming everyone to the ceremony before presenting President Donald Trump with the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize.

As of 12:42 p.m., "Top Gun: Maverick" actor Manny Ramirez is interviewing Brazilian legend Roberto Carlos about his career and Brazil's chances at the upcoming tournament.

Patriot Place is a shopping and dining center located adjacent to Boston Stadium.

"Patriot Place features more than 1.3 million square feet of shopping, dining, and entertainment," Patriot Place said on its website. "You will find major fashion retailers, live and interactive entertainment, eateries, a four-star hotel, state of the art theatre and much, much more."

Janson McNair

Moments ago, President Donald Trump took the stage at the final draw to receive the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize, awarded to individuals recognized as striving for peace.

"In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in an Instagram post.

"This is truly one of the great honors of my life," Trump said in his acceptance speech.

Janson McNair

The final draw is now live from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., hosted by Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart.

Klum said between 500 million and 1 billion people have tuned in the watch the final draw.

Sam Pausman

Houston, we have liftoff.

The 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup draw ceremony is officially livefrom the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump arrived about 30 minutes before the drawwas scheduled to begin, popping up on the red carpet with FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Nothing has happened just yet, but we will keep you updated as the group stage for the world's biggest sporting tournament is formed — especially when we're able to narrow down which teams might play in Boston.

The event will include seven-time NFL Super Bowl champion and former New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady, four-time NBA championship winner and Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, NHL Hall of Famer and four-time Stanley Cup champion Wayne Gretzky, and seven-time MLB All-Star Aaron Judge. Additionally, two-time NFL Super Bowl champion Eli Manning will serve as the red-carpet host.

Thierry Henry, a World Cup winner who cemented himself as a legend with France and Arsenal, has given his prediction for the winner of the tournament.

Henry, a Frenchman himself, considers France to be the team best suited to win the tournament. The player-turned-pundit noted that Les Bleushave made it to the finals of the previous two FIFA World Cups, and he expects his France side to make it to their third consecutive final.

Boston Stadium, more commonly known as Gillette Stadium, is not actually in Boston. The stadium is located around 29 miles southwest of downtown Boston in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

It serves as the home stadium for both the New England Patriots and the New England Revolution.

Teams are picked and assigned to "groups" in accordance with which "pot" they are placed in.

There are four "pots" that the 48 teams have been organized in, corresponding to team rankings in the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking. Highest ranked teams fall in pot 1, while lowest ranked teams fall in pot 4.

Today, teams will each be assigned to one of the 12 groups — designated as groups A-L — with each group containing one team from each of the four pots.

We already know that Boston Stadium will host some of the games for groups C, I and L, but the exact teams that will be traveling to Boston Stadium will not be known until tomorrow, Saturday, Dec. 6, when the full schedule is expected to be released.

Janson McNair

In total, there are 16 cities hosting matches in this year's World Cup, split between Canada, Mexico and the United States. We've included the FIFA name for the stadium - the closest major city - and what the stadium is called through branding rights.

Here's a look at the cities with matches on the docket:

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) has its schedule for FIFA World Cup group stage matches laid out, as do the teams for Mexico and Canada.

In the final draw, which is scheduled for Dec. 5, teams are selected from four "pots" which correspond to their FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking. Teams in pot 1 are ranked highest, while teams in pot 4 are ranked lowest.

The host countries, the United States, Mexico and Canada, are the exceptions, as they receive special privileges for hosting, which include being in pot 1 and being first in the drawing order.

Because of this, group stage matches for the USMNT have already been determined. Each team plays three group stage matches — one game against each of the other three teams in their group. Here's when and where the U.S. team is expected to play:

Gillette Stadium is typically the home to the New England Patriots and the New England Revolution, but the temporarily named Boston Stadium will be the stage for seven World Cup matches this summer. Here's when they're coming:

Gillette Stadium has a seating capacity of 64,628. The venue has undergone considerable updates since its opening over two decades ago.

"The beginning of the 2023 NFL season marked the completion of the most dramatic Gillette Stadium improvements since its opening in 2002," according to the stadium's website. "The $250 million project completely transformed Gillette Stadium's appearance, greatly enhancing the event day experience for fans.

"It includes the Gillette Stadium Lighthouse, a new signature 22-story lighthouse with a 360-degree observation deck open to guests year-round," it said. "The project also features the largest outdoor curved-radius videoboard at a sports venue in the country, the G-P Atrium, a new 50,000 square foot function space overlooking the game field, and the newly reimagined Plaza."

FIFA said the third phase of 2026 World Cup tickets will begin on Dec. 11 at 11 a.m. ET as part of an update about its ticket sales inventory. This buying period, called the Random Selection Draw, will occur six days after the official draw for the 2026 World Cup is held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. It is the initial phase in which fans can submit applications for tickets after the group-stage matchups are revealed.

World Cup tickets can also be bought through secondary ticket marketplaces, including the official FIFA resale/exchange and Stubhub.

FIFA will also offer a last-minute sales phase closer to the start of the 2026 World Cup in June. Fans will be able to purchase any remaining ticket inventory on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Tickets are selling fast on platforms like Stubhub and SeatGeek. Cheapest seats remaining in the June 13 game start at $474 on Stubhub and $510 on SeatGeek. Here's a look at the current starting prices for each game on SeatGeek as of Dec. 1:

For the first time in FIFA World Cup history, the tournament will have a round of 32 immediately after the group stage. Previously, there were only 32 teams in the tournament, so, therefore, the first knockout round used to be a round of 16.

But now, with 48 teams competing in the tournament — divided into 12 "groups" of four teams each — the round of 32 is the first round of the knockout stages. To qualify for the round of 32, teams need to do one of the following:

If teams win their round of 32 matchup, they will advance to the round of 16. Then to the quarter-finals, then the semi-finals, then the World Cup Final.

Sam Pausman

Think about "pots" as the building blocks for the tournament. They provide the guidance for which nations are drawn into which groups. Here's how it works.

The 42 teams that have already qualified for the tournament, plus the six teams yet to qualify, have been sorted into the four pots, with 12 teams in each pot. These pots are determined based on skill level. So the best teams are in Pot 1. The next quartile in Pot 2, the third in Pot 3 and the fourth quartile goes — you guessed it — in Pot 4. Each group will contain one team from each pot. That way, ideally, the groups are all of equal strength.

These pots are determined based on the team's FIFA rankings at the time of the draw.

The exception? The host teams are automatically placed into Pot 1. Which means, Canada, Mexico and the United States could have a slightly easier tournament than they otherwise would've, because they will not play any of the other "elite" teams from Pot 1. During the 2022 tournament, for example, the U.S. and Mexico were both in Pot 2 while Canada was drawn from Pot 4. Now they're all in Pot 1.

Keep in mind that teams from the same soccer confederation (essentially, continents) cannot be drawn into the same group. The exception here is Europe, which can have at most two teams drawn into the same group.

Here are the teams in each pot:

Sam Pausman

The group stage is the first round of competition for the tournament. It's the only stage where every nation is guaranteed matches (three games to be exact), and it's often the most chaotic round of the tournament. Famously, Saudi Arabia managed a 2-1 victory over the to-be champions Argentina during the group stage of the 2022 FIFA Men's World Cup.

There are a total of 12 groups, with four teams in each. The specific teams in each group will be determined by the end of today's draw. Each team plays the other teams in its group exactly once. If you win a match, you get three points. If you tie, you get one. The loser gets zero points. The first and second-highest point-getters in each group qualify for the round of 32. Additionally, the eight third-place teams with the highest points also qualify.

Once every team has played its three allotted matches — and a total of 16 teams have been eliminated — the next round (the Round of 32) will be set in stone. Group stage matches make up most of the tournament's gameplay. Of the 104 total matches in the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup, 72 of those will be in the group round.

Sam Pausman

Expect a lot of glitz and glamour.

For starters, the event is co-hosted by Heidi Klum, Kevin Hart and Danny Ramirez, and it will feature performances by Andrea Bocelli, Nicole Scherzinger and Robbie Williams.

It's going to somewhat resemble an industry awards ceremony. A lot of bigwigs in big suits will give big speeches. The whole thing will be interspersed with song and dance numbers. And, odds are, they'll save the actual draw for the end.

Historically, FIFA tends to bring up soccer legends to help physically pull team names out of the pots. So, don't be surprised if the likes of David Beckham or Zinedine Zidane make an appearance.

Once the draw is complete, the Village People are scheduled to perform their global hit "Y.M.C.A."

Sam Pausman

The draw will take place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Dec. 5, at noon. Assuming you aren't a ticketholder for the event, the draw will also air live on FOX. It will also be streamed live at foxsports.com if you're stuck in front of a computer.

The draw itself is scheduled to take about two hours.

Sam Pausman

Yes!

In the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, five matches took place at what was then called Foxboro Stadium. Four years later, when the United States hosted another Women's World Cup in 2003, the tournament returned to Foxboro. This time, Gillette Stadium hosted four of the tournament's matches.

On the men's side of things, the U.S. has hosted one World Cup (until next year, of course). In 1994, six matches were played at Foxboro Stadium.

In the 2026 World Cup, Gillette Stadium — now coined Boston Stadium by FIFA — will host seven matches.

On Monday of this week, Gillette Stadium hosted the New England Patriots as they clinched the team's 11th win of the NFL season during a Monday Night Football game against the New York Giants. The Patriots have a bye week and will return to Gillette field on Sunday, Dec. 15, at 1 p.m. when theytake on the Buffalo Bills.

This week the Gillette Stadium hosts a different kind of Super Bowl, the Massachusetts High School Football Championships. Last night in the first game, top-seeded Cohasset outlasted Amesbury, 22-14, to capture the program's third state championship all-time and first since 2021. In the second game, thetop-seeded Norwood Clippers beat No. 3 Fairhaven in the MIAA Division 6 Super Bowl 28-14.

The remain games are: Friday, Dec. 5

Div. 5 - Foxboro vs. Shawsheen Valley Tech, 5

Div. 3 - North Attleboro vs. King Philip, 7:45

Saturday, Dec. 6

Div. 8 - Randolph vs. West Boylston, 10 a.m.

Div. 4 - Tewksbury vs. Scituate, 12:45

Div. 2- Bishop Feehan vs. Catholic Memorial, 3:30

Div. 1 - Xaverian vs. St. John's Prep, 6:15

The Patriot Ledger will provide coverage from all eight Super Bowls. We'll have live blogs, stories, photos and videos from all eight games.

All eight games will be streamed live. Every game will be streamed on Patriots.com and on the New England Patriots YouTube channel.

Sam Pausman

Short answer: Saturday.

Long answer: We know that groups C, I and L will all play some of their matches in Boston. We also know that the winners of Group E will play a Round of 32 match in Boston. So once we find out which teams are in those groups, we will be able to narrow down the options (we will do this for you). But the specific teams playing won't be known until the official schedule is announced tomorrow, Saturday, Dec. 6.

Boston Stadium was awarded a total of seven World Cup matches. Five of those are group stage matches, one is a Round of 32 matchup and Boston's final match is a quarterfinal matchup on Thursday, July 9. During the draw, keep an eye out for teams drawn into Group C, Group I and Group L. At least in the group stage, those will be the teams playing in Boston.

Here's what we know about all the matches so far.

The 48-team field was split into 12 groups of four for the tournament's early rounds. 

With President Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the host nations of the 2026 men's World Cup, watching from the audience, the field for the largest and most complex tournament was revealed Friday.

The 48-team field, an expansion from the previous 32-team format, will begin June 11 when Mexico faces South Africa in Mexico City.

The United States was placed into a group with opening opponent Paraguay, the 39th-ranked team in the world, and 26th-ranked Australia. Their group's fourth and final team won't be determined until March via a playoff between Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.

The U.S. will face Paraguay on June 12 in Inglewood, California; Australia on June 19 in Seattle; and their final opponent, to be determined, on June 25 back in Inglewood.

During a more than two-hour ceremony that featured musical performances and celebrity appearances before any teams were revealed, Trump was awarded a peace prize by Gianni Infantino, the president of soccer's global governing body, FIFA.

Trump later stood next to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum on stage as the host countries were placed into their respective groups.

With the expansion of the field, there were questions whether any of the 12, four-team groups would be stacked with contenders, known as the “Group of Death.” Group C, featuring Brazil, Morocco, Haiti and Scotland, and Group I, which has France, Senegal and Norway, are especially strong. So is Group L, with England, Croatia, Ghana and Panama.

The U.S. men's national team will open the 2026 World Cup against Paraguay on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. 

Its second game of Group D play will take place June 19 in Seattle against Australia.

It will then close the group stage on June 25, again in Inglewood, California, against the winner of a UEFA playoff featuring Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo.

The FIFA World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., has put the U.S. against Australia in the group stage as matchups are solidified ahead of the 2026 tournament taking place across three countries. Australia is ranked No. 26 globally, while the U.S. is ranked No. 14 by FIFA. 

Nations are listed in order of their position in the group, which determines the order of opponents.

Group A: Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, (winner of playoff between Denmark, North Macedonia, Czech Republic, Ireland)

Group B: Canada, (winner of playoff between Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Bosnia and Herzegovina), Qatar, Switzerland

Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Haiti, Scotland

Group D: USA, Paraguay, Australia, (winner of playoff between Turkey, Romania, Slovakia and Kosovo)

Group E: Germany, Curacao, Ivory Coast, Ecuador 

Group F: Netherlands, Japan, (winner of playoff between Ukraine, Sweden, Poland and Albania), Tunisia 

Group G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand

Group H: Spain, Cabo Verde, Saudi Arabia, Uruguay

Group I: France, Senegal, (winner of playoff between Iraq, Bolivia and Suriname), Norway

Group J: Argentina, Algeria, Austria, Jordan

Group K: Portugal, (winner of playoff between Congo DR, Jamaica, New Caledonia), Uzbekistan, Colombia

Group L: England, Croatia, Ghana, Panama

There are now two very clear “Groups of Death” with Group C having Brazil, Morocco and Scotland in it, while Group I has France, Senegal and Norway. 

The latter will see superstars Kylian Mbappé against Erling Haaland, two of the front-runners to win the Golden Boot as the top goal scorers in the tournament. We will see sparks fly when France and Norway meet in the group stage, while Brazil against Morocco will also be a brilliant group stage game. The soccer gods have delivered us majestic matches in the group stage. Thank you!

Group A: Mexico, South Africa, South Korea

Group B: Canada, Qatar, Switzerland

Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Scotland

Group D: USA, Paraguay, Australia

Group E: Germany, Ivory Coast, Ecuador

Group F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia

Group G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran

Group H: Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia

Group I: France, Senegal, Norway

Group J: Argentina, Algeria, Austria

Group K: Portugal, Uzbekistan, Colombia

Group L: England, Croatia, Panama

Argentina, the 2022 World Cup champion, will face Algeria in its 2026 opening game.

Some incredible "Groups of Death" are developing, with Brazil and Morocco in Group C, Spain and Uruguay in Group H, France and Senegal in Group I, and England and Croatia in Group L. This is quite the draw and is incredibly stacked in certain groups. Plenty of powerhouse coaches have very glum looks on their faces in Washington. Wow. 

The three host nations in Mexico, Canada and the U.S. have been handed extremely favorable draws and all three will be under pressure to win the group. The U.S. has Australia and Paraguay in its group so far and it could not have had an easier draw. The host nations are going to be celebrating wildly. It could not have gone better for them. So far.

Paraguay was just drawn into Group D, in the second position, which signifies it will be the first opponent for the U.S. That game will take place in Los Angeles on June 12.

The next 12 teams have been drawn, meaning we are halfway through.

Group A: Mexico, South Korea

Group B: Canada, Switzerland

Group C: Brazil, Morocco

Group D: USA, Australia

Group E: Germany, Ecuador

Group F: Netherlands, Japan

Group G: Belgium, Iran

Group H: Spain, Uruguay

Group I: France, Senegal

Group J: Argentina, Austria

Group K: Portugal, Colombia

Group L: England, Croatia

We now know one of the U.S.' opponents, and it's Australia, which joins Group D. Australia is ranked No. 26 globally.

This is by order of position in the group, starting with the first position. These are the world nine highest-ranked teams, plus the three host nations.

Group A: Mexico

Group B: Canada

Group C: Brazil

Group D: USA

Group E: Germany

Group F: Netherlands

Group G: Belgium

Group H: Spain

Group I: France

Group J: Argentina

Group K: Portugal

Group L: England

Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Shaq and Aaron Judge are on the stage to announce the next groups. 

A pair of playoffs held in March will determine the last six teams in the 48-team field. 

Two teams will come from a group of Iraq, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jamaica, Suriname, Bolivia and New Caledonia.

Four teams will come from a Europe-only playoff featuring 16 teams: Italy, Northern Ireland, Wales, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Sweden, Poland, Albania, Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, Kosovo, Denmark, North Macedonia, Czech Republic and Ireland.

Finally, the draw of the 42 teams already qualified for the World Cup is approaching. The draw's conductor, Rio Ferdinand, is being introduced more than 20 minutes later than expected, according to a schedule for the broadcast.

Mexico will be in Group A, Canada will be in Group B and the United States will be in Group D. 

President Donald Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum are onstage now, being asked questions by FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

"It is the biggest of deals" to co-host the World Cup, Carney told the Kennedy Center audience.

Trump remarked that he remembered watching Pele play for the New York Cosmos in the 1970s. "That man can play," Trump recalled saying.

This is the first time Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have met face-to-face.

They were supposed to meet at the G7 earlier this year, but Trump left early to deal with the conflict between Iran and Israel.

Trump accepted the FIFA Peace Prize and spoke briefly onstage at the Kennedy Center. 

“This is truly one of the great honors of my life. We've saved millions and millions of lives," he said after accepting the inaugural prize. 

FIFA is having basketball, hockey and football players taking part in the draw itself, while some would have liked for big soccer stars from the U.S., Mexico and Canada to be part of it instead.

Trump was awarded the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize as was widely expected. There was a lengthy intro video compiled by FIFA that honored his roles in seeking ceasefires around the world.

Video included mention of his push to end the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, following a ceremony together on Thursday in Washington, though the fighting there has not ended.

Gianni Infantino says the World Cup will have "7 million people in the stadiums. We will have two, three, four times more, millions coming to the U.S., Canada and Mexico just to feel the vibe of the World Cup. We'll have 6 billion people watching the World Cup from home, from all over the world. 

"This is like 104 Super Bowls in one month." 

After FIFA President Gianni Infantino's opening remarks, musical artists Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger are scheduled to perform at 12:19 EST. 

The draw's conductor, former English player Rio Ferdinand, will be introduced on stage at 12:47 p.m., and his assistants — sports stars Wayne Gretzky, Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal and Aaron Judge — will join Ferdinand around 12:53 p.m.

Then comes the moment for which we are all waiting: the beginning of the technical draw. That is scheduled to start at 12:54 p.m.

Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, just introduced President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump at the Kennedy Center. He then turned to point out Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and first lady Diana Fox Carney. 

Infantino called the World Cup "the greatest event that humanity, that mankind has ever seen and ever will see" and compared it to hosting 104 Super Bowls over the course of a month.

President Donald Trump was asked on the red carpet before entering the Kennedy Center if he's been told he would receive the inaugural FIFA “Peace Prize.”

“I have not been told. There's a rumor about it,” Trump said, standing next to FIFA President Gianni Infantino. Trump later said he'd be honored to receive it.

World-renowned singer Andrea Bocelli just took the stage and sang "Nessun Dorma." Even at 67 years old, he has an incredible voice. 

Today, we will find out which teams go in which groups, but FIFA won't announce the full calendar until tomorrow. It will take an extra day to evaluate logistics and time slots so that for example European teams will be scheduled in friendlier time slots for a European audience. 

Right now, 42 are. The nations that are already in include big names like No. 1-ranked Spain; No. 2 Argentina, the defending champion; and No. 3 France, which lost to Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final. The field also contains a handful of surprises. Last month, Scotland secured its first appearance since 1998 with a dramatic win, and Curaçao became the smallest nation by population ever to qualify.

That leaves six open spots. They will be filled via dual playoffs that will take place in March. One playoff featuring European teams will fill four of the open spots, while a separate playoff will supply the other two.

As hosts, the U.S. men's national team is guaranteed to avoid fellow hosts Mexico and Canada plus the next nine best-ranked automatic qualifiers via the latest FIFA rankings.

So there will be no Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany on the group stage docket.

They will also not play CONCACAF teams or slots that could be CONCACAF teams. That eliminates Pot 3 team Panama, as well as Pot 4 teams Curacao and Haiti, and the inter-confederation playoff winners, because CONCACAF teams are in those groups.

So Jamaica, Suriname, Bolivia, Iraq, New Caledonia, and DR Congo are out, too.

The obvious ones are whether Lionel Messi and Argentina will win back-to-back World Cup titles as he aims to call time on his international career (surely) in the best way possible. While the other big storyline swirling is around Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, and if he can win the one trophy which has eluded him during his legendary career.

There is also plenty of interest around England, France and Spain as the European powerhouses have stacked squads and the Three Lions in particular have come so close to winning silverware but lost in the final of the last two European Championships. There are also the likes of Norway, Scotland and Austria qualifying for the first time in 28 years and all three European nations could go on a deep run if the draw is favorable.

And fairytales are alive and well at this competition as the expanded format has allowed for Uzbekistan, Jordan, Curacao and Cape Verde to qualify for their first-ever World Cup, while Haiti has qualified for just the second time.

The FIFA World Cup draw on Friday will be viewed by millions around the globe, but the high-profile event appears to be tailored to one key player: President Donald Trump.

Andrea Bocelli, one of Trump's favorite performers, is set to perform, and the Village People will conclude the draw with Trump's anthem, “Y.M.C.A.”

It will be held at the Kennedy Center in the nation's capital, where FIFA President Gianni Infantino will debut the organization's inaugural “Peace Prize.” The White House hasn't denied reports that Trump, who hasn't been shy about his desire for the Nobel Prize of the same name, is set to receive it.

Messi, known as the greatest player of all time, is 38 years old and in the final stages of his incredible career. The Argentinian superstar, who led the country to a World Cup title in 2022, told NBC News in October the plan is to play. 

“I would like to be there, to be well and be an important part of helping my national team, if I am there. And I'm going to assess that on a day-to-day basis when I start preseason next year with Inter [Miami] and see if I can really be 100%, if I can be useful to the group, to the national team, and then make a decision. 

"Obviously, I'm really eager because it's a World Cup. We're coming off winning the last World Cup, and being able to defend it on the field again is spectacular because it's always a dream to play with the national team, especially in official competitions.”

 

Led by Lionel Messi, Argentina raised the World Cup trophy as champions in 2022, but getting back to that stage is something a reigning champion hasn't done in six decades.

The last repeat champ was Brazil, which won in 1958 and 1962. 

Making the final is no guarantee that such success can be repeated. France came close, winning the championship in 2018 before reaching the final four years later, only to lose to Argentina. Before Les Bleus made back-to-back finals, however, it hadn't happened since Brazil won in 1994 and was the 1998 runner-up.

The betting odds for the 2026 World Cup are intriguing as we now know 42 of the 48 teams that are confirmed to qualify for the tournament.

With the group stage pairings and the route each team has to the final to be confirmed, the odds will reflect how easy, or tough, teams have it.

Read the full story here.

Forty-eight teams will play in next summer's men's World Cup, up from the previous 32-team format. This is also the first World Cup to be co-hosted by three countries — Mexico, Canada and the U.S.	

But all 48 teams haven't qualified. Only 42 have, with the final six to be decided in March via two different playoff systems, one that will determine four more teams from Europe and another that will determine two other countries from scattered regions.

So, who is in?

The U.S. advanced out of the group stage to the round of 16 in each of their last three World Cup appearances, in 2010, 2014 and 2022. They're ranked 14th in the world. For context, the U.S. men have been ranked in the top 10 just once since 2006.

While the U.S. opponents won't be known until Friday, their schedule for the group stage is already out. The U.S. will play June 12 in Los Angeles, June 19 in Seattle and June 25 back in Los Angeles.

Because of their role as hosts, which groups Mexico, Canada and the U.S. will be in has been predetermined. The question is which opponents will join them.

But, for now, Mexico is slotted to be placed into Group A, Canada in Group B and the U.S. in Group D.

Tim Ream from the United States men's national team joins "TODAY" to talk about how it will feel to play the tournament in the United States, what to expect from the draw and more.

You thought the World Cup draw was solely about teams learning who they will play? No, the worlds of politics and entertainment will be present at the World Cup draw, too. When the draw begins at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance. The show will be co-hosted by comedian Kevin Hart, model and television personality Heidi Klum and actor Danny Ramirez. 

There also will be musical performances by Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger and the Village People, who are performing, "Y.M.C.A."

FIFA has broken down the 48 teams into four “pots” that are effectively ordered by each nation's world ranking. 

The draw will kick off by selecting the three host nations: Mexico, Canada and the U.S.

From there, nine more teams from “Pot 1" — the world's nine highest-ranked teams, including No. 1 Spain and reigning champion and No. 2-ranked Argentina — will be drawn, ensuring that one team from that pot will be placed into all 12 groups. Then one team from Pot 2 is drawn into every group, and the cycle is repeated for pots 3 and 4.

Ferdinand, a former English captain, will conduct Friday's draw with broadcaster Samantha Johnson, but FIFA has also brought in a number of stars from other sports to help draw teams.

They include Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Shaquille O'Neal and Aaron Judge, the Yankees star recently named the American League's most valuable player.

Per BetMGM, these are the betting favorites to win the 2026 World Cup.

The World Cup 2026 draw has been made, with England set to face Croatia in the group stages, and the USMNT to take on Australia. Brazil have been drawn with Morocco, while France will play Senegal and Argentina must face Austria.

Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, drew his nation into Group B as the first pick, while Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum drew her nation into Group A. United States president Donald Trump then drew the United States National Team into Group D.

Brazil were the first non-host team drawn by Birmingham shareholder Tom Brady, and were drawn into Group C, while Germany were drawn into Group E, the Netherlands into Group F, Belgium into Group G, Spain into Group H, Argentina into Group J (because they cannot meet Spain in their pathway), France into Group I, Portugal into Group K and England, the final team out of the pot, into Group L. 

Thomas Tuchel's side will subsequently be playing their first game in either Toronto or Dallas, their second in Toronto or Boston, and their third in New York or Philadelphia. 



Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA legend, drew from Pot 2, before NFL star Aaron Judge drew from Pot 3, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky drew from Pot 4.

Group A: Mexico, South Africa, Korea Republic, Denmark / North Macedonia / Czechia / Republic of Ireland.

Group B: Canada, Qatar, Switzerland, Italy/ Northern Ireland / Wales / Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Group C: Brazil, Morocco, Haiti, Scotland.

Group D: USMNT, Paraguay, Australia, Turkiye / Romania / Slovakia / Kosovo.

Group E: Germany, Curacao, Cote D'Ivoire, Ecuador.

Group F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia, Ukraine / Sweden / Poland / Albania.

Group G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand.

Group H: Spain, Cabo Verde, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia

Group I: France, Senegal, Norway, Iraq / Bolivia / Suriname

Group J: Argentina, Algeria, Austria, Jordan.

Group K: Portugal, Congo DR / Jamaica / New Caledonia, Uzbekistan, Colombia.

Group L: England, Croatia, Ghana, Panama.

The 2026 World Cup will begin with the clash between Mexico and South Africa in Group A. The game will take place on Thursday June 11, 2026, and from there, the tournament will begin. England will face Croatia in a rerun of the 2018 World Cup semi-final and will also meet familiar opponents in Panama, having played them at the same tournament. That game ended in a 6-1 win for the Three Lions, as Harry Kane scored a hat-trick. Tuchel's side will also face Ghana, but have only played them once before, doing so in a friendly in 2011. That game resulted in a 1-1 draw. 

England's first game will take place on June 17 against Croatia, before their second game on June 23 against Ghana, and they then round out the initial phase of the tournament on June 27, with their clash against minnows Panama. 

Pundit Dion Dublin said on BBC Sport: "Regarding England, I think the African nations always give England a hard game. I'm expecting England to do what they need to do against Panama. Ghana and Croatia I'm a little bit worried about."

Scottish pundit Scott Brown added on their draw: "We've got to look to beat Haiti, it will be a huge game for us. Morocco, we'll be underdogs from looking at the world rankings, it's a hard game. Brazil is the big one. Everyone will want to be at that Scotland v Brazil game. Seeing that yellow shirt, they've got top quality players. As do Morocco. We've got to beat Haiti and try to pick up points somewhere else. There is hope for us."

The tournament will kick off soon enough next year but first, come the playoffs, with the competition's field set to be rounded out. The semi-finals will take place on Thursday March 26 and the finals on Tuesday March 31 with kick-off times of 5pm or 7.45pm.

The winners of the four play-off finals qualify for the World Cup and complete the field of 16 European participants.

As co-hosts alongside Canada and Mexico, the United States was an automatic qualifier for the 2026 World Cup. It'll mark the 12th time that the USMNT will compete at the World Cup.

In the World Cup draw on Dec. 5, the U.S. was placed in a group with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA's Playoff C – Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo or Romania.

The USMNT has made it through the group stage but could not advance past the Round of 16 in three of the last four World Cups (it did not qualify for the 2018 tournament). After a third-place finish at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the USMNT's best performance in the tournament came in 2002 when it reached the quarterfinals.

Managed by Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT is captained by defender Tim Ream and features Christian Pulisic as its key player.

Here's what to know about the USMNT's 2026 World Cup group and schedule:

WASHINGTON — The nation's capital hosted the draw for the 2026 World Cup on Friday, determining the groups, matchups and venues for next summer's tournament in North America.

The United States men's national team has already been placed in Group D as a host and learned its three opponents in the draw, a high-profile affair taking place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump is in attendance and was handed the inaugural "FIFA Peace Prize," an award that was announced weeks after the president was not named the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.

This edition of the draw featured some new wrinkles as the field expands from 32 to 48 for the first time, with 12 groups and separate pathways for the world's four highest-ranked teams.

"This will be the greatest World Cup ever, the greatest event mankind will ever see," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on stage at the Kennedy Center.

Follow for live updates as the 2026 World Cup draw unfolds:

WASHINGTON — Critics of the expanded 48-team FIFA World Cup will say the tournament has become watered down but several groups are loaded with heavy-hitters who may have a tougher time than expected to advance to the knockout stage.

Group L looks like the 2026 World Cup's unofficial "Group of Death" with England, Croatia, Ghana and Panama playing a round-robin for a spot in the Round of 32.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw ceremony starts at noon ET on Friday, Dec. 5.

Entering the draw, 42 of the 48 spots in the field have been clinched. The final six spots will be decided in March's qualification playoffs.

Here are the teams qualified entering the draw:

WASHINGTON — With President Trump and other heads of state and dignitaries scheduled to attend the World Cup draw, security is tight around the Kennedy Center in the nation's capital.

Neighboring streets have been shut down all morning and media members are waiting in an hour-long line in the snow to get into the security perimeter.

Entering the draw, the 48 teams – 42 already clinched – are placed into four pots of 12 based on the November FIFA world rankings. The final six countries are in the fourth pot by default, no matter who ends up qualifying.

As the co-hosts, the USA, Canada and Mexico were placed into the first pot by default with the tournament's nine highest-ranked teams.

Other than Europe (16 places), no continental federation may have more than one team in each group.

FIFA changed the draw for 2026 to create separate pathways to the semifinals for the four-highest ranked teams: Spain, Argentina, France and England. That means if Spain and Argentina win their groups, the world's Nos. 1 and 2 teams can not meet prior to the final.

WASHINGTON — It wasn't the one he had in mind but Donald Trump did finally take home a peace prize.

Trump was the winner of the inaugural "FIFA Peace Prize," which the soccer organization awarded during its World Cup draw in Washington. 

The award winner was hardly a surprise. Trump has been the assumed victor since FIFA announced the creation of the prize a month ago that it said would "reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace."

WASHINGTON — Before the drawing of teams began, Trump was awarded the inaugural "FIFA peace prize," a new annual honor that was announced after Trump didn't win the  Nobel Peace Prize. After an extended video honoring Trump, Infantino presented him with a medal and the trophy, gushing over the American president before handing him the mic.

"This is truly one of the great honors of my life," Trump said after receiving the award.

It's showtime for world soccer's courtship of President Donald Trump, complete with a performance by one of his favorite bands and a glitzy, celebrity-laden ceremony loaded with anticipation and a prize targeted to appeal to a president who styles himself as a peacemaker.

FIFA is the governing body for international soccer (football), most notably orchestrating events such as the men's and women's World Cups. FIFA is an acronym for Federation Internationale de Football Association. FIFA was founded in 1904 and has 211 members.

The FIFA World Cup 2026 draw, which will take place at the iconic John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Dec. 5, will feature a star-studded lineup of athletes assisting former England captain Rio Ferdinand.

The event, which will be broadcast on Fox, features Ferdinand and Samantha Johnson as hosts.

They will have notable assistants for the draw, including seven-time NFL Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, four-time NBA championship winner and Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, NHL Hall of Famer and four-time Stanley Cup champion Wayne Gretzky, and seven-time MLB All-Star Aaron Judge. Additionally, two-time NFL Super Bowl champion Eli Manning will serve as the red carpet host, making a special appearance to enhance the unique experience for fans watching.

England manager Thomas Tuchel said he might keep his substitutes in the dressing room during matches at the 2026 World Cup next summer in an attempt to mitigate the impact of extreme heat.

"If this helps the players later in the match, we have to consider it," Tuchel told BBC Sport on Thursday.

"Nobody likes it because I want the players to be out there, feeling the energy and bringing it from the bench on to the pitch. But I saw players doing this at the Club World Cup. Hopefully we can avoid it," the manager added.

Scorching heat was a major concern at the Club World Cup in the U.S. last June, when medical experts and players' unions expressed concerns about heat stress, dehydration and slower recovery times.

Tuchel admitted that this would be problematic for high-level football, saying it would reduce the intensity of matches in the global event co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. — Reuters

MLS commissioner Don Garber said the arrival of elite players such as Lionel Messi have helped the sport cement its place in a crowded U.S. market, as anticipation builds across the country for Friday's World Cup draw in Washington.

Garber said real progress had been made in recent years, fueled in part by the arrival of Lionel Messi in 2023.

"On the field, our league is more global than ever before," Garber said at a news conference on Thursday.

"Our roster features players from 80 different countries. More than any other league in any sport around the world. And global superstars, as we all know, are making MLS their league of choice," — Reuters

FIFA's chief of global football development Arsene Wenger backed the move to 48 teams, saying demand to participate was growing and that the quality gap between nations had narrowed.

"The evolution is always more teams want to participate. And now I believe that 48 teams is the right number," he said, noting it still represented less than a quarter of FIFA's 211 member associations.

"I was a bit scared before because maybe the difference between the teams will be too big. In fact, we realized that the difference quality-wise has been reduced." – Reuters

President Trump was awarded the first-ever FIFA Peace Prize on Friday for his “exceptional and extraordinary actions” in promoting unity across the globe – with the commander-in-chief describing the inaugural award “one of the greatest honors of my life.”

“This is your prize, this is your peace prize,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said as he bestowed the honor ahead of the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, DC.

Trump accepted a gold medal and put it around his own neck as the FIFA boss heaped praise on him for his actions in promoting world peace.

“This is what we want from a leader — a leader that cares about the people,” Infantino said.

Trump, who had his sights on the Nobel Peace Prize, was also presented with a gold trophy bearing his name and a pair of hands holding up the world.

“This is truly one of the great honors of my life,” Trump said as he hailed the fact he had ended wars and “saved millions and millions of lives.”

“The world is a safer place now,” he continued.

“The United States, one year ago, was not doing too well, and now I have to say we're the hottest country anywhere in the world that we're going to keep it that way.”

World soccer's governing body had announced last month that it was introducing the annual award — officially known as the “FIFA Peace Prize – Football Unites the World.”

Trump, who is chummy with the FIFA boss, had been heavily favored to win the newly created prize.

Still, Trump insisted he had zero prior knowledge that he would take home the inaugural gong as he walked the red carpet ahead of the draw.

“I don't know that I'm getting it. I haven't been officially noticed. I've been hearing about a peace prize — and I'm here to represent our country in a different sense,” Trump told reporters as he lapped up the cameras.

He stressed, though, that he didn't need the accolades.

“I want to really save lives, not only prizes, I need to save lives,” he said.

“I'm saving a lot of lives. I saved millions and millions of lives — and that's really what I want to do.”

After accepting the award, Trump suggested American football needed a new name because soccer is truly football, as the sport is known outside the US.

“This is football –there is no question,” Trump told the crowd. “We have to come up with another name for the other one. It really does not make sense when you think about it.”

Infantino, for his part, has previously made it clear that he believed Trump should have been given the Nobel for his efforts to broker a cease-fire in Gaza.

Trump missed out on the Nobel this year after it was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Meanwhile, a defiant Trump insisted the FIFA peace prize didn't conflict with his recent vow to strike Venezuelan drug traffickers.

“I mean, I settled eight wars,” he told reporters ahead of the draw when asked about the likelihood of him taking it home.

It comes after Trump threatened earlier this week to order strikes on land-based Venezuelan drug traffickers in an expansion of his military campaign — and added that Colombian operators were also at risk.

Since Sept. 2, the US military has attacked at least 22 vessels allegedly carrying drugs in international waters off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia, killing at least 83 people.

Donald Trump receives inaugural Fifa Peace Prize

United States President Donald Trump received the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize before the draw for the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

The award has been introduced this year by Fifa president Gianni Infantino, designated for a person who has "taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace" and "united people across the world".

It was widely expected that Trump, who arrived at the ceremony with Infantino and has made several public appearances with him in recent months, would be the winner.

That was confirmed at the ceremony in Washington DC on Friday.

As well as receiving a large golden trophy, Trump was also given a medal and certificate by Infantino before making a speech.

Donald Trump was presented with the Fifa Peace Prize trophy

Trump stated he had saved "tens of millions of lives" through diplomatic interventions and had "stopped wars happening just before they started".

"This is truly one of the great honours of my life," Trump said, before claiming that the 2026 World Cup has set a new record for ticket sales.

"Gianni has done an incredible job. It is a nice tribute to you and the game of football, or as we call it soccer. It is beyond the numbers we thought were possible," Trump said.

"The world is a safer place now. The USA was not doing well a year ago; now we are the hottest country in the world right now."

The 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, and will take place between June 11 and July 19.

Trump later returned to the stage alongside Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney to perform the ceremonial opening to the draw.

The three leaders drew the balls of their respective nations, which had already been assigned their groups. Afterwards, the trio posed for a selfie taken by Infantino.

Mexico are in Group A - and will play in the tournament's opening match - while Canada are in Group B and USA feature in Group D.

Trump, after repeating his comments about ticket sales, joked about the name clash between American football and what Americans generally call soccer.

"We have to find another name for the NFL," Trump said. "This is football, we call it soccer here in the USA but it is really football. It doesn't make sense that we call it soccer."

Trump and Infantino have appeared together at many public events in recent months

Who are the 2026 World Cup debutants?

Staged just a mile from the White House, this is a World Cup draw with a distinctly political feel.

The glittering ceremony is at the Kennedy Center, the famous Washington arts venue now chaired by US President Donald Trump after he overhauled its board this year.

Alongside stars from football, US sports and show business, Trump was in attendance, as will the leaders of the other two co-hosts - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Proceedings, however, seem to have been planned with the US president very much in mind.

Seventies group Village People were booked to play YMCA, a Trump favourite that is regularly heard at his campaign rallies. And, in a break with tradition, the draw ceremony featured the awarding of a new Fifa Peace Prize.

Such gestures will only underline the alliance forged between the US president and Fifa's Infantino, who announced the award last month, saying that Trump deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to the Israel-Gaza ceasefire, and enthusiastically praising his policies.

For critics, such moves are a threat to Fifa's commitment to political neutrality, one enshrined in its statutes, and risk turning the draw - and the tournament itself - into propaganda tools.

Those critics believe Infantino and Trump are effectively too close for comfort, and that it sends a message that world football's governing body is aligning with the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, and endorsing what many feel is a divisive administration.

Asked about the new peace award, amid reports that the Fifa Council was not consulted about it, one senior official at the governing body told BBC Sport: "Why can't this be bigger than the Nobel Peace Prize? Football has huge global support, so it's right that it recognises extraordinary efforts to bring about peace every year."

They pointed to the fact that in 2019 there was no such controversy when Fifa gave the president of Argentina an award to honour his contribution to football, and said the organisation deserves praise for endorsing peace in a divided world.

Exclusive Interview with Tobin Heath and Christen Press: they have changed the game on and off the pitch. They have also revolutionized storytelling, coverage, fashion, and so much. more. What's next? Find out.

Legends on the pitch and gamechangers off it, Tobin Heath and Christen Press have revolutionized athlete storytelling, coverage, fashion and more throughout their playing careers. Now, they're looking to build a lasting legacy off it.

The pair have combined to make over 336 caps for the United States Women's National Team, contributing 185 goals (100 goals, 85 assists) and playing key roles in two Women's World Cup winning sides (2015, 2019). And that's just on the international stage, with both shaping their own legacy at the club level. Press finished her NWSL career with 50 goals, while Heath still holds the record for the most assists in a single season (10 in 2016).

Revolutionaries, innovators and playmakers. Most of all, they are fierce advocates for justice, equality, and refuse to back down from any challenge. As they move on to the next chapter of their careers, their voices will continue to have a everlasting impact moving forward.

Ahead of the 2025 NWSL Championship, All For XI had the privilege to speak with the legends and discuss RE, their respective journeys, how far the league has come, post-retirement bucket lists, Wicked, new merch and more.

Can you speak to us about how you're using RE's platform to completely change the game? How has that set the tone for storytelling, coverage, fashion and everything you're doing not just now but into the future?

Tobin Heath: It has been such an interesting journey so far. I think about our careers and lives as both dreaming and doing at the same time; that it's like dreaming in action. I mean, it's like we're in Inception or something. It's kind of crazy. We even talk about being here for the past three championship weekends (2023, 2024, 2025) and how much has evolved and grown, and it's happening so rapidly.

So much about our our own careers, and even starting RE, was just an extension and a natural progression of what we were already doing. RE really came out of our pay equity fight, and also revamping our own Players Association, which is its own business in itself. So we had a lot of learning and education in kind of this weird way while we were players - of what it would even mean to create a company. In hindsight it was revolutionary. What RE ultimately was, and is to this day, is our vehicle to continue to reimagine and redefine and reinvent the women's sports ecosystem and business. All we have built came out of our frustrations as women's athletes and what was lacking.

Instead of being frustrated and bitter, we were like, ‘these are actually incredible business opportunities,' and ‘let's build and let's create.' That's what we've done. In a lot of ways, we have created this awesome surfboard - the waves are coming and the waves are getting bigger, and we're excited to to ride them, to shape the culture, shape the narrative into one that actually represents our culture, our voices, our stories and our diverse community.

Women's sports has yet to even scratch the surface of what it is. It's so unique and exciting, women actually getting to tell their stories from their perspective. Their voices, their outfits, their life experiences. It's so powerful, and we don't even know what's going to come of it. It's not sports, you're not really reinventing how to kick a soccer ball, although we can get into that. But like, the actual culture, culture is sports and that's what's so exciting. It's being able to shape, define, enjoy and be authentic to our culture.

You both had such incredible careers. Just looking back at it all, what was the most rewarding aspect of your journey?

Christen Press: That's a really tough question, because so much of who we are is because of football. One thing that comes to mind is the relationship we have built with this community. I felt really lucky in 2025 to play this year, and feel like I was a little bit in the future as a 36 year old with teammates that were 16 to 20 years old. I got to see the next generation and represent my generation into the future. I was profoundly moved by the connection that I felt with this entire community, and that's what I believe RE is.

It's a relationship with a group of people that have done a lot for me, and also one I get to galvanize and grow in a really unique way. I often say, I was given a gift in football so that I could be a part of a larger movement for social justice, rights and opportunity. Now that the soccer playing itself is over, it feels like I'm more perfectly situated in what my dharma is and what my purpose is on this earth. I know I'm doing it in the right group of people, if that makes sense.

NWSL Championship week has celebrated the players. Having the first-ever NWSL Awards Show… Now players are headlining the whole week of wonderful activities. How have you seen those things change and the exponential growth that has come.

TH: If you think back to 2013 until now, I don't know if there's anything more exciting and more investable on this planet than women's sports and AI. You have to feel it, you have to understand it, and it's still early days in terms of like the numbers. You can physically feel the momentum year over year. It's almost like NWSL Championship Weekend is a summit and a celebration of how much growth we've had in a year.

The players are the biggest drivers of the transformation and I love seeing them be amplified, their voices and their stories being heard, because that's what makes you love sports. It's that access. People think, oh, you know, women's sports all of a sudden is like, new and exciting. It's like, no, it's just now you have access to just how awesome it has always been.

I always say that social media has a lot of of bad, right? But social media completely changed the game for women's sports because now there is no middleman that you have to beg, ask and plead to put you on TV so people in the world know you exist. You can go direct to your audience, direct to your fans. There's an audience that resonates with women's sports and resonates with the culture that is women's sports. That's what's so exciting…just connecting those dots. We have only connected a few of them and look at what the ecosystem is doing. Imagine if we connect a few more and you actually create a cohesive ecosystem around the thing people love to cheer for. It's really exciting to be a part of it as a player, and now, as an entrepreneur and a founder. It's exciting to build in it. Ultimately, we love representing the players and the growth of of the players, because that's the perspective we understand best.

You both have always used your platform to promote inclusivity in the women's soccer community, especially with regards to the queer community. What has it meant for you to see your impact in those spaces?

CP: It has meant a lot. I feel that we have been able to just be ourselves, and in doing so, create pathways and representation for women - for me, for people of color, for queer and lesbians. I think all we had to do was be authentic in our love and our relationship and be intentional about what we kept sacred, private and what we share. I think women's sports is one of the most inclusive, wonderful pockets of this world, and we're lucky to be in it. It feels like a duty to keep it that way.

Now that you're done playing, do you have any bucket list items or fun plans that are coming up? 

CP: I mean Men's World Cup, then the Women's World Cup, and then the LA Olympics. That's where I'll be covering it, telling stories, in the stadiums, behind the microphone, doing all the things. I'm so excited, it's going to be an epic three years. And it feels like so fun that we got to end our career this year and be wide open to seize these opportunities.

I saw your amazing wicked costumes and loved them. How are you feeling about new movie, Wicked: For Good? 

CP: Well, we are here at the NWSL Final, and I think people have actually seen the movie and I haven't, so that's very upsetting. But we have tickets, and I'm a little nervous because I didn't have any expectations for the first movie, and it was so, so good. Now I have expectations. I'm a little nervous because these characters mean so much to me, and I hope that they don't get it wrong. I just hope Elphaba and Glinda, like, make up.

We saw new apparel dropping… Can you talk about that, share more info about RE moving forward?

TH: Yeah, RE has so many facets to the business. We started with a single t-shirt, so it's a huge part of our origin story. But also, physical product is so important to connect with our community. I'm a Tar Heel, so if I see a UNC sweatshirt out there or something, I'm like, ‘oh my gosh.' We have something in common. We have shared values. We know Franklin Street. All these things that are shared - that's what I believe in physical product. Our RE box logo in particular, for me it's a sign of our Reimaginers, our community members and it's a sign of Reimagination. You're here and showing up in a different way.

I want people all over the world to see (RE) and to be like, ‘those are my people. This is where I want to be.' That's why physical products are so important to me. Then it's about the culture, right? They are products I want to wear. I wear my RE boxers every single day because they're an incredible product, but also because it represents my values. And every time I put on my RE boxers, it reminds me of the things that I care about, what I'm fighting for. That's really important to me, and to connecting, to continue to find ways to connect our community.

CP: I'm really excited about this drop because we went back to our core. I love the Sports Reimagined product. I think it's just really clear in what you value and what you're doing. For me, it's going to be the next echoing cry for this community. I love the TRS products. It's our first time having TRS products available. We have had such an incredible reception for the show. We got to be playful and put in some themes that have come up in the show, right into the product. The Bad Gay t-shirt, as well, as Tobin mentioned. Our core pieces subtly just say who you are and what you're about. So it feels really like a special collection for us as we go into this holiday and continue to expand who's a part of the RE-INC world and RE-INC ecosystem.

We have been seeing the RE merch everywhere. What has that been like for you both? To see that support from not just fans, but fellow players too. 

CP: It makes me so happy. There have been a couple times where I feel like I get my own RE history reflected back at me. Anytime we do a RE party, people will come in wearing the very first thing we did, all the way up to something we dropped yesterday.

You can see our own evolution as a brand and as humans right in front of us. It's also how I feel in stadiums when I look up into the crowd. I would see as much RE as I would see (number) 23 and it means something to me to see something that I created, and often Tobin designed, on people's bodies. The way that our teammates, colleagues and players love the product, it's my favorite thing. I bring merch into the locker room and the girls go nuts and are fighting over their sizes.

We actually stopped doing as much merch this year, but now we're kind of back. I'm really excited to send a big box to Angel City, to all the players. I hope that next year you see even more people walking around in gear, because I think it's a really cool connection point for the women's soccer community. It subtly connects fans to the coaches, to the players. We're all in this together, and that's quite beautiful.

Marcello, a Hispanic actor, comedian, and cast member of Saturday Night Live, whose childhood on the soccer fields of Miami shaped his lifelong connection to the sport, made him the natural choice for the voiceover, embodying the fight and optimism of the national team spirit. Hernandez's involvement helps bridge the worlds of sport and pop culture at a moment when the global spotlight is turning toward the United States. His voice brings humor, heart, and authenticity to a campaign built for a new era of fandom.

"This campaign isn't just about soccer; it's about the American dream. Never chasing reality means ignoring the odds and daring to dream," said Marcello Hernandez. "I played soccer since I was 4 years old until college and have been a fan of the Men's and Women's U.S. National Team since I was a kid, so it's an honor to bring my passion and enthusiasm for the game to U.S. soccer."

Never Chase Reality™ marks U.S. Soccer's largest national campaign to date, launching at a pivotal moment for the sport as the United States prepares to host the FIFA Men's World Cup for the first time since 1994. Designed to reach fans across all 50 states, the campaign will live at the intersection of sport and culture, appearing across broadcast, digital, out-of-home, and fan experiences throughout the year.

The campaign debuted publicly today in New York City's Times Square, where thousands of fans gathered to watch the World Cup Draw and experience the Never Chase Reality™ film on iconic LED screens. The premiere marks one of the largest public-facing launches in Federation history, reinforcing the campaign's role in shaping the national conversation ahead of 2026.

With the FIFA World Cup returning to North America, Never Chase Reality™ is designed to inspire a new generation of fans and unify the country behind the U.S. Men's National Team. The campaign was developed in-house by the new MarComms Department at U.S. Soccer, and captures the relentlessness, fearlessness, and unyielding spirit that defines both players and fans. At its core, it's a story of the relentless pursuit of excellence.

"Soccer has always been about more than what happens on the field, it lives in our communities, in our fans, and in every person who believes in this team," said Catherine Newman, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer, U.S. Soccer. "The campaign reflects that spirit. It celebrates the resilience of our players and the passion of our fans as we unite behind a common purpose heading into 2026."

In 2026, the world will turn its attention to elite soccer in June and July as the FIFA World Cup is hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

In preparation for this prestigious tournament, the U.S. Men's National Team will play a series of international friendlies.

The USMNT's friendlies will begin in March with two games in Atlanta. The U.S. men will face Belgium on March 28 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, followed by a match against Portugal on March 31.

In May, the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte will host a friendly match against an opponent that has yet to be announced. Then just six days before their first FIFA World Cup group stage game, the Americans will play Germany on June 6 at Soldier Field in Chicago.

Here is the USMNT friendly schedule and how to watch.

Cup Draw

WASHINGTON – On Friday, the eyes of the soccer world turn to the United States capital as nations learn the identity of their group stage opponents for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Many headlines from this draw, however, will likely be dominated by one man: U.S. President Donald Trump.

This, after all, appears to be an event World Cup organizer FIFA has constructed in his image and to his taste.

Alexi Lalas, the former U.S. men's national team international and Fox Sports soccer analyst, calls Trump the “soccer president” and it is certainly difficult to recall any U.S. president who has taken such a shine to the sport; the most popular on the planet but sometimes fighting for relevance in the imagination of the American public.

FIFA had originally formulated plans for an all-singing and all-dancing draw in Las Vegas, replicating the event that preceded the 1994 World Cup, where there were star turns by Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Robin Williams. Yet as those negotiations with venues in Vegas advanced, FIFA's most senior executives always kept open the option of the draw taking place in D.C., such was the desire for Trump to play a key role on the day.

Those Vegas plans were officially shelved when the administration suggested the president preferred the event to go somewhere much closer to home. Since his return to power, Trump and his allies have taken over the previously bipartisan board of trustees at the John F. Kennedy Center, the performing arts venue in D.C. As such, FIFA opted for the Kennedy Center.

Andrew Giuliani, son of former New York City mayor and Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, is the director of the White House FIFA World Cup Task Force, which is chaired by Trump. He has previously described Friday's event as the “MAGA-FIFA World Cup draw,” according to the Associated Press.

This will be most obvious during the draw when FIFA awards its inaugural peace prize to Trump. FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who describes himself as a close friend of Trump, wrote on Instagram to say Trump deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which instead went to Venezuelan democracy advocate Maria Corina Machado. According to multiple people familiar with FIFA's preparations, all of whom will remain anonymous to protect relationships, the plan in recent days and weeks has been to invite Trump to receive his award and give an acceptance speech, which is slated to last a few minutes. FIFA is not expected to stringently enforce a time limit. Both FIFA and the White House declined to comment on the plans.

The event will also include several hallmarks of MAGA culture. The Village People, whose 1978 hit song “Y.M.C.A.” has been adopted by Trump as a personal anthem during rallies and campaign events, have been invited to perform at the draw. So too has one of his favorite tenors, Andrea Bocelli, who will open the ceremony. The Trump family were attending Bocelli concerts as far back as 2011 and the Italian sang for Trump in the Oval Office earlier this year.

Wayne Gretzky, the Canadian ice hockey legend, will assist in the draw formalities and was at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on the night of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Gretzky and his wife, Janet, also attended Trump's presidential inauguration in January, along with Infantino.

Tom Brady, seven-time Super Bowl champion, is another draw assistant. He is a former golf buddy of Trump's who served as a judge at Trump's Miss USA pageant in 2002, while he was also in Trump's suite during the Club World Cup final this past summer. Brady has previously insisted his closeness to Trump has been “mischaracterized” and stopped short of any political endorsement.

Earlier this year, FIFA took office space at Trump Tower in New York City, despite already having a U.S. office in Miami. “Our success is your success,” Infantino said, while thanking the president's son Eric and the Trump Organization for their support.

At varying times, Trump has had both the Club World Cup and World Cup trophy in the Oval Office. Infantino even gave Trump a little hold of the World Cup trophy in August, explaining that only the FIFA president and presidents of countries who win the trophy can touch it “because it is for winners only, and you are a winner.”

While wearing a baseball cap that read ‘Trump was right about everything,” the U.S. president said: “Can I keep it?…That's a beautiful piece of gold.” At the Club World Cup final in July, Trump joined Infantino to present the trophy to Premier League team Chelsea and then stayed in the middle of the players as they lifted their prize.

In the 1970s, Trump caught his first taste of elite soccer. “Many years ago, when I was young, there was a player named Pelé who played for a team called the Cosmos,” Trump told DAZN in July. “I went to see him play, and he was fantastic. So I may sound old-fashioned, but I'd say Pelé was more than excellent.”

Only last month, Trump hosted a modern day superstar when Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portugal forward, visited the White House on the same day Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman returned to D.C. for the first time in seven years. Ronaldo plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr, which is majority owned by Saudi sovereign wealth fund the Public Investment Fund (PIF).

More recently, Trump's interest in soccer has been more strategic. The World Cup is a sporting event which attracts billions of eyeballs and Trump has always recognized a product which is a ratings hit. More than 20 million Americans now participate in soccer, which is more than the combined participation of flag, tackle, touch and 7-on-7 football.

Like many parents across the U.S., Trump's awareness of soccer has also been stimulated by his children, most notably 19-year-old Barron, who had a soccer goal in the White House garden during Trump's first term. He was once photographed on the White House lawn in an Arsenal jersey. When the former Manchester United player Wayne Rooney played for D.C. United in MLS, Rooney met up with a teenage Barron at the White House to offer advice, with Barron then playing in youth teams for Rooney's club. The former England international then joined Trump on the golf course.

Trump's interest in major sports has not been limited to soccer. In this term, he has attended the Super Bowl, UFC fights, the Daytona 500, the NCAA Wrestling Championships, the Ryder Cup and the U.S. Open men's tennis final. Yet FIFA appears uniquely in thrall to the U.S. president, with Infantino taking more trips to the Oval Office than any world leader since January.

Trump can also claim some responsibility for bringing the World Cup to the United States because he was the president when the U.S., Canada and Mexico jointly won their bid to host the 2026 tournament ahead of Morocco in 2018. Since beginning his second term, he has often repeated this claim in speeches. Certainly, Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, became a key contact in the White House for the bid and helped secure key votes. According to reporting by Vanity Fair, Kushner “directly asked” Prince Mohammed for his nation's support as early as the summer of 2017 during a visit to the country.

Most people might have presumed he would either be re-elected in 2020 for a second consecutive term, or exit presidential politics, rather than returning for a second term in 2025. But Trump is in charge for the World Cup and perhaps Infantino was one of the few people who mitigated for this potential and nurtured the relationship.

After three visits to the White House during Trump's first term, as well as golfing trips and a lunch at Davos, the pair remained in touch even during Trump's period in the relative political wilderness. Then, when Trump was under scrutiny in his first term — such as the week the U.S. Senate introduced ground rules for Trump's impeachment trial — Infantino described Trump as a “competitor…who says what many think.”

After Trump won last November's election, Infantino visited him at Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition. He invited Trump's daughter Ivanka and grandson Theo to make the ceremonial first pick of the FIFA Club World Cup draw last December.

Infantino's relationship with Trump has, at times, irritated his own colleagues in soccer. In May, Infantino arrived hours late for FIFA's congress in Paraguay after he prioritized a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia with Trump. UEFA, the European confederation, accused Infantino of pursuing “private political interests” which “does the game no service”. Infantino subsequently apologised for being late: “I decided to spend the last two days in the Middle East, knowing the 2034 World Cup will be in Saudi Arabia and the 2022 World Cup was in Qatar. The 2025 Club World Cup and 2026 World Cup will be in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Some important World Cup discussions took place and I needed to be there to represent football and all of you. We had an issue with our flight, which made this delay happen — apologies, sorry, and I am looking forward to spending time with you here.” Infantino also joined Trump at a summit in Egypt in October as Trump and world leaders signed a declaration aimed at bringing peace to Gaza.

This all begs the question: why?

The men's World Cup, which drives the vast proportion of FIFA revenues, still required White House assistance on multiple issues, most notably a $625million funding commitment on security which Trump signed off following intensive lobbying by the World Cup host cities. FIFA has also secured a concession because the White House signed off the FIFA Pass, which will allow ticket holders for the World Cup an expedited visa appointment. This is particularly important because wait times for visa appointments remain around a year in several nations who have qualified for the tournament. Trump continues to threaten host cities with relocating games if he does not deem them sufficiently “safe”.

Infantino's position has been made more delicate by relations between Trump, Canada and Mexico, with trade wars and hostile rhetoric bubbling up in his second term. Jesse Marsch, the American coach of Canada's national team, described Trump's comments calling for Canada to be the 51st U.S. state “unsettling and frankly insulting.”

This week, Marsch told The Athletic: “Trump is a polarizing figure and he's very outward about everything he does. I'm respectful of the presidency and I'm respectful of the draw more than anything. This is a big moment for every team that's made it to the World Cup. I'm really hopeful just to have a very clean, uneventful draw where everybody can appreciate the experience of what the World Cup is going to be.”

The Canadians, whose Prime Minister, Mark Carney, will attend the draw, are being diplomatic ahead of the draw. In an interview with The Athletic, sports minister Adam van Koeverden said he was not prepared to speak about “hypotheticals” of what the draw might be like, when asked how he would feel about a MAGA-themed draw. Asked if the U.S. president deserves a FIFA Peace Prize, he said: ‘That's not up to me…it is not my place to say.”

Others are expressing concerns. On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch organized a news conference which included speakers from many of the U.S.'s leading civil society organizations. Jamal Watkins, a vice-President of the NAACP, an American civil rights organization founded in 1909, described the relationship between Infantino and Trump as “too close for comfort.”

He said: “What we're finding is that when Infantino aligns with Donald Trump, then you're sending a signal not only to the United States, but to the world, that all the practices and policies coming out of this administration are OK or justified.”

Jamil Dakwar, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Peace Prize is an “insult to the intelligence” of soccer fans. He questioned the transparency of the award, because FIFA has published no selection criteria. The Athletic this week reported that the FIFA Council and vice presidents had no consultation or awareness of the prize prior to it circulating in a FIFA press release in November. Dakwar said FIFA is at risk of becoming a public relations tool to “normalize an increasingly authoritarian U.S. government.”

FIFA appears to have fewer concerns. One senior FIFA official, speaking anonymously as he was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter, said on Thursday that the Peace Prize “can be bigger than the Nobel Peace Prize.”

“Look at football's reach around the world,” they continued. “And look at the impact it makes to people's lives. Why shouldn't we recognize those that want to help bring peace to a divided world?”

When approached about plans for Trump to speak at the draw, White House spokesman David Ingle told The Athletic: “The United States of America has never been more respected or successful than it is now under President Trump's historic leadership. America is the hottest country in the world right now, which makes us the perfect country to host one of the greatest sporting events in history – the FIFA World Cup 2026.”

ATLANTA (Dec. 5, 2025) – U.S. Soccer today unveiled Never Chase Reality™, its official 2026 World Cup Men's National Team campaign, narrated by Marcello Hernandez. The 90-second film honors the past, challenges expectations, and invites fans to believe in what's possible. Combining insights from fan research and sentiment analysis to reflecting the hope and ambition of the players, Never Chase Reality™ reflects the journey to 26 for the Men's National Team. 

Never Chase Reality™ guides fans through a powerful reimagining of some of the most iconic moments in U.S. Men's National Team history. From Paul Caligiuri's stunning goal in 1989 to help qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 40 years to Tyler Adams' 35-yard screamer that clinched the CONCACAF Nations League title over Mexico, each scene embodies a century-long, unwavering pursuit of greatness and reflects the team's grit and determination to rise above every expectation.

Marcello, a Hispanic actor, comedian, and cast member of Saturday Night Live, whose childhood on the soccer fields of Miami shaped his lifelong connection to the sport, made him the natural choice for the voiceover, embodying the fight and optimism of the national team spirit. Hernandez's involvement helps bridge the worlds of sport and pop culture at a moment when the global spotlight is turning toward the United States. His voice brings humor, heart, and authenticity to a campaign built for a new era of fandom.

“This campaign isn't just about soccer; it's about the American dream. Never chasing reality means ignoring the odds and daring to dream,” said Marcello Hernandez. “I played soccer since I was four years old until college and have been a fan of the Men's and Women's U.S. National Team since I was a kid, so it's an honor to bring my passion and enthusiasm for the game to U.S. soccer.”

Never Chase Reality™ marks U.S. Soccer's largest national campaign to date, launching at a pivotal moment for the sport as the United States prepares to host the FIFA Men's World Cup for the first time since 1994. Designed to reach fans across all 50 states, the campaign will live at the intersection of sport and culture, appearing across broadcast, digital, out-of-home, and fan experiences throughout the year.

The campaign debuted publicly today in New York City's Times Square, where thousands of fans gathered to watch the World Cup Draw and experience the Never Chase Reality™ film on iconic LED screens. The premiere marks one of the largest public-facing launches in Federation history, reinforcing the campaign's role in shaping the national conversation ahead of 2026.

With the FIFA World Cup returning to North America, Never Chase Reality™ is designed to inspire a new generation of fans and unify the country behind the U.S. Men's National Team. The campaign was developed in-house by the new MarComms Department at U.S. Soccer, and captures the relentlessness, fearlessness, and unyielding spirit that defines both players and fans. At its core, it's a story of the relentless pursuit of excellence.

“Soccer has always been about more than what happens on the field, it lives in our communities, in our fans, and in every person who believes in this team,” said Catherine Newman, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer, U.S. Soccer. “The campaign reflects that spirit. It celebrates the resilience of our players and the passion of our fans as we unite behind a common purpose heading into 2026.”

The United States has a new mascot, and it's definitely a good dog.

Ahead of Friday's World Cup draw, U.S. Soccer announced the team's mascot, which is inspired by a Chesapeake Bay retriever. The federation said the choice was made due to the retriever's "bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, and intelligence," adding that it will wear No. 27 to represent the 27 national teams under U.S. Soccer's umbrella.

It's not the first time the U.S. has selected a canine mascot around a home World Cup. The 1994 World Cup, hosted by the United States, was represented by Striker, an earnest and friendly pup designed by the Warner Bros. Animation team. U.S. fans will be hoping the men's national team will embody the new mascot's traits at the 2026 World Cup, which begins June 11.

Barcelona president Joan Laporta has sparked a fresh wave of Real Madrid outrage after declaring that Los Blancos “represent power” while Barca embody “freedom”, intensifying tensions at a time when relations between the clubs have sharply deteriorated. His remarks come amid ongoing clashes between the boardrooms as both sides accuse the other of political and sporting hypocrisy.

Laporta made headlines during a La Vanguardia event on Thursday when he was asked about Real Madrid's VIP box and the political figures frequently seen alongside Los Blancos president Florentino Perez. He responded by framing Madrid as a club aligned with institutional power while presenting Barcelona as the opposite, positioning his side as defenders of democracy, openness and freedom. These remarks immediately reignited tensions that had already grown following Perez's attacks during Real Madrid's General Assembly, particularly relating to the Negreira case.

His comments also came at a moment when both clubs have been moving further apart, especially after Barcelona distanced themselves from the Super League project that once united their leadership with Perez. Supporters and pundits in Madrid reacted angrily to Laporta's claim, interpreting it as an attempt to weaponise historical narratives in the present-day rivalry. The situation adds another layer of controversy to a relationship that, only a few years ago, had been unusually cooperative.

“Real Madrid represents power and Barca, freedom. I don't know if business deals are made in the Bernabeu's VIP box. There is power,” Laporta said at an event. “Here it's a different story; we're more for democracy and freedom. We have a proper and cordial relationship with Florentino Perez.”

“At Barca, we're not even considering any of this. I've been hearing for four years that we'd become a public limited company. We guarantee that Barca will always be owned by its members. It's an added value we have and it connects us with the community.”

Laporta continued: “The investors who Goldman Sachs secured for the stadium liked the fact that we weren't a public limited company. We've created a financial structure to avoid mortgages. We haven't even considered it. It would hurt us a lot because it's part of our very essence. Some people don't see Barca in its entirety.

“Barca isn't a business, it's an institution. We have different rules. We're a modern institution, committed to sustainability, equality, and diversity. We're a Catalan institution, open to the world. All of this leads me to believe that Barca should always belong to its members. My fellow board members and I are the only ones who can guarantee this.

“We want peace and sustainability in football. I came across the Super League and went ahead with it because I thought there were many differences with state-owned clubs. It has dragged on, and all this uncertainty doesn't benefit us. We reached an initial agreement with the Unify platform, but then I found out that Real Madrid were behind it. We should always give peace a chance. It's better if we're all on board. Conflict certainly doesn't benefit anyone.”

Laporta's refusal to privatise Barcelona also aligns with the club's self-identity as a member-owned institution that ties sport to community rather than private capital investment. His framing of Barça as an institution rather than a business is a continuation of its “Mes que un club” ethos, which emphasises cultural responsibility beyond sporting performance

Laporta's remarks are likely to inflame tensions further and may prompt an official or informal response from Real Madrid, who have repeatedly rejected the narrative that they benefit from political power. The already fragile relationship between the clubs, strained by the Negreira case, the Super League split and continuous boardroom sniping, appears set for another confrontational chapter.

As both teams continue their domestic and European campaigns, the off-field ideological battle may prove just as intense as anything on the pitch. Currently, Real Madrid sit behind Barcelona in the Liga standings after their drop in form in November.

Discover how Thomas Müller's nickname “Raumdeuter” reshaped our understanding of modern attacking football and why it still defines his game today.

Thomas Müller has long been one of football's most intriguing attacking players. He does not rely on dazzling dribbles, blistering pace, or the stereotypical flair associated with forwards. Instead, his greatest strength is an almost uncanny ability to appear in the right place at the right moment. 

That rare instinct led to the creation of a nickname that has become synonymous with his style: the Raumdeuter. Now representing the Vancouver Whitecaps, Müller continues to embody this role, and understanding it reveals why his approach has been so influential in modern football.

The term Raumdeuter comes from German, combining “Raum” (space) and “deuten” (to interpret). The result is a concept that roughly translates to “interpreter of space.” The origin of the nickname is well documented:

Müller coined it himself in 2011 when asked to define his role, explaining that he was neither a classic winger nor a traditional No. 10. His answer: “Ich bin ein Raumdeuter” - captured perfectly what observers had been trying to articulate. Rather than fitting into predefined tactical labels, Müller created terminology for his own unique identity on the pitch.

Calling Müller a Raumdeuter reflects how he plays: he reads the game one or two steps ahead of defenders, drifting into pockets of space that others overlook. His movements rarely appear spectacular, yet they are consistently effective. He excels not because of traditional physical attributes but because of timing, awareness, and intuition. This makes him dangerous in advanced positions despite not being the fastest or the flashiest player on the pitch.

He did it so well for Bayern Munich and Germany. Müller's game focuses heavily on off-the-ball intelligence. He identifies where the next opportunity may emerge, positions himself accordingly, and arrives at the decisive moment - often the split second before defenders react. Analysts frequently describe him as a player who “finds space that shouldn't exist,” and this reputation is why coaches at Bayern Munich and with the German national team trusted him in numerous roles: second striker, wide forward, attacking midfielder, or even a hybrid between all three. In every position, the consistent element has been his ability to exploit space, not create it through dribbling.

Unlike a classic No. 10, Müller does not dominate through creativity or intricate passing. Unlike a winger, he does not rely on one-on-one dribbling to beat defenders. Unlike a striker, he is not fixed as the focal point of the attack. Instead, he moves freely between these avenues, reading cues from teammates and opponents to determine where a dangerous gap may open. His interpretation of space effectively becomes a form of playmaking without the ball. It is this unusual blend that makes him such a difficult player to mark.

Tactical analysts often highlight that players with exceptional spatial intelligence are rare, and Müller remains one of the clearest examples in the modern era. Many forwards can score goals; few can consistently destabilise defences through movement alone. The Raumdeuter role therefore, stands apart as a hybrid concept that does not belong to any traditional tactical category.

Now playing for the Vancouver Whitecaps, Müller brings his Raumdeuter instincts to Major League Soccer. Even in a new league, his skill set remains transferable because it relies on reading the game rather than system-specific tactics.

Most of the players on this U.S. men's national team would have acted it out in their backyard, or in a friend's basement, or maybe a youth soccer field: The final minutes of a World Cup final, added time, game tied, scoring the winner to lift the trophy for … the United States!

It is the dream of every young soccer player. Stepping on the field at a World Cup is the pinnacle of what one can do in the sport. But there's a next level up from that into rarefied air.

“For a player, winning the World Cup is the ultimate achievement,” said Lionel Messi, whose own World Cup journey proved how elusive such a feat can be, even for the greatest players in the sport. “There's nothing more after the World Cup. You can't ask for anything more.”

This summer, the U.S. men will take the field at the World Cup with higher expectations than any American team before them. That's due in part to the unprecedented career success of what many dubbed a “golden generation” of players, from Champions League winner Christian Pulisic, to Juventus's Weston McKennie, Marseille's Tim Weah, Bournemouth's Tyler Adams and Crystal Palace's Chris Richards. It's also because that group, now in its prime, will play the tournament at home.

Ultimate success at the 2026 World Cup is a hope those in American soccer have harbored for about a decade.

“In 1994, I think the U.S. was looked at as this emerging frontier in the game, and FIFA wanted to bring the U.S into the world's game,” former U.S. coach Bruce Arena said in 2017, when the USA, Canada and Mexico's United Bid to cohost was launched. “In 2026 we're going to be fully emerged into the game and a big player. I think 2026 will be the time where we're going to start talking about winning a World Cup. It wasn't going to be in 1994, it wasn't going to be in 2010. But 2026 could be our time.”

So, with the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, the question is: Can this U.S. team actually win a World Cup?

The most likely and logical answer, of course, is no. There is a long list of reasons why.

For starters, only eight nations have ever won a men's World Cup, and the U.S. has never come close to looking like it could. The 2002 run to the quarterfinals was thrilling, as was a narrow 1-0 loss to eventual finalist Germany. But the U.S. was fortunate to draw Concacaf rival Mexico in the round of 16. The Americans have never beaten a non-Concacaf opponent in a World Cup knockout match. To win the World Cup this summer, it's likely the U.S. would have to do that five times in a row.

History, simply put, is not on the Americans' side. In 1930, they won one of four groups to reach the semifinals, then promptly lost to Argentina 6-1. In 1934, they lost to Italy 7-1 in their one and only match. In the last home World Cup, the margin was tighter but the result was the same, a 1-0 defeat to Brazil in the 1994 last 16. The U.S.'s World Cup record against European sides in the modern era (1990 and on) is putrid: one win, 12 losses, seven draws and a winless streak that sits at 12 following elimination at the hands of the Netherlands in the 2022 last 16.

But take a closer look at the last few World Cups, and the alternative-reality path to a World Cup win doesn't feel entirely implausible. That glimmer of hope? That's what Mauricio Pochettino and his staff want the team — and its fans — to grasp onto.

“We really believe that we can win it,” Pochettino's top assistant, Jesús Pérez, told the U.S. Soccer podcast. “We know that everything has to be on your side to win it, but it has to be on the other's team's side to win it, as well. … We have to win matches and the most important is to keep always alive the wish and the dream that you can win matches. There are different examples and moments of teams that did it, they made it. And then whatever football takes us, that will be the final result. But we don't want to set any limit.”

So what does “everything on your side” look like for the U.S.? Sometimes it's a matter of being on the right side of some fine margins.

That 3-1 loss to the Netherlands in 2022 was not as close as the scoreline indicated, but you have to wonder what might have happened had Pulisic buried his 1-on-1 look two minutes into the game. That famous 2-1 loss to Belgium in extra time in 2014 has the Chris Wondolowski miss as its sliding doors moment. In 2010, the U.S. had a golden opportunity to make another run, but lost to Ghana in the round of 16 in extra time. A win there would have sent the Americans into a quarterfinal vs. Uruguay. And in 2002, their best run of the modern era, the infamous handball-that-wasn't kept them from a potential win over Germany and a semifinal against South Korea.

For the U.S. in this World Cup, before the advantageous bounces on the field, success would start with a favorable draw on Friday. An easy (relatively speaking) group the U.S. could win would mean a date with a third-place finisher from another group. In an expanded World Cup, winning that first knockout game is the minimum barrier for meeting expectations.

A victory there could put the U.S. on track to face a team like Portugal, Belgium, Spain or Argentina in the round of 16 – all depending on Friday's draw, of course. That's where the belief will either go to a next level and the host nation's aura will grow … or where history will repeat itself.

Nonetheless, there has to be room for that belief. Morocco was a Pot 3 team in 2022 and drawn into a group with Belgium, Canada and Croatia. It not only topped that group, but it went on to beat Spain and Portugal en route to the semifinals. No African team had ever made a World Cup semifinal before. The “impossible” can happen.

So when people ask: ‘Can the U.S. win the World Cup in 2026?' Pochettino would rather another question be posed instead: ‘Why not?'

“For me it's winning, I think if you don't win, what does it matter?” Pochettino said in a recent Fútbol de Primera interview with Andrés Cantor. “I believe we should aspire to win it. Then you (might) tell me, (if you) reach the quarterfinals or semifinals, have a great tournament and due to different factors you can't win — I think we have to give (the team) credit and merit. But if Morocco did what it did in Qatar, they got to where they got because they always had the mentality of saying that ‘I'm going to go for it, I'm going to win it.' They eliminated Spain and eliminated a lot of national teams. That's fundamental, especially playing in our country.

“I believe it's important to think big.”

The Athletic has live coverage of the FIFA Men's 2026 World Cup draw.

The pots and procedures for the 2026 World Cup draw, finalized Tuesday by FIFA, offer the U.S. men's national team a wide range of possibilities.

At one end of the range, the USMNT could get a South American power, a world-class striker and one of only eight all-time World Cup winners.

At the other end, the Americans could meet a non-threatening European side and two of the true minnows in the expanded field of 48.

And then there are many alternatives in between those extremes, paths of varying degrees of difficulty that will play a significant role in determining the legacy of this USMNT.

A difficult group, of course, does not ensure failure. The U.S. emerged in 2002 from meeting hosts South Korea, Portugal and Poland. In 2014, it qualified from a group that included Portugal, Germany and longtime nemesis Ghana.

This time around, though, the U.S. will shoulder enormous expectations. Failing to reach the knockout rounds next summer would be seen as a colossal missed opportunity and a letdown for a team that left Qatar in 2022 with optimism. Plus, as hosts, the Americans are in Pot 1, which means they will avoid international soccer's biggest superpowers, including Spain, Argentina, England and France.

That seeding, however, does not eliminate all possible challenges. The following is a look at some of the best-case and worst-case scenarios, as well as potential groups that might carry intriguing storylines.

Tenorio: Colombia, Norway, UEFA Playoff B

In this scenario, depending which team emerges from the UEFA playoffs, the U.S. would probably go into the group anything but the favorite to top it. Imagine opening up the World Cup against Erling Haaland, the goal-scoring freak motivated by making his World Cup debut. If you don't manage a result there, you have to pivot to play an extremely capable and dangerous Colombia team, and then you close the group against a team like Ukraine, Sweden or Poland. Yuck.

Bushnell: Morocco, Norway, UEFA Playoff A

We agree that Norway is the scariest team in Pot 3. In Pot 2, Colombia is the best, but, in the interest of variety, I'll note that Morocco, a 2022 semifinalist, would be similarly challenging. (So would Croatia, but, as we'll cover below, drawing a European foe from Pot 2 would lessen the likelihood of drawing tough European opposition from Pot 3 or 4.)

In Pot 4, the question is: Which European placeholder is least desirable? As Paul noted, path “B” almost guarantees a difficult matchup. But Italy, the favorite in Playoff A, is probably the best of the lot.

Elo ratings: Colombia (5th), Norway (11th), Denmark (17th)

FIFA rankings: Morocco (11th), Norway (29th), Italy (12th)

Tenorio: Austria, Qatar, New Zealand

This is a mix of weaker opponents and favorable scheduling. The U.S. knows it will start against a team from Pot 3. Opening up the tournament as heavy favorites against Qatar would give the USMNT a chance for a positive result and some momentum. The second game would be manageable against Austria, which is no slouch, but falls somewhere in the lower-middle of the European options. Then, if you need a result in the final group game, it's against a New Zealand team that the U.S. would definitely expect to beat.

Yes, you could hold out hope that you get the weakest-possible European side coming out of a playoff, but, on Dec. 5, you'd be rooting for the weakest teams you can see right now. This is the best-case scenario for the U.S. to win the group.

Bushnell: Austria, Uzbekistan, Cape Verde (or Austria, South Africa, Jordan)

As Paul covers, the thought experiment here is: From which pot do you want your European team? (Each group must have one, so a U.S.-Australia-South Africa-New Zealand pairing isn't possible.)

Fleshed out, the question is: Do you hope for the weakest possible team from Pot 2 (Australia or Iran) and accept the subsequent likelihood of a European playoff team from Pot 4? Or hope for Scotland from Pot 3? Or would it be best to get a European team from Pot 2 because it opens up a path to Jordan, Cape Verde or New Zealand in Pot 4?

Australia, Scotland and Cape Verde or New Zealand is intriguing, but I'll go with the latter and note that drawing any side from the bottom third of Pot 3 — Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa — would be a very favorable outcome for the USMNT.

Elo ratings: Austria (23rd), Qatar (84th), Ghana (80th) — or Iran (33rd), South Africa (77th), Bosnia and Herzegovina (68th)

FIFA rankings: Austria (24th), South Africa (61st), New Zealand (86th) — or Australia (26th), South Africa (61st), Kosovo (80th)

Tenorio: Iran, South Africa, Ukraine

Iran's fraught political history with the U.S. was on display in 2022, when the two nations were drawn into the same group and confronted each other in a must-win group finale. The Americans escaped with a 1-0 victory. President Donald Trump has sparred with South Africa's government, recently protesting a G-20 summit and claiming White South Africans were being racially discriminated against. The U.S., meanwhile, is pushing a peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

Bushnell: Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine

Trump has been at odds with Colombian president Gustavo Petro, one of the few world leaders who has been willing to openly criticize the U.S. president. (Petro recently called Trump a “barbarian” for his military attacks on boats allegedly carrying illicit drugs.) Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has been controversial in geopolitical circles for years but is, for now, enjoying warm relations with Trump, who recently welcomed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House for the first time since the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents. And lastly, for political intrigue, Ukraine is the obvious pick from Pot 4. (The U.S. cannot draw Haiti because they belong to the same confederation, Concacaf.)

Tenorio: Switzerland, Qatar, Ghana

The U.S. got stomped by Switzerland this summer, a game that might have been the ground floor of Pochettino's rebuild. A chance to go at the Swiss again at the World Cup could be seen as a marker of growth. Qatar, meanwhile, beat out the U.S. for the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The U.S.'s history with Ghana at the World Cup is well-documented, with losses in 2006 and 2010 before finally getting a win in 2014.

Bushnell: Morocco, Norway, European minnow

Morocco has now knocked the U.S. out of the U-17 World Cup, the U-20 World Cup and the men's Olympic tournament, all in a span of 16 months. Morocco's bid was also the one that Canada, Mexico and the U.S. beat out to host this 2026 World Cup. A group-stage matchup would be spicy.

From Pot 3, it would be amazing to see Haaland at SoFi Stadium in the U.S. opener. And from Pot 4, I'd love to see a World Cup debutant like Kosovo or Albania.

Tenorio: Korea Republic, Norway, Poland

Games against Korea's Son Heung-min, Norway's Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard and Poland's Robert Lewandowski would deliver the type of major star power you'd expect from a World Cup, even avoiding the powerhouse teams stocked with the biggest names in global soccer.

Bushnell: Colombia, Egypt, Turkey

Luis Díaz has never played at a World Cup. He debuted for Colombia shortly after the 2018 tournament. They then missed out on the 2022 edition. With his prime years waning, 2026 will be his golden opportunity to carry his country on a run.

Egypt, meanwhile, has Mohamed Salah, who is in decline but still talented. Turkey, which beat the U.S. in a June friendly, has two dynamite 20-year-old attackers, Arda Güler and Kenan Yildiz.

Austria, Tunisia, Slovakia

We close with a reminder that, for all the potential excitement detailed above, the most likely scenarios are far more boring. Forget the exact teams listed above; there are dozens of possibilities that would yield the reaction: Hm, OK.

In most of these scenarios, the U.S. will be favored to advance from — though maybe not win — its group. Its legacy will be earned in the knockout rounds.

American Airlines is expanding its flight schedule during next year's FIFA World Cup, helping its customers to travel between host cities during the upcoming tournament in June and July 2026. This includes two new nonstop connections and more flights on existing routes, as well as upgrading to larger    aircraft types.    

This will add around 27,000 additional seats across 12 routes next summer, with tickets for these flights already on sale. The airline has also revealed more opportunities for AAdvantage members to redeem miles for all match tickets at the FIFA World Cup 2026.

 The carrier has unveiled a sweeping expansion of its network during the world's biggest sporting event next summer, adding more routes, flights, and perks for its customers. Between June and July 2026, American will add an extra 27,000 seats on 12 key routes, enabling its customers to travel seamlessly between the US     World Cup host cities during the tournament.

For example, routes like Boston–Dallas/Fort Worth and Atlanta–Miami will be boosted with more frequent flights and larger aircraft, while new service will be added between New York LaGuardia–Kansas and Atlanta-Kansas. The full changes and respective dates are detailed in the table above. Brian Znotins, American's Senior Vice President of Network Planning, commented:

"American is ready with its game plan for the FIFA World Cup 26, adding an extra 27,000 seats on 12 routes this summer. With more flights to all host cities, we're making sure fans don't miss the chance to take part in this once-in-a-lifetime moment across North America."

 AAdvantage members will have more opportunities to redeem miles for match tickets, with early-access windows opening for elite members. Executive Platinum and ConciergeKey members receive the first opportunity to redeem miles on December 17, followed by Gold, Platinum, and Platinum Pro members on December 18. All remaining    AAdvantage members can gain access on December 19.    

This follows a successful first round of ticket redemptions, with American also launching daily sweepstakes offering prizes like match tickets. Members can also purchase miles at up to a 40% discount.

The world's oldest operating airline program offers a lot of benefits to loyal customers. 

 There are expected to be around 5.3 million stadium spectators in the US during next year's FIFA World Cup, along with a further two million in Canada and Mexico. While the tournament is being jointly hosted across the US, Canada, and Mexico, the majority of games (78 of 104) will be held in the US. American Airlines is the official 'North American Airline Supplier' of the FIFA World Cup 2026, so it is set to play a crucial role in delivering connectivity between cities.

The city hosting the most matches is Dallas with nine, while Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York will welcome eight tournament matches. Air travel during the tournament will be strong both domestically and internationally, as, unlike most World Cups in the past, next year involves 16 host cities across three countries. This represents just the second time a tournament has been jointly hosted, after 2002 in Japan and South Korea.

The distances between venues are also greater than ever before, meaning airlines will be benefiting from significant demand. Additionally, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will introduce a new, expanded tournament, increasing the number of teams from 32 to 48 and the total matches played from 64 to 104.

Will FIFA move the games out of the USA with the present problems with qualifing teams not being allowed visas.

More likely that sides like Iran and Haiti, to name a couple, will have group stage games in Canada or Mexico instead. This World Cup is ostensibly a continental affair, but both FIFA and Uncle Sam have made it very clear who the main character of this play is (and has been).

This week, Steve Tignor will reveal his ATP Matches of the Year, and the TENNIS.com editors will reveal our ATP Players of the Year. The WTA editions will begin Monday, December 8.In 2003, the Big 3—Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic—grabbed the men's-tennis torch and proceeded to run with it faster and longer than any elite group of players had before. Finally, in 2025, over the course of a fortnight at Roland Garros, they passed it to a new generation.The tournament began with Nadal waving good-bye to the game in a special ceremony inside his home away from home, Court Philippe Chatrier.Twelve days later, Djokovic walked out of that same arena with a clump of its sacred clay in his hands, and said he may never be back.Two days after that, their young successors, Carlos Alcaraz, 22, and Jannik Sinner, then 23, played their first Grand Slam final. By the time it was over, they had proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were ready to pick up the torch and keep sprinting with it. If this early epic is any indication, they'll be taking tennis fans to places we've never been before.

Between them, they hit 1433 ground strokes. Sinner, the loser, won 193 points; Alcaraz, the winner, won 192. Each broke serve seven times. And each staged one improbable comeback. It ended, after all of that, with Alcaraz raising his game to a place where no one else—Sinner included—could go.“There were a few moments of the match that, I mean, the level was insane,” Alcaraz said.“Best match that I've played in my career in a Grand Slam.”It didn't always look like it would end up that way. For the majority of the first four sets, this final felt less like a classic contest than the coronation of a new multi-surface ATP king. And that king didn't appear to be Alcaraz.

Late in the first set, the Spaniard got clay in his eye. While his vision quickly returned, his game didn't. Sinner raced to a 6-4, 4-1 lead. His serve, his return, his forehand to both corners: They were all sharp. At the same time, Alcaraz was adrift. He chattered angrily with his coaches, unable to land on a successful tactic.“His head's gone a bit AWOL here,” John McEnroe said in the commentary booth.Even when Alcaraz regained his concentration, it didn't seem to matter. The second set ended with the Spaniard belting a forehand crosscourt, only to see Sinner stretch wide and snap back an even better forehand, at a sharper angle. The Italian had now won 20 straight sets at Roland Garros, and needed just one more. After he broke to start the third, it felt like he had a clear path to perfection, and the title. Alcaraz felt the same way.“When he broke my serve at the beginning of the third set, I felt like everything was to his favor,” Alcaraz said. “I felt like everything he's doing was going to be in.”

Sometimes glimpsing the finish line will make a player feel more confident. Just as often, it can make him feel the weight of what he's trying to accomplish. Sinner really only made one mistake early in the third set, but against Alcaraz it was one more than he could afford.Serving at 1-0, up 40-30, he hit a forehand that landed just wide. It was out by an inch, but that was all the defending champion needed. Alcaraz broke, then broke for the set at 5-4. The crowd, which had been waiting for him to come to life, erupted.Sinner had blinked, but he quickly recovered. Just as Alcaraz looked ready to start a comeback, Sinner stole the initiative by going on the attack. At 3-3 in the fourth, he broke Alcaraz at love. Two games later, with Alcaraz serving at 3-5, Sinner reached 0-40, triple championship point.Now it was Alcaraz's turn to find his best when he had to have it. He immediately cut out the errors, and forced Sinner to beat him. Sinner couldn't do it. He missed two forehands and a backhand on his match points, and Alcaraz held. From there, the Spaniard, like a man freed from jail, happily rampaged through a fourth-set tiebreaker, and went up an early break in the fifth.“I just believe all the time,” Alcaraz said. “I never have doubt about myself, even though in those match points down. I thought just one point at a time.”

There was no way he could lose now, right? No way that Sinner, after missing out on those match points, had the strength to mount a comeback.For the first nine games of the fifth, an Alcaraz win looked inevitable. But in an 11th-hour twist, the tables turned again when Alcaraz served for the match at 5-4. Now the Spaniard was tight, and the Italian was loose. Sinner went on the attack, won a point with a seemingly impossible get and winning re-drop, broke for 5-5 and held for 6-5. Considering when it happened, and the gargantuan mental effort it required, it may have been Sinner's most impressive passage of the day.“I tried to delete everything, every set,” Sinner said. “In Grand Slams you try to start from zero again. I was of course disappointed about the fourth set and match points and serving for the match. But again, I stayed there mentally.”Sadly for Sinner, his finest moment would just be a prelude to an even better one for Alcaraz.Down 5-6 in the fifth, Alcaraz fell behind 15-30 when Sinner played an immaculate half-volley from behind his body. On the next point, Sinner fired what looked to be a winning crosscourt forehand, which would have given him two more match points. Somehow, Alcaraz tracked it down, stuck out his racquet, and sliced a forehand that landed on the sideline.

Best match that I've played in my career in a Grand Slam. Carlos Alcaraz

Winning that point sent Alcaraz on his concluding rampage of the day. He hit a backhand pass to hold for 6-6, then won the first seven points of the deciding tiebreaker. Every shot was better than the last, and elicited a louder roar from the Chatrier crowd. He hit a forehand winner, a swing-volley winner, a backhand winner that landed on the sideline, a service winner, and, finally, a running forehand pass for the title.Fittingly, his razor-thin victory ended up securing Alcaraz the No. 1 spot over Sinner at the end of the year. He gained 800 more points than the Italian at Roland Garros, and finished 650 points ahead of him in the final rankings.“The real champions are made in [those] situations, when you deal with that pressure, with that situation in the best way possible,” Alcaraz said. “That's what the real champions have done in their whole careers.”“It's a Grand Slam final. It's no time to be afraid.”After five hours and five sets, Alcaraz reached God mode. But it took Sinner to push him there. That's what rivalries are for. The men's-tennis torch is in safe hands with this one.

The former 14-year NBA star, who suited up for the Hornets from 2020-24, found out like Isaac before him that Tiafoe doesn't go easy for too long.

TECH TALK – Farewell to Sauber    

Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi

Lando Norris led the field in both of Friday's practice sessions for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Lando Norris continued his strong form in a busy second practice session for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, topping the times ahead of Max Verstappen and George Russell.

After he beat his Red Bull rival to first place in FP1 by just 0.008s, Norris extended his advantage in FP2 to 0.363s. This session has the most similar conditions to the upcoming Qualifying hour, putting the Standings leader in a good position to chase down another podium position.

Elsewhere, Ollie Bearman took an impressive P4 for Haas and remarked over the radio: "I don't know how it's so good." Just behind him in fifth and sixth were the Kick Sauber pair, with Nico Hulkenberg leading the charge in the team's final weekend before they adopt the Audi name in 2026.

Oscar Piastri, after sitting out of FP1 for Pato O'Ward, struggled to put a lap together that was good enough for the top 10 – he locked up on his flying lap to end up in P11, just under seven tenths off his team mate's pace.

There was plenty of traffic throughout FP2 as many fought to get the most out of the soft tyres before switching focus to their long-run pace on harder compounds, leaving the order predominantly unchanged in the final quarter of the session.

TECH TALK – Farewell to Sauber    

Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi

Roman Stanek clinched pole position as the final F2 weekend of the year at the Yas Marina Circuit got underway.

Roman Stanek was in flying form at the Yas Marina Circuit, putting in a fine performance to beat Jak Crawford and Invicta Racing team mate Leonardo Fornaroli to pole position.

The Czech driver's 1m 36.836s was good enough to beat Crawford, who was fresh from his FP1 outing with Aston Martin, by just 0.087s.

2025 Champion, and recently announced member of the McLaren Driver Development Programme, Fornaroli had looked on course to beat Stanek on his final lap, but lost time in the last two sectors, before settling for third.

Hitech TGR driver, and Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy prospect, Dino Beganovic was fourth, ahead of PREMA Racing's Sebastian Montoya.

MP Motorsport's Oliver Goethe recovered from losing his fastest time for exceeding track limits, to go up to sixth late on, ahead of ART Grand Prix driver Victor Martins.

AIX Racing's Joshua Duerksen wound up in eighth, in front of the Campos Racing pairing of Nikola Tsolov and Arvid Lindblad, who rounded out the top 10.

This means the 2026 Racing Bulls driver, Lindblad, is set to line up on reverse grid pole in his final Formula 2 Sprint Race, with lights out scheduled for 1615 local time on Saturday afternoon.

Before that gets underway, you can read a full report on the FIA Formula 2 website here.

TECH TALK – Farewell to Sauber    

Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi

George Russell ended Friday's running eager to help Mercedes find improvements overnight, despite finishing in the top three in FP2.

George Russell has admitted that Mercedes have work to do if they want to fight towards the front in Abu Dhabi after a highly competitive day of practice left him anticipating “surprises” in the field.

As the sun set and temperatures dropped at the Yas Marina Circuit, Russell improved from sixth to third between FP1 and FP2, albeit ending up 0.379s away from Lando Norris' pace-setting lap in the later session.

Although the McLaren driver ended the day with a commanding lead, the rest of the pack was separated by extremely small margins, enabling midfield teams to fight alongside the frontrunners and shake up the order.

Ollie Bearman was an impressive fourth for Haas, just 0.039s slower than Russell's best lap, and the Kick Sauber pair of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were within hundredths of the 20-year-old's time in P5 and P6.

The results have left Russell keen to extract more pace as he explained: “It was definitely feeling better this evening. It always tends to feel a bit nicer when you're driving in the dark and the track is a bit cooler.

“I think it's going to be tight in Qualifying, probably between ourselves, Red Bull and Ferrari. There are some other teams who were a bit unexpected as well – Bearman was right up there, and Hulkenberg as well, so we may have some surprises.

"The race pace wasn't great in all honesty. We need to review tonight how we can improve that and see on Sunday.

“It's not easy when you've got that C5 tyre – there's a lot of grip. When it's cool conditions, it's easy for mistakes to happen. My lap was strong and I don't think there was much left in the tank. We were only just P3 so we need to try and find a bit more pace overnight.”

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, his team mate Kimi Antonelli looked much happier in FP1, which was the least representative session of the weekend – taking place earlier in the day, the temperatures were higher than they would be in the all-important Qualifying hour or the race.

The Italian teenager finished the first session in P4, a little over a tenth away from Norris' benchmark. In FP2, he dropped to P10 as the McLaren driver's advantage opened up, leaving Antonelli 0.667s adrift, but less than three tenths behind Russell.

“We started the day pretty well,” he summarised. “I think FP2 didn't really show the pace. The last lap on softs was looking pretty strong, but then I made a mistake in the last corner and lost a lot of time.

“We're there in the mix. Of course, McLaren look a step ahead of everyone but the gaps are very, very close and every little mistake can really punish you. I think the long run was much better in FP2 than FP1 so that was a positive. We've got to keep working in order to improve for tomorrow.

“I felt pretty comfortable with the car. We've been trying quite a lot of stuff in terms of set-up and we're going in the right direction, but there's a lot of work to do.”

TECH TALK – Farewell to Sauber    

Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi

Check out all of the odds for this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, from the race winner to the all-important championship victor.

The 2025 Formula 1 season reaches its conclusion this weekend in exciting style, with three drivers still in contention to clinch the World Championship – but what do the odds say about who might come out on top in Abu Dhabi? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

A three-driver race is on the cards as the 2025 season concludes in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Lando Norris arrives as the championship leader at the Yas Marina Circuit; however, he struggled in the previous two rounds amid a disqualification in Las Vegas and fourth place in Qatar.

Team mate Oscar Piastri, meanwhile, produced his best weekend since Monza last time out. The Australian starts with seven victories in his portfolio this term.

Max Verstappen has already etched his name into the history books with four World Championships, but the Dutchman has the potential to produce one of the greatest comebacks in F1 history this weekend.

He was 104 points adrift of the leader before Monza, but starts this weekend in second place, only 12 points away from Norris. Verstappen is the in-form driver on the grid, boasting nine consecutive podiums between Zandvoort and Lusail with five of those results being victories.

Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli continues his impressive run at the backend of the campaign, producing two podiums in three races. He held onto fourth spot until the 56th lap in Qatar, when an error nudged him off track, giving Norris a gap to pass him. The Italian is showing that he can consistently deliver, and offers value for money for a top-three performance.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc also can't be written off at this venue, having stood on the rostrum in his last three visits to the UAE Capital. In 2024, the Monegasque driver started from 19th on the grid and worked his way through the field to finish third.

Antonelli's senior, George Russell, clocks in for the final round as the only driver on the grid to have finished every race this year. The Briton has joined in the champagne celebrations on nine weekends this term, twice as a winner. He's also remarkably consistent, averaging 4.0 in his past 10 appearances.

One driver who has also found his rhythm is Carlos Sainz. The Williams racer produced his second podium for his new team in Qatar and back-to-back top sixes. While he has an outside shot of making the podium, he's showing the pace of the vehicle and his ability to compete with the top four teams.

Qatar produced another challenging weekend for Lewis Hamilton, as he greeted the stewards outside the top 10. The Ferrari driver appears to lack confidence and cohesion with his pit crew, but despite the hiccups, he's still finished among the top six in nine races this year.

Alex Albon also remains a contender for a top six, despite last achieving the feat in the Netherlands. He's collected five top-six results across the campaign, better than any of his midfield rivals.

Double World Champion Fernando Alonso crossed the line in seventh in the last round, his fourth such result this year. The veteran has only made the top six once all season, but he's constantly knocking on the door.

Red Bull number two Yuki Tsunoda starts the weekend ahead of Albon and Alonso in the betting, but he's only cracked the top six once this year and is a better option for a top 10 outing in the final round. Over in the Racing Bulls pen, Isack Hadjar is worth a look, after finishing as one of the first six cars three times this year.

New Zealander Liam Lawson has found some rhythm in the second half of the year, conjuring up six top-10s in the previous 13 rounds. From youth to experience, Nico Hulkenberg was unlucky in Qatar, just clipping Pierre Gasly and crashing out. That's now his second DNF in five races, but he's captured three top-10s in that period as well.

Speaking of Gasly, the Alpine senior drove well all weekend and showed immense promise until the contact with Hulkenberg. He's registered five top-10s this year, but only one in the previous 10 races.

Another rookie who has excelled late in the year is Haas' Ollie Bearman, but Qatar didn't go according to plan. A disastrous pit stop saw him lose time and accrue a penalty for an unsafe release. He eventually retired from the race, leaving Doha point-less.

On a positive note, the youngster has six top-10s to his name in the past nine appearances. Bearman's team mate Esteban Ocon struggled at Lusail, but he's been reliable of late, posting a 50% top-10 return in four starts.

The Yas Marina Circuit plays host to perhaps the most important Qualifying session of the year this weekend; the driver who has started in pole position in the last 10 races has gone on to win the Grand Prix.

Verstappen and Piastri desperately need a win if they have a shot of leapfrogging Norris for the title. Norris clocked the fastest time on Saturday last year at this venue and proceeded to win the race, and the papaya driver is tied with Verstappen on seven Pirelli Pole Position awards this year.

Piastri trails the duo with six starts from the front row on the grid. The Australian powered to first place on Saturday night in Doha, his first since Zandvoort.

Elsewhere, Russell has proudly captured two poles this year, but both of them were on street circuits or at the minimum hybrid layouts. Leclerc is the only other driver to win the pole position award this year, stopping the clock fastest in Hungary.

Leading into Monza, McLaren had captured 12 wins across the campaign, which aided the Woking outfit in claiming the Teams' Championship at the Singapore Grand Prix. Despite a sensational start to the season, the papaya outfit has faltered in the last 10 rounds, capturing only 20% of the victories.

Mercedes contributed one to the cause, through Russell in Singapore, but other than that, it's been all Red Bull. The Milton-Keynes garage has taken home five team trophies in the last eight races, all thanks to Verstappen. They are also seeking to end their campaign on a hat-trick.

Ferrari have faced a challenging season this year, but we can't ignore their history at this venue, as the squad from Maranello have delivered a podium-performing vehicle since 2021 in Abu Dhabi. Can they finally come right and grab the chequered flag?

Three drivers are in the hunt to secure the 2025 Drivers' Championship this weekend. Norris is in pole position in the standings and only needs to finish on the podium to clinch the title, while finishing fourth or worse will leave his fate in the hands of Verstappen and Piastri.

If Verstappen wants a fifth title, he'll need to seal victory in Abu Dhabi and hope Norris finishes outside of the top three.

Norris' team mate, Piastri, has more ground to make up. The Australian needs to gain 16 points on the leader, which means he can only win the title if he grabs top honours in this race and Norris crosses the line in sixth or worse.

The Jonas Brothers have been a worldwide sensation since exploding onto the music scene nearly 20 years ago. But one place they were not so popular was at their dad's church. “The Voice” coach and season 28 advisor Nick Jonas told People on December 4, 2025, that their dad lost his job as a pastor because Nick and his brothers, Kevin and Joe, weren't exclusively singing religious music. 

Nick, Kevin, and Joe released their first album in 2006, but when it didn't take off, their record label dropped them. They didn't taste success until the following year, when they signed with Hollywood Records and released the album that featured hits like “S.O.S.” and “When You Look Me in the Eyes.”

In the meantime, failure was not an option, Nick said, recalling how their dad, Kevin Jonas Sr., managed their fledgling band as a side hustle while serving as a pastor at Wyckoff Assembly of God in New Jersey. 

“I definitely felt a lot of pressure,” Nick told People. “Our lives had changed so much. Our father also lost his job effectively because we weren't making solely Christian music and he was a pastor. So our shift to singing about love and romance and heartbreak caused that to happen.”

“Financially, we were in a really vulnerable position and we'd spent all this money that we kind of didn't have,” Nick said, adding, “It was bad. We either had to succeed or we had to shift and figure our stuff out.”

This isn't the first time the Jonas Brothers have discussed what happened to their dad. In their 2019 “Chasing Happiness” documentary, Kevin recalled, “We were signed to a secular label, and we weren't making a Christian album. There was this perception that was on us that we were supposed to be these squeaky clean, perfect kids. Dad's job essentially hinged on it.” 

Jonas Sr. was essentially forced out of his position, stating in the documentary, “The day I resigned at Wyckoff Assembly of God, it was really devastating. I couldn't even read my resignation letter.” 

According to two “former leaders” at Wyckoff Assembly who spoke with TriStateValley.com in 2019, the church board “had concerns about Pastor Jonas managing the band and serving as senior pastor, among other concerns.” The congregation split over the issue, with some people supporting Jonas Sr. and others demanding he resign, the outlet reported.

The family, which includes fourth brother Frankie, relocated to Los Angeles in hopes of finding a new record label and opportunities. Kevin told People that their 2007 “Jonas Brothers” album reflects the hard times they went through before finding success. 

“The fact that these songs were written in those desperate moments and then we kind of found our voice, I think, was really special,” Kevin told the outlet. 

Nick added, “There's some really big themes in here about tough times and even just a sense, an urgency, in the lyrics and in the music that I'm really proud of.”

A biopic that skips along the surface of its subject, deriving cliched psychological insight from its traumatized source, The Chronology Of Water sees Kristen Stewart liquify Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir into a expressionistic slurry. In her feature debut as writer-director, Stewart takes explicit pains to explicitly render Yuknavitch's pain on screen, drenching the swimmer-turned-writer's life—spanning childhood abuse, young-adult hedonism, and professional success—in over-styled and overindulgent imagery. Despite its relative formal boldness, The Chronology Of Water is as ineffectively elliptical and muttery as Stewart's first short film, the similarly aquatic “Come Swim.”

In a shorter or more complex character study, that opaque aesthetic approach could bring the audience into its subject's world, or translate a chaotic headful of emotions and coping mechanisms into a blast of elemental feeling. But The Chronology Of Water is two hours of simplistic, one-to-one, cause-and-effect personal history, disguised by its shifting shape. For each adolescent horror experienced by Lidia (Imogen Poots)—mostly at the hands of her sexually abusive father (Michael Epp)—there is a direct corollary to come later in her life. Even though Stewart's film is more focused on evoking sensation than making sense, miring Lidia's life in the various liquids of blood, piss, cum, and water (the latter from swimming pools, choppy seas, and tear ducts) never clarifies the woman underneath all the muck.

It's easy to glean the broad strokes. Lidia finds an escape route away from her predatory dad and alcoholic mom in swimming, which earns her an athletic scholarship to a school out of town and sparks her bisexual awakening in a quiet corner of the locker room. Once at college, Lidia's painful early life manifests in rebellion—Stewart relays this, as she relays almost everything in the film, through fractured quick cuts of warm-hued close-ups. These relentless, repetitive, interchangeable sequences of pain, sex, and substance abuse border on masturbatory even when Lidia isn't literally rubbing one out. As the film nears her career as an author, and continues quoting at length from Yuknavitch's prose (when it's not listening to Poots recite passages at readings), its reverence for its source becomes hard to ignore.

The literary voiceover from Poots, mumbled and under-mixed, evokes some of Stewart's most mannered performances, like her skittish oddball in Crimes Of The Future. But that's not Lidia. Lidia is straightforward and blunt and intense, Poots' glare as steady as her gait is wobbly. She harangues and lashes out, pushing her romantic partners around just as she was pushed around. It's all as basic and blunt as the film's juxtaposition of her being spanked as a child and her future dalliance with BDSM. Lidia's anger tries to guide The Chronology Of Water through its stupor, though this only breaks up the abstract haze with moments of too-stiff clarity, like a bleary-eyed boozer trying to oversell their sobriety when questioned.

These more straightforward sections ramp up around the film's midpoint, when Lidia makes her way to the University of Oregon as a member of a writing class led by Ken Kesey (a goofily fried Jim Belushi), contributing to the collaborative novel Caverns. But Kesey's pluckish debauchery never quite proves a counterpoint to the self-destruction clouding Lidia's burgeoning abilities as a writer. Similarly, Poots' subtle wariness around him, emphasized by the camera's shifting glance, is overrun by his recognizability—industry namedropping and diegetic admiration take precedence over more uncomfortable personal complexities. Despite this and other intimate connections (like a few love affairs with passive men and bold women), Stewart's film blurs its subject, showing how, at such zoomed-in extremes, a close-up is as impersonal as a body observed at a distance.

It's an initially striking effect, but its impact is shallow. After a few hours of this familiar fragmented suffering, never adding up to anything as punishingly breathless as If I Had Legs I'd Kick You or as personality-driven as Sorry, Baby, The Chronology Of Water is simply wearying. As Lidia hurtles forward on the warpath with impending normalcy, there's little lasting sense of the harrowing trials she's survived or the provocative ways in which she's shared them with readers. Stewart applies an admirably experimental vision to her adaptation, but she can't translate whatever power she may have found in Yuknavitch's text to the screen.

The truth behind Jay-Z and sister-in-law Solange Knowles' infamous elevator fight has been revealed.

Fashion designer Oscar G. Lopez, who made Rachel Roy's 2014 Met Gala gown, claims Jay-Z complimented Roy's dress at the event, which upset wife Beyoncé Knowles' sister.

“I think that Jay-Z complimented [Roy] about the gown, and Beyoncé's sister felt that it was not proper, so it was a kind of drama there,” Lopez, 52, told the Daily Mail on Thursday.

Surveillance footage from inside an elevator at New York City's Standard Hotel — which showed Solange lunging at, swinging at and kicking Jay-Z following an afterparty at the Boom Boom Room — leaked and immediately went viral.

Page Six previously reported that Solange was drunk and had gotten into an argument with Roy upon arriving at the hotel, though our sources did not say what the disagreement might've been about.

The ordeal dominated headlines at the time, which put more eyeballs on the black lace dress Lopez had designed for Roy.

“The dress was all over the news. That was so funny,” he recalled, arguing that “any press is good press.”

Lopez described Roy, who has long been rumored to have been Jay-Z's mistress, as a “sweetheart.”

He shared that she ran “late” to the annual gala that year and actually missed the red carpet, “so she couldn't take pictures.”

Therefore, his design didn't get much attention — until fists started flying later that night.

Regarding speculation that Jay-Z had an affair with Roy, Lopez dismissed it as “silly.”

“Remember that Rachel Roy was married to Damon [Dash, who] used to work together with Jay-Z,” he said.

Roy interned at Rocawear, the fashion label started by Jay-Z and Dash, before working her way up to creative director of the women's and children's lines.

Jay-Z, 56, and Beyoncé, 44, have both alluded to his past dalliance in their music. And while the woman's identity has never been confirmed, Roy, 51, did herself no favors when she made a cheeky reference to the scandal in a poorly timed Instagram post.

In 2016, Beyoncé referred to her husband's mistress as “Becky with the good hair” in her song “Sorry.” Within hours of its release, Roy captioned an upload in part, “Good hair don't care.”

She later insisted her message had been “misunderstood.”

The following year, Jay-Z confessed in his song “Family Feud” to cheating on Beyoncé with “Becky” and asked her to “leave [him] alone.”

As for Jay-Z and Solange, they released a joint statement shortly after their altercation, saying they had “apologized to each other” and “moved forward as a united family.”

Kristen Stewart is beating the chill.

Well, at least she's attempting to in her own way.

Though the 35-year-old actress opted for long underwear at the IndieWire Honors Winter Film Awards on Thursday night, she seemed to have forgotten the clothing one normally layers on top.

Practically speaking, we're not sure whether her take on the après-ski look was actually warm at all.

Stewart dressed up the long johns with a black blazer and a pair of pointed-toe pumps.

Calvin Klein designed the head-to-toe look. The see-through long underwear was spotted during the brand's spring 2026 runway presentation, styled with a draped V-neck top.

To accessorize, Stewart layered two diamond tennis necklaces from Fiametta and wore a set of lightly tinted sunglasses. She pulled her hair back into a messy knot, revealing a new undercut style.

Stewart is very comfortable wearing sheer outfits on the red carpet. A month ago, she chose a second-skin lace Rhea Costa dress with matching leggings. And this past summer in Cannes, she wore a pair of Chanel tweed shorts and a short-sleeved jacket, going shirtless underneath. She topped the look with an ethereal sheer tulle skirt.

The actress was honored at the event with the Maverick Award, having made her recent directorial debut with “The Chronology of Water.”

“There's certain programming, ideas that seep into your body, that do debilitate you and create insecurities that take a long time to get over,”  Stewart shared with IndieWire. “I love acting, but it is crushing. It's like fitting yourself into someone else's perspective in the most pure way. It's a huge responsibility, and then that performance lives in another's art.”

	David Porter remembered his longtime Stax Records compatriot Steve Cropper as “a true member of a creative musical family that changed the world of music” in a tribute shared with Rolling Stone.


	Cropper, who died earlier this week at the age of 84, helped craft the “Memphis soul” sound as a guitarist of Booker T. & the M.G.'s, who scored hits of their own while also serving as the house band for Stax during the label's hit-making prime. Porter, meanwhile, was one of Stax's go-to songwriters, penning many hits that Cropper helped bring to life, including Sam & Dave's “Soul Man.”


	In his tribute, Porter identified Cropper as one of the six people who served as the “cornerstone of what made Stax consistent and unique,” along with himself, organ player and bandleader Booker T. Jones, drummer Al Jackson, bassist Donald “Duck” Dunn, and songwriter-turned-superstar Isaac Hayes. “The musical unity meant that each person knew their role and lived up to it 24-seven,” Porter said.

	











	The songwriter praised Cropper's special ability ”to cement the musical pocket, with his own special flavor coming from him every song, every artist, every day.” Porter continued: “He took pride in finding a musical personality that turned that song into its own identity. That was his Soul. He played his magic in the six members creating Soulsville USA, the Memphis Sound. He will forever live on.”

	Cropper's contributions to rock and soul history are massive. Along with “Soul Man,” he played on Booker T. & the M.G.'s “Green Onions,” Wilson Pickett's “In the Midnight Hour,” and Otis Redding's “(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.” Cropper also served as a co-writer on those latter three hits. 

	











	After his time at Stax, Cropper relocated to Los Angeles, where he enjoyed a lengthy career as a go-to session musician. He played with John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell, Rod Stewart, and the Blues Brothers (he appeared on John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd's 1980 comedy film, too). Cropper also worked as a producer, helming albums by the Jeff Beck Group, John Prine, Poco, and John Mellencamp.

Miley Cyrus is not a fan of paper.

The “Hannah Montana” alum detailed her serious “phobia” on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Thursday evening, admitting she “need[s] help.”

The singer introduced the topic by telling viewers about her “qualm with Christmas” — her fear of wrapping paper.

The former Disney Channel star, 33, clarified that the note card on Jimmy Kimmel's desk also made her “want to vomit,” and his book was “giving [her] hell.”

Cyrus repeatedly gagged as she struggled to describe another “real problem [she has] with paper” — people with “dry hands [who] touch” it.

She admitted to throwing away “lovely letters” without opening them because she can't stand stationery, noting that she prefers to be reached by text, email or phone call instead.

While rolling papers are “fine” and tablets have “solved a lot of [reading] problems” for the singer, she railed against Amazon packages.

She explained that cardboard is “extra dry” and has more “packaging in it,” joking that she recently got engaged to Maxx Morando because her fiancé opens all deliveries outside their home.

When Kimmel, 58, asked whether Cyrus would be able to sign her marriage certificate, she reflected on her first time tying the knot to ex-husband Liam Hemsworth.

“I think I remember the paper is wax, but I had smoked one of those imaginary joints. I can't really remember,” she said of the 2018 wedding ceremony. “I'm not sure.”

The Grammy winner added that she is “working on” her aversion but does “need help” since it is “getting worse.”

Cyrus admitted, “There does need to be some sort of intervention, and I am gonna look into … maybe EDMR [or]  getting hypnotized because it is affecting [her] everyday life.”

The actress previously used EDMR, which is Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, to combat her stage fright, she told the New York Times over the summer.

“It's so weird because it's like watching a movie in your mind, but it's different than dreaming,” she said in July. “You're kind of more in yourself but still in another place of consciousness that's kind of hard to describe unless you've been in that hypnotic state.”

At the time, Cyrus gushed that she “love[d]” the sessions and they “saved [her] life.”

	In one form or another, John Sebastian knows you remember his songs. He knows that if you're of a certain age, you recall “Do You Believe in Magic” and “Summer in the City” with his band the Lovin' Spoonful, or “Welcome Back,” the theme song to Welcome Back, Kotter, the John Travolta-led sitcom of the Seventies. He knows you may recognize “Welcome Back” as a post-pandemic song used in ads by Applebee's, Major League Baseball, and more, or recall how it was sampled in Mase's rap single of the same name. Or maybe you've heard MonaLisa Twins' indie-pop remake of “Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?”


	But Sebastian is also well aware of the sometimes painful fact that not enough people may know the name John Sebastian. “I'm sort of, how would you say … I'm the opposite of the guys who have all the different awards,” Sebastian, 81, tells Rolling Stone from his home in Woodstock, New York.


	Unlike many of his peers from the Sixties, Sebastian has never written what he calls “a fucking memoir,” which could be one reason his name doesn't always ring a bell, even to his generation. But he did decide to sit down for interviews for I'll Paint Rainbows All Over Your Blues, a just-completed Sebastian documentary by directors Todd Kwait and Chris Andersen that revisits the highs (sometimes literally) and lows (the notorious Spoonful drug bust) of his life and career. “I guess my reaction was just glad to have somebody interested,” Sebastian says about cooperating.

	











	As the doc proves, Sebastian's career has been a particularly quirky one. The son of a classical harmonica player and radio actress and writer, Sebastian cut his teeth as an accompanist in the early Sixties New York folk scene — befriending Bob Dylan and many others along the way — and then co-founded the Lovin' Spoonful. After the group collapsed, Sebastian became a symbol of the Woodstock generation thanks to his semi-stoned appearance at that festival and in the accompanying movie. Since then, he's returned to the mainstream occasionally (that Kotter song) but has largely stuck with the American roots music that was also his own roots, touring and playing with the likes of the late Chuck Berry pianist Johnnie Johnson.

	Featuring interview with peers like Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Arlo Guthrie, Michelle Phillips, and Spoonful bassist Steve Boone, I'll Paint Rainbows All Over Your Blues does, in its way, explore some of the obstacles Sebastian faced. In conversation and in the film, he exudes the same beatific, genial, and bespectacled vibe he exhibited dating back to the Spoonful days; then and now, he's never been an archetypal wild-and-crazy rocker. Film footage of Sebastian with his father is a reminder that Sebastian also didn't quite have the requisite angst required by many rock stars of his generation. “I'm looking at old home movies of my dad getting off the plane and hugging and kissing me, and I said, ‘This is why I'll never be Bruce Springsteen,'” he says. “That whole route was not for me. My father loved me, like an Italian father.”


	Sebastian's last-minute performance at Woodstock also branded him, for better or eventually worse, as a tie-dyed troubadour of his time, although he says he wasn't as stoned as the legend has it. “As time goes on, it's an inclination for people to make me higher than I was,” he says. “As a New York guy, I didn't just start taking things I didn't know about. However, if you put me in mud for a few days and go, ‘Well, this isn't LSD, more like DMT,' I would've said, ‘Yeah, I'll see what it can do.' That was before anybody told me this would be a good idea to get up and play in front of a few hundred thousand people.” (Many years later, Sebastian says, he was approached about a career as a kids folk singer along the lines of Raffi: “I said, ‘Guys, I smoke dope, and I'm not going to look like I hide it.' I think that was good, because it only took about 10 minutes for them to figure out I wasn't their guy.”)

	Then, as the film chronicles, came the idiosyncratic career choices, starting with the way he followed up his Woodstock appearance with albums like The Four of Us, which was centered around a side-long suite (prog folk?) recounting a cross-country trip with his wife, Katherine, and two friends. “I can only say I was madly in love,” he says now, “and it permitted me to get pretty goofy sometimes.” At a point where “nobody wanted me” after his post-Spoonful albums didn't sell, Sebastian was asked to write the theme song for a sitcom about urban toughs in high school called Kotter. The producers loved “Welcome Back” so much that the name of the show was changed to include that phrase. (Sebastian currently lives in the house he purchased with that money.)

	











	Throughout the documentary, Sebastian also brings up what he calls the “Spoonful curse,” which manifested itself in many ways. He maintains that the band, which hopscotched around pop, jug band music, blues, country, and folk, was ahead of its time. “Our timing as a band was somewhat peculiar,” he says. “When we were doing what we were doing, nobody got it. When we were no longer a band, all of a sudden, about eight years later, people are saying, ‘Hey, this is like Americana!'”


	Anyone who saw One-Trick Pony, the offbeat 1980 Paul Simon film about a fictional rock star, might have caught a glimpse of a reunited Spoonful. But in another instance of bad luck, Sebastian says that what we didn't see was an entire rehearsal of the temporary reformed band. “We're doing a rehearsal, and the Spoonful clicked in, like, wow,” he says. “We hadn't played in eight or 10 years. Nothing wrong. Finished the whole set. And we said, ‘Boy, that's, great. Were you filming?' And they go, ‘Well, we had to save film.'”  


	Then came that day in 1966 when Boone and lead guitarist and cutup Zal Yanovsky were busted for weed in San Francisco. With the Canadian Yanovsky facing deportation, which would also mean the end of the Spoonful, the two agreed to take an undercover cop around and introduce them to friends, in the hopes the cop would make a bust. As a result of those machinations, Boone and the late Yanovsky (who are both seen in the doc discussing the bust) got off. 


	But word of the incident made its way to the underground press, which branded the band as informers and even (in one alt-newspaper ad) instructed women not to sleep with them. “I was not even in the town where my bandmates and brothers got busted,” says Sebastian, who was in Los Angeles at the time of the arrests. “And then the next thing that happened was in San Francisco, everybody was so anxious to have a virtue-signaling thing. Nobody ever managed to say, ‘Oh, so, these two guys were in San Francisco, and those two other guys were in Los Angeles, so we only promise to not fuck half of the Spoonful?'”


	As Sebastian tells RS, with evident melancholy, “I still am suffering the results of those decisions made way back when. That was the thing you couldn't erase.”


	Due to the arrests, Sebastian says the Spoonful were not invited to play the monumental Monterey Pop festival in 1967, despite his friendship with festival co-organizer John Phillips and his band, the Mamas and the Papas. “We were the best friends of John, Michelle, and Cass [Elliot],” he says, “but they knew, and we knew, that they couldn't invite us” thanks to the band's tattered reputation. (In the second issue of Rolling Stone, Ralph J. Gleason wrote a sympathetic rebuttal to the backlash, calling the episode a “terrible, tragic thing”: “If what Zal and Steve did was a sin, then it is our sin too. They are victims, just as the man who was fingered is a victim. Just as we are all victims.”

	











	In one way, at least, the Spoonful were ahead of their time. A version of the band still exists and tours, with only one founding member (Boone) involved, paving the way for many classic-rock bands to follow. Sebastian says he relinquished any ownership to the Spoonful name when he left, which he sees now as a mixed blessing. “It could have helped me financially,” he says, “but I guess I didn't attach much value to what would be the enormous nostalgia market for all of our contemporary bands.” (He says he's seen the current Spoonful and that they're “very good,” although he has tweaked them for not fully re-creating the finger-picking guitar weave that he and Yanovsky perfected.)

	Two years ago, Sebastian did sell his publishing (from his Spoonful songs to solo tunes) for an undisclosed sum to the independent music publishing company AMR Songs. Unlike many of his peers, Sebastian is frank about the reasons why he made the deal. “I had to sell it,” he says, “because when you do the math and find out you couldn't make that money in a year working every day times eight, you start to go, ‘Jesus, I guess I should be thinking about my family here.' It isn't a great move, because as time goes on, everything is just skyrocketing in the world of monetizing the arts. But it's a decent move.” Last year, the jacket he wore onstage at Woodstock sold at a rock memorabilia auction for $64,000.


	Now that he's finally laid out his life on film, what does Sebastian hope people will take from I'll Paint Rainbows All Over Your Blues? “I really don't know,” he shrugs. “Except to say this guy was there. Some of you noticed. Some didn't. But here he is.”

	When Pink Floyd‘s Wish You Were Here tour touched down at the Los Angeles Sports Arena for a run of five shows in April 1975, chaos erupted outside the venue each night thanks to the heavy-handed tactics of the LAPD. A front-page article in the April 26, 1975, issue of the Los Angeles Times reveals that 350 fans were arrested at the first three shows. “Police said 85% of the arrests were for possessions of marijuana,” reads the article. “Other arrests were made for possession of dangerous drugs, liquor-related offenses, ticket scalping, and interfering with an officer during the course of an arrest. Most of the arrests involved juveniles under the age of 18.”


	In the midst of all this chaos, few took notice of Jim Reinstein pushing his buddy Mike Millard up to the entrance of the arena in a wheelchair. “The sheriff at the time was a total redneck, totally anti-hippie,” Reinstein says today. “There was this gauntlet of security, and there were guys that got busted with two joints. But we got in.”

	











	Once they entered the main concourse, Reinstein wheeled Millard into a bathroom stall where he removed a phonebook-sized Nakamichi 550 tape recorder he hid beneath his wheelchair seat, along with batteries and a pair of AKG 451E microphones he stashed in a bag under a stack of clothes. “He would say, ‘Hey, I get digestive problems, and I need a change of clothes,'” says Reinstein. “He had a pair of boxer shorts on top, and then security wouldn't look past that once they saw it was underwear.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It wasn't a completely ethical scheme considering Millard didn't actually need a wheelchair, and they were in gross violation of venue policy (not to mention the law) by sneaking in a recorder to tape the show. But Millard and Reinstein pulled off a historic feat that night by creating, by far, the most pristine recording of any show on Pink Floyd's 29-date Wish You Were Here tour. The tape has been cherished by Floyd fans for decades, and Sony — who bought the band's catalog in 2024 — is including it on the upcoming Wish You Were Here 50th anniversary box set. (In a stunning lack of forward vision, Pink Floyd didn't properly record any shows on the Wish You Were Here or Dark Side of the Moon tours.)

	Tragically, Millard died by suicide in 1994, and didn't live to witness his ascent to a Mount Rushmore figure in the world of concept taping: along with the Floyd recordings, he taped roughly 350 other shows around Los Angeles between 1973 and the early 1990s. “He would be ecstatic,” says Reinstein. “It gives his work a stamp of approval. It's no longer a bootleg. It's legitimate.”


	WHEN REINSTEIN FIRST LAID EYES on Millard, he was tying microphones to a rail at the Long Beach Arena. It was March 19, 1974, and they'd both arrived early to see Yes on the Tales From Topographic Oceans tour. “I was really into photography and sound,” he says. “So I was like, ‘I got to talk to this guy.' It turned out he lived in Fullerton at his mom's house. I was in Placentia at the time, which is like five miles away. And he had a buddy with him filming the show in 8-millimeter. We met up afterwards at Mike's rumpus room, the three of us, and synced up the footage to the recording. We became fast friends doing that.”


	They couldn't have been in a better time and place. L.A. was the epicenter of the rock universe in America, and it was a peak moment for groups like Genesis, Yes, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd that they both revered. Every single major touring act came through town at least once per tour, often playing multiple shows. Millard and Reinstein spent every dime they had on tickets, and they refused to experience each concert only a single time.


	“They wanted to bring that show home in the same way that if your parents went to Hawaii in the 1980s, they brought slides back and leis and whatever,” says Erik Flannigan, a writer and musical archivist who wrote the notes in the Wish You Were Here box set. “For these guys, this was their vacation. That was their thing they wanted to re-experience. Mike was like, ‘How can I take that to the highest level? How can I make the highest quality recordings of these things that I love?'”

	In the early days, it was easy since venues like the Long Beach Arena didn't flinch when Millard walked in with mics and a TC-153SD portable cassette recorder. But once record stores started selling bootlegs pressed onto vinyl by shady underground labels — a practice Millard abhorred — venue staff started to hunt for tapers, especially at the Forum and the L.A. Sports Arena, where many of their favorite bands played.


	No band was more anti-bootleg than Led Zeppelin. Manager Peter Grant and his minions would scan the crowd looking for tapers. Violators would be ejected, and not always in gentle ways. And so when Zeppelin came to the Forum in March 1975, Millard got creative. “Mike dug his dad's wheelchair out of his garage,” says Millard. “We stuffed the recorder into the seat cushion. And in the bathroom of the arena, I'd wire him from head-to-toe, with two microphones sticking out of his hat. The wires went down his shirt, through his pants, down to his boots.” 


	When they arrived at their row, Millard would gingerly stand up, fold the wheelchair, and slowly walk to his seat, pretending he had mobility issues. At this point, the recorder was in a large yellow bag he placed at his feet. It was then just a matter of connecting the wires, hitting record, keeping the mics hidden in his hat, and hoping security didn't notice the ends sticking out. “At the beginning of the night, he would say to nearby fans, ‘Here's my name and number. If you're quiet, I'll give you a copy of the recording.'” says Reinstein. “And out of over 350 shows, I think only one person did that.”


	At the Zeppelin show, Millard dared to do this from the very front row. “You look off to the side, and here's Peter Grant, this big hulking menace,” says Reinstein. “We knew if we were caught, we'd be beaten to a pulp.”


	They landed in the front row since tickets were distributed back then through a mail-in system that they figured out how to game. “Mail-in was code for total corruption,” says Reinstein with a laugh. “We knew a guy at Al Brooks [ticket company] who worked out of the Roosevelt Hotel in downtown L.A. They'd have seats in every section. We'd have our choice.”


	After testing multiple spots, they determined the best spot for recording was about five rows back. “We became very picky,” says Reinstein. “To us, the 10th row was way back. But we sat in the 16th row for Pink Floyd because we heard that they were using quadrophonic sound at the show. They had a stack of PA speakers in each corner, so we wanted to sit a little back and hopefully pick up more of that.”

	











	After a few glorious years of utilizing the wheelchair system, venues finally caught onto their act and flagged their gear at the door. Fortunately, a handful of security guards were willing to open up a side door and let them in — for the right price. “We just bribed them,” says Reinstein. “That got us in, but we still couldn't get caught during the show.”


	They also feared getting caught leaving the venue. To avoid that, Millard would subtly pass the tape into Reinstein's hand the moment the show ended. “As soon as the lights came back up, I would go one way, he would go another way,” says Reinstein. “I was an expert at going through the crowd and making my way to the car.”


	It meant the tape would get out of the house even if Millard was caught with the recording gear. “You get a rush out of it,” says Reinstein. “And our reward at the end was a chest in the back of his car with Heinekens on ice. So, we would get to the car, plug in the headphones, crack open a couple of beers, listen to the show, and go, ‘Cheers. We did it.'”


	Unlike most tapers of his era, Millard had no interest in profiting from his recordings. This was purely a hobby. And when making copies for friends, he'd insert a brief audio-drop at a set point that he'd carefully log in his records. It meant that if one of his tapes wound up as the source of a commercial bootleg, he'd know exactly who leaked it.


	“What often goes lost is that Mike had an eclectic taste in music,” says Flannigan. “Yes, he made great tapes of Led Zeppelin. But he also made great tapes of Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Joni Mitchell, and the Pretenders. He's famous for the big hard-rock shows, but the most exceptional tape I've heard of is is a Chick Corea tape. Also, people wonder why he didn't tape Pink Floyd in 1980 or Anaheim Stadium in 1977. Why didn't he tape the Stones in 1981? It's because he couldn't get the seats he wanted. If he couldn't get the seat, he wouldn't do it. It makes his hit rate extremely high.”


	The details remain a little blurry today, but Millard took a five-year break after getting busted by security in 1983. By the time he started taping again in 1988, Reinstein had moved on with his life. “I had to give up the rock and roll lifestyle, because it's not…to give you the G-rated version, I just had to get out of that or else I'd be dead in a few years,” he says. “I got married in 1986. Mike came to the wedding, and he sometimes came over to a barbecue or whatever at my house. But we stopped seeing shows together.”

	











	For the entire time that Reinstein knew him, Millard worked in the audio/visual department at Mt. San Antonio College. “I remember him saying once that if things didn't work out with his job that he'd rather kill himself than live on the street,” says Reinstein. “I just dismissed it at the time, but I guess in hindsight that was always an option for him.”


	By 1994, Millard was battling depressing, self-medicating with cocaine, and trying to get back to work after living off disability for a period. “He was in a lot of duress,” says Reinstein. “I guess his boss didn't like him. He actually tried suicide a few months before and he wasn't successful.” Later that year, he died by jumping off a building. 


	For years, the Millard's tape archive sat in a closet at his mother's house, gathering dust. The vast majority of it had never been heard by anyone outside of his very tiny circle of friends. “I'd go over for dinner sometimes, but I didn't want to ask her about them even through, in a sense, those tapes were half-mine since we were 50-50 partners,” Reinstein says. “And I took photos at the shows and would give him whatever he wanted. But our mutual friend befriended his mom and she gave him the tapes. We've released about 250 of them on [BitTorrent sites] Dimeadozen and Trader's Den, even though some were so old they had to pull the spool out and re-shell them.”


	Once they started to spread through the BitTorrent community and eventually make their way to YouTube, Mike “The Mic” Millard tapes become shorthand for supreme high quality.  And as always, nobody made a dime from them. 


	It may be hard to imagine that a cassette recorded by a fan with microphones sticking out of his hat is better than anything in the Pink Floyd vault from 1975. But the band simply didn't see the value in recording shows back then. “Recording multi-track in the Seventies was a onerous, heavy, expensive, complicated thing to do,” says Flannigan. “You had to have a mobile truck because you needed not one, but two multi-track decks. If you only had one and you're flipping the reel, you're missing some of the show. So, having two 16-track decks, the power it took to do that, the temperature control, all these other things… It's a lot of money for someone to spend without necessarily knowing what you were ever going to do with it.”


	It was much cheaper and easier to create a mono or two-track soundboard recording from the venue's mixing console. “It feels like just common sense to us that every artist would have someone record every show at least as a soundboard,” says Flannigan. “But, again, to what end? And most of the soundboard recordings that exist came from then. It's the sound engineers who kept them, not the band.”

	











	A great audience tape is usually superior to a standard soundboard since it captures the sound of the room. That's what Porcupine Tree's Steve Wilson — who enjoys a very successful side career as an audio remixer of classic albums — discovered when he was given Millard's tape to remix for the Wish You Were Here set. 


	“You still have all the hallmarks of a bootleg,” says Wilson. “There's the ambience of the room, very little separation, and all that stuff. But it's of exceptional high quality for a bootleg. He really, really took his work seriously. We're very lucky to have it, and I really did what I could in terms of restoring.”


	“My job was really to listen to all the digital versions that had been made from his original cassette tape over the 50 years, compile a master take, and then to try and add some extra fairy dust on top,” he adds. “My job wasn't to try and make it sound like anything other than what it was, which is a bootleg. But just to try and increase the stereo separation a bit, try to get a bit more tone in it, and try to even out some of the uglier frequencies that were there because of the sound of the auditorium on the night. And just to try to do my best to present a definitive version of this original cassette tape that's been around for 50 years.”

	Flannigan has been enthralled by Millard's story for years, and even used a vintage Nakamichi 550 tape recorder to record a show by the National in 2019 that the band officially released on cassette. He paired it with the mini-documentary Juicy Sonic Magic: The Mike Millard Method. Going forward, he hopes to make a proper documentary that tells Millard's entire life story. “I've interviewed all but one person I've found that knew Mike directly and was involved in what he was doing,” he says. “There's some pretty amazing stories there.”


	The groundswell of interest in Millard has been enormously vindicating for Reinstein. He just wishes his friend was still here to experience it. “If Mike would have known that we're talking about him now,” says Reinstein, “obviously, he'd still be alive.”

Sean “Diddy” Combs is back in the news this week because a Netflix documentary put him there. But should streaming services really dictate which crimes we talk about — and when? 

With more than 300 million subscribers worldwide as of early 2025, Netflix is the most popular streaming service by a wide margin. True crime dominates with Netflix's audience, too, reaching significantly more viewers than established network true crime programs like “Dateline.” Netflix's true crime popularity is so great that the streamer consistently creates new headlines, effectively warming up even the coldest cases for audiences to feast on for weeks at a time.

In “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” Diddy faces even more public scrutiny following his explosive criminal trial from over the summer. Not much is happening in court for the disgraced hip-hop artist right now. He's serving a four-year prison sentence in New Jersey, having been found guilty on two charges of “transportation to engage in prostitution” earlier this year. Combs was cleared of the other charges (related to racketeering and human trafficking) and otherwise faces ire online and in the press today.

 










But the four-part “The Reckoning” stokes the Diddy controversy regardless of the legal calendar, thrusting the wreckage back into the spotlight on Netflix's timeline and terms. Executive produced by 50 Cent (Diddy's longtime rival, stemming from a decades-long feud), the series connects one version of the Diddy narrative back to broader questions about media and the power imbalances that exist throughout the entertainment industry. The streamer's role in illuminating that scandal seems personal to Diddy.

“For Netflix to give his life story to someone who has publicly attacked him for decades feels like an unnecessary and deeply personal affront,” read a statement from the defendant's counsel, per Variety. “At minimum, he expected fairness from people he respected.”

Combs has been accused of orchestrating a years-long pattern of sexual abuse, violence, and coercive control that hinged on exploiting his influence in music. The reaction to that unmasking has been big, and “The Reckoning” makes a sweeping assessment of his life, spotlighting the stories of alleged victims and demonstrating the scope of the damage they say was done. Diddy's team named Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos in the defendant's public response to the series and further claimed the project was retaliatory in a cease-and-desist letter sent to the company on December 1, as reported by Deadline.

 










“In or about 2023, CEO Ted Sarandos proposed that Netflix produce a documentary about Mr. Combs,” it said. “However, Mr. Combs rejected the proposal when Mr. Sarandos insisted he give up creative control.“ The four-page letter further characterizes “The Reckoning” as “Netflix's vindictive response to that rejection — an attempt by Netflix and Mr. Sarandos to ensure a one-sided character assassination, rather than a balanced and accurate portrayal.”

Combs further claims the streamer stole his personal footage to make the project, helmed by Emmy-winning filmmaker Alex Stapleton. Most notably, “The Reckoning” includes clips of Combs looking panicked and speaking on the phone with one of his attorneys just days before he was arrested in September 2024. In a public statement from Netflix, Stapleton vaguely addressed the origin of the footage, and said, “It came to us, we obtained the footage legally and have the necessary rights. One thing about Sean Combs is that he's always filming himself, and it's been an obsession.”

Combs isn't the first celebrity to see their “personal” content become unflattering evidence to the public. But he's the biggest name to question Netflix's part in platforming true crime. Journalists and documentarians often run into rights issues when they rely on images or videos they don't own to depict real events. 

 










Netflix is no exception, and the streaming service, which denied any misuse and said Diddy's claims were “false,” has faced similar accusations on other unscripted projects. From the 2018 Sundance documentary “Wild Wild Country” to the salacious “Tiger King” in 2020, the streamer has largely defended its storytellers and ethical practices while settling those cases out of court.

Diddy is appealing his two criminal convictions, and with somewhere between 80 and 90 additional pending civil cases against him, the ex-superstar seems to have bigger problems than who owns which videotape. But delivered from behind bars, Combs' intense reaction to “The Reckoning” underlines Netflix's ability to deliver a profound PR blow — theoretically, to anyone, at any time. That's powerful and convenient if you trust the company's programming and judgment, but also cause for concern if cable-cutting and social media continue to prop up entertainment as a real source of news, or the truth itself.

When the true crime subgenre first boomed for Netflix in 2015, the docuseries “Making a Murderer” made it all the way to the White House. A petition with nearly 130,000 signatures asked Barack Obama to pardon the show's subjects, although the former president ultimately said the issue was outside his purview. 

 










Still, the response formalized the impression that Netflix is powerful enough to impact the justice system. The trend continued through last year, when the Ryan Murphy-produced docudrama “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” reignited two cases from the '80s in Los Angeles federal courts.

Like “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” these revisitations happened because of Netflix — and in some cases, that's inarguably been a good thing. In 2019, “Don't F**k with Cats” put the spotlight on some internet sleuths who actually helped investigators catch a killer. And with the “Unsolved Mysteries” anthology, Netflix routinely asks viewers for their help finding suspects still at large. But without the traditional guardrails of a real newsroom, and no public standards or practices explaining the company's overall approach to informing the public, the streaming service essentially decides the docket for real issues in a digital pop culture bubble with no external checks and balances. (IndieWire has reached out to Netflix for comment, and will update if and when the company responds.)

Decades of schlocky unscripted offerings on broadcast TV tell us FCC regulations can only do so much to separate documentary storytelling from serious frontline journalism. But even protected by the leeway inherent to a straight-to-streaming publicly traded media company, Netflix has released every caliber of true crime caper. In 2023, the streamer came under heavy fire for forwarding baseless conspiracies in “MH370: The Plane That Disappeared.” But this past summer, “The Perfect Neighbor” made pioneering use of police body cam footage to produce a singular work that demands to be seen. 

 










And yet, swinging between exploitative and innovative projects, Netflix's approach to deciding which crimes its customers should “care” about bears a striking resemblance to its embattled stand-up comedy stage, which has repeatedly divided its consumer base. Whether Diddy's complaints about “The Reckoning” carry any weight with the public remains to be seen. He's fighting from a weak position and, perhaps unintentionally, giving his adversary more authority. But Diddy's striking and strident objection suggests a legitimate fear. 

When Netflix chooses to cover a case, its version may be the only one that survives in a court of public opinion where the service is judge, jury, and executioner.

“Sean Combs: The Reckoning” is now streaming on Netflix.

	“We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in theaters,” said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos on a call with Wall Street fresh off clinching a mega deal to acquire Warner Bros.


	“My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long, exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly,” he said. AMC and other chains are looking to reestablish a 30 or 45-day window to energize moviegoing that dwindled during Covid. The biggest chains often won't run Netflix films with truncated windows. 


	The entertainment community and movie theaters in particular have been immensely jittery at this corporate combination given the streamer's short windows if any as they cater to their streaming audience. Exhibition's biggest trade group, Cinema United, came out with a blunt statement this morning opposing the merger, saying. “The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business.”

	“The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” said Cinema United President and CEO Michael O'Leary. 


	“Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre. But Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.” This mega-deal between Netflix and Warner Bros. would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office if films that are traditionally given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros. disappear from theatres. Netflix currently grants only a handful of their films a token theatrical release and the overwhelming.”

	In his comments today, after announcing the $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios, HBO and HBO Max, Sarandos said, “I wouldn't look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or Warner movies, for that matter. I think over time the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly … to meet the audience where they are … all those things we'd like to do. But I'd say that right now you should count on everything that has planned on going to the theaters through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros. And Netflix movies will take the same [path] as they have — which is some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand.”

There are consumers that want to at least be given the opportunity to see a film projected in a movie theater. Why should they be forced to pay for a Netflix subscription just to see a particular movie that's just been released? He's not being “consumer friendly”. He's looking to drive more subs for his company.

“Right now”

Two hour theatrical windows hooray!

Since when can we trust anything Netflix says?

He's only committed to the stuff currently scheduled. This is bad for theatrical and it's even worse for physical media. Yes, that market contracted but it's still a great revenue stream, especially with Warner Archive and collector's market which is still solid. If Netflix is approved, I'd hope they'd keep their partnership in the physical SDS with Universal and instead work on releasing some of their older streaming to discs. Not everyone wants to watch just digital. And I've bought the select Netflix films on physical media as they're still better to view this way than streaming.

Sarandos thinks he is sounding pro-theatrical but his dismissive comments about windows only display his obliviousness and encapsulate our industry's nightmare. Nobody asked for shorter windows. They have slowly eroded the power of theatrical and trained people to sit at home and wait for things to stream. I miss the days when CEOs actually cared about the art form. Netflix is a video company and filmmakers that care about theatrical should stop taking their checks.

	Acclaimed playwright and actor Jeremy O. Harris was arrested in Japan last month after customs officers at an airport allegedly found Ecstasy in his bag, The New York Times reports.


	Harris — best known for his 2018 drama Slave Play— has been in custody on the southern island of Okinawa since Nov. 16 on suspicion of attempting to smuggle illegal drugs into Japan. But it was only on Thursday (Dec. 4) that customs officials officially referred Harris to prosecutors in the capital of Naha to begin formal charging proceedings. 


	A representative for Harris did not immediately return a request for comment. 


	Harris was arrested after arriving in Okinawa from Taiwan. During a bag search at Naha Airport, customs officers reportedly found 780 milligrams of MDMA in Harris' carry-on tote bag. He was arrested on the spot on suspicion of violating Japan's Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Acts. Police in Tomigusuku, just outside Naha, confirmed Harris remains in custody, but couldn't say if he'd admitted to the allegations against him.

	Japan has famously strict anti-drug laws, and Harris could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. (In 1980, Paul McCartney was arrested in Tokyo after flying into the country with 7.7 ounces of marijuana in his luggage; the former Beatle only spent nine days in prison, though, before being released.)


Slave Play garnered 12 Tony nominations and immediately turned Harris into a sensation. While he's continued to write for the stage and screen — he co-wrote the 2021 film Zola and worked on Euphoria Season Two — he's also taken up several acting roles, too. He portrayed himself on the reboot of Gossip Girl, had a recurring part on Emily in Paris, co-starred in The Sweet East, and acts alongside Charli XCX in Pete Ohs' upcoming film, Erupcja.

The UNIC, which represents cinema exhibitors across Europe, fears the streamer will downgrade the theatrical experience. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	European cinema trade body the UNIC has come out against Netflix‘s planned $82.7 billion takeover of Warner Bros., saying the deal will be bad news for the theatrical business. 


	In a statement on Friday, issued shortly after Netflix and Warner Bros. made the takeover bid official, the UNIC said the proposed deal “represents a double risk” with fewer films being produced and fewer of those being made getting released in cinemas.   




	“As elsewhere, cinemas in Europe rely on one product for their viability: films. And to ensure they can attract and successfully serve the widest possible audience, that flow of content needs to be consistent and diverse, with an exclusive period of release supported by effective marketing,” the statement reads. “By that measure, the planned acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix fails in every regard.”

	The loss of a studio “will inevitably mean that cinemas will have fewer films to screen for their audiences, leading to reduced income and significant cinema closures and job losses in the industry,” Laura Houlgatte, CEO of UNIC wrote. But worse than that, she argues, Netflix has shown “time and again” that “it doesn't believe in cinemas and their business model. Netflix has released only a handful of titles in cinemas, usually to chase awards, and only for a very short period, denying cinema operators a fair window of exclusivity.” 

	











	Announcing the deal on Friday, Netflix said that it expects to maintain the current operations of Warner Bros. “including theatrical releases for films,” without giving specific details. Netflix is spinning the takeover as an opportunity for filmmakers and creatives to have access to both Warner Bros.' “renowned franchises and extensive library,” and to Netflix's unparalleled global reach, providing “more opportunities to work with beloved intellectual property, tell new stories and connect with a wider audience than ever before.”


	Phil Clapp, President of UNIC and Chief Executive of the UK Cinema Association, said regulators looking at the deal have to take into account “its consequences for the cinema exhibition sector and the wider public. Any reduction in the diversity and quality of content arising from this acquisition, combined with the potential loss of cinemas and jobs, would have a profoundly damaging impact on Europe's cultural landscape.”


	The UNIC represents exhibitors across 39 territories in Europe with a reach of 43,500 screens.

International Investigations Editor


Netflix‘s blockbuster deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) is unlikely to be blocked by regulators in the European Union, according to antitrust experts.


	Netflix's proposed $83B takeover of WBD's movie and TV studios and HBO Max was confirmed on Friday morning, dramatically reshaping the entertainment industry by bringing together a portfolio of megabrands that includes Stranger Things and Harry Potter.


	Experts who keep a close eye on the European Commission's competition work told Deadline that it would be surprising if Netflix's move was vetoed, but said any deal would likely trigger an investigation that could recommend merger conditions.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“The EU never stops these deals. They always do access remedies,” said Cristina Caffarra, a competition economist, who has advised companies including Apple and Amazon on antitrust matters in Europe. “I'm not saying it will sail through, [but the process will be] sabre rattling, remedy, clear.”


RELATED: Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery: EU Antitrust Experts Say $83B Deal Unlikely To Be Blocked — But Conditions May Be Imposed On Merger


	Nicolas Petit, a professor of competition law at the European University Institute, agreed: “The European Commission rarely fights these kinds of mergers.” 


	There is also a view that blocking the merger would not play well with Donald Trump — even amid suggestions that he supported Larry Ellison and David Ellison's efforts to acquire WBD. “The geopolitics of prohibiting a merger between two purely U.S. firms would be very tricky with all the trade war talk,” Petit explained.

	











	Skydance's merger with Paramount was waived through with zero fuss. The last major deal blocked by EU regulators was Booking.com's 2023 acquisition of Etraveli, which is now the subject of an appeal.


Investigation & Remedies


	There is little question that the European Commission will examine the takeover. Companies must notify European authorities if their combined worldwide revenue exceeds €5B ($5.8B), or if their European sales total more than €250M — thresholds that will be comfortably cleared by the might of Netflix-WBD.


	Caffarra predicts that the European Commission will order a so-called “Phase II” investigation, which would involve closer scrutiny of Netflix's plans for WBD. Such an investigation takes at least 90 days to be completed.


	Rather than an outright block, perhaps the bigger question is what remedies the EU might demand. Experts said Netflix could be compelled to honor and maintain film and TV licensing agreements to prevent it from holding a monopoly over content.


	“Framing appropriate remedies might be the most challenging aspect of this merger review,” said Peter Alexiadis, a visiting scholar at Kedge Business School in Paris, who worked as a competition law and regulatory policy specialist in Brussels for 30 years.


	He added that once regulators get into the details, there could be all sorts of questions around dominance, including Netflix's ability to train AI on an enormous library of content to supercharge its content recommendation machine.


	Guy Bisson, executive director of Ampere Analysis, said getting EU sign-off might require a more dramatic concession from Netflix: “I don't think Warner studio operations plus Netflix is particularly problematic, but Netflix plus Max may be the sticking point, a problem that should be solvable by potentially selling that operation off.”


	There is some precedent here with Disney's takeover of Fox in 2018. As part of securing European Commission approval, Disney committed to divesting its interest in factual channels, including History, Crime & Investigation, and Lifetime.


	For its part, Netflix is upbeat about clearing regulatory hurdles. On a call on Friday, co-CEO Ted Sarandos said: “We're highly confident in the regulatory process. This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth.”


	A European Commission spokesperson said: “This transaction has not been formally notified to the Commission. If a transaction constitutes a concentration and has an EU dimension, it is always up to the companies to notify it to the Commission.”

No, it's the “gimme's.” Trump's probably already telling Carr what he wants on his wish list. Donations to his projects and of course, which talent he wants to install and get riid of, dismantling CNN, etc.

Now that that's settled...


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Netflix just solidified itself as the leading entertainment company (and then some), and all it cost was $83 billion.


	The East coast is just waking up to the bombshell news that Netflix is buying Warner Bros. (but not Discovery — the split and spin is still on). That's kind of weird, as Warner Bros. is famously a legacy film studio. How legacy is it? WB's composition in 1923 literally predates the advent of television, which Netflix basically upended when it switched from DVDs to streaming video. (Or at least, when it launched Lilyhammer, House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black.)

	In his Friday morning acquisition announcement, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-CEO and former chief content officer, first shouted out (in order) his affinity for (and excitement over ownership of) Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Harry Potter — three very theatrically released films. Netflix famously does not distribute its movies in theaters, with (very) few, (very) limited exceptions.




			Related Video		







	“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Sarandos said in a prepared statement. “By combining Warner Bros.' incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends — with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”

	











	In the same press release, Netflix affirms it is committed to releasing Warner Bros. films theatrically — well, it sort of affirms that.


	“Warner Bros.' studios are world-class, with Warner Bros. recognized as a leading supplier of television titles and filmed entertainment. HBO and HBO Max also provide a compelling, complementary offering for consumers,” the media alert reads. “Netflix expects to maintain Warner Bros.' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.”


	To be clear, we bolded the “expects” there — but even without our darker, thicker font, that is heavy verb use right there.


	Shortly after the acquisition announcement, on a conference call with media analysts, Sarandos was asked about the subject of theatrical distribution.


	“I wouldn't look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies — or for Warner movies for that matter. I think over time, I think the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to be able to meet the audience where they are, quicker,” he said. “All those things I'd like to do, but I'd say right now, you should count on everything that is planned on going to the theater through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Brothers. And Netflix movies will take the same strides they have, which is, some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand, but our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that's what they're looking for.”

	











	Sarandos is positively giddy about the deal, and WBD chief David Zaslav is … saying the right things.


	“Today's announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” Zaslav said on Friday. “For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world's attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.”


	Paramount Skydance, the company that did not win the bidding war for Warner Bros., is feeling all sorts of feels this morning. In a letter sent Monday from Paramount's attorneys to Warner Bros. Discovery's lawyers, the counsel for the losing party repeatedly stated how bad Netflix Warner Bros. (our working title) would be for the movie industry.


	“Netflix does not have the same incentive to release films in theaters and will be incentivized to use WBD's world-class IP library to entrench Netflix's streaming dominance while also harming theatrical distribution, talent and moviegoers,” it reads. 


	There's a lot of that.


	Like also: “Netflix, if combined with WBD, will reduce the number of films for broad theatrical release, further pushing consumers away from theaters to streaming and harming those theaters which are already struggling. Given that the co-CEO of Netflix has called brick-and-mortar movie theaters an ‘outdated; concept, Netflix ownership of WBD's studio would continue the trend toward more empty seats in theaters as Netflix shifts its movies away from initial runs in theaters.”

	











	(To reiterate, Netflix is not buying the Discovery piece of Warner Bros. Discovery.)


	And: “Netflix's streaming ambitions that threaten consumers, creative talent, and theatrical distribution.”


	You get the point. If you still don't, Cinema United, the former NATO (National Association of Theatre Owners), is here to drive it home.


	“The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business. The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” Cinema United president and CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement reacting to Friday's news. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre. But Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”


	O'Leary & Co. believe the deal specifically risks “removing 25 percent of the annual domestic box office” — Warner Bros. theatrical share.


	“Netflix success is television, not movies on the big screen. A true commitment to exhibition means a robust slate of movies with a meaningful period of theatrical exclusivity supported by marketing. Sporadic and truncated theatrical releases to meet awards criteria in a handful of theatres is not a commitment to exhibition,” O'Leary added. “Movie theatres are cultural and economic anchors of communities of all sizes — we are a Main Street industry. Research shows that for each dollar spent in a local movie theatre, an additional $1.50 is spent in surrounding businesses in the community—restaurants, bars, shopping centers, transportation. That is what is at risk here if we sanction fewer movies in the marketplace. Theatres will close, communities will suffer, jobs will be lost.”

The streaming giant's proposal includes a $5.8 billion breakup fee and promises to maintain Warner Bros. current operations, "including theatrical releases." Theater owners are already speaking out. 



		By Georg Szalai, Alex Weprin 

	December 5, 2025 4:08am	




Netflix, run by co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, has agreed to buy Warner Bros. in a megadeal valued at $82.7 billion. Under an effort nicknamed “Project Noble,” the streaming giant's leadership secured $59 billion in financing from a consortium of banks to assemble the deal.


	Netflix says the buy would give users more choice and let it “optimize its plans,” it will also expand its studio operations, while creating better value for talent and shareholders, with $2 billion-$3 billion in annual cost savings. The deal proposal has a break up fee of $5.8 billion, meaning that if the acquisition is scuttled in any way Netflix still has to pay Warner Bros. Discovery those billions.

	The companies revealed the acquisition early Friday, altering the course of the entertainment business. Netflix said that it expects to maintain the current operations of Warner Bros. “including theatrical releases for films,” though specifics aside from topline deal numbers remain scarce. And that may be the focus of opposition to the acquisition as the dust settles on the announcement.

	Netflix also made its pitch to filmmakers and creatives, writing that “by uniting Netflix's member experience and global reach with Warner Bros.' renowned franchises and extensive library, the Company will create greater value for talent — offering more opportunities to work with beloved intellectual property, tell new stories and connect with a wider audience than ever before.”

	











	WBD shareholders will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock, with the linear networks business, including CNN, TNT HGTV and Discovery+ still set to be spun out. That move is now expected in the third quarter of 2026.


	“I know some of you are surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told Wall Street analysts on a conference call Friday morning. “We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders, but this is a rare opportunity and it's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.


	“We built a great business, and to do that, we've had to be bold and continue to evolve,” he continued. “Remember, we started off as a DVD by mail company, then we moved to streaming, to producing original content, live programming from a US-centric business to a global business. In a world where people have so many choices, more choices than ever how to spend their time, we can't stand still. We need to keep innovating and investing in stories that matter most to audiences, and that's what this deal is all about.”


	“This acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come,” continued Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix. “Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities. With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.”

	











	“Today's announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” said David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. “For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world's attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.”


	Netflix arguably emerged as the winner of the “Streaming Wars.” And now, it is at the Hollywood gates and ready for its latest conquest, even if it is expected to face heavy regulatory scrutiny. The news came after reports that it was in exclusive talks with Warner Bros. Discovery to acquire its streaming and, ironically, studios business.


	Not only is it understood to have made the highest offer in terms of financial valuation, a Netflix deal allows WBD to go through with the planned separation of its networks business and allow WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels to become CEO of that Global Networks business.


	Wall Street analysts have already previewed the logic of the deal. “Above all, the flow of new content which drives the majority of Netflix engagement,” Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino wrote in a recent report. “Content released in the last year makes up only about 5 percent of the titles on Netflix but drives over 20 percent of Netflix viewing, reflecting that Netflix engagement increases/ decreases when content spend goes up/down.”

	











	Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich, in a recent report, described the auction of WBD this way: “The global media industry stands at the precipice of historic transformation, with WBD positioned at the epicenter.” 


	And she argued that Netflix sealing a deal for WBD's studios and streaming operations would allow it to kill three birds with one stone. “The bidding war for WBD's streaming and studio assets reflects the economic reality of the 2025 media environment that mid-sized legacy media studios/companies can no longer compete with the unit economics of Netflix or the ecosystem of large tech players, such as Amazon,” she explained. “Ultimately, an acquisition may be existential for both Paramount Skydance and [Comcast's] NBCUniversal, and therefore, aside from potential direct financial benefits, an acquisition by Netflix could potentially be killing three birds with one stone – as WBD would be housed within Netflix and Paramount Skydance and NBCU/Peacock would, in our view, have difficulty remaining competitive.”


	Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne has previously also highlighted the intellectual property that Netflix would get its hands on in a WBD deal: “Perhaps most interesting to Netflix, it owns or has exclusive rights to several iconic franchises that could be exploited for decades to come – including DC Comics, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. Finally, it brings talent relationships, production assets, and global distribution scale.”

	











	The same is true for HBO and HBO Max. “HBO brings its own set of IP, built over the past few decades, with HBO original series,” Swinburne highlighted. “It also has a brand still largely synonymous with prestige TV. HBO has also largely made the pivot from linear distribution to streaming, implying Netflix would have minimal exposure to legacy TV headwinds. We estimate only 10-15 percent of its roughly 130 million global subscribers are still signed up through wholesale [pay TV] packages.”


	The biggest hurdle for a Netflix-WBD combination is widely seen as being regulatory concerns. But that is more of a headache for the streamer rather than WBD. 


	Even before news of the exclusive talks, Bernstein analyst Laurent Yoon argued that going with Netflix's takeover bid was a win-win for the seller. “WBD faces little downside – at least one worth taking,” he wrote. “Either they get acquired by Netflix – 85 percent cash! – or they walk away with free capital to fund the next phase of growth. And more than $5 billion is enough to produce more than 20 Superman-scale blockbuster films. That's not a bad outcome either.”


	Many in Hollywood are fearful of the deal, with theater owners group Cinema United saying in a statement overnight that “the proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business.”


	“The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” Cinema United president and CEO Michael O'Leary said. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre. But Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”

	











	The Directors Guild said that the proposed deal raises “significant concerns.”


	Now Hollywood will have to take stock of a megadeal that promises to change the landscape in a way that no deal before it has.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


	International industry are trying to make sense of the overnight bombshell that Netflix is buying Warner Bros, which has been confirmed this morning by the two companies. 


	We have cast the reaction net far and wide this morning. Responses to the deal vary considerably. Former WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar tweeted his thoughts last night. Some Warner Bros Discovery international staff we spoke to off the record this morning expressed dismay. Others expressed hope that a deal would at least provide some clarity on company direction.


	A number of international studio execs we spoke to said they understood the business sense of the deal and that there are benefits to this deal rather than a Paramount or Comcast pact. But there was serious concern among leading independent distributors and producers about the potential impact on theatrical and the broader ecosystem.

					"Watch Out, Netflix": Overseas Analysts Weigh In On Complexities Of Streamer's Mega-Deal For Warner Bros. Discovery		
			








	In their press release this morning, Netflix said it will “maintain Warner Bros.' current operations.” The proof will be in the pudding. The move has made many anxious, especially those in the independent sector. 


	One leading UK film producer we spoke to echoed a familiar refrain by going a step further than Kilar: “This feels like the death of Hollywood,” they lamented. “This is terrible,” added a leading Scandinavian indie distributor. “The only shot now is anti-trust.”


	“It's hard not to see this as depressing,” another head of a leading European film company noted. “Get ready for the Harry Potter – K-Pop Demon Hunters mashup,” one longtime indie marketing executive quipped, perhaps presciently.


	A senior British TV producer said the takeover was “very bad” for the industry, sharing a link to a Jane Fonda op-ed in another trade in which the Oscar-winner said it would mean “fewer jobs, fewer opportunities to sell work, fewer creative risks, fewer news sources and far less diversity in the stories Americans get to hear.”


	One longtime overseas studio head offered a more upbeat take: “Netflix must feel that they are in such a strong financial position that it's too good of a move not to make. If they get WB, they get a dominant global position. It's a smart move. I think they will be better stewards than Discovery or AT&T. I see them maintaining some kind of theatrical business alongside streaming. I think at this point in their life cycle, they can afford to keep much of it standing alongside. I honestly think this will create less job loss and more opportunity than the other bids.”

	











	Another international studio boss posited: “Personally, I'd have found it more depressing for Universal or Paramount to have taken over Warner Bros, as it would kill another quality distributor. Netflix seem to be finally seeing the benefit of theatrical distribution (and even a theatrical window, albeit limited) and I'm excited to see things like the finale of Stranger Things in a cinema. Netflix do shared global events well. They'd inherit a distribution powerhouse which would complement their D2C business. I guess the question is the balance between them seeing this as a way to get WB IP into Netflix vs getting Netflix IP into cinemas and shared experiences. I feel they've come some way along that journey, and maybe we'll see an explosion of what we used to call “alternative content” on the big screen. Will it make for better movies? Maybe. Netflix have a decent track record with quality films.”


	Despite official confirmation from WBD of their intention to sell to Netflix, not all see it as a done deal. One head of a leading international company told us: “It's not over yet. It's not really the Warner Bros board that will decide where Warner Bros ends up. It's Trump's DOJ and FTC. Given his closeness to Ellison, I'd expect some serious anti-trust complications to emerge in coming weeks.”


	Some were incredulous, a sign of how swift and decisive Netflix's move has been. One longtime production and distribution boss based in Europe posited: “I think we're in the middle of the second act. This could be a charade. My intel was that the Paramount deal was pretty much done.”

Wow did not see this coming. I was hoping for Comcast to help Peacock be worth it. Netflix is so huge and own the market not sure if it will pass. Warner studio and streaming is a gold mine for sure.
Get ready for more overpriced subscription to go up to pay for this.

I'm not a top economist, nor billionaire nor a major hedge fund manager, but like most decisions by top CEOs, it starts with a gut instinctual feeling. And my gut feeling is that this represents the further death of Hollywood, something Netflix started a long time ago.

Netflix is officially buying Warner Bros. Discovery for a total enterprise value of $82.7B.


	The industry-changing deal will see Netflix paying $27.75 a share for the venerable Hollywood studio, with a total equity value of $72B. Netflix will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO, subject to regulatory conditions – of which there will be several.


	The deal will follow after WBD's global networks division, Discovery Global, spins out into a new publicly-traded company, a move that is now expected to happen in Q3 2026.

	In their official announcement, Netflix said it “expects to maintain Warner Bros.' current operations” and “build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” Netflix added that the acquisition will also allow the company to “significantly expand U.S. production capacity.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Yesterday, Deadline reported that Netflix had beaten out Paramount and Comcast to buy WBD, and the announcement a few minutes ago confirmed the agreement. The boards of both Netflix and WBD voted “unanimously” to approve the deal.


	“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix. “By combining Warner Bros.' incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends—with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”

	











	Greg Peters, the other co-CEO of Netflix, said the acquisition would “improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come,” adding: “Warner Bros. has helped define entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities. With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.”


	“Today's announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” said David Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery. “For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world's attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.”


	The terms of the agreement will see each WBD shareholder receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for WBD common stock share.


	Moelis & Company LLC is acting as Netflix's financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel. Wells Fargo is acting as an additional financial advisor and, along with BNP and HSBC, is providing committed debt financing related to the transaction. 


	Allen & Company, J.P. Morgan and Evercore are financial advisors to Warner Bros. Discovery and Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Debevoise & Plimpton LLP are serving as legal counsel.


	Politics has played a key role in this protracted sale since the start, and one can imagine we will hear from the White House soon on today's news. The Ellison family has close ties to President Trump. Paramount has consistently argued that it is the only one of the three offers with a clear path to closing, insisting in an open letter published yesterday that the rival offers from Netflix and Comcast both “present serious issues that no regulator will be able to ignore.” Paramount said it believed Netflix, being the dominant streamer in the U.S. and globally, would face major antitrust hurdles adding HBO Max to the fold.


	David Ellison's company also called the sale process unfair and tilted towards Netflix. WBD countered that its board “attends to its fiduciary obligations with the utmost care, and that they have fully and robustly complied with them and will continue to do so.”


	In a veiled attack on WBD CEO David Zaslav, Paramount claimed the “sales process has been tainted by management conflicts, including certain members of management's potential personal interests in post-transaction roles and compensation as a result of the economic incentives embedded in recent amendments to employment arrangements.”


	Paramount had offered Zaslav a role if the companies were to merge. It's not currently clear what role Zaslav will play in a Warner-Netflix merger.

Well time to delete your Netflix subscription and boycott.

Netflix makes content.

I can't see how this doesn't take Netflix out as a buyer of original content for some time, as they're going to spend the next few years raiding the WB closet of IP for remakes. The TV buying market was just starting to turn around, this is going to kill it again.

Tech buys Hollywood.  Here comes AI.

Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa has died. A veteran actor with nearly 150 credits to his name, Tagawa was probably best known for his long association with the Mortal Kombat franchise, where he played villainous sorcerer/Kombatant Shang Tsung on multiple occasions. (Most notably in 1995's Mortal Kombat film adaptation, and in the gaming franchise's 2019 installment, Mortal Kombat 11.) Prolific in film and television, live-action and voice, Tagawa was a reliable screen presence through the latter parts of the 20th century and well into the 21st (including a leading role in Prime Video's The Man In The High Castle, which allowed him to show far more of his range than many more villainous parts across his long career). Per Variety, Tagawa died on December 4 from complications from a stroke. He was 75.

Born in Japan to a Japanese mother and a Japanese-American soldier in the American Army, Tagawa spent most of his childhood living on Army bases around the United States, before his family ultimately settled in California. Training in acting and martial arts served him in good stead securing early roles once he left school and begin his career in earnest, first with small roles in shows like MacGuyver and Star Trek: The Next Generation, and then in his first break into film, appearing in a small role in Bernardo Bertolucci's Oscar-winner The Last Emperor. From there, Tagawa began to work at a frankly relentless pace, alternating single-episode stints on American TV with a lengthening laundry list of films. (Including playing an undercover Hong Kong narcotics officer who runs afoul of James Bond in 1989's License To Kill, and appearing in a major role opposite Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes in 1993's Rising Sun.)

When it came to securing the signature role of his career, Tagawa famously didn't screw around: Legend has it that he arrived to his Mortal Kombat audition in full costume, and basically took the part of the game series' evil wizard by sheer force of personality. The role tapped into Tagawa's skill at projecting both menace and grandeur, as well as his training as a martial artist—to say nothing of his willingness to give his all in a truly committed villainous scowl. (The actor himself, meanwhile, ascribed at least part of the 1995 movie's shock success to director Paul W.S. Anderson's savvy in selecting a soundtrack, including the prominent use of The Immortals' “Mortal Kombat (Techno Syndrome)” for the film's fight sequences.) Tagawa's performance as Shang Tsung was beloved enough that it influenced many future incarnations of the character—often depicted as much younger than his initially wizened appearance, to match Tagawa—including returning to the franchise to reprise the role for Mortal Kombat 11.

Despite the film's success, Tagawa's career continued after Mortal Kombat much as it had before: A mix of TV roles—including a lead role in a couple of seasons of Don Johnson's Nash Bridges—interspersed with films both big and small. (Now also incorporating an increasing number of voice roles into the mix.) Arriving in 2015, The Man In The High Castle was, thus, a rare landing point for an actor frequently on the move; as Japanese Trade Minister Tagomi, Tagawa tapped into his ability to project stoic calm to become a rare moral center point in the show's often complex alternate universe moral equations. Tagawa stayed with the show for three of its four seasons, following it with a stint as a recurring character on Netflix's Lost In Space reboot.

Tagawa's death on Thursday was confirmed by a representative.

Update, 12/5/25 at 12:15 p.m.: Overnight, Netflix announced it had entered a “definitive agreement” to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film and television studios, including Warner Bros., HBO, and HBO Max, for $83 billion. In its statement, Netflix claims it “expects to maintain Warner Bros.' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” WB has a current slate of movies scheduled for theatrical release through 2029, and many have criticized Netflix's two-week theatrical strategy, including James Cameron, who described it as “rotten to the core” last week. Nevertheless, the company emphasizes “more choice and greater value for consumers,” a “stronger entertainment industry,” “more opportunities for the creative community,” and, perhaps, most importantly, “more value for shareholders.” We're confident the company will make good on at least one of those.

Original story: The three-way bidding war that erupted after Warner Bros. Discovery formally announced (back in October) that it was putting the ol' water tower up for sale has apparently concluded, Deadline reports, and it did so with a sound that marketing professionals continue to insist, to our ever-deepening irritation, has to be written out as “Tudum!” Yes, Netflix—the DVD envelope people, with the BoJack Horsemans and the movies where The Rock seems to be constantly glaring at people in formal wear—is apparently now in position to buy at least part of one of Hollywood's oldest studios. (Also all the Discovery Channel stuff, but that doesn't carry quite the same smack of a legacy being fed to the Silicon Valley heathens, yeah?)

Let's start by noting that “winning the bidding war” here means there are still about a million caveats to this whole thing before it can become a done deal. Including a), the fact that Netflix hasn't actually bought anything as of yet, and has basically just secured for itself a chance to enter into specific one-on-one negotiations with WBD for a future purchase. And b), it only really wants the company's studios and HBO Max, and won't be buying, say, all of Warner Bros.' TV networks. And c), any deal the two companies make will then have to seek governmental authorization, running straight into the maw of White House-controlled regulators who've been very comfortable about forcing big media corporations to suck their rings in order to get deals like this through. Still, though: This is step one of all that, including reports that Netflix has agreed to give Warner Bros. a hefty $5 billion “breakup fee” if the deal fails to close.

News that this little coup was coming has pissed off a pretty wide coalition of people today, starting with David Ellison, owner of Paramount, who's been claiming very loudly in the trades that Warner Bros. has been trying to rig the sale in Netflix's favor from the start. Meanwhile, Variety reported several hours ago—before official word of the bidding war finishing was getting passed around—that a group of anonymous “concerned feature film producers” had sent a letter to basically any Congressperson they thought might listen, complaining that Netflix buying the studio would “effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace.” There's no word of exactly who signed the letter, on account of the definition of the word “anonymous.” But Variety does quote a source saying “a number of prominent filmmakers” were among its signatories; these folks are calling for “the highest level of antitrust scrutiny” on the deal, which, they allege, could specifically do massive harm to theaters by cutting the window between when Warner Bros. movies appear in theaters and when they arrive on streaming to as little as two weeks. (Netflix leadership has done itself no especially big favors on this score, by the way, with its only-begrudging willingness to put films onto the big screen as a token sop to ornery filmmakers, while Ted Sarandos goes around calling the whole concept of going to the movies “outdated.”)

It's easy, amidst all these mergers, acquisitions, movements of giant piles of money and IP, to reduce the whole massive business down to so much easily-dismissed Succession-esque boardroom bullshit. But Netflix ponying up to buy one of the major studios feels big—not just as a symbol of the old guard giving way to the new, but because one of the major arms of American cinema might wind up in the hands of a company that's unabashedly cinema-agnostic. It's a major shift in the dynamic, no matter how it all ends up playing out, and those always seem to shake a whole lot of very unsettling elements loose in the process.

For' Ghost World,' her fourth solo studio, Wonderland brushed aside the self-doubt, got answers, found the rush.

	Like the rest of us, Alison Wonderland has self-doubts. Questions that can't be answered. Wells of energy, the location of which is a mystery.


	For Ghost World (via EMI), her fourth solo studio which drops in full today, Dec. 5, Wonderland brushed aside the self-doubt, got answers, found the rush.


	“This one felt like my first album, where I really had so much to say to the world and go hard. The energy was back for me,” she tells Billboard over a Zoom. “I just really had a lot to give in a more extroverted way where the last album felt very introverted. That was how I've been feeling. I've been feeling so strong.”

	Much has happened in Wonderland's life since 2022's Loner, which crashed Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums tally at No. 3 and started at No. 9 on the ARIA Chart, her third consecutive top 10. Later that year, Wonderland (real name: Alexandra Sholler) launched FMU Records, and, in 2023, revived her darker, more industrial project Whyte Fang, with the release of a full-length album, Genesis.

	











	Enter, health problems. Fertility issues. Wonderland experienced a miscarriage in December of 2024 that forced the cancellation of several shows, and backlash from gung ho types who didn't yet know the full story. “This frustration I was feeling,” she remarks, “I went f— this.” She returned home to Australia, and felt “really welcome.” Rediscovered her groove, played more shows. The positivity flowed.




	Then, in November of this year, Wonderland brought into this world a second boy. More joy.


Ghost World was pushed back from a scheduled Oct. 15 release date to a pre-Christmas unwrapping, due to production delays with merchandise, vinyl, and other important elements.


	Better late than never.


Ghost World is anything but meek. Wonderland's vision is a punchy one, a journey stretching across 14 tracks including the previously-released cuts “Get Started,” “Again? F—.,” “iwannaliveinadream” and “Heaven” featuring Ninajirachi.


	“My aim is to always externally communicate what I'm internalizing. I'm not trying to be a sad sack about it,” Wonderland tells Billboard.com. “A lot of the meaning behind this album was me trying to get excited about where I was again, and I did. Ghost World is really about me trying to find my place. When you're growing and evolving, you need to still be in love with what you do or you shouldn't be doing it. I felt a little bit like a ghost. I will always feel that way. I just kinda felt like, what world do I fit in, where do I fit in anymore? It's easy to feel replaceable.”


	Having the break between Loner and Ghost World, and doing Whyte Fang “helped me go back to my roots.” On Loner, she recounts, “I was so isolated. And it was such an internalized album, it was a very different energy. There was something I felt like I was missing.” There was a moment in time when “I was stuck in the middle of the ocean, and couldn't see any land on either side of me.”


	Wonderland came back with a creative recharge. “It also made me really appreciate women, tenfold. I worked with a lot more women on this album.”

	











	Collaborators include Nina Wilson, better known as the three-time ARIA Award winning EDM producer and artist Ninjirachi, plus DJ Dave and Erick The Architect. Wonderland produced the album with Dylan Ragland, MEMBA and QUIX. Ghost World was mixed by Tom Norris and Tristan Hoogland and mastered by Dale Becker.


	Wonderland comes alive on stage, and can boast more than 800,000 headline ticket sales across her U.S. tours alone. In 2018, she wrote her name in the history books with a headline spot at Coachella, her fourth performance in the California desert, and has seven-times headlined the “Temple of Wonderland” at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. 


	She'll hit the road again next year, in support of Ghost World. “There will be a big tour, I'm excited,” she admits. “I'm a perfectionist. Someone said something a long time ago, you can tell everyone you put everything into this body of work but at the end of the day the only person who will know if you really went there will be you. It sits with me and haunts me anytime I make anything. I think it's why I push myself so hard. I think about it all the time to this day.”

The streaming giant appears to have emerged victorious over Paramount and Comcast, though there is a lot that needs to happen for the deal to close.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	In a deal that would dramatically change the entertainment industry, Netflix, led by Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, is poised to win the battle for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s studios and HBO Max streaming business.


	Netflix has entered into exclusive talks with the David Zaslav-led WBD after topping rival bids from Paramount and Comcast.




	There is still a lot that needs to happen for the deal to close, but if it does, it would alter the course of the entertainment industry, with its impact felt across streaming video, theatrical filmmaking and studio production.

	Entering into exclusive talks do not necessarily mean that the companies will come to a definitive agreement, and even if they do, they will need to navigate a complex regulatory environment in the U.S. and around the world. Paramount executives believed that their deal would have an easier path to approval than the offer from Netflix, given Netflix's scale in subscription streaming, but that was not enough to overcome Netflix's bid.


	Specific deal terms were not immediately available, though they were clearly strong enough to warrant moving forward on exclusive talks. CNN reported that Netflix offered $28 per share, with Paramount offering $27, though Paramount was trying to buy the entire company, not just the studios and streaming business.


	Bloomberg, which first reported the news, says that Netflix has offered a $5 billion breakup fee should the deal not be allowed to go through, an enormous sum that could offset concerns about regulatory challenges.

	











	If the companies agree on a final deal, they will need to deal with U.S. regulators, with leaks to the New York Post suggesting that the Department of Justice is already planning a legal challenge. European regulators may also be skeptical of the deal. Netflix is likely to argue that the video marketplace is much broader than just subscription streaming, and could point to YouTube's domination of video viewing as a counterweight to any arguments they make.


	Should the deal go through, Netflix would become the steward of one of the industry's most storied film studios, and one of its most prolific TV studios. The fate of its theatrical releases and its production for other streaming services and TV channels could hang in the balance. And HBO and HBO Max, arguably the most prestigious brand in TV, would become a part of the Netflix portfolio.


	The potential addition of such a valued set of entertainment properties to a tech-oriented company had some in Hollywood on edge. At least one traditional studio executive was lamenting the outcome, saying privately Thursday night that they feared that a Netflix takeover of a traditional movie studio would deal a mortal blow to exhibition. The streamer would be unlikely to put WB movies in theaters, they said, causing an already teetering business to topple further.


	Studios also rely on revenue from Netflix buying movies for post-theatrical windows, and with the WB library the company would be less likely to do so.


	Also in question is the future of a certain kind of premium TV in a combined company. HBO has long focused on development, with shows taking a longer time to get to air as executives honed and chiseled them, often over years, a process Netflix has not always been known for.

	











	Meanwhile, WBD's linear TV assets, including CNN, TNT, TBS, HGTV and Food Network, would continue to be spun out into their own company. 


	There have been signs that things were trending in Netflix's direction. On Thursday morning, a letter from lawyers for Paramount to Zaslav leaked, calling the process “unfair.”


	“Several U.S. media outlets have reported on the enthusiasm by WBD management for a transaction with Netflix, and on statements by management that a transaction between WBD and Netflix would be a ‘slam dunk,' while also referring to Paramount's bid in a negative light,” read the Paramount letter. “Additional reporting since the submission of revised bids on December 1 has indicated that WBD's ‘board has really warmed to' a transaction with Netflix due to the ‘chemistry between' WBD management and Netflix management.”


	Representatives for WBD and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.

When news broke that Peacock was canceling Rian Johnson and Natasha Lyonne's charming murder mystery series Poker Face a few weeks ago, it was accompanied by a much weirder little tidbit: That Johnson was intending to shop the canceled series around—so far, so normal—except with Peter Dinklage replacing Lyonne in the starring role. It was not clear, beyond Dinklage's obvious charms as a performer, why this might happen—and, specifically why, were the series somehow miraculously resurrected, Lyonne wouldn't be caught up in the heavenly event.

Now Lyonne herself has discussed the news, making it clear that she was pretty clearly hoping to get a break from the life of living lie detector Charlie Cale in order to focus on other gigs. (Albeit in a way where she makes it clear that she's still a fan of both Johnson, and the series, which she'd remain as an executive producer on.) Talking to Deadline, Lyonne laid it out clean: “I love Dinklage, I love Rian, and we'll see what happens. I could pop back up. I really need a few years; if I don't make a movie before I die, I'll be very bummed out. So let me just get one feature in the can, and we'll see… I love Poker Face. I just would like to do a couple of movies for a second, and maybe I'll see you again.”

It's worth remembering that Operation: Dinklage Messiah is an entirely hypothetical concept in any case: Although Johnson has a fair amount of industry clout at the minute—his latest Knives Out movie, Wake Up Dead Man, is scoring strong reviews with its sporadic theatrical run ahead of a Netflix release—what he doesn't have at present is a studio or streamer that actually wants to make more Poker Face.

As for Lyonne, she also addressed the other oddity that's been swirling around her lately—and which touches on that filmmaking she's so anxious to do. Talking about her upcoming film Uncanny Valley, Lyonne apparently stressed that it's moving slowly because she's taking her stated intent to use “clean' AI—i.e., ones not trained by scraping huge piles of copyrighted materials—seriously: “When you're not generating in Midjourney, it takes longer, basically, because it's a team of artists in there. We're looking at every image and kind of dialing it in. Everything I've done is always sort of a five-year span from inception to the touch-and-go cycle of cast coming together with the budget.” Lyonne, who's signed industry pledges calling for increased safeguards against copyright infringement by AI training, reiterated past comments saying she doesn't see use of AI tools as antithetical to human creativity: “I think it's worth remembering that we need hope and new ideas, and to remember that we're kind of the architects of this moment, and how we all choose to show up for each other is really key.”

The star-studded opening ceremony, which also included Sean Baker, Kirsten Dunst, Jessica Alba and Queen Latifah, made clear that the recent controversy over the Riyadh Comedy Festival has done little to slow the momentum of the kingdom's flagship film event.

	The fifth edition of the Red Sea International Film Festival opened Thursday night with a glittering red carpet and the Middle East premiere of Giant, British filmmaker Rowan Athale's boxing biopic about British-Yemeni champion “Prince” Naseem Hamed, starring Amir El-Masry and Pierce Brosnan. The launch again transformed Jeddah's Al-Balad — the city's UNESCO World Heritage old town — into a glamorous focal point for the region's fast-developing film industry, as an international array of stars from the Middle East, Africa, Hollywood, Europe and Asia gathered under the festival's banner theme, “For the Love of Cinema.”

	Guests walked the carpet at Culture Square, the festival's open-air hub, before the opening-night screening. Among those in attendance were many of the festival's upcoming In Conversation With participants and honorees — including two-time Oscar winner Adrien Brody, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Kirsten Dunst, Vin Diesel, Jessica Alba, Queen Latifah, Dakota Johnson, Ana de Armas, Riz Ahmed, Naomie Harris, Giancarlo Esposito, Uma Thurman, Rita Ora, Olga Kurylenko, Daniel Kaluuya, Nina Dobrev and Kriti Sanon — alongside industry legends such as Juliette Binoche, Sir Michael Caine, Stanley Tong and Rachid Bouchareb, who received the festival's Red Sea Honoree Awards. They were joined by regional figures such as Saudi actors Yaqoub Alfarhan and Naif Aldaferi, Jordanian actress and producer Saba Mubarak and Egyptian stars Lebleba, Reem Sami and Yasmine Sabri, underscoring the festival's signature mix of global and Arab talent.

	Running Dec. 4–13, the 2025 festival is presenting more than 100 films from over 50 countries — a slate designed to bridge “East and West” while spotlighting Middle Eastern and African storytellers. Giant set the tone with its story of identity and migration — themes that resurface throughout the program. The main competition features 16 titles spanning Asia, Africa and the Arab world, including the world premiere of Somali debut Barni and Saudi filmmaker Shahad Ameen's Hijra, the country's official 2026 Oscar submission. Other competition highlights include Cherien Dabis' All That's Left of You, Akio Fujimoto's Rohingya-language drama Lost Land and Zain Duraie's Sink. 


	The night's most emotional moment came when Michael Caine, 92, accepted his Red Sea honoree award from Vin Diesel, who introduced him as “one of the greatest actors of all time” and praised the screen legend as a devoted husband and “fellow family man.” Caine, seated in a wheelchair with three of his grandchildren standing behind him, delivered a meandering but deeply heartfelt speech that had the audience hanging on every word before rising for a standing ovation. “I was born in London, a very poor, working-class area, and I grew up to be what I am,” he said with characteristic wit. Reflecting on his 70-year career and long marriage, he added, “I've been married for 53 years … I have a fabulous family that I adore beyond belief, and I've had a fairly fabulous movie family, too.” Caine concluded with a smile: “I kept going until I was 90 … and I'm done. I've had all the luck you can get — and tonight is one of the biggest.”

	











	The star-packed opening also made clear that recent controversy in the U.S. surrounding the participation of major American comedians at the recent Riyadh Comedy Festival has done little to dampen the draw, or slow the momentum, of the kingdom's flagship film event. Despite periodic criticism of Hollywood's growing engagement with the Gulf state, the RSIFF's steady expansion and sustained A-list turnout suggest that Saudi Arabia's nascent screen sector continues to gain traction as a legitimate stop on the international festival circuit.


	Recent multi-Oscar-winner Sean Baker, writer and director of Anora, presides over the jury and will lead a masterclass during the festival. Addressing the crowd during the ceremony, Baker praised Saudi Arabia's rapid transformation into a thriving film market and production hub. “To think that in five short years an ecosystem has been created to train regional talent and develop an infrastructure for local and global film production — it's just incredible,” he said, noting the country's 650 new cinema screens and status as the world's fastest-growing box office. “While we are fighting to save screens in the U.S.,” he added, “hundreds of cinemas have opened here.” Baker called the festival “exciting, inspirational and heartwarming” for cinephiles and emphasized that the competition lineup — 16 titles spanning Asia, Africa and the Arab world — reflects “a place on Earth where cinema is burgeoning, growing and evolving.”

	











	Accepting one of the evening's Red Sea honoree awards, Juliette Binoche reflected on a career defined more by emotional than physical action and spoke of how performing has deepened her empathy as a person. “Acting helped me open my heart even more — and elevate my spirit, because I was in front of people who were very inspiring,” she said from the stage. Binoche, who recently made her directorial debut with the documentary In-I In Motion, which will screen at RSIFF, added that international festivals expand artists' horizons: “When you're in a jury with people from different traditions and mindsets, it opens your heart even more.”


	Binoche will also participate in the first-ever “Kering | Women in Motion” panel in Jeddah, part of a new initiative spotlighting women behind and in front of the camera.


	The lineup also includes powerful, regionally set dramas that have impressed at A-list festivals throughout the year — including Óliver Laxe's Sirāt, which won the Jury Prize at Cannes and was later selected as Spain's official Oscar submission; Annemarie Jacir's Palestine 36, Palestine's entry for Best International Feature; and The Voice of Hind Rajab, from Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania, which earned the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize at Venice and represents Tunisia at the Oscars.

	











	Beyond the competition, the “International Spectacular” section will feature Alice Winocour's Couture starring Angelina Jolie; Olivier Assayas' The Wizard of the Kremlin with Paul Dano and Jude Law; Mamoru Hosoda's anime Scarlet; Rupert Wyatt's Saudi-shot Desert Warrior; and the Spanish documentary Farruquito: A Flamenco Story. New Saudi productions — such as Haifaa Al Mansour's thriller Unidentified and Anas Ba-Tahaf's Jeddah-set rom-com A Matter of Life and Death — point to the Kingdom's growing ambitions as an expanding production base.


	The Red Sea Souk market opens Friday with more than 160 companies from over 45 countries registered, including senior executives from Netflix, Disney+ and others — underscoring the festival's broadening international reach.


	Now in its fifth year, RSIFF has quickly become a leading date on the Arab film calendar — a showcase that combines global visibility with Saudi Arabia's concerted effort to build a domestic film industry. This year's expanded lineup, robust industry turnout and deepening participation from Hollywood, Asia and beyond suggest the festival's ambitions remain undiminished.

Four years ago, we reported that Mattel—still a couple of years out at the time from getting a hit of serious street cred by throwing a lot of money/pink paint at Greta Gerwig to make a Barbie movie—had tapped Vin Diesel to star in an even less likely Hollywood adaptation of a well-known toyroom property: A film version of classic “Fun for twenty seconds, until your hand gets tired” kids game Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. At the time, we reported that Diesel was throwing both his body, and his filmmaking rep into the movie, which he would both star in and executive produce. But something was obviously missing from this cocktail of Diesel fuel. An obvious creative spark, leaving the film trailing along at, at best, an eighth or a sixteenth of a mile at a time. Where, in all this, was the mind of Diesel?

Wonder no more, as Deadline reports today that the Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots film has added a key creative light to its screenwriting team: One Mark Sinclar Vincent, a.k.a., well, Vin Diesel, who's now officially writing the movie. It's not clear if Diesel—whose official screenwriting credits are mostly confined to a few short films he made before getting famous, but who's known to get heavily involved creatively on most of his film projects—will be working from the screenplay supposedly penned a few years back by Ryan Engle, a known associate of hated “Candy ass” Dwayne Johnson, or if he'll whip up something new.  Reading Diesel's own press statement about the news, for instance, doesn't really make anything clearer, as he notes, “I am excited to expand the Mattel universe by bringing this classic toy from my childhood to a modern audience by telling a story that examines the role of competition in a world often measured by strength and dominance that dares to reveal the power of compassion at its core.”

Diesel's public reputation has been spotty lately: He hasn't starred in a movie since Fast X in 2023, and was the subject of claims of sexual battery from his former assistant Asta Jonasson in December of 2023. (A lawsuit from Jonasson was dismissed by a California judge last month on the grounds that the incident in question, which allegedly happened in 2010, was said to have happened in Georgia, outside the court's jurisdiction.) None of which has stopped Mattel from throwing vocal support behind him, at least as regards his Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robot-writing duties: Mattel Studios president Robbie Brenner gave a statement this week that we're going to go out on a limb and suggest is the nicest thing anyone's ever said about Vin Diesel or “his creative vision for Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots“:

Vin is a powerhouse storyteller with an unmatched understanding of action, heart, and world-building. His creative vision for Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots is bold, human, and deeply cinematic—exactly the kind of storytelling we love at Mattel Studios.

Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried are trading suspense for holiday-themed laughs when they appear in a special edition of “Celebrity Family Feud” this December. The actors, who star together in the upcoming thriller “The Housemaid,” will team up with their castmates for a festive showdown against a group of “Real Housewives” favorites.

ABC will air the special Thursday, Dec. 4, at 8 p.m. Eastern. The episode will stream the following day on Hulu.

ABC will broadcast the holiday special on Dec. 4 as part of its primetime lineup. Viewers who miss the initial airing can stream the episode the next day on Hulu. Yahoo Entertainment reported that the network plans to make the special available on demand shortly after it airs.

Several outlets, including TV Insider, confirmed that the episode follows ABC's standard release pattern for “Celebrity Family Feud,” meaning it will be accessible to both cable viewers and those who watch primarily through streaming platforms.

The special, titled “The Housemaid vs. The Housewives All-Stars Holiday Special,” brings together Sweeney, Seyfried, director Paul Feig, Brandon Sklenar, and Sarah Cooper to face a team of Housewives stars. TV Insider reported that their opponents include Cynthia Bailey, Dorinda Medley, Melissa Gorga, Eva Marcille, and Alexia Nepola, all competing for charity.

In a preview clip released to TV Insider, Harvey asked the teams to name a Christmas movie people never tire of. TV Insider reported that Feig guessed “Miracle on 34th Street,” which did not appear on the board. Sweeney's call of “Elf” landed, while Seyfried's guess of “The Grinch” missed. The moment sparked laughter and added to the special's light, playful tone.

IMDb's news desk also reported that the holiday episode follows the show's traditional charity-driven format.

The episode arrives two weeks before “The Housemaid” hits theaters on Dec. 19. TV Insider noted that the psychological thriller places Sweeney and Seyfried in tense, high-stakes roles as their characters navigate danger inside a wealthy household.

Their “Family Feud” appearance gives viewers a very different look at their dynamic. Instead of suspense and dark twists, audiences will see the pair joking, reacting to unexpected answers, and working together as teammates. The timing also positions the special as a promotional boost for the film, which has generated buzz for its cast and eerie premise.

Whether you watch for the celebrity matchups, the holiday spirit, or a preview of the chemistry behind “The Housemaid,” this special promises a mix of humor, competition, and seasonal chaos, the kind of December TV moment that sticks with viewers long after the buzzer sounds.

Tara Reid was heard loudly slurring her words in the background of a 911 call as a bystander attempted to get help during her alleged drugging incident.

In the clip obtained by Page Six, the caller referred to Reid, 50, as a “really inebriated” guest in the hotel needing to transported to the local hospital.

“She can barely stand. She can barely sit in a wheelchair. She's not responding sometimes. She's giving unresponsive answers,” the caller explained.

Reid's voice can be heard loudly moaning in the background of the call.

The caller attempted to quiet down the “American Pie” star by loudly calling, “Miss Reid” several times.

The actress continued to give incoherent responses to the woman, who told dispatch that Reid is “laying on the floor in the hallway” at the time of the call.

A rep for Reid did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment. 

Reid claims that she was drugged while grabbing a drink at a Chicago hotel bar last month.

Video obtained by TMZ on Nov. 24 showed Reid — who has a history of substance abuse — being helped by a group of people into a wheelchair before she was later wheeled out of the hotel on a stretcher.

On Wednesday, Rosemont police announced that they found no video evidence in their ongoing investigation to back Reid's claims.

“While video surveillance showed Tara Reid at the hotel bar, at no time did video show anyone tampering with or adding something to her drink,” the Rosemont Public Safety Department said in a statement Wednesday.

In the meantime, the police are continuing to work with Reid and are still waiting for her hospital records to continue their investigation efforts. 

The department closed, alleging that “no criminal act … has been committed” and they aren't looking into anyone at this time. 

Still, the “Sharknado” actress maintained her original claims that she believes her drink was tampered with.

“Bottom line is no one ends up in the hospital incapacitated for over 8 hours after a drink,” she said in a statement to Page Six on Wednesday night.

“I felt so helpless. This has been a horrifying experience for me that is severely affecting my mental health. I cannot sleep over this it's a very scary feeling not knowing what happened to me. I believe I was drugged. Something happened to me,” she insisted.

“Endless Cookie” begins with an account of how the film began production, which is not a particularly interesting story: half-brothers Seth and Pete Scriver received a grant for funding they needed to direct an animated project together, and Seth flew from Toronto to Pete's home in the remote First Nations community of Shamattawa to brainstorm on the stories they wanted the film to incorporate. 

What makes the opening few minutes captivating is how this is all presented. The representative of NFG Canada that provided the grant is depicted as a bent ruler. Seth's wife has an onion head, and he himself is a pale, flabby, blue-nosed figure that only vaguely resembles the contours of a real human being. When he calls his brother to break the news, the film zooms out to a map of North America with a sleeping face stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic. And as Seth rattles on about the goal of the film — to make “something funny, beautiful, spiritual, political, complex, simple, and true” — emojis line up on screen to represent every descriptor.

With a hand-drawn aesthetic that combines a little DNA from indie '90s comics, retro video games, and children's picture books, “Endless Cookie” is a wonderfully grotesque, beautifully surreal visual experience. Animated by Scriver, the film's psychedelic world is one with only a passing relationship to logic, populated with dogs shaped like peanuts and daughters shaped like cookies, where pictures on a wall can speak and time can jump from the present day to a future apocalypse and back again in the blink of an eye. It's a hazy, confounding experience, but also a warm delight — using its hallucinatory animation to tell a down-to-Earth, relatable history of a family.   

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Much of the film takes place in Pete's living room, where he and Seth recorded several conversations from 2016 to 2024, the audio of which provides the basis for most of the vignettes featured within the film. We get a general sense of their relationship: they share a father, but Seth is white while the older Pete is indigenous, though the two were raised for some time together in the Kensington Market neighborhood of Toronto. As the two chat, Pete throws out a few stories he wants to incorporate into the film, starting with an account of how he got his own hand caught in a beaver trap.  

But while Pete keeps trying to head back to the story, he only just barely manages to finish the loop by the time the film rambles its way to an ending. Instead, the sheer bulk of “Endless Cookie” consists of a whole bunch of digressions. Some come from Pete and Seth themselves, as they go off topic to discuss Pete's youth as a teen in Toronto, ordering terrible pizza and slacking off with his friends. Some come from Pete's large family, consisting of nine children, 10 dogs, and a whole bunch of other relatives, who interrupt to offer their own tales or musings about life in Shamattawa. And some come from Seth, as his animation takes turns into the absurdist, from parodies of old video games to a commercial for a city made of toilets.

 










Where one vignette ends and another begins is intentionally difficult to parse; this is a free-flowing narrative, where the storytelling is zigs and circles back on itself rather than proceeding in a straight line. Occasionally, it can veer on a little exhausting, but for the most part, the approach is soothing in its way, and endearing in how it fleshes out this family as a very rambunctious and colorful, tight-knit unit. The stories they tell, of rebuilding a teepee that burned or witnessing the wildlife mating, are lightly amusing and sweet, accompanied by a chipper, whistling score that amplifies the slice-of-life charm.

Although most of “Endless Cookie” is cheerfully comedic, it also very much lives up to the “political” descriptor Seth aimed for in the opening. At several points, the movie exposes its politics visually, such as a memorable scene inside a supermarket where the frozen food aisles are filled with products like “Let's Eat the Billionaires Chicken Fingers.” Mostly, however, it comes from the real experiences of First Nations people in Canada, as shared by Pete and his family. Early on, a car radio reports on systemic harassment from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that has led to disproportionate rates of Indigenous people being incarcerated. One particularly sad segment, narrated by an elderly friend of Pete's family, discusses his experiences being kidnapped, separated from his family, and sent to one of the infamous Canadian Indigenous Residential Schools as a child.

 










Still, “Endless Cookie” doesn't dwell on the tragedy: while it makes a point on the importance of looking at the past, it also celebrates the joy of community and the passing of culture down from generation to generation. Late in the movie, as the cast looks through a camera, we see real pictures of Pete, Seth, and all of their loved ones for the first time. It's to the credit of “Endless Cookie” that you already feel like you know them all — even if you only knew them as, well, a cookie.  

Obscured Releasing will release “Endless Cookie” in Los Angeles and New York theaters on Friday, December 5.

	You've probably heard that cosplay Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been blowing up alleged drug running boats from Venezuela in extra-judicial killings that give new meaning to the phrase “war on drugs.”


	But you might not have heard that his boss just pardoned the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year sentence in a U.S. prison for abusing his office by leading what prosecutors called “one of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking conspiracies in the world.”


	If the cognitive dissonance gives you whiplash, that's because you're paying attention.


	For a guy who talks a lot about how much he hates drugs — and is now floating it as a pretext for knocking off the odious Maduro regime — Trump has developed a strange habit of giving pardons to drug dealers. A day after his latest inauguration, Trump pardoned the founder of the Silk Road website, which was notorious as a dark web drug den. This was followed by the strange commutation for the founder of the Gangster Disciples in Chicago, who flooded the Windy City with cocaine.

	











	This weirdness is part of a wider pattern. Because Trump has issued more than 2,000 pardons and commutations this year — 10 times the number he pushed through in his entire first term.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The presidential pardon is written into the Constitution, but Trump is not aiming for mercy or addressing objective injustices, as the founders intended. 


	He is abusing the power to reward partisan political allies, enabling pay-for-pardon schemes, and attempting to decriminalize corruption.

	











	Right out of the gate, Trump offered pardons to all the January 6 MAGA minions who attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election. This list included violent individuals who assaulted police officers and those with criminal records. Last month, he added blanket pardons for the white-collar instigators and fake electors who advanced those election lies — including his lawyers Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, and Sidney Powell. The rule of law doesn't apply to Trump loyalists.

	A boatload of connected big businessmen have also been getting presidential pardons. A former nursing home executive who was set to report to prison for tax crimes found himself off the hook after his mother attended a $1 million fundraiser for Trump that promised face-to-face access with the president. As The New York Times' Ken Vogel reported, the curiously timed pardon spared Paul Walczak from “having to pay nearly $4.4 million in restitution and from reporting to prison for an 18-month sentence that had been handed down just 12 days earlier. A judge had justified the incarceration by declaring that there ‘is not a get-out-of-jail-free card” for the rich.'”


	The judge spoke too soon. There are get-out-of-jail-free cards available to Trump supporters, for the right price.


	The CEO of the failed EV Truck company Nikola, a Utah billionaire named Trevor Milton, received a full pardon after being convicted for defrauding investors. It was surely just a coincidence that Trevor Milton and his wife gave almost a million dollars each to a Trump-backing Super PAC less than a month before the 2024 election. That's expensive but pardons are priceless.


	More notorious is the case of billionaire Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, dubbed “crypto's richest man,” who had previously pleaded guilty to money laundering that U.S. prosecutors said benefitted Hamas terrorists and Russian drug dealers. Zhao “rehabilitated” himself by helping to boost the Trump family's crypto venture, which “raked in about $1.4 billion in revenue over the past year … far more than the president's real-estate portfolio ever earned annually,” according to The Wall Street Journal. When Trump was asked about this shady pardon on 60 Minutes, he said he didn't know who Zhao was.

	But perhaps the most consistent beneficiaries of Trump's pardons and commutations have been corrupt politicians. This includes names associated with buffoonish corruption and fraud like George Santos, Rod Blagojevich, Michael Grimm, Duncan Hunter, and Duke Cunningham. It covers local elected Trump loyalists like Tennessee Statehouse Speaker Glenn Casada, who was convicted of fraud, and Las Vegas City Councilwoman Michele Fiore, who was convicted of using money raised for a memorial to slain police officers on personal expenses. As of this week you can add to this list conservative Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar, who was indicted by the Biden Justice Department for accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijani oil company and a Mexican bank.

	











	This list is exhausting but nowhere near exhaustive. Trump's pardon-palooza is not just fueled by his own bitterness at being America's first felon president, but also a desire for obsequious signs of fealty from the people he's let off the hook. Thanks to the Supreme Court's disastrous presidential immunity decision, there remains the specter of more pardons for anyone who puts loyalty to Trump ahead of loyalty to the Constitution. 


	There is a sickening rationalization creeping across our nation which says that sucking up to Donald Trump is just the cost of doing business in America at the moment. This decays the integrity of our democracy like acid. 


	When this insane era is over, we will need reforms that rein in the power of the executive, because many of the unwritten guardrails were rooted in a belief that virtue and character would be a self-corrective. The founders apparently did not anticipate an era in which shamelessness was considered a political superpower. 


	That's why we need to pursue reforms to stop the abuse of the pardon power. A constitutional amendment is the biggest lift, though both parties have howled at past pardons from opposition presidents. Representative Steve Cohen has put forward an amendment that would “clarify and limit” presidential pardons,  prohibiting self-pardons and pardons for actions that personally benefit the president or for crimes committed with a president. Sounds common sense enough even though the two-thirds threshold seems insurmountable in our stupid hyper-partisan era.

	A more achievable approach could be pursued through Congress, where a bill called the Abuse of Power Prevention Act would require that the Department of Justice and the president turn over details about the crimes and explain the pardon rationale to Congress, making it clear that the bribery statute applies to presidential pardons while also barring self-pardons. The website Just Security has a good write up about these options. 


	Trump's pardon spree is a daily scandal that is deforming the norms of our democracy. But populist anger over corruption is historically one of the forces that takes down would-be autocrats. People understand that corruption is fundamentally unfair as long as they understand how it affects their lives. So as you take in this list, just remember this: The rich, connected, and powerful are getting out of jail free cards under President Trump.

      I'm not American and I don't know your procedures in detail. However, I do know that whenever something alarming enough happens, various authorities rush to deny it, usually with a press conference, or at least to reassure public opinion.
    


      But now, after growing alarmism about national security due to the overflights of the infamous "drones" over sensitive areas and the strong accusations coming from authoritative figures against the main agencies involved in civil and military defense, has no one yet rushed to deny it? Can any US citizen explain to me how to interpret this attitude? Is it a prelude to other events, or is each government agency simply hiding behind its own hole? Thanks to anyone who can explain.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and credible cases:
    


Description: Over 60 children at Ariel School in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and a few beings emerging. The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and a documentary on YouTube provides more details.
    


Credibility: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out. It was investigated by a well known psychologist, you can find a documentary on YouTube so go check it out!"



Description: A Japanese pilot had a multi-hour documented encounter with a UFO that broke off into several smaller UFOs surrounding his plane. The incident was also tracked by ground radar.
    


Credibility: "JAL Flight 1628. This imo was just incredible. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well. The pilot was put on desk duty for speaking on this too, and for me it's hard to imagine a professional Japanese man to outright make this shit up."



Description: Military personnel at an Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in Rendlesham Forest. They even had audio tape recordings of the event.
    


Credibility: "Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO."



Description: Thousands of people in Arizona, including the governor, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights in the sky.
    


Credibility: "I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice). It was never given a reasonable explanation, and even our Governor at the time admits he was told to dismiss the story and make fun of it."



Description: Military personnel, radars, and a civilian plane encountered a UFO. The radar signature matched that of a Boeing 707, and instrumentation and communications failed when approaching the UFO.
    


Credibility: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO."



Description: Navy pilots encountered a white, tic-tac-shaped object that performed incredible maneuvers, captured on FLIR footage.
    


Credibility: "I think the Nimitz/tic tac sighting in 2004 is likely to have the most credence to a skeptic given the pilot testimony and FLIR footage."



Description: A security guard filmed a UFO over the Sea of Marmara in Turkey on multiple nights. The footage was investigated and determined to be authentic by a Turkish scientific agency.
    


Credibility: "As a Turkish person I experienced this when it happened, Turkish TV didn't give a damn, it was on news for 1 evening and thats it, it was investigated thoroughly and was determined authentic by TÜBİTAK..."



Description: The military had to use anti-aircraft weapons against a supposed "weather balloon" over Los Angeles.
    


Credibility: "The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'."



Description: Several witnesses saw a large object crash into the water off Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia.
    


Credibility: "Shag Harbour UFO incident"



Description: A woman and her son witnessed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights. She captured multiple images, and investigators found no clear signs of manipulation.
    


Credibility: "On February 1, 2003, in Weyauwega, Wisconsin, a woman and her son witnessed a disc-shaped craft with a triangular pattern of lights on its underside."

      French navy troops opened fire on unidentified drones over a military site housing nuclear submarines in the latest in a series of drone incursions into European airspace.
    


      According to French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), five drones were detected on Thursday night over the submarine base of Île Longue in Brittany, western France.
    


      It is a strategic military site and home to nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines – a key part of France's nuclear deterrent.
    


      So once again we have unidentified objects flying over nuclear bases, which presumably are protected by radar, visual and infrared sensors. Yet once again - no evidence produced to show that these are conventional drones.
    


      Is this Russia or something else?

Trump's new blueprint for international policy is racist and claims that Europe faces ‘civilization erasure' in a boost to far right and conspiracy theorists, says world affairs editor Sam Kiley

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

It's official. The US government believes that Europe faces “civilization erasure” and is already indulging in the “censorship of free speech and the suppression of opposition”.

This is not the latest social media post from a crank in the White House. This is the assessment of its finest minds who have just produced the 2025 National Security Strategy. This is the written version of how all in the White House must see the world and the means by which they intend to get the rest of us to view the planet.

“Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,” it says.

This is rubbish. There is no mainstream population analysis that shows that any European nation will ever become a majority “non-European”. 

The Trump administration is getting its demographic guidance on Europe from the so-called Great Replacement Theory – a term coined by French conspiracy theorist Renaud Camus, in which he argues that a "global elite" is colluding against the white population of Europe to replace them with non-European peoples.

It has a powerful following among far-right groups, Q-Anon fanatics and Maga supporters. And now it is the official long-term view of America itself. A view that underpins the US relationship with the West and the Anglo-sphere from now on.

So concerned is the US that it is going to lean in and force a change of direction on Europe by supporting groups which align closely with American policies and undermining those which do not.

“We will oppose elite-driven, anti-democratic restrictions on core liberties in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world, especially among our allies,” the document says.

The Trump administration is fighting Europe's Digital Services Act, which requires internet companies, mostly US-based like Meta, Apple, and Google, to moderate content, remove illegal or harmful content, and regulate disinformation. 

The White House has made allegations of “censorship” against European countries for their efforts to regulate companies that generate huge profits but are anxious that new regulations would be costly to police for them.

Vice President JD Vance is likely to have held the pen in creating the new doctrine from the White House. Its contents closely reflect his startling attacks on Nato and European democracy at his first trip in office to the continent in February. He also threw his weight behind far-right groups and parties then.

“America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the new document says.

The other influence on the document is likely to have been Vladimir Putin. 

His regime has become a beacon to many on the far right and Christian evangelicals who support Trump. His unashamed claims to represent traditional white Christian values are catnip to conspiracy fans of the great replacement theory.

Trump has backed Russia at every stage since returning to office. He has set his face against Europe's support for Kyiv and for arguments that show Ukraine can eject Russian forces if it gets the support it needs.

Trump has cut all aid except for intelligence support to Ukraine while demanding enormous 50 per cent shares in future profits for the US and US companies in any future Ukrainian peace deal.

Key to Putin's long-term strategy is to undermine Western diplomatic alliances and cohesion. Brexit was a major step in that direction – so was the re-election of Trump.

He, like Trump, seeks to amplify disinformation and doubt in Western civil society by claiming that governments, like Volodymyr Zelensky's administration in Ukraine, are illegitimate and undemocratic. Zelensky was elected by a landslide in 2019.

The new US foreign policy blueprint for the future claims that when it comes to Ukraine: “A large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.”

Democracy has been eviscerated in America with attacks on every branch of the federal administration, the media, academia and the military. Loyalty to the Oval Office now trumps any oath to uphold the constitution as a condition of employment among officials across the US.

While that persists and Trump writes outright lies into copper-plated national policy, it is no longer possible to see America as an ally, or even a frenemy.

Ostensibly grounded in Venusian wellness technology, the Integratron now provides a unique meditation experience for guests.

LANDERS, Calif. (CN) — One night in 1953, a strange man awoke George Van Tassel from his home in the Mojave Desert.

It was 2 a.m. The man, Solgonda, was a visitor from the planet Venus.

Although Van Tassel had nothing on but his underwear, Solgonda nonetheless invited him aboard his glittering spacecraft.

The experience naturally left a lasting impact on Van Tassel, a former Lockheed test flight inspector.

In newsletters to his fellow believers, Van Tassel explained how Solgonda had given him information about a technology that could rejuvenate the human body.

Later that year, Van Tassel began work constructing it.

His otherworldly instructions forbade any metal. Instead, he only used wood and glue.

The result: the Integratron, a 38-foot-high, 55-foot-wide dome outside of Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California.

Whatever one makes of Van Tassel's galactic tales, this striking white dome has earned a listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Advertised as a “fusion of art, science and magic,” it's become a tourist destination for the curious, the skeptical and the true believers.

Now under new management, the Integratron these days is mostly known as a retreat for sound bath meditation.****Van Tassel's parabolic design is said to be acoustically perfect, with sounds evenly balanced throughout the room.

In Van Tassel's time, the Integratron was ostensibly a research laboratory for an organization he called the College of Universal Wisdom. He imagined it as part of a larger campus dedicated to UFO research and metaphysics.

After he died in 1978, the property bounced between various owners, including his widow. In 2000, sisters Joanne, Nancy and Patty Karl bought it for sound bath therapy.

Although sound baths are more grounded in science from Earth, the Karl sisters nonetheless lean into Integratron's unique history, with Van Tassel and his beliefs featuring prominently on an official website. The sisters continue to operate the landmark today.

Visiting for a sound bath on a recent afternoon was a diverse crowd. There were crystal-collecting yogis, as well as curious retirees vacationing at nearby Joshua Tree National Park.

When it was time, the Integratron's stewards ushered their guests into a rustic first-floor room inside the large domed building. The exposed Douglas fir walls and faint faint scent of palo santo are a marked contrast to its bright, futuristic exterior. After some instructions, the group ascended a steep staircase to the second floor where the baths take place.

There are some rules at the Integratron. No shoes, no talking and absolutely no snoring. Phones must be not only silent but powered off completely.

That's in large part because of the building's unique acoustics, which allow a whisper on one side of the building to be easily heard on the other.

“There are no secrets in the Integratron,” sound therapist Kristine Atkinson told the group as they settled onto their mats.

Sitting near the front of the room, Atkinson surrounded herself with 22 white crystalline singing bowls ranging in size from mixing bowl to garden planter.

Singing bowls like these are said to calm the mind and are often used in meditation practices. Although they can veer into alternative wellness and are not the panacea that some proponents claim, a growingbody of evidence suggests that auditory meditation does have real benefits, including improved mood, sleep and pain management.

“It's like nutrition for your nervous system,” Atkinson told the group. “No two bowls are the same, so it is a process. You have to develop an ear for the space.”

In the dead center of the Integratron, right under its vertex, is a small patch known as the “magic square.”

Because of the acoustic effect of the building's dome, sound waves effectively gather here, becoming louder for listeners in the center as sounds echo off the curved walls. Atkinson invited each guest to stand in the magic square and say something they were grateful for.

Atkinson gently rubbed the edge of the bowls with wooden dowels, creating a low humming sound.

Some guests covered themselves with small blankets and put sleeping masks over their eyes. Atkinson instructed the group to take a few deep breaths.

For around 45 minutes, she ran her dowel along her various singing bowls, creating different pitches. They got louder, their ringing tones vibrating and bouncing off the circular frame of the Integratron.

Sometimes the bowls were quiet. At other times the warbling sound was loud and guttural, as though the Venusians were back and hovering their spacecraft just outside of the building.

A couple of snores broke the silence but were quickly hushed. Then the sound bath was over.

In a brief interview afterwards, Atkinson explained how the bowls are arranged according to the seven chakras in the human body — starting with a C note corresponding to the root chakra at the bottom of the spine and working down to a B note for the crown chakra at the top of the head.

One visitor — Irina Contreras, a Los Angeles resident on a trip to Joshua Tree — explained how images came to her as the singing bowls increased in pitch and volume.

“I cycled through all these thoughts. I kept on seeing stone,” Contreras explained. There were more images carved in the stone, “and then I saw someone's face, and then I got a little freaked out.”

“I think that different spaces have more dimensionality than we're able to put language to,” Contreras added. “We're very stuck in this kind of 2D, 3D world.”

Also visiting from Los Angeles, Phoebe Darling said she'd participated in sound baths before, but none as immersive as this.

As the bowls began to sing, Darling said she could feel physical sensations inside of her.

“The first one, it felt like a little bit of pain,” she said. “I wasn't expecting the physical reactions.”

For Darling, the unique setting of the Integratron is a big part of the draw.

“It's the merger of my favorite things,” she said: “aliens and spirituality and hippie stuff.”

Atkinson, Nancy Karl's daughter, has been working with singing bowls for 10 years. Trained by her mother and aunt Joanne, she says it took her about a year to learn the technique.

Although the Karl sisters didn't take ownership of the Integratron until 2000, their roots at this place stretch back further. According to Atkinson, her mother and aunt had left corporate jobs to lead wilderness meditation retreats when, in 1986, a friend suggested they check out this unique landmark.

The Karls have turned the Integratron into more of a UFO-themed meditation retreat while paying tribute to its original DNA. In a statement, they said they have “deep respect for Van Tassel's gift to humanity and his commitment to frequency, vibration and human potential.”

Asked whether they'd had their own UFO experiences like Van Tassel did, Atkinson was circumspect.

“Let's just say we've had experiences that expanded our understanding of what's possible,” she wrote in an email.

Van Tassel left his job at Lockheed in 1947, when he was 37 years old. With his wife and children, he moved to the Mojave Desert to run an airport and cafe.

1947 was the same year a mysterious craft crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, igniting America's fascination with UFOs. Van Tassel certainly had an interest in otherworldly topics. Around that time, he started holding weekly meditation meetings under Giant Rock, a free-standing boulder in the region that was once a meeting point for Indigenous people. He even lived beneath it for a period.

In 1952, the year before he said he met Solgonda, Van Tassel said he was telepathically contacted by another Venusian, Lutbunn, who was interested in his group's activities.

According to Van Tassel's newsletter, these benevolent, egalitarian beings resided in highly developed technological societies on the moon, Mars, Venus and even farther-flung planets.

Like Van Tassel, they were critical of the materialistic and aggressive behavior of humans on Earth. Though he described himself a Christian, Van Tassel did not like what he called “Churchianity.” In his newsletters, he wrote that human civilization was going down a dark path.

Unsurprisingly for the Cold War era, the United States government took an interest in this unusual man who was operating an air strip and lecturing about secret technologies. Was he a communist?

The FBI investigated, then seemed to lose interest. In a now disclosed file, agents cast him as simply a “dirty and unkempt” restaurant and airport owner.

“He has been described as eccentric and [an] apparent mental case,” they concluded.

Nonetheless, Van Tassel was among a small but growing group of people in the United States who believed in the existence of intelligent life in space. His meditation gatherings eventually evolved into an annual convention for the UFO-curious.

Van Tassel himself is harder to pin down. He was an artist, scientist, and philosopher who thought as much about society as technology. More curious than culty, the beings he wrote about have nonetheless been described as angelic. Atkinson sums up his thinking with a favorite quote by him: “Science and religion are two sides of the same wall.”

It's not exactly clear how the Integratron was supposed to work. According to the Integratron's official website, Van Tassel “claimed that the structure is based on the design of Moses' Tabernacle, the writings of Nikola Tesla and telepathic directions from extraterrestrials.”

Copies of Van Tassel's newsletter, “Proceedings of the College of Universal Wisdom,” are available online for anyone hoping to decipher the Venusian technology.

According to documents from the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, the “primary function” was “as a negative ion-producing cell regenerator.”

The Integratron's stewards aren't quite sure what that means, either. Ostensibly, the dome's upper level can collect and store energy, which is then directed downward to the first floor for visitors to receive. Van Tassel believed the building would be critical for other breakthroughs too, including time travel and the anti-gravity fields needed to run flying saucers.

In a sense, Van Tassel's Integratron is an incomplete project. And yet with this unusual and beautiful structure, he created something genuinely special, a monument to possibility and wonder in an uncertain universe.

Today, people of all ages, backgrounds and interests visit this strange building in the desert. Thousands are drawn in each year. According to Atkinson, the building has become a destination for meditators, audio professionals, scientists, Tibetan monks, artists and veterans with PTSD, among many others. And thus there is the Integratron as it stands today: part laboratory, part temple and part unanswered question.

A massive new sunspot complex, dubbed AR 4294-4296, has emerged on the sun and is facing directly at Earth. The dark patch is on par with the infamous sunspot that birthed the 1859 Carrington Event — but, for now, it's staying quiet.

A gigantic cluster of sunspots — collectively around the same size as the one that birthed the largest solar storm in recorded history — has just emerged on the sun's Earth-facing side, and is now pointed directly at our planet. But don't panic! While auroras and some technological disturbances are possible over the coming week, the new sunspot complex seems unlikely to unleash a second Carrington Event.

The complex, dubbed AR 4294-4296, is made up of two different sunspot groups, AR 4294, and AR 4296, that are magnetically intertwined. It first became visible on Nov. 28, when it rotated onto the sun's Earth-facing side on our home star's western limb. However, the dark patches were first spotted around a week earlier by NASA's Perseverance Mars rover, which was spying on the sun's far side relative to Earth.

AR 4294-4296 is around the same size as a giant sunspot observed by British astronomer Richard Carrington in September 1859, which subsequently birthed the "Carrington Event" — the biggest solar storm ever seen by humans. The image above, first shared by Spaceweather.com on Dec. 2, shows the sunspot complex alongside Carrington's sketch of the giant 19th-century behemoth. At first glance, the new sunspot complex appears to be larger. However, in reality, its dark spots cover an area of the solar surface around 90% the size of the Carrington sunspot.

Sunspots have the capacity to unleash powerful blasts of radiation, or solar flares, when their invisible magnetic field lines contort and snap, unleashing energy into space. These explosive outbursts can trigger temporary radio blackouts on Earth and launch massive, fast-moving clouds of plasma, or coronal mass ejections (CMEs), at our planet. When this happens, it can subsequently cause disturbances in our planet's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic storms, which can interfere with electronics and paint vibrant auroras in the night sky.

The new dark patches are "one of the biggest sunspot groups of the past 10 years" and have the capacity to unleash supercharged X-class flares — the most powerful type on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's solar flare categorization system — Spaceweather.com representatives recently wrote. If it does blow and unleashes a CME, then the resulting solar storm "will be geoeffective," they added.

 




The Carrington Event unleashed an estimated X45 magnitude solar flare in 1859, which remains a record, although there is geological evidence that even more powerful blasts occurred long before humans emerged. For context, an X45 flare is more than five times stronger than the most powerful solar flare of the last decade — an X7 blast in October 2024.

If an equally powerful blast impacted Earth today, the radiation would knock out every satellite in orbit around our planet, recent simulations revealed. It would also wreak havoc on the ground, potentially damaging parts of the electrical grid. Experts estimate that the total damages would easily exceed $1 trillion.

If AR 4294-4296 is close in size to the sunspot that birthed the Carrington Event, that means a huge solar storm is likely, right? Well, yes and no.

Larger sunspots do have the potential to launch more powerful solar flares. For example, the sunspot that birthed a geomagnetic "superstorm" in May 2024 was more than 15 times wider than Earth. However, with sunspots, size isn't everything.

Whether or not a sunspot reaches its maximum explosive potential is also tied to the configuration of its magnetic field and the frequency with which it explodes, meaning that some giant sunspots can be completely harmless.

The magnetic fields of AR 4294-4296 are quite entangled, meaning that flares are possible, and the complex has already unleashed a potential X-class flare while still on the sun's farside, according to Spaceweather.com. However, despite this, experts say there is no clear sign of a superstorm on par with the Carrington Event in the immediate future.

Scientists will be keeping a particularly close eye on the magnetic field of the latest behemoth for signs of incoming activity. But if it happens to rotate past Earth without any outbursts, the hefty dark spots are likely large enough to survive more than one trip around the sun, meaning they could be back for "round two" sometime closer to Christmas.

—Invisible 'flickering' on the sun could predict potentially dangerous solar flares hours in advance

—We are fast approaching the sun's 'battle zone' — and it could be even worse than solar maximum, experts warn

The sun has been particularly active in recent years, because it has recently been in the most active phase of its roughly 11-year solar cycle, known as solar maximum.

That has fueled several recent X-class flares, including two back-to-back explosions, which triggered a G4 (severe) geomagnetic storm between Nov. 11-12. In fact, 2024 had the highest number of X-class flares in a single year since modern records began in 1996.

A lot of these flares have triggered geomagnetic storms on Earth, including the extreme disturbance in May 2024, which was the most powerful of its kind for 21 years and triggered some of the most widespread auroras in centuries.

For decades, helium has been produced with natural gas, generating huge carbon emissions. Now, geologists are looking for new helium sources — and finding enormous "carbon-free" reservoirs that could revolutionize the industry.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In 1903, residents of the small town of Dexter, Kansas, gathered to celebrate a newly drilled natural gas well.

Crowds flocked to the well for the lighting of the escaping gas, which officials had said would produce "a great pillar of flame." But when they rolled a burning bale of hay onto the well, nothing happened.

An analysis in 1905 revealed that most of the gas was nonflammable nitrogen, just 15% was methane — and a little less than 2% was a colorless, odorless, elusive element that scientists had discovered only a few decades earlier. This marked the first discovery of helium in a natural gas field.

Helium is the second-most-abundant element in the universe after hydrogen, yet it is scarce on Earth. Helium does not react with other elements, and it mostly accumulates in Earth's crust as radioactive uranium and thorium decay, which takes billions of years. Because it takes much longer to replenish helium reserves than it does to deplete them, helium is a nonrenewable resource.

The discovery in Dexter paved the way for the helium industry, which mushroomed during World War I as fighting countries realized that helium was an excellent way to lift military airships. Unlike hydrogen-filled airships, those carrying helium didn't explode when the enemy shot them down. And helium's properties, particularly its ability to be liquid at close to absolute zero (minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 273.15 degrees Celsius), meant it could cool machine parts like engines and magnets better than any other element could.

Today, helium is an essential cooling component in nuclear reactors, rockets and medical diagnostic equipment such as MRI machines. The gas keeps fiber optics, superconductors, quantum computers and semiconductors cool, but skyrocketing demand has pushed supply chains to their limit, resulting in a global shortage that has persisted for more than a decade. Helium extraction also has a huge carbon footprint — almost equivalent to the U.K.'s per year — because currently, it is exclusively produced together with natural gas.

However, in recent years, pioneering discoveries have led to a pivotal change in scientists' understanding of the geology that helps helium accumulate. Researchers have uncovered reservoirs of primary, "carbon-free" helium — large accumulations of the gas that are highly concentrated and don't contain methane — that could revolutionize the industry.

This new understanding has fueled exploration projects in a handful of regions around the world. From Yellowstone to Greenland to the East African Rift, a helium "rush" is starting to address shortages and helium's enormous carbon footprint.

"It's a new industry," Thomas Abraham-James, co-founder and CEO of the exploration company Pulsar Helium, told Live Science.

After World War I, helium discoveries multiplied and the U.S. emerged as the world's leading producer. Gas wells with helium levels of 0.3% and above were tapped to fuel a growing number of industries and form a stockpile, the Federal Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas. (The stockpile was sold in 2024 to the industrial gas firm Messer.)

But helium has been produced only as a minor byproduct, usually found in tiny amounts mixed in with natural gases such as methane.

That's because gases like methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) are required to transport helium from the middle part of Earth's crust to shallower regions, Chris Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford, told Live Science in an email.

 




Helium forms in the top 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Earth's crust when uranium and thorium break down into other radioactive elements, emitting alpha particles, or helium nuclei, in the process. These helium nuclei gain two electrons from atoms in their environment to form helium atoms, which then migrate and gradually collect in groundwater down to 10 miles (16 km) below Earth's surface, Ballentine said.

But for helium atoms to form a gas, they need to reach their "bubble point" — the concentration of a dissolved gas in a liquid required to make buoyant gas bubbles. Helium in groundwater rarely accumulates in sufficient quantities to reach this bubble point, Ballentine said. So other, more ubiquitous gases, like methane and CO2, are typically needed to entrain helium and form the bubbles that rise toward geological traps, Ballentine said.

These geological traps are often natural gas fields. But helium also gets trapped, because natural gas fields often have strong seals, research suggests.

 




Natural gas reservoirs form beneath layers of fine-grained "cap" rocks "and minerals. In Australia's Amadeus Basin, for example, helium and natural gas are locked beneath a thick layer of salt, which is a "perfect" seal, Jon Gluyas, a professor of geoenergy, carbon capture and storage at Durham University in the U.K., told Live Science.

Most places, however, don't have a perfectly sealed reservoir to trap helium underground, so the gas escapes into the atmosphere. "All systems are leaky," Gluyas said. As a result, most regions with helium-producing rocks emit some helium, so "if you went out with a sensitive enough instrument, you would find it," he said.

Helium's association with natural gas means producers can extract both at the same time, but this approach has major drawbacks. For one, the helium industry currently has an indirect carbon footprint of about 350 million tons (320 million metric tons) per year, which is bigger than all but 20 countries' carbon footprints.

A second downside is that countries with natural gas deposits and the companies drilling these deposits control the world's supply of helium. The U.S. used to dominate global helium production, but Qatar took the lead in 2022. Depending on other countries for helium introduces risks related to regional geopolitics, Gluyas said. Algeria and Russia are also leading helium producers, raising similar concerns.

But the biggest problem with helium extraction is that natural gas contains minuscule amounts of helium. In the U.S., the lower profitable limit to separate helium from natural gas is 0.3%, but some countries with different production and transport methods have much smaller thresholds. For example, Algeria's Hassi R'Mel gas field contains 0.19% helium and Qatar's North Dome deposits contain 0.04% helium, yet both countries extract helium at these locations.

Data show that only about 1 in 6 natural gas reservoirs in the U.S. has helium levels higher than 0.3% and that levels above 7% are extremely rare, meaning economically useful helium concentrations are the exception in the U.S.

The trend is similar in other countries. So when scientists found a nitrogen gas reservoir that contained up to 10.4% helium in Tanzania in 2016, they were flabbergasted. The gas was bubbling out of the ground in the Rukwa Rift Basin, which is located on a divergent plate boundary called the East African Rift.

Crucially, the Rukwa Rift Basin doesn't have reservoirs of natural gas or other hydrocarbons. This was the first major confirmed discovery of a hydrocarbon-free helium reservoir, and it sparked an ongoing worldwide hunt for other such reservoirs.

Ballentine, Gluyas and Abraham-James were part of the team that made the discovery in Tanzania. "The approach we adopted essentially is similar to that which any explorer would use for petroleum — we went looking for seeps," Gluyas said. Helium seeps are "all over the show," he said, but locating them is trickier than finding petroleum because helium is odorless, colorless and usually at low concentrations.

From then on, researchers and exploration companies tried to determine whether known helium seeps led to hydrocarbon-free reservoirs with high concentrations of the noble gas. In 2021, for example, the exploration company Pulsar Helium acquired land near Babbitt, Minnesota, where a company searching for nickel had previously found gas with high helium concentrations. Pulsar Helium drilled a well down to 2,200 feet (670 meters) in early 2024 and found a huge gas reservoir with helium concentrations up to 14.5% — the highest the industry has ever seen in North America.

 




The other gases in the reservoir were nitrogen and CO2. But the site contains no natural gas, so it counts as a primary helium accumulation, Pulsar Helium representatives say. CO2 concentrations were above 70%, but the company views this as an opportunity rather than a problem, because the gas is pure enough to be used for carbonated beverages, water treatment, food preservation and medicine.

The more reservoirs of hydrocarbon-free helium that researchers and companies find, the more information they learn about the geology that forms these reservoirs. Shortly after the discovery in Tanzania, geologists identified five key conditions needed to form accumulations of helium without natural gas.

First, the region must have helium-producing rocks miles below the surface. The best helium source rocks are ones that contain uranium or thorium, and are usually composed entirely of crystallized minerals, Gluyas, Ballentine and their colleagues wrote in a 2024 article for the Energy Geoscience Conference Series.

That's because crystalline rocks solidify from magma cooling extremely slowly underground. This unhurried process concentrates radioactive uranium and thorium, which are unstable elements in mineral structures and therefore among the last to be incorporated. Granite is one of the best helium sources, Ballentine said.

Ideally, the rocks should also be hundreds of millions to billions of years old, because the radioactive versions of uranium and thorium that decay into alpha particles have half lives of 4.5 billion and 14 billion years, respectively, according to the article. That means it would take that long for half of a sample of those elements to decay into helium. As a result, it takes millions of years to accumulate enough helium to fill a large reservoir.

The second criterion needed to form a hydrocarbon-free helium reservoir is a heat source around the rocks.

Normally, helium is frozen in a mineral's lattice structure because that structure is "blocked" — or doesn't exchange molecules with its surroundings. For minerals to release that helium, they must exceed their "closure temperature" — the temperature at which the lattice becomes unblocked. That temperature varies, but can be above about 160 F (70 C) for one of the most common helium-containing minerals.

Often the source of heat is volcanism or geothermal heat, so hydrocarbon-free helium reservoirs typically occur in regions where there is, or once was, volcanism. Beneath the Rukwa Rift Basin, for example, eastern Africa is pulling away from the rest of the continent, causing magma to rise to the surface. Similarly, Pulsar Helium's exploration site in Minnesota sits on an ancient tear in North America's crust called the Midcontinent Rift System. This rift system started and then failed about 1.1 billion years ago, producing intense volcanic activity during the roughly 100,000 years it was active.

 




The third condition to form a hydrocarbon-free helium reservoir is the presence of nitrogen in groundwater, because nitrogen bubbles can transport helium upward through the crust in the same way methane and CO2 bubbles can, while completely removing greenhouse gases.

The fourth condition is the need for relatively airtight "cap rocks" that sit near the surface above the helium-forming rocks in Earth's crust. That's because when nitrogen reaches its bubble point, it captures helium atoms and taxies them until the gases either escape into the atmosphere or are trapped. But for that to happen, the cap rocks must form an impermeable seal.

The fifth and final condition is that these cap rocks must sit atop fractured, porous "reservoir" rocks that can store gas, Ballentine, Gluyas and their colleagues wrote in the 2024 article.

The growth rate of a reservoir depends on the rates at which gases enter from below and escape via cracks in the seal, the researchers wrote. The more helium that enters a reservoir and the less that escapes through the seal, the bigger an accumulation can get. In other words, reservoirs ideally have porous or highly fragmented rocks down below, and nonporous, intact rocks above.

Helium reservoirs with impermeable seals can hold gases for long periods of geological time. For example, the link between the reservoir in Minnesota and the Midcontinent Rift System suggests helium has been building up there for 1.1 billion years.

Pulsar Helium recently announced that it will start engineering work for a helium production plant at its site in Minnesota, signaling that hydrocarbon-free, U.S.-produced helium could reach the market in just a few years.

Early this year, the company more than doubled the depth of its first well to reach the bottom of the reservoir and drilled a second well down to 5,638 feet (1,718 m). Tests over the summer showed high flow rates to the surface and stable helium concentrations of up to 8% at both wells, "providing a robust foundation for future development," Abraham-James said in a September statement. Since then, Pulsar Helium has drilled an additional well down to 3,507 feet (1,069 m) and opened two more wells.

Pulsar Helium is also progressing with a helium project in East Greenland — the first helium discovery on the island, Abraham-James told Live Science.

"What we've learned in Minnesota and elsewhere, we then applied it to Greenland and we found the helium there," he said. "Like Minnesota, its helium is not associated with hydrocarbons. We conducted a seismic survey last year, and that went some ways to mapping the reservoir."

 




Located about 3 miles (5 km) from the coastal settlement of Ittoqqortoormiit, the site in East Greenland looks promising for helium and geothermal energy production, which could limit the settlement's dependency on fossil fuels, Abraham-James said. Mapping in 2024 revealed a zone of crust with temperatures reaching 266 F (130 C), as well as a fractured reservoir that researchers linked to gas emissions at the surface containing up to 0.8% helium, according to a statement from Pulsar Helium.

Any helium produced in East Greenland would likely go to the local community, Abraham-James said. Similarly, helium produced in Minnesota would be sold inside the U.S. to supply MRI scanners, semiconductor fabrication and space launches, he said.

Helium shortages in the U.S. have eased somewhat since early 2024, partly thanks to additional supplies from natural gas fields, said Nicholas Fitzkee, a professor of chemistry at Mississippi State University. "But having a larger domestic supply would be valuable, because it could insulate the U.S. from geopolitical instabilities that have contributed to past helium shortages," Fitzkee told Live Science in an email.

Halfway across the globe, prospecting in Tanzania is also ongoing, with two exploration companies currently reporting helium levels of 5.5% and 2.46% at different ends of the Rukwa Rift Basin. Called Helium One Global and Noble Helium, these companies are still in the early phases of exploration, Gluyas said.

"Both Helium One and Noble Helium have successfully shown elevated concentrations of helium in the wells they've drilled," he said. But these wells don't provide a clear picture of the reservoir yet, and the reservoir may not end up fulfilling researchers' expectations.

"They could speculate, based upon the seismic information, what the geometry of the accumulation might be, but they haven't yet drilled sufficient wells to say, 'It really is that,'" Gluyas said.

Beyond Tanzania, there may be opportunities for helium exploration in India's Bakreswar-Tantloi geothermal area, which is located in the east of the country and straddles the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand. The Bakreswar-Tantloi area sits on ancient granitic rocks that are rich in uranium and therefore produce helium. The region also has a fault system and a high heat gradient as a result of ongoing tectonic activity along the Son-Narmada-Tapti rift zone, research suggests.

Closer to home, researchers are analyzing the conditions for potential helium accumulations beneath and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is rooted in the Wyoming Craton, a prehistoric region of crust and upper mantle that contains 3.5 billion-year-old rocks known to produce huge quantities of helium. Thanks to Yellowstone's countless geothermal features and volcanic structures, helium may be accumulating in reservoirs beneath or peripheral to the park, although it's more likely that the gas is circulating and escaping into the atmosphere through a complex system of natural pipes.

"What's happened over the millions or hundreds of millions of years in the area in which Yellowstone occurs is that helium has been building up, and now in the last [roughly] 5 million years, the supervolcano beneath is flushing it out," Gluyas explained.

—Massive hydrogen reservoir discovered beneath an Albanian mine could be an untapped source of clean energy

—Giant reserves of 'gold' hydrogen may be lurking beneath at least 30 US states, 1st-of-its-kind map reveals

—Scientists just discovered an enormous lithium reservoir under Pennsylvania

That means the chances of extracting this helium are remote, not least because of the scorching temperatures of up to 275 F (135 C) that drillers would encounter belowground. "Will your drilling equipment survive? Almost certainly not," Gluyas said.

But beyond Yellowstone, it's important for existing hydrocarbon-free helium projects to complete their evaluations and start selling the gas as soon as possible, Gluyas said. "There is a huge need for helium," he said.

However, Fitzkee sees another way forward — rolling out technologies that can recycle or lower our helium consumption. That could be through installing helium recovery systems or engineering room-temperature alternatives to current helium-hungry technologies, he added.

Topping up our helium supply is a good stopgap solution, but not a permanent fix, he argued.

"Ultimately, we cannot mine our way out of future helium shortages," he said. "Helium is non-renewable, and we have no easy way to make more at scale."

On Friday, December 5, Logan Paul wrote a lengthy tweet about one of his team members spotting a potential UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena) in the sky on Thursday evening. 

Attaching a screenshot of his text message exchange with Jorge in his tweet, the podcaster spoke about an "Orb shoot straight up into the sky above the marina in Puerto Rico," which Jorge was convinced was an "hyper-advanced technology."

Yesterday at 6:29pm, my teammate Jorge texted me saying he'd just watched an Orb shoot straight up into the sky above the marina in Puerto Rico.

He was shaken, convinced he'd witnessed some kind of hyper-advanced technology

Today, totally randomly, we walked into a small local… pic.twitter.com/E3YhMnsflZ

Paul then connected that conversation to the next day, when the owner of a local pizza store he walked into mentioned a similar incident, describing it as "a bright light flying across the sky". The owner also provided him with a video he took of the sighting, which was timestamped around the same time as Jorge's text message to him. 

Logan's tweet concluded by meeting the son of the pizza store owner - something the little one had wished for upon the UAP, believing it to be a star.

The tweet has since gone viral with over 1.1 million views.

Elsewhere, Logan Paul has been making headlines for suggesting that President Trump might be making a surprise appearance at John Cena's final match. 

According to Marca, Paul acknowledged conversations about Trump possibly attending the WWE star's retirement match, while stressing that nothing is confirmed yet. He said:

For the unversed, John Cena's final match is scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C.'s Capital One Arena next week, on December 13. It will mark the conclusion of his yearlong retirement tour, titled The Last Time Is Now. 

WWE's CEO, Nick Khan praised Cena's attitude as "unparalleled" on the Impaulsive podcast, adding:



As the event nears, the prices for the final match have also been surging. On Wednesday, the cheapest seats in the arena were priced at $241 on Ticketmaster.

The opponent of the 17-time world champion for his final match will be disclosed on Friday evening on SmackDown.

Misha Collins' remarks appeared to be greeted with enthusiastic cheering at the Brazil event, leading the actor to reply, "So, not a big MAGA crowd here?"


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Supernatural fans made it clear that they were thrilled about the cast's latest reunion — and that was even before a barb about President Donald Trump seemed to conjure up positive feelings from the boisterous crowd. 


	Former co-stars Misha Collins, Kathryn Newton, Jim Beaver and Rob Benedict, along with show director Richard Speight Jr., took the stage at CCXP in São Paulo on Thursday to celebrate 20 years of the series that launched in 2006. Among those who were not on hand for the reunion were Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who starred as the demon-hunting Winchester brothers on the show that signed off in November 2020 after 15 seasons.

	Fans of the show packed the floor of the São Paulo Expo to get a glimpse of the program's team, and the crowd made their excitement known with loud and frequent cheers. This included singing along to Kansas' “Carry on Wayward Son” during the event's introduction, given that the classic rock tune became a signature song for the show. 


	“When we're back home in the U.S., nobody pays any attention to us anymore,” Collins told the crowd. “But here, there must be a lag or something because you still know what Supernatural is.” 


	The actor known for playing Castiel got a big response just before the end of the panel with a politically charged response to a fan question. After someone in the crowd asked Newton, who recurred as Claire on the series, what kind of monster she would want to face, the actress chose dragons. But Collins seized the moment to comment on the current presidential administration.

	











	“You mean like, what kind of an evil monster character would we want to go up against?” Collins asked for clarification. “I think it'd be fun to take on Donald Trump.” 


	This spurred a significant cheer from the onlookers, leading Collins to add, “We've found our people. So, not a big MAGA crowd here?” The moderator did not respond to his remarks and promptly moved along to a video portion of the event.


	Earlier in the conversation, the moderator asked Newton what she would imagine Claire might be doing if the character were to ever get a spinoff. “I'm sure Claire's out there, still kicking ass and taking names,” Newton responded. “There's always going to be monsters, and somebody's always got to find them.”
