                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steady purchasing demand at Bitcoin's lower support levels is keeping the pressure on the $95,000 BTC resistance zone. Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that there were more than $9 in realized profits for every dollar realized in loss. However, a positive sign in favor of bulls is that the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessed inflows of $1.8 billion last week, per Farside Investors data. What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? The S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week and rose above the 50-day simple moving average (5,575). The 20-day exponential moving average (5,501) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to buyers. The up move could reach 5,800, which is expected to attract strong selling by the bears. If the price turns down from 5,800, it is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening. Buyers are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, but a minor positive is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. If that happens, the index could rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 101.39 and then to the 50-day SMA (102.72). This positive view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below the 99 level. Buyers will have to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA to keep the bullish momentum intact. Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals the bulls are rushing to the exit. Buyers have managed to sustain Ether (ETH) above the moving averages, signaling strength. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be crossed. A break and close below the moving averages opens the gates for a fall to $1,537 and later to the critical support at $1,368. XRP (XRP) remains stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies. Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3, suggesting a short-term trend change. On the contrary, a break and close below $2 will put the sellers in charge. BNB (BNB) slipped below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels. If buyers push the price above the moving averages, it suggests buying at lower levels. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could shoot up to $644. Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it suggests that the bears are trying to take control. There is support in the $576 to $566 zone, but if it breaks down, the pair could dive to $520. Solana (SOL) is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($143), indicating that the bulls remain buyers on dips. Such a move brings the large $110 to $260 range into play. That suggests the pair may consolidate between $110 and $153 for a while. Related: XRP price risks 45% decline to $1.20 — Here is why Buyers have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the moving averages but failed to start a strong rebound. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $0.75. That opens the doors for a rally to $0.83. There is solid support at $0.58, but if the level gives way, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to $0.50. Sui (SUI) is attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.09), indicating demand at lower levels. A break and close above $3.90 could catapult the SUI/USDT pair to $4.25 and later to $5. That may pull the price to $2.86 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.57).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dubai, UAE, May  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BitUtility has officially launched its initial utility NFT, labeled "Peacock." The team proposes a way to tear down the hassle wall standing between users' crypto wallets and their monthly bills. Rather  than wasting time on bridges/exchanges and having to deal with relevant  fees, BitUtility brings its one-click system to the market. Any bill  (from electricity to phone, and even rent) can be paid with crypto in a  matter of a few seconds with BitUtility. In fact, token holders will forever pay 0% fees, get  early-bird access to new features, and have a say in the project's  roadmap through shared governance. It connects to thousands of service providers globally, such as: - Electricity, gas, and water bills (more generally, utility bills)- Mobile plans and top-ups- Rent, insurance, and financial services- Flight bookings, accommodation arrangements, eSIMs,- Gift cards to large international brands- Government services in supported jurisdictionsPayments come in through supported crypto wallets only. The  team believes that paying bills with crypto should not be a maze of  middlemen and hidden fees. BitUtility turns this mechanism into a quick  and low-cost click. It will also  be possible to simply resell the NFT later, combining today's utility of  owning the token with tomorrow's market value. The  Peacock NFT was created for freelancers, DAO contributors, and remote  workers who earn income in crypto. It offers lifetime access to zero-fee  payments and also includes: The  Peacock NFT was not created with speculation in mind. The  main strength of this NFT is that it aims to bring a definite economic  purpose. In fact, Peacock NFT lowers expenses of crypto-based living and  connects long-term value to actual financial activity. These problems  include cross-border remittances, expensive transfer fees, and limited  merchant acceptance. The  site eliminates friction by making any crypto wallet a global payment  gateway. For those  living in crypto, it presents a working replacement to fiat bank  systems. BitUtility  users are shaping upcoming product integrations and governance of the  platform. Minting of the Peacock NFT will soon be live. BitUtility  is a Web3 utility payments platform built to make everyday life truly  crypto-native. Instead of shuffling coins through bridges, swaps, banks,  and hidden 5–10 % fees, BitUtility lets users pay any utility bill  (electricity, rent, phone, groceries) in one direct click from their  wallet. Early  supporters can mint the limited Peacock NFT, which locks in 0% lifetime  fees, earns a share of protocol revenues, and gives holders voting power  over new services. As  more people choose BitUtility to skip fees and complexity, demand for  fee‑free Peacock passes rises too. The system turns an everyday  cost‑saver into an asset that can grow and be resold, effectively  letting users own a piece of the payment rail they use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sometimes, it's all about sharp timing and clear action. As BlockDAG's presale moves toward its final phase, this win sends a clear message, momentum is building, and acting fast can still lead to big rewards. BlockDAG's Buyer Battle system proves that smart entries can make a huge difference. With total volume not peaking, wallet 0x932c...bde used that to their advantage. By committing to a 1.69 million BDAG buy, they outpaced others and secured the top spot, plus a hefty reward from the day's unclaimed bonus pool. It's designed to benefit those who act with purpose. Unlike standard ICOs, BlockDAG encourages competitive participation where top buyers can grow their holdings faster. April 28's result shows how even a mid-volume day can deliver outsized returns. With more than 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold and $226 million raised, interest is growing rapidly. The current presale batch, Batch 28, is priced at $0.0262, but buyers still have until May 13 to lock in tokens at the special $0.0019 rate. That spread signals a clear value for anyone joining in now. Early-stage buyers have already seen a 2,520% return, and new buyers still stand to gain from the pricing gap and active reward systems. With its blend of fixed deadlines, aggressive bonus incentives, and rising demand, BlockDAG presents more than just another cryptocurrency ICO. It's a well-timed opportunity for buyers to benefit from smart entry and active participation. As May 13 approaches, BlockDAG is entering its final presale push. This creates urgency for those who want to take advantage of the current value gap and still compete in daily Buyer Battles. With referral bonuses, leaderboard rewards, and interactive features, participants can earn more than just tokens, they're part of a growing ecosystem that values active contributors. For those arriving late, the chance isn't over yet. Strategic buyers still have time to climb the leaderboard, especially on days when volume is moderate. As exchange listings announcements draw near, BlockDAG offers a final entry path that blends accessibility with real potential, something rare in traditional ICOs. Wallet 0x932c...bde's April 28 win of 1.69 million BDAG wasn't luck, it was a strategic move that captured the kind of upside still on offer. With $226 million raised and 19.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is already outpacing expectations. Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from his kidnappers Saturday night, but found he'd had one of his fingers severed – the latest in a spate of abductions tied to cryptocurrency. The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was forced into a van by four men wearing ski masks on a street of Paris Thursday morning. He was held hostage in an Airbnb 12 miles south of the French capital for two days before being rescued. The kidnapping shares striking similarities with other recent kidnappings tied to cryptocurrency in France and surrounding countries. In January 2025, David Balland, co-founder of the crypto wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car in a dramatic police chase, Winkel wrote in a post on X. “Obviously there's at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it's the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde speaking on French television Sunday. Police have opened an investigation into the latest kidnapping, including for extortion by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, the Paris Prosecutor's office told CNN.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy Adds $180 Million in Bitcoin Ahead of Expanding BTC Push Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired 1,895 Bitcoin worth $180 million last week, capping off a $21 billion at-the-money equity offering program unveiled in October, according to a filing on Monday. Strategy funded its most recent purchase by selling $52 million worth of so-called perpetual “STRK” preferred stock and $128.5 million worth of common shares. Although Strategy can still issue $20.87 billion worth of preferred stock, it said it can no longer sell common stock through the equity offering program that “has been substantially depleted” over the past six months. Strategy, however, doubled down on its ambitions to buy as much Bitcoin as possible during its first-quarter earnings call last week, unveiling a similar equity offering program, in which the company will sell another $21 billion in common shares. On Friday, analysts at asset manager Bernstein reiterated an “Outperform” rating for Strategy with a price target of $600 per share, highlighting the firm's ability to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisition plans, despite headwinds from the latest market correction. The analysts also wrote that Strategy continues to serve as a Bitcoin proxy for institutional investors that may not be able to get exposure to the asset through vehicles like exchange-traded funds tracking the asset's spot price. “MSTR continues to hyper-scale its Bitcoin acquisition strategy,” Bernstein analysts wrote. Benchmark Senior Research Analyst Mark Palmer reiterated a “Buy” rating for Strategy last week, stating his $650 price target for Strategy's shares was partly based on Strategy's “ability to accelerate its accumulation of bitcoin.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His remarks have fuelled bullish sentiment among crypto traders who are now seeking the top altcoins to buy. While speaking in a recent interview, Trump noted that crypto was “much stronger” than other risk assets during the recent financial market turmoil caused by tariff concerns, a statement that has sparked interest in the top altcoins to buy. Altcoins also registered minute losses compared to US stocks, with the total market cap shedding around $400 million of its value during the same period. Besides its resilience, Trump further added that he was endorsing the industry because millions of people are interested in crypto assets. Trump's remarks come after a recent survey revealed that 73% of US digital asset investors believe that it is important for the US to emerge as a crypto leader. This could become possible with Trump's pro-crypto approach, hence the surging demand for top crypto coins to buy. Some of the top altcoins that crypto investors can consider to buy today, following Trump's recent endorsement, include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE). These are some of the top altcoins by crypto market ranking and have solid fundamentals and a bullish technical outlook that may support a rally. There are multiple reasons that a crypto trader should consider to buy the largest altcoin, Ethereum, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade and surging inflows to ETH products. One of the altcoins to buy that is bound to make notable gains following Trump's recent endorsement of the crypto industry is Ripple (XRP). XRP stands out as the biggest USA coin that is poised to benefit heavily from a pro-crypto regulatory framework. Moreover, technical analysis shows that the Ripple price is at a pivotal point that may precede an uptrend to $2.59 if it overcomes resistance at the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern. Coingape also reported that XRP may hit $12 amid a bullish formation in the Elliott Wave pattern. This indicates a bullish bias as most futures traders anticipate an upward price recovery. President Trump's recent statement about the crypto market being “much stronger” than the US stock market, with a $52 trillion valuation, has fuelled demand for altcoins. Some of the top altcoins to buy amid this development include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin-holding public companies may be sitting on a powerful market catalyst: untapped issuance capacity that could meaningfully raise bitcoin's (BTC) price, according to new research from NYDIG. If these companies take advantage of their elevated equity valuations to raise new funds and buy more bitcoin, it could trigger a significant upward move in the market. That would mark a roughly 44% jump from current levels near $96,000. This market dynamic has gained new urgency following the launch of Twenty One, a bitcoin accumulation vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex and Cantor Fitzgerald. Unlike other firms that have folded bitcoin into broader business models, Twenty One exists solely to acquire and hold bitcoin, and has already been seeded with a substantial BTC position. Across the sector, 69 public companies hold around $69.6 billion worth of bitcoin. Cipolaro's analysis suggests that their current stock premiums over net asset value could fund even more purchases — effectively creating a feedback loop, where equity issuance fuels BTC buying, which drives up the value of both the bitcoin and the issuer's shares. “This "dry powder" in the form of issuance capacity could have a significant upward effect on bitcoin's price.” Whether or not these companies pull the trigger, the growing interest from institutions and the performance of bitcoin-forward stocks signal a shift in how capital markets approach bitcoin exposure — through balance sheets rather than just ETF flows.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the market enters its next phase and with growing momentum, Turbo seems well-positioned to capitalize on further upside and is quickly gaining attention as a top contender today. Meanwhile, some analysts and investors believe that MIND of Pepe could soon follow a similar rally, drawing comparisons to Turbo's current breakout. Turbo token has been gaining significant attention in the market lately, and for good reason. Despite being a relatively new project, having launched after 2021, it's making major moves, with volume surging by 101%. For those considering an entry, this could represent a favorable opportunity, as Turbo remains well below its previous all-time highs. However, this dip likely served to clear out weaker holders, laying the groundwork for a potential rebound. Following this, the token experienced a sharp price spike, indicating renewed buying interest. This rally reached its peak around May 3 before pulling back, but the price remained resilient, which suggests that the bullish sentiment is still intact. After a brief pullback, Turbo found solid support near $0.0050, signaling that buyers are still actively engaged. This growing momentum is a clear sign that buyers are becoming more confident with each dip. As Turbo transitions from a downtrend to a bullish pattern, marked by higher highs and higher lows, breaking and holding above $0.00575 could confirm a breakout, setting the stage for further upward movement in the coming days. While Turbo makes waves in the meme coin space, another project gaining attention is MIND of Pepe, which also integrates AI to offer something unique to its investors. Unlike Turbo, which is AI-generated, MIND of Pepe goes a step further by using Hive-Mind analysis. This sophisticated AI system tracks market sentiment, monitors influencers, and follows trending narratives, providing investors with detailed reports to guide their decisions. For those looking for an edge in the meme coin space, MIND of Pepe provides valuable insights and a more data-driven approach to investing. To ensure secure and efficient asset management, holders of MIND of Pepe or other tokens must select the right wallet. Best Wallet stands out as the ideal choice, offering full support for ERC20 tokens and delivering a seamless user experience. As a non-custodial solution, it grants users complete control without requiring ID verification or personal documentation, ensuring both convenience and privacy. Supporting over 60 blockchains, this wallet provides exceptional flexibility along with advanced portfolio management tools. Additionally, users can earn rewards in the form of BEST tokens by completing daily tasks, making it an excellent option for those looking to generate passive income while growing their holdings. With MIND of Pepe's presale nearing its conclusion and its ICO raising nearly $9 million so far, investor demand is surging. With only 25 days left before the presale ends, now could be the ideal time to buy at its lower price of $0.0037515 — with the potential to surge like Turbo once it hits exchanges.

In a post on the social media platform X, Lookonchain says that the Ethereum holder awoke from a long slumber to unload thousands of ETH in less than four weeks. “The Ethereum ICO participant sold another 1,500 ETH ($1.76 million) again [on May 3rd.].

TRUMP is trading for $11.00 at time of writing, a 4.55% decrease during the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Lookonchain spotted a different whale who went long on Bitcoin (BTC) and a slew of altcoins – including ETH – and is currently sitting in profit. “A whale has been long BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, XRP, LINK and other 16 tokens in the past month, with a total profit of more than $9 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has maintained robust support for crypto assets by acknowledging their ability to resist market downturns. Donald Trump explained that cryptocurrency maintained stability as a financial asset when other markets faltered. The official believed that government support for innovation would be better than regulations to inhibit new developments. He endorsed using crypto technologies because multiple industries were showing increased acceptance. Trump used worldwide developments to illustrate the importance of leading in digital technology. He established his support of crypto through arguments about boosting national competitiveness and developing long-term growth opportunities. The TRUMP token lost most of its $15 billion value before experiencing intense price swings. The token value increased by more than 70% after Donald Trump declared his plan to host a private dinner with his most significant token holders. Only 220 wallets among millions will join the limited attendance at Trump National Golf Club on May 22. The announcement rapidly increased TRUMP token interest, generating temporary profit gains. Many critics viewed the special event warily because they believed it developed into a questionable ” pay-to-play” arrangement. Supporters of the presidential dinner for token holders believe that such rewards create problematic ethical issues. After the TRUMP token event, both Republican and Democrat lawmakers requested an ethical examination. Two key senators, Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff, doubted possible personal financial advantages because of their political positions. According to legislators from both sides of the political spectrum, the decision to provide special benefits through token holding could potentially violate ethical boundaries. Congress members who support Trump still have doubts about the significance of this event. According to her recorded comments, Senator Cynthia Lummis paused after the announcement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lately, those names aren't top-tier coins, they're micro-cap altcoins trading under $0.05. The best altcoins to buy now are the ones catching attention before they explode, like Dawgz AI, a low-cost presale getting early traction for its AI-focused utility. Let's take a closer look at the ones influencers are already watching. You won't always see these coins on front-page lists, but scroll through crypto Twitter for a bit, and you'll notice something: the same low-cap altcoins keep showing up in threads, replies, and alpha groups. Dawgz AI feels like one of those coins you hear about right before it takes off. Plus, over $3.4 million raised and a SolidProof audit doesn't hurt. Here's what early buyers and influencers are pointing to when they talk about Dawgz AI under the radar: For a deeper look into $DAGZ, you can check the video below by Crypto Chino where he explains why Dawgz AI could be one of the top altcoins to invest in this year. At around $0.0155 with a market cap just under $690M (according to CoinMarketCap), GALA has been quietly rebuilding after its recent contract migration. Here's why some think GALA's current dip might be an opportunity: Algorand has been around for years, but some influencers are circling back now that it's dipped under $0.21. According to CoinMarketCap, ALGO is currently trading at around $0.206, with a market cap of just under $1.8 billion. What's interesting is that ALGO still sees consistent developer activity, DeFi expansion, and cross-chain integrations, and all of that is happening at a discount right now. Here's why it's not being ignored despite the dip: The same influencers who used to pump every BTC breakout or ETH ecosystem upgrade are now hunting quiet, early-stage altcoins instead. Because the upside on big caps just isn't what it used to be, at least not in the short term. Early-stage altcoins, especially those priced under $0.05, let influencers build positions before the retail wave hits. They just need to ride a well-positioned project from $5M to $50M and they know their communities will follow once the breadcrumbs are dropped. That's why coins like Dawgz AI and other low-cap players are making the rounds in crypto circles before they ever show up on mainstream lists. But by then, the real gains are usually gone. If you're seeing smart money and influencers accumulating quiet, underpriced tokens like Dawgz AI, it's probably worth paying attention. Dawgz AI is one of the few projects some investors think could deliver outsized returns, thanks to its low entry price and AI-powered utility. As always, 1000x is rare, but historically, those gains have come from small caps with smart timing and community momentum. Dawgz AI is gaining attention for its strong blend of tech, staking rewards, and meme-driven branding, all wrapped in a low-cost presale. Broader potential also lies in infrastructure altcoins building tools the next bull market will rely on. Dawgz AI is one of the early picks being mentioned in tight-knit circles as a potential breakout.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking alongside Midnight CEO Eran Barak in a May 1 conversation, Hoskinson emphasized that full privacy, programmability, and interoperability are essential to bringing traditional equities into the blockchain era. Midnight, developed by Input Output Global (IOG), uses zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable confidential smart contracts. “You need a private side, full programmability, RWA standards, and trade across all blockchains and legacy exchanges,” Hoskinson said, underscoring what's needed to onboard global stock markets. To achieve these goals, Midnight combines several technological frameworks drawn from other networks. In addition, the team drew insights from Zcash's approach to privacy, incorporating zero-knowledge cryptography as a core element of Midnight's architecture. This setup allows developers to create confidential smart contracts that prioritize both user privacy and legal compliance. Midnight CEO Eran Barak highlighted this as a response to growing concerns about personal data sharing with artificial intelligence. Barak stated that the protocol is designed to allow AI to access private data without breaching ownership rights, offering a controlled, transparent framework for secure data interaction. Meanwhile, Hoskinson also pointed to stablecoins as a primary use case for Midnight. These organizations are exploring secure hardware enclaves and GPU-based systems for private AI computation. In December 2024, Hoskinson confirmed that Midnight would make Cardano a multichain network by enabling interoperability with chains such as Ethereum and Solana. Hoskinson also disclosed a partnership with Fairgate Labs to advance Midnight's cross-chain vision. This development drew attention from the Cardano community, especially due to IOG's earlier involvement with BitcoinOS. Responding to inquiries from an analyst at Angry Crypto Show, Hoskinson clarified that Fairgate created the base technology for BitcoinOS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has entered a landmark partnership with the Kyrgyz Republic aimed at accelerating the country's transition toward a digitally empowered economy. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Binance and the National Agency for Investments of Kyrgyzstan. Central to this strategic alliance is the rollout of Binance Pay, a contactless cryptocurrency payment solution that will now be available across Kyrgyzstan. It is expected to enhance financial inclusion while also strengthening the region's integration into broader crypto-enabled economic networks, particularly within the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). These programs will target a wide range of audiences, from civil servants and banking professionals to entrepreneurs and students. By investing in human capital, the initiative hopes to cultivate a local ecosystem capable of driving innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and blockchain governance. The programs are part of a larger national push to ensure that Kyrgyzstan's workforce is prepared for the technological demands of a digital-first economy. This partnership aligns with Kyrgyzstan's broader policy objectives of enhancing digital sovereignty and financial resilience. In April 2025, President Japarov signed a constitutional law granting legal tender status to the digital som, making Kyrgyzstan one of the few countries to institutionalize a CBDC through constitutional reform. Moreover, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has reportedly agreed to serve as an advisor to Kyrgyz officials on matters of blockchain strategy and crypto regulation. His involvement is expected to lend additional technical expertise and global credibility to the country's digital transformation efforts. As the global crypto landscape continues to evolve, Kyrgyzstan's forward-leaning stance and partnership with Binance may serve as a regional blueprint for how emerging economies can responsibly integrate digital assets into national development strategies.</p>
