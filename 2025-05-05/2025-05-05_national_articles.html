                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a week of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey were caused after air traffic controllers lost communication with aircraft they were supposed to be controlling, and as a result took leave government employees use after experiencing traumatic situations. The controllers in Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control, which coordinates planes arriving at Newark, “temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them,” on Monday April 28, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement shared with CNN. Last summer, control over the flights arriving into Newark's airport was transferred from an FAA facility in Long Island, New York to Philadelphia. The staffing delays have pushed into an eighth, and unprecedented day. Related article What we know about the massive staffing shortage that has caused 7 days of major delays at Newark Airport By Monday afternoon, more than 150 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, with more than 250 flights delayed, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. The FAA issued a brief ground stop at Newark Airport early Monday morning due to low cloud cover, which has since been lifted, but the agency is still forecasting nearly four-hour delays for inbound flights. The nationwide air traffic controller staffing shortage was compounded by over 20% of FAA controllers who “walked off the job” at Newark Airport, according to a statement Friday by United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby. This program covers all federal employees that are physically injured or experience a traumatic event on the job.” “It's written in the regulations if they experience a traumatic event —they can take time off to go see psychiatrist.. the people working that day did that.” On Monday, Canadian travelers Greg Marszalek and Stephen Lance were grounded at Newark Airport by multiple delays on their way home from celebrating their fortieth birthdays in Manhattan. “We can rent a car and just drive up to the border. Ottawa's pretty close to the border,” Marszalek said. “We have a very safe system, but anytime it's stressed like this, where you have controllers who are feeling under maximum pressure, it impacts safety – and people have a right to be concerned,” Goelz told CNN. I might choose an alternate route, because you cannot expect humans to function at their highest level for sustained periods of time with this kind of pressure on them,” he added. “We're here because the FAA is really a mess. This mess needs a real forensic look, a deep look into it,” Schumer said, adding that Newark's air traffic controllers have long warned the FAA of problems at the airport. About 225 flights into or out of Newark Airport were canceled over the weekend, with more than 950 flights delayed, according to FlightAware. Multiple factors have come together to create a nightmare travel week at the airport, including an air traffic controller shortage, a walk-off by air traffic controllers last week, runway closures and outdated equipment. Many of the affected flights have been through United Airlines. Kirby addressed the challenges in a statement Friday. Related article What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed Kirby also said technology used by FAA air traffic controllers to manage planes coming in and out of Newark failed on multiple occasions last week, resulting in delays and cancelations that left thousands of customers with disrupted travel plans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man arrives to the federal courthouse wearing a shirt supporting Sean “Diddy” Combs in New York, Monday, May 5, 2025. Sean Diddy Combs sits at the defense table before the start of jury selection at Manhattan federal court, Monday, May 5, 2025, in New York. Diddy' Combs arrives at the annual Independence Day ‘White Party' at the PlayStation 2 Estate in Bridgehampton, New York, July 4, 2004. Sean ‘Diddy' Combs, right, stands and looks at jurors as they file into the jury box at the start of jury selection at Manhattan federal court, Monday, May 5, 2025, in New York. Most people, especially music fans, probably already know them. Diddy” and even the obscure “Brother Love,” here's a look back at Combs' self-appointed names and what was going on during his career in each era. Hence the early stage names: Puffy and Puff Daddy. In these days, he was side by side with fellow New York City rapper Notorious B.I.G., the star of Combs' Bad Boy record label. In 1998, Combs won two Grammys as Puff Daddy, one for best rap album for his debut “No Way Out” and another for best rap performance by a duo or group for “I'll Be Missing You” with Faith Evans. The song memorialized Notorious B.I.G., who was fatally shot in 1997 in a case that remains unsolved. This was during the East vs. West rap rivalry, particularly with Tupac Shakur from California and his team at Death Row Records. The shift to P. Diddy unfolded in 2001, not long after Combs was acquitted of gun and bribery charges from when he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a shooting that wounded three people at a New York City nightclub. Combs noted at the time that Notorious B.I.G. came up with the nickname P. Diddy. He became the producer and star of the talent-search TV show “Making the Band” in 2002, performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004 and weeks later won a Grammy for best rap performance by a duo or group for “Shake Ya Tailfeather.” He dropped the “P.” from his artist nickname in 2005. He told the “Today” show at the time that fans at concerts weren't doing well chanting P. Diddy. Still, he ran into issues in trying to use Diddy for his 2006 album “Press Play” due to a lawsuit by British DJ Richard “Diddy” Dearlove over the use of the name. Combs used P. Diddy for some releases of the album as a result. Roughly two months later, Combs is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. For just a week in May 2011, Combs changed his name to “Swag,” posting in a video online that it was part of his “comeback” after a bad illness. He posted on social media in November 2017 that he was celebrating his birthday by changing his name to “Love, a.k.a. Brother Love.” Combs said he would not be answering to Puffy, Diddy, Puff Daddy or any of his other monikers. Later that month, he said was joking about the name change and people could use any of his older names. A year later, he clarified on the “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that Diddy remains his stage name. At his sex trafficking trial Monday, the judge read off a list of his monikers to prospective jurors, telling them, “There is one defendant: Sean Combs.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Uturuncu, a lofty peak in the Central Andes mountain range, is what's known as a “zombie volcano.” It hasn't erupted for more than 250,000 years, but it nonetheless shows signs of activity similar to those seen in active volcanoes, such as gas plumes and earthquakes. Satellite radar imagery taken more than two decades ago of Uturuncu — the tallest mountain in southwestern Bolivia — showed that forces inside the volcano had lifted and then lowered a region near the summit measuring about 93 miles (150 kilometers) wide, creating a shape like a sombrero. Scientists recently took a closer look at Uturuncu, to see whether ongoing deformation and other activity were signs that the slumbering volcano might be waking up. Volcanic eruptions typically occur when magma below a volcano surges into subsurface pockets called magma chambers, then escapes to the surface through vents and fissures. Eruptions are more explosive when magma is thicker, trapping gases so that pressure builds up and then suddenly releases, forcefully expelling magma as lava. Rather,      magma, gases and briny fluids were interacting  in      a hydrothermal network — a system with activities that were not  fully understood — to      produce       the volcano's zombie rumblings. Related article ‘Mystery volcano' that erupted and cooled Earth in 1831 has finally been identified Beneath Uturuncu at a depth of about 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 kilometers) lies a vast reservoir of magma called the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body. Prior studies hinted at an active hydrothermal system linking the magma reservoir and the mountain range above, but it was unknown how magma and fluids were interacting within this network. Using signals from more than 1,700 seismic events between 2009 and 2012, scientists produced high-resolution images of the shallow crust under Uturuncu. Their movement through Uturuncu triggered quakes, released steam and deformed the volcano's rock, causing surface rise of about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) per year. Uturuncu's internal dynamics not only explain its activity but also suggest that this zombie won't be reviving any time soon, said study coauthor Dr. Mike Kendall, a professor and head of the department of earth sciences at the University of Oxford. Related article A young man's brain turned to glass during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Using multiple techniques was a key part of bringing Uturuncu's subsurface structure into focus, according to geologist Dr. Benjamin Andrews, director of the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC. In isolation, the methods investigating seismic activity, rock chemistry and physics “would give interesting but somewhat ambiguous results,” said Andrews, who was not involved in the study. Together, these methods point to a hydrothermal system rather than surging magma as the cause of Uturuncu's activity, and provide a snapshot of the interplay between magma, rock and fluid under volcanoes. “This (research) has importance for understanding volcanoes, granitic rocks, ore bodies, and the formation of (the) continental crust,” Andrews said in an email. Their signs of activity are “mostly geothermal features like hot springs and fumaroles (openings where hot gases escape),” said study coauthor Dr. Matthew Pritchard, a professor of geophysics at Cornell University in New York. Some zombies show elevated surface temperatures and are already being explored as potential sources of geothermal energy, as well as for their mineral deposits, “but many are ripe for further investigations,” Pritchard told CNN in an email. “Some might be in a long, slow decline,  just cooling off from previous hotter times. Others might eventually have some  increase in activity,” he said. “But we don't yet know how to tell  them apart.” Related article Newly discovered fungus turns cave-dwelling spiders into ‘zombies' Peering at a volcano's internal plumbing could reveal possible targets for harnessing geothermal energy and accessing metals that are essential for technologies, such as copper, nickel and platinum, Kendall added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's announcement that a 100% tariff will be levied on foreign-made movies comes a month after West Wing actor Rob Lowe sounded the warning on the costs of filming in Hollywood. On Sunday, Trump lamented the state of Hollywood, which he said is dying a “very fast death.” Gavin Newsom (D-CA), he instead blamed a “concerted effort” by other nations to woo filming away from Tinseltown. Last month, Lowe, however, blamed Los Angeles and California leadership for offering no tax credits. In a podcast interview with his former Parks and Recreation co-star Adam Scott, Lowe said, “There are no tax credits, so like, all those other places are offering 40%. “And then, that's not even talking about union stuff,” he continued. A week after Lowe and Scott's interview was released, the California Film Commission approved a record 51 movies for tax incentives, according to the Wrap. Bob Sallady, Newsom's senior adviser for communications, told Deadline in the wake of Trump's movie tariff post that “we believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.” Hollywood continues to be a major part of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than 2.3 million jobs in 2022, according to data from the Motion Picture Association. The United States remains the top filming hub by production, with $14.5 billion in 2024, according to ProdPro, but that number is down 26% from 2022, and a survey of executives regarding their preferred locations for 2025-26 listed Toronto; the United Kingdom; Vancouver, Canada; Central Europe; and Australia as their top five.</p>

(AP Photo/Reba Saldanha) Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists. But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? “People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures –- but in very different ways.” He chaired Illinois' Human Rights Commission before running for governor. His family's hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events. JB Pritzker speaks during the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner, Sunday April 27, 2025, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Reba Saldanha) When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state. Since Harris' defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. “All I'm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.” Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets. It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaks at the NYCLU's May Day rally for worker's and immigrants rights at Foley Square, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. She has recently headlined “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she's made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. She also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump's argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump's biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people's lives. JB Pritzker, center, poses for a photo during the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner, Sunday April 27, 2025, in Manchester, N.H. (AP Photo/Reba Saldanha) Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) speaks at the NYCLU's May Day rally for worker's and immigrants rights at Foley Square, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in New York. “People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he's rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. “They're mad at him because he's vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.” Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn't resonate with working-class voters. Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration “over their needs not being met.” It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S. Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is opening a new salvo in his tariff war, targeting films made outside the U.S. In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorized the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to slap a 100% tariff “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” President Donald Trump speaks with reporters after disembarking Marine One upon arrival on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Sunday, May 4, 2025.

It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” said spokesperson Kush Desai. Yet Trump's tariffs are designed to lead consumers toward American products. And in movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace. China has ramped up its domestic movie production, culminating in the animated blockbuster “Ne Zha 2” grossing more than $2 billion this year. But even then, its sales came almost entirely from mainland China. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was awaiting more details of Trump's measures before commenting on them but would continue to pitch to filmmakers abroad, including in India's Bollywood. “We've got an absolutely world class industry,” he said. The Motion Picture Association, which represents major U.S. film studios and streaming services, didn't immediately respond to messages Sunday evening. The MPA's data shows how much Hollywood exports have dominated cinemas. Trump, a Republican, has made good on the “tariff man” label he gave himself years ago, slapping new taxes on goods made in countries around the globe. That includes a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with even higher levies threatened. By unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions. There are tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be subject to new tariffs in the weeks ahead. Trump has long voiced concern about movie production moving overseas. Shortly before he took office, he announced that he had tapped actors Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone to serve as “special ambassadors” to Hollywood to bring it “BACK — BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!” Toronto, the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia came out on top, with California placing sixth, Georgia seventh, New Jersey eighth and New York ninth. Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have also used aggressive tax incentives to lure film and TV productions. Those programs can take the form of cash grants, as in Texas, or tax credits, which Georgia and New Mexico offer. “If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States we should have a tariff on movies that come in.”</p>

Former Vice President Mike Pence, in a national digital exclusive interview with Fox News, says any move by Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy 'needs to be opposed' EXCLUSIVE - BOSTON – He is out of power, but former Vice President Mike Pence does not feel powerless. "When you look at those Trump-Pence years, they were years that we governed on a conservative agenda," the former vice president said in an exclusive national digital interview with Fox News minutes after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in Boston on Sunday night. Pence said he gives "President Trump all the credit in the world for an historic victory last November, and for sparing the country one more liberal Democrat administration." Former Vice President Mike Pence acknowledges his staff members as he speaks after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award during a ceremony at the JFK Library on Sunday, May 4, 2025 in Boston. However, he argued that "I truly do believe that some of the other steps the president is taking away from that conservative agenda should be a concern that would work against his legacy and ultimately the success of our party or our country. "I really do believe that for prosperity…for the success of our country, we need to stick to those time-honored principles of strong defense, American leadership on the world stage, less government, less taxes, traditional moral values, and the right to life, and I'm going to be a voice for that," added Pence, long a champion of social and fiscal conservative values. Former Vice President Al Gore, left, watches as former Vice President Mike Pence, center, shakes hands with then-President-elect Donald Trump before a State Funeral Service for former President Jimmy Carter at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 9, 2025. "Any suggestion that I've heard among some in and around the administration that we raise the top margin rate, the so-called millionaires tax, would be an enormous tax increase on small business owners across America," Pence said. He additionally emphasized that "It needs to be opposed. Let's make all the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent. The former vice president, a proponent of a muscular U.S. foreign policy, has criticized the president's upending of longstanding U.S. foreign policy and has urged Trump to stand with longtime international allies. Pence received a standing ovation from the audience at Boston's JFK Presidential Library when, in his acceptance address, he stressed that the U.S. "must continue to stand with Ukraine." While Pence, who became the first running mate in over 80 years to run against their former boss, regularly campaigned in the crucial early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, his White House bid never took off. Struggling in the polls and with fundraising, he suspended his campaign just four and a half months after launching it. When asked if there was another political chapter ahead, and possibly another bid for national office, Pence told Fox News Digital, "I leave that up to the American people." He reiterated that he intends to "be a voice" for traditional and conservative values and "we'll let the future take care of itself." As for Trump's repeated flirtations the past three months with seeking a third term in office in 2028 – which is forbidden by the 22nd Amendment in the U.S. Constitution – Pence said, "I think there's no higher priority for a president or any elected official to keep faith with the Constitution of the United States." Former Vice President Mike Pence, second from right, stands with his wife, Karen Pence, far right, as he is presented with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award by Jack Schlossberg and his mother, Caroline Kennedy, at a ceremony at the JFK Library on Sunday, May 4, 2025 in Boston. Pence spoke with Fox News Digital after receiving the Profile in Courage Award, which is named for a book the late John F. Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president. Among the previous recipients were former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Hours later, after the rioters were cleared from the Capitol building, Pence resumed his constitutional duties by overseeing congressional certification of former President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. His actions preserved the fundamental democratic principle of free and fair elections, and we are proud to honor him," former Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, the late President Kennedy's daughter, said in presenting Pence with the award. Pence, in accepting the annual award, emphasized that it is a "distinction that I will cherish for the rest of my life." The former vice president, pointing to his actions on Jan. 6, said to a standing ovation, "I will always believe by God's grace that I did my duty that day." Additionally, Pence, in his interview, noted that "in all my travels across the country in the last four years, I've been deeply humbled by how many Americans have come up to me and just taken a point to encourage us and support us, and it convinces me that the American people know that what ever differences we may have, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand."

A pair of bald eagles call out while resting on a tree next to Union Bay, Jan. 16, 2024, in Seattle. Three Democratic U.S. senators are asking the Trump administration to explain how it analyzed a proposed rule to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species and whether industry had a hand in drafting it. Senators Adam Schiff, Sheldon Whitehouse and Cory Booker sent a letter Monday to the departments of Interior and Commerce that also asks how the administration plans to protect species if the rule is changed. At issue is a long-standing definition of “harm” in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live — the No. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service proposed a rule that says habitat modification shouldn't be considered harm because it isn't the same as intentionally targeting a species, called “take.” Environmentalists argue that the definition of “take” has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of “harm” has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the new interpretation, industry, developers and others could simply say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, environmentalists say, which could lead to the extinction of critically endangered species like the Florida panther and spotted owl. The proposal could threaten progress made to save species that once were endangered, including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales, they said. “It is widely understood that a species cannot live without a safe place to call home,” the letter reads. A pair of bald eagles call out while resting on a tree next to Union Bay, Jan. 16, 2024, in Seattle. They also asked the administration to explain how it could enforce the act at all amid efforts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to fire federal staff and cut agencies' funding. The Department of Interior said in an email that it would not comment on the letter but carefully reviews all correspondence from Congress. The Department of Commerce did not respond to an email sent Monday seeking comment.

He said the nation needs judges who will not demand "trials for every single illegal immigrant." Responding to a question from the Daily Signal about his timeline and criteria for making future judicial nominations, President Donald Trump said, "we're putting 'em in rapidly," and seeking to "get very good ones." Trump suggested there are "radicalized" and "crazy" judges who want a trial for each illegal immigrant who enters the U.S. The nation needs judges who will not demand a trial "for every single illegal immigrant," he indicated. "We have millions of people that have come in here illegally, and we can't have a trial for every single person, that would be millions of trials." "Whitney is a Fighter who will inspire confidence in our Legal System," Trump declared in his post. That marked the president's first judicial nomination of his second term, according to reports. "Can it be so that Judges aren't allowing the USA to Deport Criminals, including Murderers, out of our Country and back to where they came from? This is not what our Founders had in mind!!!"

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum speaks at a ceremony renaming a Texas wildlife refuge for Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Houston girl who was killed in June 2024 by two alleged illegal immigrants affiliated with Tren de Aragua. EXCLUSIVE: Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is planning to introduce a bill that would enshrine into law President Donald Trump's executive order to rename a national park after a 12-year-old Houston girl allegedly killed by two illegal immigrants. The bill is being brought forward by Cornyn and U.S. Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, to make it more difficult for future administrations, Republican or Democrat, to change the name of the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge. "Jocelyn Nungaray was taken from this world far too soon at the hands of brutal killers who were in the U.S. illegally due to President Biden's open-border policies, and her legacy deserves to live on forever," Cornyn told Fox News Digital. "I am proud to lead this legislation alongside Congressman Babin to ensure President Trump's renaming of this sanctuary to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge is made permanent." The Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas was renamed the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge in honor of the Houston girl allegedly killed by two illegal immigrants. In April, officials held a renaming ceremony for the park. "One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America," Trump said during his address. "The heartbreaking murder of Jocelyn Nungaray shook our community to its core, and it never should have happened," Babin said in a statement. "Today, we are introducing legislation to honor Jocelyn's life and to send a clear message: securing our border and restoring the rule of law is not optional, it's essential. President Trump's leadership is making America safe again, and we are proud to stand with him to ensure that no family ever has to endure such a tragedy again." Cornyn's bill aims to make it more difficult for the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge's name to be changed. "Ms. Nungaray loved animals and, given the close proximity of her hometown of Houston, it is fitting that the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge be renamed in her honor," the bill's text states. Nungaray's killing, as well as others involving illegal immigrant suspects, became a flash point during the 2024 presidential election as Trump campaigned on a platform of deporting criminals in the U.S. illegally. Nungaray, who lived in Houston, was kidnapped, sexually assaulted before she was strangled to death and left dead under a bridge in June 2024 by Franklin Pena, 26, and Johan Martinez-Rangel, 22, Harris County prosecutors said. Franklin Jose Peña Ramos, left, and Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel have been charged in the killing of Jocelyn Nungaray in Houston on June 17. Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would order the government to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz, a former prison on a small island of the same name off the coast of San Francisco that once housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, including Al Capone, George “Machine Gun” Kelly and James “Whitey” Bulger. The prison, which closed 60 years ago due to its crumbling infrastructure and high maintenance costs, “will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Sunday, later telling reporters it was “just an idea” he had as federal judges pushed to ensure deported migrants had due process. On Monday, the US Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said his agency will “pursue all avenues” to implement Trump's plans for reopening Alcatraz. “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice. We will be actively working with our law enforcement and other federal partners to reinstate this very important mission,” Marshall said in a statement. Now a major historical landmark and tourist destination, Alcatraz was once one of the most heavily fortified military sites on the West Coast before it transformed into a notorious federal penitentiary in 1934. As a maximum-security prison surrounded by the Pacific's strong, cold currents, Alcatraz had a reputation for being a “last resort” facility where the most dangerous and most unruly in other prisons were sent. It was virtually impossible to escape, despite numerous storied attempts. Here's what else to know about its colorful history: It was also used to protect San Francisco from Confederate raiders during the Civil War. Prisoners at Alcatraz had four rights: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care –– all other privileges, including visits from family or access to books, art supplies and music, had to be earned. Most of the prison's inmates were among those who refused to conform to rules at other federal jails or who were deemed “escape risks.” Alcatraz saw 14 separate escape attempts involving 36 men over its 29 years as a federal prison. Officially, no one ever succeeded in reaching the mainland alive. Using spoons and homemade tools – including a drill made from a vacuum cleaner motor – the inmates dug through ventilation ducts behind their cells, which they used to establish a makeshift workshop on top of their cellblock. They created fake heads of themselves from plaster – complete with real human hair. The men secretly assembled a makeshift raft and life vests out of more than 50 stolen raincoats, using heat from steam pipes to seal the materials, investigators found. They then crawled through a ventilator shaft on the prison's roof that they had previously cut open and left temporarily secured with a bolt made from soap. It is believed that the group never made it to land and disappeared into the cold waters of San Francisco Bay. The FBI concluded they likely drowned, but no bodies were ever recovered. Occasional sightings and leads have kept the case open for decades. Though he was allowed to conduct his studies in his cell, prison authorities later found that equipment Stroud had requested for his experiments were used to construct a still for “home-brew,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons site. He left Alcatraz for another facility in 1959 and died four years later. Authorities estimated it would take roughly $3 million to $5 million to restore and maintain the facility –– excluding daily operational costs. “Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Today, Alcatraz is operated by the National Park Service as a tourist destination, welcoming approximately 1.2 million visitors a year. There are certain conditions that make a landmark eligible for losing the designation, such as ceasing “to meet criteria for designation; the qualities for which it was originally designated have been lost or destroyed.” Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, pushed back on the president's proposal, calling it “not a serious one.” “Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction.</p>

Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley was once synonymous with America's industrial might. The region was known for its booming manufacturing economy anchored by companies like Mack Trucks and Bethlehem Steel, the latter of which employed over 30,000 workers at its peak in the 1950s. Bethlehem Steel went bankrupt in 2001 (the site now houses a casino). There's even a Billy Joel song about it. President Donald Trump has said his ongoing trade war is meant in large part to bring manufacturing jobs back to communities like this. But, in the Lehigh Valley, it's having the opposite effect: Last month, Mack Trucks announced it would be laying off about 10 percent of its unionized workers at its Lehigh Valley plant, and pointed to tariffs and the economic uncertainty they've caused as the reason. “We were very surprised,” Mack Trucks employee and UAW Local 677 District 1 Committeeperson Dan Hand told me. “We have people that just started working on the shop floor Monday of last week. Last summer, Mack Trucks' parent company, Volvo, announced it was building a massive new truck plant in Mexico. The company said it planned to supplement its American workforce, not replace it, but Hand and his union members were upset and scared that their jobs, like so many others in their industry, would eventually move south of the border. In March, UAW 577 put out a press release blasting Mack's decision and endorsing tariffs as a tool to fight it. Now, even with the impending layoffs, Mack's Lehigh Valley workforce is split on Trump's tariff policy. “It doesn't seem like there's a good game plan,” said Hand, who voted for Trump in 2016, but then soured on him because of his treatment of organized labor in his first term. John Taniser, on the other hand, told me short-term pain is worth it for long-term change. But what we're looking for is a path forward to thrive and not just sustain and exist,” said Taniser, a 27-year veteran of Mack's production line. Nearly all economists agree that it's unlikely manufacturing will ever play as big a role in the American economy as it did in the mid-20th century. My colleague Dylan Matthews wrote an article recently about how, as countries get richer, they all see manufacturing jobs replaced with service industry jobs. Manufacturing itself has changed over time, too. Even if companies like Mack buck the trend and invest more in the United States, that ultimately won't translate into many new jobs: As manufacturing technology has improved, factories need fewer and fewer human workers. Many hope tariffs will still, despite what experts say, rewind the clock and reverse that decline. “Those great jobs — they built the Valley,” Taniser said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As President Donald Trump secures the U.S. border and executes a high-profile deportation operation, the unconventional methods he has employed have been curbed by courts and raised legal concerns. The Trump administration has used the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to fast-track deportations, which have been stopped by courts, has contracted with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to send suspected terrorists to a megaprison, and has even arrested a Wisconsin judge who tried to help an illegal immigrant avoid ICE detention. As Democrats and the American Civil Liberties Union have raced to the courts to stop deportations and demand due process for illegal immigrants, public interest in civil liberty protections has increased and given some Republicans pause. “Do they have to be careful not to deport the wrong people or make sure everybody has their day in court? The court has kind of said, you know, these people need their due process.” The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order shielding him from returning to his home country, has thrust the issue into the national spotlight, becoming a flashpoint in the broader clash over immigration enforcement and judicial power. Some Republican lawmakers concede, both publicly and privately, that the Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland is entitled to due process. Still, they are wary of provoking a direct clash with the White House. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who is up for reelection next year, expressed concern over the lack of fair legal procedures in the case, noting that while the administration first acknowledged an error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvadar in violation of a court order, it has since appeared to reverse its position. “Initially, the administration said that a mistake was made. “That's why you have due process, to find out what the facts are,” she added. Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally in 2012 and is subject to deportation, though an immigration judge in 2019 granted a withholding of his removal to his home country of El Salvador due to fear of persecution. Trump's team accuses Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, and his wife has filed for protective orders against him on the grounds of domestic violence, though he was never charged. Federal judges have sharply criticized the Trump administration's handling of Abrego Garcia's deportation. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis described the deportation as “wholly lawless” and accused the administration of a “willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.” Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit condemned the government's inaction, stating that officials are not permitted “to do essentially nothing” in facilitating Abrego Garcia's return, emphasizing that due process must be upheld regardless of allegations. When he was asked in an interview that aired Sunday on whether citizens and noncitizens are entitled to due process, Trump said, “I don't know.” I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.” However, he sidestepped questions about whether Abrego Garcia was afforded those protections. But I'm not sure I can give you an answer,” Paul said, explaining he didn't have enough information to conclude whether Abrego Garcia was denied due process. Paul pointed out that the Trump administration maintains Abrego Garcia has already gone through two legal proceedings and would face deportation again if he reentered the U.S. from El Salvador. “I can tell you that, by and large, I think the public is supportive of removing people who are criminals and are violent in our country,” Paul added. New polling appears to show a growing unease with perceived executive overreach and erosion of constitutional rights. A YouGov survey in April found that nearly half of Americans believe everyone in the country, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to due process. YouGov's tracker of the issues that people care about the most shows a sharp increase in “civil rights and civil liberties” since Trump returned to office, with 16% of registered voter respondents saying it's the most important issue, second only to inflation and prices at 20.7%. Separate polls by AP-NORC and the Washington Post also reveal that majorities of Americans think the federal government is overstepping its authority, with many worried about threats to free speech, press freedoms, and legal protections. Recent polling has raised alarm among some Republican lawmakers, who are increasingly uneasy about the administration's escalating clashes with the judiciary, although they are hesitant to speak up about it publicly. We've seen it is not popular with some voters, even though it is with some of our base,” said an adviser to a GOP senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), have called on Trump to recognize the judiciary's equal standing under the Constitution and to comply with its decisions. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said many people support the president's tough immigration stance because they see it as a way to stay safe but that they also expect him to follow legal boundaries and respect whatever the courts decide. “Here's what I believe the perception is right now. “I have yet to run into a person, I'm sure they exist in my district, who thinks that an MS-13 gang member should actually come back to Maryland,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) said. GOP strategist Dennis Lennox argued that Republicans won't be punished for backing tough deportation policies but could face political backlash if they fail to deliver on Trump's agenda. “No Republican is going to lose a midterm election on deporting gangbangers,” Lennox said. “They will lose the election if Republicans on Capitol Hill don't start passing what President Trump and Republicans ran on last year.” Late last week, federal agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of obstructing justice after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant exit her courtroom through a side door to avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement. FBI Director Kash Patel drew attention to the arrest by posting a photo of Dugan in handcuffs. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) argued that voters are strongly invested in defending the country's democratic values. “When you look at the polling data, Americans care deeply about this issue,” he said. You are trampling on what America is all about, and the American people realize it.” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said he's had numerous conversations with GOP colleagues who have voiced concerns privately about due process protections. “I have had conversations with GOP colleagues who have expressed real misgivings about Donald Trump's violation of constitutional due process rights — I've heard that from a number of Republican senators,” said Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to visit Abrego Garcia. “The public overwhelmingly supports making sure we protect due process rights for people who reside in America.</p>

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity: I have family and friends who are relatively well-off but don't spend much time thinking intentionally about how to do good. So I've been wondering whether or how much to challenge them to do more good and take doing good more seriously. For example, I've always given a percentage of my income to charity. I've got parents who are lovely people, but they donate basically not at all. I'd love for them to answer the question of “How much should we be giving back?” I have the sense that they haven't actually thought about it, so the default decision is to do nothing. And especially with people in my generation, it feels uncomfortable to talk about this. I don't want it to feel accusatory or make people defensive. I want people to make an affirmative decision they're happy about and not have it live in the ambient guilt zone. How can I bring it up in a way that makes clear I just want people to be actively making a decision, even if it's not the same as mine? I think the same is true about changing other people. Start by accepting them just as they are, and you may find they're a lot more receptive to what you say. It sounds like you're not trying to shove your own ideological commitments down your family and friends' throats, and I think that's great. But I'd encourage you to go even further. Contrary to the views of other psychologists, Rogers didn't think it took any special therapy for a person to change for the better. Feel free to email me at sigal.samuel@vox.com or fill out this anonymous form! Newsletter subscribers will get my column before anyone else does and their questions will be prioritized for future editions. But ask yourself if you've truly understood how the world feels to them from within their own internal frame of reference. That can lead to an enduring scarcity mindset. Take me, for example: I grew up in a family on welfare, and even though I started earning a decent salary as an adult, I kept grappling with money dysmorphia — feeling nervous about money even after becoming financially stable. Or maybe your family and friends just have a different idea about what counts as “doing good.” It's possible they already see themselves as very committed do-gooders, only their approach isn't about giving charity; it's about volunteering or helping the environment or engaging in political activism. Or is it possible that there are multiple moral perspectives that are equally valid, even if they conflict with each other? Philosophers call that latter view moral pluralism, and I think it's worth taking really seriously. But even if you do think your way is better or your loved ones are ignoring a pretty powerful way to do good, you'll still want to be very careful about how you express that. I say that because of the Stanford psychologist Benoit Monin's research on “do-gooder derogation.” Monin's studies showed people tend to feel less warm toward those who are extremely moral and altruistic. For example, Monin's study participants rated vegetarians more negatively the more they expected the vegetarians to see themselves as morally superior to meat eaters. And if they get even the slightest hint that you might be judging them, your approach is likely to backfire. Again, a personal experience: In college, a friend who was studying environmental science looked at me with disgust when she saw me once eat my lunch — a vegan lunch, for goodness' sake! Her reaction turned me off environmentalism for longer than I care to admit. If you understand what it really feels like to be the other person, a la Rogers, that might give you clues about what it would take for them to become more open to your views. Often, I think you'll find that they need carrots, not sticks. Then I got a job where my colleagues were super-excited about donating. And believe it or not, I enjoyed it so much that Giving Tuesday actually became one of my favorite days of the year. But because it was fine to approach it in a way that felt safe to me, and I was given the sense that there was an awesome feeling waiting for me on the other side, I willingly made the change. As for environmentalism, I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I didn't reengage until, as an adult, I was re-exposed to the beauty of nature and of the animal kingdom. It started when someone invited me to try birding. To my surprise, I fell in love with birds! They turned out to be a gateway drug: I soon found myself watching monkeys, listening to bugling elk, and snorkeling with colorful fish. And caring deeply about the natural world they inhabit. In other words, sometimes people need to feel safer or to have positive experiences that show them just what's at stake for them personally before they'll engage. As psychologist Molly Crockett has shown, when people judge how good a “good deed” is, they consider the benefits that those deeds bring about — but they also consider how good it feels to perform them. If anything, Crockett's data suggests that people put more weight on how good it feels to them. So they might think that a good deed that brings very little benefit but gives them a really warm, fuzzy glow is actually more praiseworthy than a good deed that feels detached and emotionless but brings about a lot of benefit. Don't emphasize the moral arguments (lest you fall victim to do-gooder derogation). Since it's tough to find ways to slip this into conversation organically, you'll probably be better off doing this as part of a ready-made ritual that you share with family or friends. But, since neuroscientific research indicates that practicing gratitude can prime our brains to be more altruistic, I'd suggest piggybacking on a holiday traditionally associated with feeling thankful for all we have — whether that's a religious holiday, like Judaism's Sukkot, or a secular holiday, like Thanksgiving. After people have had something to eat but before they're totally comatose, ask everyone to reflect on what they're grateful for. Then say, “I feel really grateful that I've been able to donate 10 percent of my income to charity X this year. I just got an update from the charity, and it said that my money helped 10 poor families put food on the table and send their kids to school. Is there something helpful you've done this year that felt super-satisfying? Don't expect people to magically change their entire personality then and there. More likely, you'll be planting a seed that will germinate over months or years. This patient approach might take longer than direct persuasion, but it typically creates more sustainable change and preserves your most important relationships in the process. And then help them fall deeper in love with the world by putting them in contact with what's beautiful and good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawmakers face rolling deadlines throughout May to submit so-called earmarks for the annual budget, a popular mechanism that Republicans have a love-hate relationship with but that offers members of Congress a chance to score funding for local projects. “If the money's there, we'd rather our state get it than anybody else because it's going to be spent,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), who is weighing a run for governor, told the Washington Examiner. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Ron Johnson (R-WI), among the more hawkish GOP senators on fiscal matters, derided earmarks as the “gateway drug” to bloated pork barrel spending. “That's why we're in such deep doo-doo here,” Johnson said. With a GOP trifecta controlling Congress and the White House, Republicans are in cost-cutting mode, which fiscal conservatives say runs counter to spending items such as earmarks. But GOP leaders say the mechanism is once again up for use in the fiscal 2026 budget that starts Oct. 1 despite slashing $16 billion in earmarks from the 2025 budget in a stopgap funding bill signed into law earlier this year. Compounding the friction among dueling factions of conservatives are negotiations over crafting a so-called budget reconciliation bill to advance President Donald Trump's economic agenda on taxes, energy, and the border. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is managing friction over the megabill between warring groups within his razor-thin majority, while Senate Republicans draw their own red lines over fiscal discipline and preventing Medicaid cuts. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is among the anti-earmark senators who vow not to submit any. Trump praised earmarks during his first term and is a wildcard who could significantly influence the process now that Republicans control both chambers, should he choose to weigh in. Congress's use of them in recent decades has varied widely, including former Speakers Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), John Boehner, and Paul Ryan either scaling them back or eliminating them over members facing allegations of political corruption and bribery. Some lawmakers solicit requests directly from would-be recipients with submission forms on their office websites. “Earmark” is often viewed in Washington as a dirty word associated with pork barrel spending to fund lawmakers' pet projects. They're known as “community project funding” or “congressionally directed spending.” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) preferred the phrase “congressionally designated expenditures.” He defended the process as one that takes control from bureaucrats in Washington over how already allocated federal funds will be used and places it with lawmakers or local entities more in tune with specific community needs. It's money that would probably be spent either within the programmatic plan and laid out by a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., as opposed to specifically determined by elected members in their individual states,” Rounds said. I think we're better suited than they are to make those determinations on a project-by-project basis.” Rounds cited some of his previous earmark requests for things in his state, such as road projects for Native American reservations, rebuilding damaged bridges, and improving rural water systems. More than 8,000 earmarks totaling almost $15 billion were included in the fiscal 2024 budget. Trump released his 2026 budget request on Friday that represents a blueprint for congressional appropriators as they craft a final version that lawmakers must eventually pass. His proposal calls for $163 billion in nondefense cuts, or about a 22.6% decrease, to multiple federal programs and offered a window into the president's political priorities for reshaping the federal government.</p>

Jodey Arrington discusses House Republicans working on advancing President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful' budget bill and Democrats claiming the GOP is attempting to make Medicaid cuts. Bloated bureaucracy and growing debt are holding back President Donald Trump's economic "golden age," according to one House Republican who is urging lawmakers to have the "political courage" to execute Trump's America First agenda and pass a budget reconciliation bill. Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, appeared on "Fox News Sunday" where he was asked about his concerns over out-of-control spending and the rising national debt – a combination that he previously said is "the greatest threat to our country and our children's future." "The question is, will we have the political courage to execute on that and right-size the bloated bureaucracy, as was reflected in the president's budget, and deal with this wartime-level debt, $2 trillion in annual deficit spending that's going to double, and interest payments that exceed not only national defense, but Medicare payments," said Arrington, who is chair of the House Budget Committee. Arrington warned that this would prove to be a "pivotal" moment for America. Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, speaks at a news conference at the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service Cotton Classification Complex on April 16 in Lubbock, Texas. (Mateo Rosiles/ Avalanche-Journal / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) "We can't get to the president's rocket ship economy, we cannot usher in the golden age. In fact, we risk a sovereign debt crisis if we don't deal with the unsustainable deficits and national debt." Arrington said that he believed the pro-growth policies in the budget reconciliation bill and a reduction in deficit spending, along with entitlement reform, "will bend the curve on debt to GDP and deficit to GDP." "So if we follow the framework that we laid out in the budget resolution, then we will restore fiscal health," he said, though he did not provide specifics on the bill's policies. Democrats, however, have accused Republicans of trying to cut costs by slashing Medicaid, affecting America's "most vulnerable." The White House has maintained that public entitlements, including Social Security and Medicaid, will not be cut in the Republicans' budget bill. Arrington conceded that the bill alone would not solve America's debt crisis. "It won't get us out of the debt hole overnight, but it is a good first step and a down payment for our kids to actually be on good fiscal footing, a sustainable path, and enjoy the same opportunities and freedoms that we have," the lawmaker said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump floated his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, as an option to be his next national security adviser after he ousted Mike Waltz from the role last week. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump revealed that Miller, a stalwart of his administration who has made frequent, sometimes fiery appearances before the media defending Trump's deportation operations, is “at the top of the totem pole” for the high-profile post. “I think he sort of indirectly already has that job. Because he has a lot to say about a lot of things. Trump also said he will fill the national security adviser role, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily serving in, within six months. That timeline means Rubio will likely be serving in four roles — specifically secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and now national security adviser — for a significant amount of time.

Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), targeted the administration on Sunday over the amount of work Rubio will now have, suggesting it's not sustainable. “Especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD, with Pete Hegseth being Secretary of Defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership, there's no way he [Rubio] can carry all that entire load on his own,” Duckworth said. Trump's most recent comments on possible selections for the national security adviser role follow his move to nominate Waltz to U.N. ambassador late last week. This marked the end of a tumultuous few months for Waltz in the national security role that was dominated by Signalgate.</p>
