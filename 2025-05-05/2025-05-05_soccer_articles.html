                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Episcopal High School is about to get a lot brighter. The private high school at 1200 N. Quaker Lane has been approved to serve as a training site for a team participating in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and now the school wants to install field lighting with 47 light poles between 40-to-100-feet-tall. It is anticipated that in addition to lights being installed on the Track Field and Hummel Bowl, lights will be installed on the School's Soccer, Baseball, Softball, Field Hockey/Lacrosse fields as well as the tennis courts as part of a multi-year capital improvement program for EHS. FIFA announced Episcopal as a potential training site last fall, and the selected team will stay at Hotel AKA Alexandria (625 First Street). Episcopal High School proposes to install lighting on campus outdoor athletic fields and courts as an accessory congregate recreational facility use to the principal use of the property as a private academic school. A total of 47 light poles are proposed ranging in heights from 40 feet to 100 feet… The lighting contractor is Musco Lighting, which specializes in lighting for sports facilities and has completed other projects in the city for the Department of Recreation Parks and Cultural Activities (RPCA) and Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS). The system is designed to comply with the International Dark-Sky Associations (IDA) Community Friendly Outdoor Sports Lighting Program and provide full cutoff lighting that minimizes glare and light spillage onto adjacent properties. City Council will consider the matter at its hearing on May 17. Reporter James Cullum has spent nearly 20 years covering Northern Virginia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Women's Soccer League was once the lone professional women's league in North America. And now it appears lower-tier leagues are forming, too. The NWSL has asked U.S. Soccer to sanction a second-division league that would include at least six teams and possibly launch in 2026. The WPSL Pro also will launch next year as a second-tier league. “I think this is what progress looks like,” said Amanda Vandervort, president of the USL Super League. "I think the more options there are, whether it's owners, investors, players, or fans, the better it is for everyone. The eight-team league plays on a fall-to-spring calendar like many international leagues, and is currently in the stretch run of its inaugural season. A ninth team will join next season. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman believes there's room for everyone. “There are countless examples of players who were unsigned in our league who ended up going to some of those other leagues, who are still able to play the sport of soccer and continue their careers. And maybe there's a world where they find their way back to the NWSL," Berman said. "If they didn't have a place to go and play in the interim, they might not have continued to play." There are signs of the mutually beneficial relationship. The NWSL's Gotham FC played a pair of preseason friendlies against the Super League's Fort Lauderdale United and Tampa Bay Sun. The league has long been a dream of former national team star and co-founder Diana Matheson. It has been boosted by Christine Sinclair, international soccer's all-time leading goal scorer. Canada was one of just two countries that played in the 2023 Women's World Cup without a domestic professional league. While a majority of the players in the league are Canadian, 20 other countries are represented, too. "It's a global industry and we're competing with leagues all over the world, which is the reality. But I think in North America specifically, I think us, the NWSL, Liga MX Femenil in Mexico, also know that we have the opportunity to really build women's soccer in our region,” Matheson said. "I think we've got three very competitive tier-one women's pro leagues in our region that can work together to build that landscape." Cleveland Soccer Group, which had bid in the latest round of NWSL expansion, pivoted to joining the division 2 WPSL Pro. Cleveland's group, which will also have an ownership stake in the league, will join teams from Atlanta, Dallas, North Carolina, Oklahoma City, Sioux Falls and the San Francisco Bay Area in the league's first season next year. “Rising demand calls for more options, not fewer,” Vandervort said. “And if you look at the landscape today, we still don't have as many options for women to go pro, even with the addition of these leagues, as the men do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leeds United and Brenden Aaronson already clinched their promotion to the Premier League last month, but closed out the campaign in style by finishing as league champions after a win. Cardiff City and Ethan Horvath will play in League One next season. They will take on fourth-place Sunderland (21-12-13, 76) in a home-and-home semifinal promotion series. Sargent, despite missing 14 Championship games due to injuries, still finished with 15 goals in 32 appearances. Cardiff City and goalkeeper Ethan Horvath were relegated to League One after the team finished 24th in the English Championship after dropping a 4-2 away decision to Norwich City on Saturday, May 3. White sat out Vancouver's 2-1 home win over Real Salt Lake in MLS action on Saturday, May 3 due to hamstring issues. Balogun, who has found the net four times this season, scored his first goal since a 3-1 victory over Saint-Etienne on Oct. 5, 2024. He had come off the bench for five consecutive games before starting on Saturday. DeJuan Jones made an impact not once, but twice during a nine-minute span in his first start and second appearance for the San Jose Earthquakes. Arsten scored a goal in Columbus' 2-1 win over San Jose on April 26. Club America and Alejandro Zendejas haven't played since April 19, but they will play two vital matches within a three-day span in the Liga MX Clausura quarterfinals. -- Kellyn Acosta (Chicago Fire; MLS) - Injured, DNP in 0-0 draw vs. Orlando City SC (May 3) -- Tyler Adams (AFC Bournemouth; English Premier League) – 90 minutes in 2-1 win at Arsenal (May 3) -- Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; MLS) - 90 minutes, ASSIST, in 4-2 win vs. Charlotte FC (May 3) -- Folarin Balogun (Monaco; French Ligue 1) – 90 minutes, GOAL, in 3-1 win at Saint-Etienne (May 3) -- Taylor Booth (Twente; Dutch Eredivisie) - Injured, DNP in 2-0 win at Sparta Rotterdam (May 4) -- Gianluca Busio (Venezia; Italian Serie A) - 82 minutes in 1-1 draw at Torino (May 2) -- Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven; Dutch Eredivisie) - 14 minutes as a substitute in 4-1 win vs. Fortuna Sittard (May 3) -- Jesús Ferreira (Seattle Sounders; MLS) - Injured, DNP in 4-1 win vs. St. Louis CITY (May 3) -- Brian Gutiérrez (Chicago Fire; MLS) - 84 minutes in 0-0 draw vs. Orlando City SC (May 3) -- Sean Johnson (Toronto FC; MLS) - 90 minutes in 2-0 loss vs. New England Revolution (May 3) -- DeJuan Jones (San Jose Earthquakes; MLS) – 90 minutes, TWO ASSISTS, in 4-1 win vs. Portland Timbers (May 3) -- Richy Ledezma (PSV Eindhoven; Dutch Eredivisie) - 76 minutes in 4-1 win vs. Fortuna Sittard (May 3) -- Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; MLS) - 90 minutes, GOAL, in 2-1 loss at Vancouver Whitecaps (May 3) -- Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; MLS) - 89 minutes in 2-0 loss at Los Angeles FC (May 3) -- Weston McKennie (Juventus; Italy Serie A) - 90 minutes in 1-1 draw at Bologna (May 4) -- Aidan Morris (Middlesbrough; English Championship) - 78 minutes in 2-0 loss at Coventry City (May 3) -- Jordan Morris (Seattle Sounders; MLS) - Injured, DNP in 4-1 win vs. St. Louis CITY (May 3) -- Erik Palmer-Brown (Panathinaikos; Greek Super League) - 67 minutes as a substitute in 2-1 win at AEK Athens (May 4) -- Kevin Paredes (Wolfsburg; Bundesliga) - Injured, DNP in 4-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund (May 3) -- Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven; Dutch Eredivisie) - Injured, DNP in 4-1 win vs. Fortuna Sittard (May 3) -- Antonee Robinson (Fulham; English Premier League) - 90 minutes in 1-0 loss at Aston Villa (May 3) -- Tanner Tessmann (Lyon; French Ligue 1) – 2 minutes as a substitute in 2-1 loss vs. -- Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven; Dutch Eredivisie) - 89 minutes in 4-1 win vs. Fortuna Sittard (May 3) -- Timmy Tillman (Los Angeles FC; MLS) - 90 minutes, ASSIST, in 2-0 win vs. Houston Dynamo (May 3) -- Tim Weah (Juventus; Italy Serie A) - 86 minutes in 1-1 draw at Bologna (May 4) -- Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC; MLS) - Injured, DNP in 1-1 draw at Atlanta United (May 3)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Milan and FC Barcelona face off this Tuesday in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at the Giuseppe Meazza, with a spot in the Munich final on their minds. When asked whether he preferred Inter or Barça, the Swiss president responded that “everyone knows that I am a fan of Inter Milan,” making his preference very clear. This is not the first time that Infantino has expressed his passion for the team led by Simone Inzaghi, as he has done so on other occasions in the past. FIFA is on the verge of inaugurating its first major Club World Cup with the participation of 32 clubs who will compete to win a trophy that is intended to be comparable to the most prestigious competition that national teams contest every four years. If Barcelona defeats Inter in Milan this week and Arsenal overturns the 0-1 deficit against PSG in Paris, then it would be a given that the European champion would not be in that great tournament that FIFA has activated. This is a major concern for the organization. Good news for Barcelona: Inter Milan's star player to miss Champions League return match Barça has players in its ranks who are gaining worldwide recognition this season. There is the recent example of Pedri González, who, for a Real Madrid legend like Toni Kroos, is already “the best in the world in his position.” Or Raphinha Dias, whom many see as a Ballon d'Or contender thanks to his goals and assists. And, above all, Lamine Yamal, whose global consecration at just 17 years of age has accelerated at a dizzying pace in recent days for his own colleagues, including Erling Haaland, or among soccer legends such as Thierry Henry or Rio Ferdinand. All of this uncertainty hangs over the eve of a Club World Cup to which, applying the most basic logic, a Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and PSG would be much more beneficial for its peace of mind than one between Barça and Arsenal. A final between two of the biggest and most lucrative brands. With the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup set to kick off in less than 2 months, head coach Carlo Ancelotti has made a final decision about coaching Real Madrid in the international competition. Club América and LAFC will face off in a playoff match to determine the final qualifier for the 2025 Club World Cup. "With his loan spell at AC Milan nearing its end, João Félix's future is uncertain. Will the Italian side make the move permanent, or will he be searching for a new club this summer?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are preparing to name current director of football Santiago Solari as interim head coach for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, according to a report from MARCA. The move comes as the club anticipates the departure of current manager Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to leave his role in the coming weeks. Solari previously managed the first team during the 2018–19 season. Though his tenure was brief, lasting less than a year, the Argentine coach earned respect within the organization for his professionalism and commitment. He later returned to the club in a front-office role and has remained a trusted figure behind the scenes. According to the report, Solari is expected to return to his executive duties after the tournament, once Real Madrid appoint a permanent successor—most likely Xabi Alonso or Jürgen Klopp. The Club World Cup has become a significant target for Real Madrid, with over €100 million in prize money at stake. Club officials reportedly see the tournament as both a prestigious opportunity and a valuable financial asset as they look to the future following what's been a disappointing 2024-25 season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are plenty of factors from a World Cup that mark its place in history, but few measure up to the theme songs for each tournament. Their tunes ingrain themselves in viewers' heads throughout the competition, all of course before they become nostalgic throwbacks to past tournaments. While a traditional World Cup has one theme and sounds that encapsulate the entire World Cup journey and highlight the host nation, the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico has 17, one for each city and a general theme to bring them under one umbrella. To produce the 16 unique compositions, nicknamed "SonicIDs," FIFA partnered with local DJS and artists to create sounds that would resonate with their communities and make the first-ever 48-team World Cup even more historic. Here are all the themes fans will become familiar with during next year's tournament, which kicks off on June 11 in Mexico City at the Estadio Azteca. If you missed our ranking of each city's World Cup poster, check that out too. Atlanta's World Cup theme saw FIFA team up with Georgia's own Dallas Austin, who is among the several Grammy Award winning artists to bring their talents into the soccer space. Known for their world-class music education and musician development, Berklee College brings a unique Bostonian flavor to the city's World Cup theme song for next summer's tournament. An audio engineer who has worked with world-famous artists inlcuding , Ed Sheeran, Blake Shelton, Lady Gaga, and Travis Scott, Tre Nagella put his spin on the Dallas World Cup theme. A house music producer, Bautista ensured the Guadalajara anthem included horns and echoes, defining features of the music culture in one of Mexico's most vibrant cities. A producer local to the Houston arena, Bombón linked up with FIFA to produce a theme highlighting the cities hip hop and R&B culture, while also throwing in a little bit of Latino flare, albeit less than other cities. Having sold over two million albums, Kansas City's own Tech N9ne brought a bit more of a vocal vibe to this theme song. As much as Pitbull might be Mr. Worldwide, it was Puerto Rico's Mr. Naisgai leading the theme for Miami, a big challenge given their city's status of having Lionel Messi on their local MLS team. How do you create a single theme to unify a city that has split soccer allegiances between Tigres UANL and CF Monterrey? Hosting the World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, New York/New Jersey had a defining and critical theme design, and enlisted production company Take A Daytrip with the pressure. A native of nearby Brenton, Washington, Sango stepped in to produce Seattle's theme, building on the central beat with Indigenous heritage. However, there was no call-out to Seattle's history with the grunge music genre. Grayson Repp was a DJ at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar and brought his experience of the global tournament into his remix. He also added an Indigenous flavor, showcasing the Pacific Northwest identity. "Being from Vancouver, my entire DJ history was from Granville Street essentially, so it was nice to come home and make a track for our city, our stadium and our team," Repp told CBC Radio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England head coach Thomas Tuchel faces a dilemma over releasing his players early next month before the Club World Cup. His side are scheduled to play two games in June - a World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona on 7 June before a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest three days later. Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header. The FA is to hold further meetings when its stance regarding Club World Cup players will be confirmed. Although in its annual report released last week,, external the FA cited the tournament as a "significant challenge" for "protecting player welfare" which could also have "financial implications". Chelsea contingent Cole Palmer, Reece James, Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke could be selected by Tuchel. Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header. Captain Harry Kane is at Bayern Munich while Jude Bellingham plays for Real Madrid and fellow midfielder Conor Gallagher for Atletico Madrid. Teams competing at the Club World Cup are required to arrive in the USA no later than three days before their opening tie. With that in mind, Enzo Maresca's side face a potential Europa Conference League final in Poland on 28 May - three days after the final day of the Premier League season - before joining up for international duty. Manchester City's first game of the tournament is on 18 June versus Wydad AC. Speaking in March, Tuchel hinted towards his reluctance to do favours for club managers saying: "I take care of the players. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players now 'hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'. Because first of all I feel responsible for the players. "I experienced it many, many times in clubs that players from South American countries don't even think about dropping one minute because they want to play for their country, they're proud to play for their country. This is also something that we have to understand and accept. I was also hoping that they are proud to play."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National team could have as many as 12 players from Chelsea, Man City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid for summer fixtures Thomas Tuchel is planning to stick to his promise of avoiding special favours for club managers by keeping England's Club World Cup players for the friendly against Senegal. England play two games in June, a World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona and a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City ground – four days before the Club World Cup kicks off in the United States on June 14. It had been anticipated that players scheduled to participate in the Club World Cup would be released from Tuchel's squad after the Andorra game, but the German is believed to have been leaning towards keeping them for the entire camp. A final decision has not yet been made and further planning talks are scheduled. The issue is of particular relevance to Tuchel's former club Chelsea, given they are on course to reach the final of the Europa Conference League and start their Club World Cup campaign two days before Manchester City. Telegraph Sport understands that Chelsea do not plan to make any special requests for the early release of their players. The club will abide by Tuchel's wishes, which could impact as many as 12 England players with City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid also competing in the Club World Cup. Chelsea have four players – Cole Palmer, Reece James, Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke – who could play in the Club World Cup and be selected for England. Phil Foden is one of five City players who are of interest to Tuchel, while Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Conor Gallagher are in line to take part in the Club World Cup for Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid respectively. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who on Monday announced he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season, is expected to join Bellingham at Real on a free transfer midway through the Club World Cup, although the Spanish club could yet pay a transfer fee to Liverpool to sign him in time for the competition. Should Tuchel stick to his plan, then Chelsea's England contingent will meet up with their team-mates just five days before their opening Club World Cup game against Leon in Atalanta. Competing teams at the Club World Cup must arrive in the US no later than three days before their opening tie. But Tuchel made it clear that he does not have time to do club managers favours ahead of next summer's World Cup and has consistently referenced the fact he only has a total of 60 available days with the players ahead of the tournament. Speaking in March, during his first England camp as manager, Tuchel said: “I take care of the players. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players now ‘hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'. Because first of all I feel responsible for the players. I don't want the player to be injured. “I always accepted it as a club manager. I was also hoping that they are proud to play.” Tuchel did, however, concede that the June international window poses difficulties, saying: “Being a club coach or international coach – the Fifa June window is I think debatable… if it makes sense. “They get a little bit of holiday but they think ‘Other players are on holiday, I need to come back. I am not so concerned about the amount of games they play in total. I am more concerned that they never have a real break of three to four weeks. They should have a minimum three or 3½ weeks of preparation and then it would be better for everyone.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because Carlo Ancelotti's continuity is practically ruled out, even if victory is achieved in the current league campaign, given his decisions during this course. That's why Real Madrid is already working on making the arrival of his replacement a reality, a Xabi Alonso who, according to many sports media, would want to take the position after the World Cup. Not before because he wouldn't have the necessary time to install his tactics and game visions to footballers tremendously worn out by the demanding pace of this season. In any case, Carlo Ancelotti wouldn't be Real Madrid's coach at the Club World Cup, a decision that sparks dozens of opinions. That idea wouldn't hold with the coach change devised by Real Madrid: an interim for the Club World Cup and welcoming Xabi Alonso afterward. The former white forward, in that sense, argues that "it would seem incongruous not to put the Castilla coach". Because "he already did it in the past with Zidane and I think he is the one who knows best because he is daily with Ancelotti". Thus, the former Real Madrid and AS Monaco forward reveals his personal bet on Raúl González Blanco as the new first-team coach. "I would put Raúl, and if not, it would seem even a bit disrespectful to the figure" of one of the most remembered legends of the Madrid squad. Apart from the 'promotion' of the current Real Madrid Castilla coach, Fernando Morientes recalls that "Solari is more than prepared, but I know he would take it reluctantly". So much so that "I'm convinced that he is in another much calmer and more comfortable area than taking that responsibility for just a month", he reveals about Santiago Solari.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mehdi Taremi will start for Inter Milan against Barcelona if Nerazzurri captain Lautaro Martinez proves unable to. This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. The big fitness doubt for Inter Milan ahead of tomorrow's Champions League semifinal second leg against Barcelona has concerned Lautaro Martinez. However, Martinez had to come off at halftime. Subsequent medical tests confirmed that Martinez had not suffered a serious muscle injury, though. Rather, he had sustained an “elongation” to the flexor muscles in his left thigh. Therefore, Martinez should be able to return for the second leg. The Inter captain is doing absolutely everything to make himself available. And reports today have been optimistic regarding Martinez's ability to start. However, the fact that the 27-year-old is still only just coming back from a physical problem means that there is inevitably some doubt. Therefore, Nerazzurri coach Simone Inzaghi also has an alternative plan in mind.</p>

GOAL brings you the latest goings-on with the Britons plying their trade on foreign soil, including England's captain and Los Blancos' 'Galactico'

There isn't a lot left to play for in the Premier League after Liverpool strolled to the title last week and with three teams already relegated straight back to the Championship. The quest for the top five is bubbling away deliciously and the FA Cup final is appearing over the horizon, but the most life-changing of races have already been run.

The same can't be said for many of the competitions in mainland Europe and beyond, however. While those at home on this side of the English Channel are scrounging for continental qualification, there have been some major storylines unfolding elsewhere. Championships are still to be won in Spain and Italy, while one particular person will have been more pleased than anyone else in the knowledge that Germany's Bundesliga has been wrapped up.

Over in France, the top-four battle is as close as can realistically be at this stage of the season, and across the border in Belgium, a relatively low-key Englishman is making waves for a side chasing their first title in generations. This week's review of Britons abroad also takes us to Asia to check in with a continental champion.

So strap in as GOAL brings you the latest on the best Brits strutting their stuff across the globe. It's an action-packed one this week...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami was one of the last clubs to earn a spot in the upcoming Club World Cup… although it was quite controversial, since it was invited by FIFA as a team from the tournament's host country (United States) without meeting any sporting criteria. Sergio Busquets, one of the team's stars, spoke about it at the F1 Grand Prix held this weekend in Miami… and made some statements that surely surprised Inter Miami fans. Sergio Busquets was completely honest about Inter Miami's real chances of making a good impression at the upcoming Club World Cup, where they've been placed in Group A alongside Al Ahly, Palmeiras, and Porto. A group that fans might have gotten excited about, hoping to reach the knockout rounds… until Sergio Busquets crushed expectations. In an interview with DAZN, Sergio Busquets acknowledged that Inter Miami is far behind the competitive standard of most teams participating in the Club World Cup. But we'll try to compete in the group, take it game by game, fight, and hopefully move on to the next round, although it's going to be tough,” said one of Inter Miami's stars just over a month before the tournament begins. Despite their recent win over New York Red Bull in MLS, Inter Miami had a disastrous week that ended with their elimination in the ConcaChampions semifinals against Vancouver Whitecaps. In response, Busquets was highly critical after the match. Javier Mascherano, however, did not share Sergio Busquets' opinion and made that clear in the post-match press conference. “I don't agree with that criticism because Busquets is having a great season and, in my view, he's one of the best players on the team.</p>
