            The International Court of Justice has dismissed Sudan's case alleging that the United Arab Emirates violated the Genocide Convention by supporting paramilitary forces in the Darfur region.
    


            The court said Monday it did not have the jurisdiction to enact provision measures against the UAE, as Sudan had requested, and its judges voted to end the case.
    


            The UAE was quick to celebrate the ruling. Reem Ketait, the Deputy Assistant Minister for Political Affairs, said in a statement that the decision is “a clear and decisive affirmation of the fact that this case was utterly baseless.”
    


            “The Court's finding that it is without jurisdiction confirms that this case should never have been brought,” Ketait said. “Quite simply, today's decision represents a resounding rejection of the Sudanese Armed Forces' attempt to instrumentalize the Court for its campaign of misinformation and to distract from its own responsibility.”
    


            “The facts speak for themselves: the UAE bears no responsibility for the conflict in Sudan. On the contrary, the atrocities committed by the warring parties are well-documented,” Ketait said.
    


            Sudan filed its case against the UAE in March, accusing it of arming the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), an accusation that the UAE had repeatedly denied. Sudan's acting justice minister, Muawia Osman, told the court that “a genocide is being committed against the ethnic group of the Masalit in the west of our country,” with the “support and complicity of the United Arab Emirates.”
    


            Since April 2023, two of Sudan's most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who leads the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and former ally Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary RSF – have engaged in a bloody feud over control of the country which is split between their strongholds.
    


            The ongoing civil war has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian catastrophes and diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict to an end have failed.
    


            Based in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICJ deals with disputes between states and violations of international treaties. Sudan and the UAE are both signatories of the 1948 Genocide Convention.

Follow:


            Britain is marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day this week with four days of commemorations honoring the end of World War II on the continent, as well as those who served and perished during the conflict.
    


            The official surrender of Nazi Germany to Allied forces took place on May 8, 1945, ending a brutal war that claimed tens of millions of lived and reshaped global history.
    


            London's commemorations began Monday when Big Ben, the clock and bell in Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament, struck at midday and extracts from wartime leader Winston Churchill's VE Day speech echoed across the capital.
    


            A military parade, featuring members of the United Kingdom's armed forces, marched from parliament to Buckingham Palace. It was watched by King Charles, Queen Camilla, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.
    


            The King and Queen led the royal family onto the Buckingham Palace balcony to cheers from the crowd below. Moments later, the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows display team streaked across the sky in a flypast that left trails of red, white and blue smoke.
    


            Members of the British royal family attending Monday's procession wore uniforms chosen to reflect both personal military ties and historical resonance. King Charles wore a Naval No.1 uniform with no medals or decorations – mirroring the attire of his grandfather, King George VI, who stood on the Buckingham Palace balcony on VE Day in 1945. Queen Camilla appeared beside him in a sapphire blue wool crepe dress and coat, adorned with a 12th Royal Lancers Brooch – honoring her late father's regiment.
    


            Events will continue across the UK this week. On Tuesday, 30,000 ceramic poppies will be installed at the Tower of London to remember those killed in conflict. Elsewhere, historic landmarks across the UK will be illuminated in the national colors of red, white and blue.
    


            VE Day itself, Thursday, will include a national two-minute silence at midday, a service at Westminster Abbey attended by the King and Queen, and a large-scale concert at Horse Guards Palace. Later, 2,500 beacons will be lit across the UK.
    


            Eighty years ago, the nation erupted in joy as news of the surrender broke. In London, the late Queen Elizabeth, then a 19-year-old princess, and her younger sister Margaret famously slipped out of Buckingham Palace to join the revelers.
    


            But this year, the commemorative mood comes amid renewed tensions within the royal family. Just days ago, Prince Harry revealed that his father, King Charles, no longer speaks to him and that he cannot imagine bringing his family back to the UK after losing a court case over his security arrangements on Friday.

We had hopes of change, but to no avail. Trump's so-called diplomacy pitches are in a state of collapse. He is unwilling to end the Ukraine conflict and military action against Iran almost seems inevitable. Meanwhile, we are witnessing the collapse of liberal democracy in Germany.

Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky is testing America's tolerance for abuses of power by sanctioning his critics, jailed Ukrainian MP Aleksandr Dubinsky has said.

Last week, Zelensky announced measures targeting his former top adviser Aleksey Arestovich, historian Konstantin Bondarenko, who published a biography of the Ukrainian leader, titled “The Joker,” and several other journalists and political analysts. Penalties have included asset freezes, restrictions on trade and financial transactions, travel bans and the revocation of state awards.

“By imposing sanctions against media people and political scientists, Zelensky is also testing the US tolerance for his dictatorship,” Dubinsky, who was detained by Kiev authorities in November 2023 on charges including high treason, wrote in a post on Telegram on Sunday.

The fact that the restrictions were announced a day after the signing of the minerals deal between the US and Ukraine was no coincidence, he suggested.

Zelensky is trying to find out “if there will be any reaction” to such a move from Washington when “the agreement is signed, but not yet ratified” by Ukraine's parliament, the ousted legislator wrote.

The deal, which was agreed upon on Wednesday after months of difficult negotiations, established a joint investment fund and gave the US preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources.

The American security guarantees which Zelensky's government had been demanding were not part of the agreement, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal.

“Furthermore, Zelensky is also needed to sign the peace treaty [with Russia]. This gives him the opportunity to test the limits of what is allowed. Europe is satisfied with him, and the US seems to be satisfied with him now too,” Dubinsky stressed.

The Ukrainian leader sees the situation as an opportunity to get rid of his political opponents, he added.

Legislators from Zelensky's Servant of the People party, who are “joyfully applauding the tyranny… do not understand that they are next. A dictator does not need fellow travelers, he only needs a show of force,” the MP wrote.

Zelensky remains in power in Ukraine despite his presidential term officially expiring last May. He canceled the election citing the martial law he had imposed due to the conflict with Russia. In mid-April, the Ukrainian leader prolonged the emergency measures another three months.

Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has launched a drone attack on Port Sudan, targeting a military air base and nearby facilities, the African country's army spokesperson reported on Sunday. 

The strike marks the first RSF attack on the eastern city since clashes erupted between the group and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) more than two years ago. The army said the shelling caused “limited damage” to an ammunition store at the Osman Digna air base, but no casualties were recorded.

Port Sudan – home to the country's main airport, military headquarters, and its seaport – had been considered the safest haven in a war that has devastated the capital, Khartoum, and killed thousands of people.

The SAF said it had closed roads leading to the presidential palace and army command following the incident and increased deployments around key locations.

The Port Sudan attack came just days after the RSF seized control of El-Nuhud, West Kordofan state's largest city. At least three health workers, including the medical director at the E-Nuhud hospital, were killed following the May 1 takeover, local news outlet Sudan Tribune reported on Sunday, citing a statement from the Sudan Doctors Syndicate.

In March, the army drove RSF forces out of their last positions in Khartoum, but the militia group has maintained control in parts of Omdurman across the Nile and tightened its grips over western Sudan.

The RSF has not commented on the Port Sudan attack, but it confirmed its operations in Al-Nuhud in an official statement on Saturday. The group announced that its fighters have also “successfully liberated the city of Al-Khowei in West Kordofan State, just one day after liberating the city of Al-Nuhoud.”

The conflict between the army and the RSF began as a power struggle in April 2023 and has since displaced over 12.4 million people, including over 3.3 million refugees who have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN estimates. Approximately half of Sudan's 50 million people are facing acute hunger. A study published last year by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine estimated that the death toll in Khartoum state alone could be around 61,000.

NEW YORK, May 5. /TASS/. The European Union is set to propose measures to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027, Bloomberg reported citing sources.

The EU plans to unveil in June a proposal to prohibit all gas imports under new agreements with Russia as well as existing spot contracts, according to the agency. The European Commission (EC) intends to announce its proposed restrictions on Russian pipeline gas and LNG supplies under long-term contracts in Strasbourg on May 6, the sources said.

Policies targeting spot contracts will come into effect no later than 2025, while restrictions on long-term agreements will be implemented by the end of 2027, Bloomberg wrote. Their timeline depends on the EU's ability to secure alternative LNG sources from Africa, Canada, Qatar, and the US among others, through trade negotiations with US President Donald Trump's administration, the agency added.

The plans, scheduled to be presented at the European Parliament's session on May 6, are still subject to change, sources noted.

Reuters reported earlier that the EC was assessing legal options to allow EU companies to exit current gas supply contracts with Russia without incurring penalties. Additionally, the EU intends to present a comprehensive roadmap for phasing out Russian energy resources on May 6.

In May 2022, the European Union launched the REPowerEU program to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian gas by 2027. Meanwhile, the cost of Russian LNG imports for the EU has nearly quadrupled in three years due to rising prices and increased supply volumes.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 5. /TASS/. Romanian residents have been deprived of the opportunity to vote for their preferred presidential candidate, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing, responding to a TASS request to comment on the results of the first round of the presidential election in the country.

According to the voting results, right-wing candidate George Simion, a co-party of politician Calin Georgescu, who was withdrawn from the election for farfetched reasons, emerged as the first-round leader.

""One of the favorites of these elections was thrown out of the electoral race in a totally arbitrary manner,"" the Kremlin spokesman recalled. ""In any case, Romanian voters were deprived of the right to cast their vote for the person they want,"" he added.

Asked whether Europe could be considered tired of candidates imposed by the EU bureaucracy, Peskov said that the matter should be assessed ""not by us, but by the Romanians.""

The first round of Romania's new presidential election was held on Sunday. According to its results, Simion (40.96%) and an independent candidate, Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan (20.99%), moved to the next stage with a large gap.

Scheduled presidential elections were suspended in late 2024 by Romania's Constitutional Court after nationalist candidate Calin Georgescu won the most votes in the first round on November 24, 2024. He was suspected of having ties to Russia, but even an internal Romanian investigation failed to confirm the allegations. Despite the fact that the unprecedented move caused an uproar both in Romania and abroad, the government took note of the court's decision and called a re-run of the presidential election. Georgescu, on the other hand, was barred from running as a candidate in the runoff election.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Five others injured while police say more than one person may have been firing a gun in Arizona restaurant

Three people are dead and five others were injured after a shooting at a restaurant in a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday night, police said, adding that there may have been more than one person firing a gun.

Police received calls reporting shots around 7.45pm at El Camaron Gigante Mariscos & Steakhouse, Officer Moroni Mendez of Glendale police department said during a briefing.

Mendez said three people died from their injuries and five other people were injured by gunshots or shrapnel, KPHO-TV reported.

“Obviously there was a lot of people here,” Mendez said. “A lot of people that were attending some sort of event. Anyone who has information, please come forward and provide that to us because as we just recently stated, there are three deceased. So we want to make sure we do a complete and thorough investigation, and do right by the victims.”

Police believe there was more than one shooter involved. Investigators did not have a suspect in custody but multiple people were being questioned, Mendez said.

Bystander Lupe Rodriguez said he ran to safety. He was shaken, but said he was grateful that he and his friends survived.

“There was a man on the ground, and it didn't look like he made it,” Rodriguez said. “His father was yelling out his name. It was pretty bad.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Steven J Hatfill, who promoted the drug despite scant evidence of efficacy, becomes special adviser at HHS

A proponent of using the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 despite scant evidence of its efficacy has been named to a top pandemic prevention role at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Washington Post reports.

Steven J Hatfill is a virologist who served in Donald Trump's first administration, during which he promoted hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus in the early months of the pandemic, when vaccines and treatments were not yet available. He recently started as a special adviser in the office of the director of the administration for strategic preparedness and response, which prepares the country to respond to pandemics, as well as chemical and biological attacks.

The Trump administration embraced using the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, along with other drugs such as ivermectin and chloroquine, as treatments against Covid-19, despite concerns over both their efficacy and potentially serious side-effects. In June 2020, just months after the pandemic started, the Food and Drug Administration warned against using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19 over “reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues”, even after Trump approved ordering millions of doses of the drug for US patients from Brazil.

Last year, a study released at the onset of the pandemic that promoted hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 was withdrawn by the publisher of the medical journal.

In an interview with the Post, Hatfill defended his support of hydroxychloroquine, which remains in use to treat diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. “There is no ambiguity there. It is a safe drug,” Hatfill said, noting that “they gave the drug to the president” in 2020, when Trump contracted Covid-19.

In his new job, Hatfill said he would “help get us ready for the next pandemic” and work with his agency's scientists on achieving “complete awareness of the scientific literature, not just for influenza, bird flu or Covid but other global diseases that could represent a threat to the US”.

Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former appointee under Joe Biden, told the Washington Post: “My hope is that Dr Hatfill will pursue the things that are of greatest value in preparing for another pandemic, such as new medicines and vaccines.”

He noted that hydroxychloroquine “doesn't cure Covid and has risks”.

Before Hatfill began working for the Trump administration, he was a biodefense researcher for the army in 2001 and was named a “person of interest” in the investigation into anthrax-filled envelopes sent by mail across the country, which killed five people and made 17 others sick.

The allegations, which Hatfill denied, cost him his job, and in 2008, the justice department formally cleared him, the same year that he received $4.6m from the government to settle a lawsuit alleging the government violated his privacy rights.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump spokesperson says the administration is ‘exploring all options' but not yet enacting 100% tariff on movies ‘produced in Foreign Lands' as president said

The White House said in a clarifying statement Monday that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made” after President Trump abruptly announced on his Truth Social platform Sunday a 100% tariff on all movies “produced in Foreign Lands,” sparking widespread concern across the film industry.

“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Hollywood Reporter.

Earlier we reported that Rwanda is in “early stage” discussions with the Trump administration to potentially receiving third-country deportees from the US, according to the country's foreign minister. According to internal federal government documents obtained by CBS News, the administration has also approached the likes of Angola and Equatorial Guinea to aid its aggressive mass deportation efforts.

The administration has already brokered agreements with several Latin American countries willing to accept migrants who are not their own. In February, the US deported hundreds of African and Asian people to Costa Rica and Panama. In March, the Trump administration sent nearly 300 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador, which is being paid millions of dollars to detain them in its infamous mega-prison.

Guatemala has also agreed to take in third-country deportees from the US. The Mexican government, under a deal that precedes Trump's second term, has been receiving migrants from other Latin American countries, like Venezuela, caught crossing the US southern border illegally.

But per CBS's report, the Trump administration has identified further countries that could potentially accept deportations of third country nationals, including Angola, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Libya, Moldova and Rwanda, according to the internal government documents and officials. The US has yet to announce any formal deals with these countries.

The Wall Street Journal reported on the internal talks with some of these countries in April. The negotiations with Angola and Equatorial Guinea have not been previously reported.

One of the ideas under consideration, the internal government documents show, would be for the US to use the agreements to deport suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration.

During last Wednesday's cabinet meeting, secretary of state Marco Rubio confirmed the Trump administration was “actively searching for other countries to take people from third countries”. He said:

We are working with other countries to say, ‘we want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries'. ‘Would you do that, as a favor to us? And the further away from America, the better.'

Drugmakers have warned that Americans would suffer most if Donald Trump imposed tariffs on imports of pharmaceuticals, as medications would become more expensive and potentially unaffordable for some people.

Drugmakers have been braced for targeted border taxes – similar to the 25% levies on steel, aluminium and car imports – after the president threatened to hit the sector and announced an investigation last month. Last week, Trump hinted at a possible reprieve for companies, saying they would be given time to move their operations to the US, but “after that it's going to be a tariff wall put up, and they won't be happy about it”, he added.

Giovanni Barbella, the global head of strategy and supply chain at the Swiss multinational Sandoz, one of the world's biggest makers of generic drugs, said tariffs would lead to supply disruptions and price increases, hitting US patients hardest. He said:

We are producing products on a very tight margin. That's the nature of our industry. So ultimately, higher production cost, including the cost of tariffs, will lead to higher prices.

Rwanda is in talks with the Trump administration to potentially take in people deported from the US, the country's foreign minister said late on Sunday.

Rwanda's foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, said that his country's government was in “early stage” discussions about receiving third-country deportees from the US.

“It is true that we are in discussions with the United States,” Nduhungirehe said in an interview with Rwanda TV, reported Reuters. “These talks are still ongoing, and it would be premature to conclude how they will unfold,” he added.

The move appears to be another step by the Trump administration to pursue swift deportations, several of which have lacked thorough due process. In a highly controversial arrangement worth millions of dollars, it has already paid El Salvador to incarcerate hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members deported from the US in its notorious mega-prison.

The White House said in a clarifying statement Monday that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made” after President Trump abruptly announced on his Truth Social platform Sunday a 100% tariff on all movies “produced in Foreign Lands,” sparking widespread concern across the film industry.

“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Hollywood Reporter.

President Donald Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform this morning that he had just had a “very good and productive” phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Their conversation covered “many subjects, including the War with Russia/Ukraine, all things Syria, Gaza, and more,” Trump wrote. “The President invited me to go to Turkey at a future date and, likewise, he will be coming to Washington, D.C. During my four years as President, my relationship with President Erdoğan was excellent,” he added.

“In any event, I look forward to working with President Erdoğan on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!” Trump wrote.

Scott Bessent, the US secretary of the treasury, referred to a “trade puzzle” and said “China is the biggest piece” when asked about Trump's “goal of reindustrialization” with tariffs and the risk of isolating the US.

“If we want more manufacturing, and everyone agrees that [China] needs more consumption, we could actually do that together,” he said during a global conference in California on Monday morning. “Trade is not always a straight line. It's not always a pleasant process, but I think at the end, the trading relationships will be stronger. Our security and values ties will still be there.”

President Trump's trade war has continued to escalate, especially with China, driving up tariff costs. Beijing said on Friday it was “evaluating” an offer from the US to engage in trade negotiations, though Donald Trump had claimed a week earlier that talks were already under way.

The Trump administration says it's going to pay $1,000 to immigrants who have returned to their home country voluntarily after being in the US illegally, reports the Associated Press.

The Department of Homeland Security said Monday that it was also paying for travel assistance and that people who use their CBP Home app (the Customs and Border Protection app) to tell the government they plan to return home will be “deprioritized” for detention and removal by Ice.

As the mass deportation agenda continues, the Trump administration is seeking cost-saving measures such as pushing people to “self-deport”.

“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest. DHS is now offering illegal aliens financial travel assistance and a stipend to return to their home country through the CBP Home App,” the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, said.

Prominent figures in the Maga movement came out against the bipartisan IGO Anti-Boycott Act, House Resolution 867 saying it would criminalize boycotts and free speech against Israel, after which a scheduled vote on the legislation today was canceled, Newsweek reports.

According to the lawmakers who introduced the bill, Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, and Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, it would have amended “the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 to include international governmental organizations (IGOs) in existing anti-boycott laws”. The change, they said, “targets harmful and inherently antisemitic” boycott efforts undertaken at IGOs while also “extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries”.

Critics warned the bill threatened the constitutional rights of Americans to free speech. The penalties under the legislation included civil penalties, criminal fines of up to $1m and imprisonment of up to 20 years for supporting calls to boycott Israel or its settlements.

Revealing an interesting split on the American right regarding criticism of Israel, after public backlash to the bill a number of prominent Maga lawmakers said on Sunday that they planned to vote against the legislation. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, wrote on X yesterday evening that the vote had been pulled.

She had posted on X in opposition to the bill: “I will be voting NO. It is my job to defend American's rights to buy or boycott whomever they choose without the government harshly fining them or imprisoning them. But what I don't understand is why we are voting on a bill on behalf of other countries and not the President's executive orders that are FOR OUR COUNTRY???”

Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, wrote on X in response to Greene's post: “I agree with @RepMTG. I'll be voting No on this bill as well.”

And Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, wrote on X: “H.R. 867, up for a vote tomorrow, aims to curb antisemitism but threatens First Amendment rights. Americans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment.”

Trump is scheduled to meet at the White House today with Russian American ballerina Ksenia Karelina, a White House official has told NBC News.

Karelina was released from a Russian prison last month after spending more than a year in custody following allegations of financially supporting Ukraine's military.

She was arrested in Russia in February 2024 and sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony after she donated $52 to a charity that sends aid to Ukraine.

Donald Trump has two crypto-focused dinners on the calendar this month — one aimed at deep-pocketed political donors, the other at meme coin millionaires. Both are poised to help him raise millions.

The first event, a $1.5m-per-plate Maga Inc fundraiser set to take place tonight, is among the most expensive ticketed dinners in presidential history. Attenders are promised the chance to network with Trump's inner circle, including David Sacks, the White House's crypto policy architect.

The second, on 22 May, offers the opportunity to win a private dinner with the self-proclaimed “crypto president” for the top 220 investors in the $TRUMP meme token. For the top 25 coin holders at the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National golf club in Washington DC, there will be “an-ultra exclusive private VIP reception with YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!” plus a “special VIP tour” of the White House, the coin's website said.

But the terms and conditions dutifully state: “President Trump may not be able to attend the $TRUMP Gala Dinner, and the $TRUMP Gala Dinner may be cancelled for any reason (including, but not limited to, a force majeure event). In the event President Trump is unable to attend the $TRUMP Gala Dinner, or if the $TRUMP Gala Dinner does take place, then in our sole discretion, the $TRUMP Gala Dinner may be rescheduled to another date, or $TRUMP Meme holders who are qualified for the Gala Dinner and/or reception will receive a limited edition TRUMP NFT in lieu thereof.”

The offer of access to the president for those who invest in an organization that funds Trump's personal fortune has sparked bipartisan scrutiny and criticism, NBC News reports. “This is my president that we're talking about, but I am willing to say that this gives me pause,” said Senator Cynthia Lummis, of Wyoming, who has been spearheading a legislative push on cryptocurrency regulation in the Senate.

A staunch ally of the president, Lummis said on Wednesday that she thought Congress needed to regulate standards around the use of digital assets like meme coins. “This is the wild west, and so when I hear things like this, my reaction is, we need to legislate so there are rules,” she told NBC News.

Senator Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, who often bucks her party, expressed uneasiness about the event, though she noted she didn't have all of the details. “I don't think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” Murkowski told NBC News on Thursday. “[Trump's] got to remember that he's living [at the White House], but it's the people's house, right?”

Donald Trump's former vice-president Mike Pence received a John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award on Sunday for his actions on January 6, when he defied Trump's demands to overturn the 2020 election. After rightwing extremists stormed the US Capitol, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence”, the former vice-president remained in the Capitol and later oversaw the congressional certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory.

“Vice-President Pence put his life, career and that of his family on the line to execute his constitutional responsibilities. His actions preserved the fundamental democratic principle of free and fair elections and we are proud to honor him,” former ambassador Caroline Kennedy, John F Kennedy's daughter, said in presenting Pence with the award.

She added that “political courage is not outdated in the United States”.

In accepting the annual award, Pence, 65, said it was a “distinction that I will cherish for the rest of my life”. Pointing to his actions on 6 January 2021, he said to a standing ovation:

I will always believe by God's grace that I did my duty that day.

Pence went on:

January 6 was a tragic day. But it became a triumph of freedom. And history will record that our institutions held.

Speaking after the ceremony of public response to his actions, he told Fox News Digital: “It convinces me that the American people know that what ever differences we may have, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand.”

Donald Trump on Friday reflected on his phone call earlier in the week with Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, telling NBC News that he would use the same tactic with other CEOs if necessary.

Trump called Bezos after it was reported that Amazon would list the cost of tariffs on certain purchases for consumers. The White House had earlier called the reported move a “hostile and political act”.

In an interview that aired on Sunday, Trump said of Bezos:

He's just a very nice guy. We have a relationship. I asked him about [the tariff charge language Amazon considered including in listings]. He said, ‘Well, I don't want to do that,' and he took it off immediately.

Trump and Bezos have developed a cozier relationship in recent months, with Amazon donating $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and Bezos attending his swearing in ceremony. In the days before the presidential election, the Washington Post, owned by Bezos, did not endorse a candidate for the first time in over three decades, and in February went a step further in overhauling the newspaper's opinion section to focus its output “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”.

Following the call, Tim Doyle, Amazon spokesperson, said: “The team that runs our ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen.”

Asked whether he would use the same tactic with CEOs of other major retailers, Trump told NBC News:

Sure. I'll always call people if I disagree with them.

If I think that somebody's doing something that's incorrect, wrong or maybe hurtful to the country, I'll call. Wouldn't you want me to call? [former president Joe] Biden wouldn't call because he didn't know what was happening, but I do.

A senior Israeli defence official said on Monday there was a “window of opportunity” for a hostage deal in Gaza during Donald Trump's visit to the region next week.

However, Reuters reports, if no deal is agreed Israel would begin its new operation in the enclave.

“If there is no hostage deal, Operation ‘Gideon Chariots' will begin with great intensity and will not stop until all its goals are achieved,” the official said, following a decision by the security cabinet to approve an expanded operation.

It comes as Israel's security cabinet voted unanimously on Monday to approve a plan to expand its military operations in Gaza in the coming weeks, with the aim of “conquering” the territory and establishing a “sustained presence” there.

The plan is part of Israel's efforts to negotiate a ceasefire on Israel's terms and increase pressure on Hamas to free the remaining hostages. Israeli officials said the plan also includes the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to southern Gaza.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, “continues to promote” Trump's proposal from January to displace the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza to neighbouring countries such as Jordan or Egypt, to allow its reconstruction, the officials also said.

Trump's scheduled visit later this month to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE may provide an additional incentive to the Israeli government to conclude a new ceasefire deal and allow aid into Gaza. Trump, who recently said he wanted Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”, is likely to come under pressure from his hosts to push Israel to make concessions to end the conflict.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

SPAIN

Cable theft delays trains

Thousands of rail passengers were hit with delays after the cable used in the signaling system of the high-speed line between Madrid and Seville was stolen at four locations, authorities said yesterday. The theft, which happened late on Sunday, affected dozens of trains traveling between Madrid and Andalucia, just as many people were returning home to the capital after a holiday weekend. Railway infrastructure company ADIF said on X that the high-speed train connecting Madrid and cities in the south was expected to resume service at about 9:30am from Madrid and in Seville, Malaga and Granada. State-owned railway operator Renfe said in a radio interview that services should return to normal by mid-morning yesterday. The cable theft took place at four points on the high-speed line in Toledo, ADIF said. 

VENEZUELA

Protester dies in prison

A man detained during protests following President Nicolas Maduro's controversial re-election last year has died in state custody, an opposition leader and a non-governmental organization (NGO) said. Lindomar Amaro, 27, was arrested for “inciting hatred, harassment, and possession of a weapon of war,” a military report said, and was being held in Tocoron prison, a maximum-security facility in the state of Aragua. The Venezuela-based Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners on Sunday said that Amaro died in prison on Saturday. “The reported cause was hanging inside his cell,” the NGO wrote on X, noting that Amaro had previously “attempted to kill himself.” Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who claimed the opposition's victory in last year's presidential elections, accused the president of responsibility for Amaro's death. “This is one of the most horrendous crimes this regime has committed. Let no one doubt it: this death has ONE person responsible: Maduro,” Machado said on X.  

CHINA

10 tourists die at sea

Four boats capsized in a sudden storm at a tourist spot in southwestern China, killing 10 people, state media said yesterday. More than 80 people fell into a river when strong winds hit the scenic area in Guizhou Province late on Sunday afternoon, China Travel Television (CCTV) said. The boats capsized after a sudden rain and hail storm on the upper reaches of the Wu River, a tributary of the Yangtze River. In one video shared by state media, a man could be seen performing CPR on another person, while one of the vessels drifted upside down. Initial reports said two tourist boats had capsized, but state media yesterday said that four boats were involved. The other two boats had no passengers, and the seven crew members were able to save themselves, CCTV said.

KENYA

President fends off shoe

President William Ruto fended off a shoe thrown at him during a speech about the cost of living which has been a source of public anger, videos shared on social media showed. Ruto has been compelled to abandon tax hikes and invite opposition members into his Cabinet, but discontent remains high. At a rally on Sunday in Migori County, Ruto blocked the flying footwear with his arm and did not appear to be injured, according to three videos. “We have said we are reducing the price of fertilizer, true or false?” he said as the shoe bounced off him, kicking up a small cloud of dust. Minister of the Interior Kipchumba Murkomen said police had arrested three people, the Star newspaper reported.

“Nigeria needs someone like Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso. He is doing well for his country,” Sanni said.
His admiration is shaped by a steady stream of viral videos, memes and social media posts — many misleading or outright false — portraying Traore as a fearless reformer who defied Western powers and reclaimed his country's dignity.

Following a campaign dominated by Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Carney promised to chart “a new path forward” in a world “fundamentally changed” by a US that is newly hostile to free trade.

For more than a decade, passengers at New Zealand 's Wellington International Airport have boarded flights below the figures of two giant, hovering eagles from the Hobbit films, one bearing a bellowing wizard Gandalf.

With 15m wingspans and weighing 1.2 tonnes, the sculptures that hover in the terminal have delighted tourists and scared children since 2013. Their tenure was eventful — one became unmoored from its fixings during a severe earthquake in 2016, and plummeted onto the terminal floor below. No one was hurt.

However, this month the majestic creatures, which underscore the city's connection to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, are to depart the terminal for good, Wellington airport announced yesterday.

“It's been quite a Lord of the Rings-heavy storytelling theme in here,” airport chief executive Matt Clarke said. “Now we're looking to change that to something new.”

“It breaks my heart,” said one traveler, Verity Johnson, who sat beneath a grasping eagle claw in the food court yesterday.

The sculptures had impressed her since she was young.

“Please, please reconsider,” she said.

“Taking them away is un-New Zealand,” joked another airport visitor, Michael Parks.

The eagles were crafted by the film props and effects company Weta Workshop, which created tens of thousands of props for the Oscar-winning fantasy films directed by Jackson. The movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novels generated billions of dollars in tourism revenue for New Zealand and employed thousands of people in Wellington over the 15 years of the movies' production.

However, during the years the eagles have hovered in the terminal, Tolkien tourism has waned in Wellington — although the city will perhaps always be synonymous with Jackson's films. Guided tours still convey fans to the settings of famous scenes from the films and to visit production companies such as Weta, which will create a new display for the airport, to be unveiled later this year, Clarke said.

Travelers have until Friday to admire the birds, which will then be put into storage, Clarke said. He hopes the creatures — which each feature 1,000 3D printed feathers — would find a home at a museum.

“It's a spectacular thing for little kids to see,” Clarke said. “Even your old, grizzled businessmen, they still pull out their phones and take a quick cheeky photo, too.”

Wellington Airport is not losing its quirky side. An enormous sculpture of The Hobbit's gold-hoarding dragon, Smaug, is to remain overlooking the check-in counters.

The BRP Miguel Malvar, old enough to have seen action in World War II, was yesterday scheduled to go out in a blaze of glory, as a target ship during the annual US-Philippine “Balikatan” military exercises.

However, the 80-year-old vessel would not quite make its own funeral.

Onlookers instead watched as the ship, which once chased Japanese submarines and ferried German prisoners as part of the US fleet, sank before the first volley could be fired.

“The Balikatan 25 maritime strike targets vessel sank off the west coast of the Philippines prior to the event commencing today,” Philippine Navy spokesman John Percie Alcos said in canceling a planned media event.

“Due to rough sea conditions ... and with its long service life ... she took on a significant amount of water and eventually sank,” he said 

 Praising it as one of the most-decorated ships in Philippine history, Alcos said the country was proud to be “transitioning to a new and multicapable navy.”

After more than 20 years of service, the vessel — then named USS Brattleboro — was sold to the Republic of Vietnam in 1966.

The Philippine Navy acquired and refurbished the ship after its crew fled Vietnam following the 1975 fall of Saigon.

Balikatan, three weeks of US-Philippine joint exercises aimed at deterring Beijing's ambitions in the disputed South China Sea, is set to end on Friday.

17:53 JST, May 5, 2025

OYAMA, Tochigi — About 6 kilometers north of JR Oyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture, located in the middle of a fork in the road, sits a restaurant with soda labels on its signboard.

Inside the restaurant, called Drive-in Fuso, several groups of people, including families and men in work uniforms, were sitting at tables waiting for their food.

The owner, Hiroko Suzuki, could be heard from the kitchen saying: “Sorry for the wait, the tanmen will be ready soon. It's delicious. I'm putting my whole heart into it.”

One customer informed me, “She doesn't have anyone to help her.”

The restaurant serves three dishes: tanmen (ramen with stir-fried vegetables and pork on top), katsudon pork cutlet rice bowl and yakiniku grilled meat set.

There used to be more items on the menu, but the owner narrowed them down a few years ago to make it easier to run the shop by herself.

The tanmen, which is served with about 1 kilogram of vegetables, and the katsudon cost ¥770 each, while the yakiniku set costs ¥990. The dishes are inexpensive yet come with a lot of food.

Suzuki's husband, Shoji, opened the restaurant in 1965, around the time more people in Japan began buying cars, and it became very popular. The look of the interior, with its tatami mat sections, has remained unchanged since the restaurant opened. Five chefs used to prepare the meals, and the restaurant would take reservations for banquets in the evenings.

Suzuki married her husband when she was 18. She would bring their young child to the restaurant and help out, even working in the kitchen. She also got a large vehicle license so that she could drive a minibus to pick up and drop off banquet customers. Shoji passed away in 2022, but she continues to run the restaurant.

When torrential rains hit the Kanto and Tohoku regions in 2015, the restaurant was flooded, destroying everything from the tables to the refrigerator.

Suzuki said her children, relatives and regular customers helped her out. She was able to reopen the restaurant after about two months, as customers donated chairs and tatami mats.

“The only way I can repay them is to serve delicious food with all my heart,” she said.

Ukraine's Embassy in Slovakia on May 4 condemned what it called ""anti-Ukrainian"" remarks by Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky's warning that Russia could stage provocations during its May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow.

In a statement, the Ukrainian Embassy said it regretted Fico's accusations and urged Slovak officials to ""more carefully study, rewatch, and analyze"" Zelensky's statements. 

Zelensky on May 3 said Ukraine cannot guarantee the safety of foreign officials planning to attend Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, warning Russia could orchestrate provocations, including ""arsons, explosions, or other actions,"" and attempt to blame Ukraine. Russia is responsible for ensuring safety and security on its territory, Zelensky added.

Fico, who plans to attend Russia's Victory Day celebrations, had earlier denounced Zelensky for ""threatening"" foreign delegations, calling the remarks ""unacceptable"" and accusing the Ukrainian leader of disrespecting Russia's role in defeating fascism in World War II.

The embassy said that Zelensky had only warned that Russia might exploit the parade to stage provocations and blame Ukraine, and therefore could not guarantee the safety of visiting foreign officials.

In its response, the Ukrainian Embassy said it viewed Fico's remarks as ""deeply regrettable,"" particularly amid ongoing Russian aggression. 

""Regarding the need not to mix history with the present, the Embassy regrets to note that the current Russian aggression against Ukraine has returned to the scale of atrocities unseen since World War II, which Russia is now using solely to justify the war against our country,"" the embassy said. 

""It should be remembered that during the Second World War, Ukrainian soldiers made a huge contribution to the victory over Nazism, having distinguished themselves with extraordinary heroism, bravery and self-sacrifice on all fronts,"" the statement read.

Highlighting Ukraine's contribution to the Allied war effort, the embassy noted that six million Ukrainians fought against Nazism, both in the Soviet army and other Allied forces. The war, it said, claimed over eight million Ukrainian lives.

The embassy also pushed back against Fico's calls for a ceasefire timed with the WWII anniversary, noting that Ukraine had already agreed to a full ceasefire on March 11, while Russia ""constantly rejects this option and puts forward new demands, manipulates, escalates terror, and now offers a short truce for 3 days, which is not a serious path to peace.""

Fico, a populist with pro-Russian leanings, is one of few European leaders set to attend Russia's Victory Day amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. 

On May 9, Russia holds grandiose military parades in celebration of the end of World War II in Europe. Ukraine and most European nations mark May 8 as Victory in Europe Day.

Latest: Kyiv responds to Fico's 'anti-Ukrainian' remarks.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 4 condemned President Volodymyr Zelensky for warning ""foreign delegations not to come"" to Russia's Victory Day parade on May 9.

Zelensky on May 3 said Ukraine cannot guarantee the safety of foreign officials planning to attend Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, warning Russia could orchestrate provocations, including ""arsons, explosions, or other actions,"" and attempt to blame Ukraine. Russia is responsible for ensuring safety and security on its territory, Zelensky said.

""I reject such threats for security reasons. I fully respect that the safety of participants is an internal matter of the Russian Federation. But if Mr. Zelensky believes that his statements will force foreign delegations not to come, then he is deeply mistaken,"" Fico said.

The leader called for an ""armistice"" amid the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, adding that Zelensky should of ""remain silent.""

""It is a great disrespect when someone says to a country that made the greatest contribution to the victory over fascism and suffered the absolute greatest sacrifices we can imagine: 'Well, celebrate, we might drop a drone or something like that on you.' For me, these are unacceptable things,"" Fico said.

Moscow often situates victory in World War II as a sole Russian achievement and not a multinational one, Jonathan Brunstedt, an assistant professor of history at Texas A&M University, focusing on nationalism and historical memory in the Soviet Union, said.

""They are responsible for your safety. We will not provide any guarantees, because we do not know what Russia might do on those dates,"" Zelensky said on May 3.

Fico, a proponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, will attend Russia's Victory Day celebrations, despite Russia's war against Ukraine.

On May 9, Russia holds grandiose military parades in celebration of the end of World War II in Europe. Ukraine and most European nations mark May 8 as Victory in Europe Day.

Ukraine has invited senior EU leaders and officials to Kyiv on May 9 to counter Russia's celebration.

The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, on April 15 warned European leaders against attending Russia's Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.

""What was also discussed very clearly, and said by different member states, is that any participation in the 9th May parades or celebrations in Moscow will not be taken lightly on the European side, considering that Russia is really waging a full-scale war in Europe,"" she said.

Kallas said the EU does not want to see any country aspiring to join the bloc participating in celebrations hosted by Putin's government.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic confirmed on April 16 that he intends to travel to Moscow for Russian President Vladimir Putin's May 9 Victory Parade despite the EU's pressure.

Serbia is a candidate country to join the EU, and has undergone accession negotiations with the bloc for several years.

Vucic has reportedly fallen ill, jeopardizing the Serbian president's ability to participate in Russia's celebration, Newsweek reported on May 4.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A boat makes its way toward Alcatraz Island with the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the background in this view from Sausalito, Calif., on Dec. 13, 2013.Eric Risberg/The Canadian Press

President Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on a hard-to-reach California island that has been closed for more than 60 years.

In a post on his Truth Social site Sunday evening, Trump wrote that, “For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.”

“That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders,” he wrote, adding: “The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.”

The prison – infamously inescapable due to the strong ocean currents and cold Pacific waters that surround it – was known as the “The Rock” and housed some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including gangster Al Capone and George “Machine Gun” Kelly.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday (May 4) that he was directing the Bureau of Prisons to rebuild and reopen the infamous Alcatraz prison in the San Francisco Bay to ""house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders."" Lauren Roback reports.

It has long been part of the cultural imagination and has been the subject of numerous movies, including “The Rock” starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.

Still in the 29 years it was open, 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes, according to the FBI. Nearly all were caught or didn't survive the attempt.

The fate of three particular inmates – John Anglin, his brother Clarence and Frank Morris – is of some debate and was dramatized in the 1979 film “Escape from Alcatraz” starring Clinton Eastwood.

Alcatraz Island is now a major tourist site that is operate by the National Parks Service and is a designated National Historic Landmark.

The closure of the federal prison in 1963 was attributed to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the island facility, because everything from fuel to food had to be brought by boat.

A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that the agency “will comply with all Presidential Orders.” The spokesperson did not immediately answer questions from the Associated Press regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National Park Service's control of the island.

The island serves as a veritable time machine to a bygone era of corrections. The Bureau of Prisons currently has 16 penitentiaries performing the same high-security functions as Alcatraz, including its maximum security facility in Florence, Colorado, and the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is home to the federal death chamber.

The order comes as Trump has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without due process. Trump has also directed the opening of a detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,to hold up to 30,000 of what he has labelled the “worst criminal aliens.”

The Bureau of Prisons has faced myriad crises in recent years and has been subjected to increased scrutiny after Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at a federal jail in New York City in 2019. An AP investigation uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.

The AP's investigation also exposed rampant sexual abuse at a federal women's prison in Dublin, California. Last year, President Joe Biden signed a law strengthening oversight of the agency after AP reporting spotlighted its many flaws.

President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House after arriving in Washington on May 4.TIERNEY L. CROSS/The New York Times News Service

For the past few months, Jon Voight has been quietly taking meetings with U.S. studio executives and entertainment-industry unions as the actor – perhaps best known today for biting the arm of Cosmo Kramer – tries to fulfill his mandate as one of U.S. President Donald Trump's “special ambassadors” to the film industry. (The other two unofficial envoys, announced by Trump in January, are Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson, right-leaning Hollywood fixtures who, unlike Voight, are presumably too busy making movies to take the White House's instructions seriously.)

One of the problems that Voight has been asked to solve by Trump is a legitimate one: production of movies inside the United States, specifically California, has cratered over the past few years. While the pandemic and the duelling Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023 didn't help the situation, the exodus of Hollywood from its own home base is largely due to one thing: money. 

Over the past decade, countless international territories have seriously beefed up their financial incentives and infrastructures while the more familiar U.S. production hotbeds of L.A., New York, and Atlanta struggled to respond. Today, most Marvel movies are filmed in London. The same goes for the DC, Star Wars, and Fast & Furious franchises. Many mid-budget action flicks (including this summer's forthcoming John Wick spinoff, Ballerina) have decamped to Eastern Europe. And Canada has practically invented the Hallmark Movie industrial complex, providing not only the generous tax incentives but the well-developed local talent. It's not personal, it's just business. 

Last week, word around Hollywood was that Voight was set to finally unveil his grand Make American Movies Great Again plan to Trump. But if Voight's idea is indeed the same one that Trump unveiled on the Truth Social platform Sunday night, then the White House got what it deserved when it enlisted the erstwhile star of Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 to be the brain behind its initiative. 

The President announced that instead of, say, reasonably coaxing U.S. states into revamping their tax-break programs for film productions or adding a federal layer of financial incentives for shooting domestically, he will slap a 100-per-cent tariff on “any and all movies coming into our country that are produced by foreign lands.” Like so many of Trump's pronouncements, there were no details or timelines offered – only the thoroughly ridiculous notion that the situation represented a “National Security threat.”

U.S. President Donald Trump on May 4 announced a 100-per-cent tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers.

Reuters

There are approximately 10,000 reasons why such a plan would not and should not work. 

For starters, films and any other “informational sources” produced abroad are constitutionally protected from any sanctions thanks to the Berman Amendment, which was passed in 1988 to protect the free flow of culture internationally, even from “adversarial” states. (The obscure measure was rescued from the margins of Cold War history in 2023 after D.C. tried to ban TikTok.) 

Second, Hollywood's major studios – which are controlled by some of the largest corporations in the United States – would simply implode were they forced to add tariffs to, say, this summer's new Fantastic Four movie (filmed in London) or James Cameron's upcoming Avatar sequel (New Zealand) or the latest Mission: Impossible instalment (filmed absolutely everywhere). 

Donald Trump's Truth Social post about the movie industry from May 4, 2025.

While Hollywood CEOs have so far shown a craven attitude toward Trump in his second term – squashing diversity initiatives, erasing trans characters from productions, throwing millions to the First Family – any so-called tariff would kill their businesses overnight, and result in a never-ending stream of apoplectic phone calls to the Oval Office from the heads of such American behemoths as Amazon, Comcast, Apple, Disney, and Netflix. Who would then have exceedingly plausible cause to sue. (The 2025 U.S. box office is actually up compared with 2024, refuting any Trump claims about economic emergency, while the national-security threat is equally implausible.)

Meanwhile, if the move is simply a sneering response to Beijing – which recently restricted the number of U.S. films it lets into China over Trump's other tariffs – then it is far too little, too late, given that Hollywood largely abandoned the complex and fickle Chinese marketplace years ago. 

But – and because Trump's 2025 tenure has so far demanded countless “buts” – if some iteration of a foreign-film tariff were to become reality, it would swiftly and single-handedly destroy Canadian culture. Between April 2023 and April 2024, foreign location and service (FLS) production – essentially, films and television series shot in Canada that were financed by foreign (often Hollywood) producers – came in at $4.73-billion, or almost half of the total volume of film and TV production inside this country. 

And that was during a particularly off year, owing to the impact of the strikes. Typically, Hollywood productions coming here to shoot pump even more money into the domestic screen sector – we are talking about billions and billions of dollars that keep our sound stages humming, our craftspeople employed (more than 26,000 in B.C. alone), and our own producers flush enough to bring genuinely Canadian-made stories to the screen. 

So much of Canadian culture – films and series that are shot here, written and directed by Canadian creatives, and starring Canadian performers – are largely made possible thanks to the FLS side of the screen-sector equation. And while television was not mentioned in Trump's post, so much of our homegrown TV is financed with the assumption that it can be sold to global markets, including American broadcasters. Any tariff would kill our big- and small-screen industry cold. 

As is almost always the case, the mood inside the Canadian film community is currently oscillating between eye-popping panic, despair, and incredulity. Filmmakers, producers, and distributors have already spent the past half-decade waging the Online Streaming Act (Bill C-11) fight, which even in the current “elbows up” era seems to be going nowhere very slowly. Could Ottawa respond to any possible Trump tariff by placing a counter-tax on Hollywood movies coming into Canada? Movie theatre owners, already tackling a generational audience crisis, would lose whatever precious little cool they had left. And consumers would riot over any extra ticket or streaming subscription cost passed onto them. We're stuck. 

But, before Mark Carney threatens to forcibly repatriate Seth Rogen and Ryan Gosling under the cover of darkness, everyone in the film industry – both in Canada and in any other “foreign land” that is apparently pumping “propaganda” into the hearts and minds of Americans – should take a breather. 

Trump's movie-tariff idea arrived at the tail end of a 48-hour period in which the President also, in no particular order, said he “doesn't know” if he has to abide by the U.S. Constitution, announced that he wanted to reopen Alcatraz prison even though it's been a museum for more than half a century, and revealed that he thinks himself as a Jedi warrior fighting the Empire of woke-ism (albeit brandishing the red lightsaber favoured by the evil Sith). 

Perhaps Trump should stop taking calls from Jon Voight, step away from social media, and watch a made-in-America classic about solving one's financial worries that he would more easily identify with: It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

Clients who wanted to lock in the lower capital gains inclusion rate undertook costly 'crystallization' transactions to opt out of realizing the gain later.PeopleImages/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Some wealthy Canadians spent tens of thousands of dollars last year on sophisticated tax planning to get ahead of Ottawa's proposed hike to the capital gains inclusion rate, only to see the federal government abandon the measure earlier this year.

Clients who wanted to lock in the lower inclusion rate before June 25, 2024 – the original effective date for the proposals – undertook “crystallization” transactions using provisions in the Income Tax Act (ITA) that provided them with the option of electing out of the gain later.

Now that the proposed capital gains changes aren't proceeding, Canadians who acted find themselves no better off from a tax perspective than those who did nothing. 

“In June [2024], when everyone was doing this planning, nobody knew that we'd get to a point at which the government never actually followed through with the legislation,” says Armando Minicucci, partner with Doane Grant Thornton LLP in Mississauga. 

“Clients are now stuck with these structures they put in place, and there's [an additional] cost associated with unwinding them.”

Those structures include transfers of property to a corporation in exchange for shares and transfers to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership.

Mr. Minicucci estimates taxpayers paid fees between $20,000 and $70,000 on legal, tax and accounting advice and services related to crystallization transactions completed before June 25.

Michael Cadesky, managing partner with Cadesky Tax in Toronto, says professional advisory costs related to pre-June 25 planning could run as high as $100,000 for taxpayers with “sophisticated structures” who may have used crystallization transactions as part of broader planning.

“For a lot of people, it was an expensive proposition,” Mr. Cadesky says.

In the 2024 federal budget, the Liberal government proposed increasing the capital gains inclusion rate to two-thirds for corporations and trusts as well as for individuals with capital gains above an annual threshold of $250,000. The hike in the inclusion rate was to be effective June 25, 2024, giving taxpayers 10 weeks to trigger gains and still have access to the lower rate.

Many taxpayers, such as those who owned vacation property, sold assets outright before June 25 to trigger capital gains to ensure access to the 50 per cent inclusion rate.

However, some individuals with assets of significant value, such as shares of a small business, undertook transactions that allowed them to transfer property as of a certain date and retain flexibility to elect out of triggering a gain later.

Here's an example of how such a transaction works:

Now that the capital gains tax changes have been cancelled, many clients will elect to have pre-June 25 crystallization transactions completed at ACB to defer taxes, experts say.

Alexandra Spinner, a partner with Crowe Soberman LLP in Toronto, says clients who had plans to sell a property soon – or were already in the process of selling but didn't anticipate closing a deal before June 25 – used crystallization transactions to lock in access to the lower inclusion rate while giving themselves more time to find a buyer or close a deal. 

Costs to put such planning in place generally start at $10,000, “and then only climb higher,” Ms. Spinner says. “It depends on how complex the assets are.”

The use of crystallization transactions, particularly as part of tax planning when selling a business, isn't unusual, she adds.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) was aware that taxpayers were using crystallization transactions to get ahead of the proposed changes last year, and even gave the transactions their blessing.

On April 29, 2024, the CRA released guidance indicating that “where a taxpayer crystallizes an accrued capital gain prior to the increase in the capital gains inclusion rate, the [general anti-avoidance rule] would generally not apply to redetermine the inclusion rate.” 

Some taxpayers used strategies other than transfers to corporations and partnerships to plan around the proposed capital gains tax changes last year.

For example, some taxpayers transferred an asset to a spouse before June 25. Transfers to a spouse are automatic rollovers of property unless the transferor elects out of the rollover on their tax return to have the transfer completed on a taxable basis, triggering a capital gain.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said an interim ceasefire with Russia was possible any moment, ""even starting today,"" if Moscow agreed to the US proposal. Ukraine's president rejected a Russian truce for three days from May 8 to 10.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a ceasefire with Russia was possible the moment Kremlin agreed to it.

Zelenskyy's comments come hours after he rejected the Russian president's declaration of a three-day truce over May 8-10, denouncing it as a ""theatrical show"" that hardly allows time to hold talks to end the war.

Zelenskyy also said earlier during those comments that Ukraine ""cannot bear responsibility for what happens"" to foreign leaders attending the World War II commemoration ceremony in Moscow on May 9.

Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight, sparking fires at residential buildings in parts of the city.

This live updates article is now closed. Thank you for reading.

Below, you can read a roundup of developments from Russia's war in Ukraine on Sunday, May 4.

Russia is maintaining its offensive in eastern Ukraine with intensity, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook post.

Fighting has increased, notably around the strategic city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, where Ukrainian forces said they had to fend off 70 attacks on Sunday, with 12 more clashes still ongoing.

Pokrovsk serves as a key transport hub and Moscow forces are reportedly edging closer.

The information could not be independently verified. 

Moscow's offensive comes despite ongoing diplomatic efforts by the US to arrange a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine.

Czech President Petr Pavel backed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's comments that called for increased pressure on Moscow to have it agree to an interim 30-day ceasefire.

""If someone has all the cards in their hand to end the war then it is President Putin, who can do it with a single decision,"" Pavel told reporters.

""But so far the will has not appeared.""

The Czech government has been a firm backer of Kyiv's efforts to defend itself against Russian forces, and has led an initiative to supply Ukraine with large-calibre ammunition.

Zelenskyy, who is accompanied on the trip by first lady Olena Zelenska, will meet Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala on Monday, with the Czech ammunition drive among the topics on the agenda.

The Ukrainian leader said on X on Saturday he was preparing for upcoming foreign policy meetings with a focus on helping push Russia toward a ceasefire.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference with Czech President Petr Pavel that a ceasefire with Moscow would be possible ""at any moment.""

""We believe that without increased pressure, Russia will not take real practical steps to end the war. Today marks the 54th day that Russia has ignored even the American proposal to completely cease fire,"" Zelenskyy told reporters.

""We believe that a ceasefire is possible at any moment, even starting today, and should last at least 30 days to give diplomacy a real chance.""

Ukraine accepted a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States in March, following peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.

Russia has yet to accept the offer, and the country's leader, Vladimir Putin, declared a three-day ceasefire over May 8-10 to mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union and its allies over Nazi Germany in World War II.

Zelenskyy rejected the offer, denouncing it as a ""theatrical show"" since three days offered no time for talks to end the more than three-year-old war that began with Russia invading Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Prague on Sunday at the start of a two-day visit to the Czech Republic, a key Central European ally in Kyiv's battle against the ongoing Russian invasion.

Zelenskyy, accompanied by his wife, Olena, was met at the airport by Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky, who described him on social media as ""the leader of the free world.""

Zelenskyy, who was last received in Prague in 2023, is expected to meet with President Petr Pavel, a former NATO general, on Sunday before a meeting with Prime Minister Petr Fiala and other senior Czech politicians on Monday.

Likely to feature on the agenda is a Czech-led European initiative to jointly procure millions of artillery shells from stocks around the world and deliver them to Ukraine. According to Prague, 400,000 rounds were already provided in 2025.

The Czech Republic has also provided military support to Kyiv in the form of tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters, and welcomed more than half a million Ukrainian refugees.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday played down the prospect of deploying nuclear weapons in Ukraine and said he hoped the necessity would not arise.

""There has been no need to use those weapons,"" he said in fragmented comments broadcast as part of a preview of an interview on state television marking his 25 years in power. ""And I hope they will not be required,"" he added.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin and his generals and staff have made occasional references to Russia's nuclear arsenal, often in response to increased Western aid to Ukraine, such as the provision of long-range missiles which Kyiv has used to strike targets deep within Russia itself.

Three years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin believes the brutal war will not damage relations with his neighbor, predicting reconciliation with Ukraine one day.

""It seems to me that this is inevitable despite the tragedy we are currently experiencing,"" he said in excerpts from an upcoming interview by Russian state television marking the 25th anniversary of his first presidency.

Putin was referring to the biggest European conflict since World War II, launched by Moscow as a ""special military operation"" in February 2022. ""It's a matter of time,"" he added.

Putin said he believed Russia is still capable of attaining its war goals.

""We have enough strength and means to bring what was started in 2022 to a logical conclusion with the outcome Russia requires,"" he claimed.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Russia from May 7-10 to attend the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Kremlin said on Sunday.

Xi will discuss with Russian President Vladimir Putin the development of the two countries' strategic partnership, as well as signing a number of ""bilateral documents,"" the Kremlin said In a statement on Telegram.

Ukraine said Russia had launched a drone attack on Kyiv overnight, causing damage to several buildings in the city.

Falling debris from destroyed drones sparked fires at residential buildings in Kyiv's Obolonskyi and Sviatoshynskyi districts, Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said on social media.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app that medics were called in to provide assistance in the Sviatoshynskyi district, west of the city center.

The full scale of the damage from the attack was not immediately clear.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow about the attack.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country cannot guarantee the safety of leaders and officials from other countries taking part in the World War II commemoration ceremony in Moscow on May 9.

Leaders of around 20 countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, have accepted invitations to join the May 9 celebration, according to the Kremlin.

""We cannot bear responsibility for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Zelenskyy told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.

""They are ensuring your safety,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia ""may take various steps on its part, such as arson, explosions, and so on and then blame us.""

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, in a post on Telegram, slammed Zelenskyy's remarks.

""He is threatening the physical safety of veterans who will come to parades and celebrations on the holy day,"" she said, adding: ""His statement... is, of course, a direct threat.""

The ceasefire would be from May 8-10, to coincide with the annual Victory Parade on Moscow's Red Square to mark the end of World War II, which is celebrated in Russia on May 9.

""This is more of a theatrical performance on his part. Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,"" Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader said Kyiv, however, was ready for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

Zelenskyy added that Ukraine would not be ""playing games to create a pleasant atmosphere to allow for Putin's exit from isolation on May 9.""

French police mounted a nighttime raid to free a man held hostage for ransom, the prosecutor's office said. The man's son is a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur, similar to other recent abduction cases.

French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency millionaire in a nighttime raid after he was abducted earlier this week, the prosecutor's office said Sunday.

The prosecutor's office said police located the hostage in a house in the Essonne region south of Paris and freed the man on Saturday night.

It said he was treated for injuries, but gave no details. French media reported that alleged hostage-takers cut off one of the man's fingers.

Police detained five people in connection with the incident and the prosecutor's office said the police investigation was looking at an array of possible criminal charges, including kidnapping ""with torture or a barbaric act.""

The abduction appears to be yet another incident in a recent criminal trend in France where cryptocurrency millionaires are held hostage for ransom.

French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau hailed the ""decisive"" police operation to free the man in a message posted to X. 

A police source told the AFP news agency that the alleged hostage-takers wore ski masks and took the man into a delivery van on Thursday.

Le Parisien newspaper reported that the kidnappers demanded a ransom of between €5 million and €7 million (or between $5.7 million and $7.9 million).

The the identity of the man taken hostage, the identity of his son and other specific details have been withheld by the prosecutor's office.

In January, a French police unit that specializes in hostage situations freed a co-founder of a crypto-wallet firm after he was abducted along with his wife from their home in Vierzon.

The head of the police unit that freed the couple, David Balland, a founder of crypto wallet firm Ledger, along with his wife, told reporters later the operation was a complicated effort that involved more than 200 officers.

The French prosecutor at the time said Balland was hospitalized because of a ""mutilation"" inflicted by the kidnappers to his hand. His wife was found tied up in a vehicle.

The United Arab Emirates used its ""reservation"" in signing the UN Genocide Convention to argue that the UN court has no authority over Sudan's accusations related to the genocide in Darfur.

The Netherlands-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday dismissed Sudan's claim that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had fueled genocide in Darfur.

Last month, Khartoum argued before the UN's top court that the UAE was violating the Genocide Convention by supplying weapons to paramilitary forces.

The judges sided with the UAE in its ruling, accepting its arguments that the UN court ""manifestly lacked"" jurisdiction to rule on the case.

Sudan had made a request to the court for urgent measures against the Gulf nation. 

However, the UAE had firmly argued that the court was not legally competent to rule on the matter. 

When the UAE signed up to the UN's Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a ""reservation"" to a key clause allowing one country to sue another at the ICJ over disputes.

This reservation meant the Hague-based ICJ had no power to intervene in the case, the Emiratis said.

While the top UN court agreed with this, it expressed its concern about violence in the region.

The ICJ said it was ""deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan that forms the backdrop to the present dispute.""

""The violent conflict has a devastating effect, resulting in untold loss of life and suffering, in particular in West Darfur,"" the court added.

In their ruling, the judges added that, regardless of the opt-out clause, states ""remain responsible for acts attributable to them which are contrary to their international obligations.""

Since April 2023, Sudan has been plunged into chaos by a brutal power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and paramilitary RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.

The conflict has sparked what aid agencies now call the world's worst displacement and hunger crisis, with famine officially declared in five regions, according to a UN-backed report.

North Darfur has become a flashpoint, where the UN says at least 542 civilians have been killed in just the past three weeks.

On Sunday, the RSF struck Port Sudan, the army said, marking the first attack on the seat of the military-aligned government in the country's two-year war.

Donald Trump has ordered notorious maximum security prison Alcatraz be reopened.

The president announced on Sunday night that he will direct the US Bureau of Prisons to reopen “a substantially enlarged and rebuilt” prison on the small island off San Francisco in order to deter “vicious” criminals.

“For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than misery and suffering,” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders.”

He added: “The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of law, order, and JUSTICE.”

The prison island was known for being a “last resort” facility which once housed some of America's most dangerous and escape-prone criminals, including gangsters Al Capone and George “Machine Gun” Kelly.

Owing to crumbling infrastructure and high operating costs, the prison – which housed up to 275 inmates at a time – closed in 1963 and is currently operated as a tourist site.

Located 1.25 miles off the coast of San Francisco, it was known as “The Rock” and regarded as inescapable thanks to the strong ocean currents and icy Pacific waters that surrounds it.

In the 29 years it was open, 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes, according to the FBI. Nearly all were caught or did not survive the attempt.

Having previously been one of the most heavily-fortified military sites on the West coast, the island was in 1934 transformed into a federal prison designed to deter hardened criminals.

Prisoners at the facility had basic rights to food, clothing, shelter and medical care, while all other privileges including visits from family had to be earned.

The president suggested that the prison could be used to house illegal migrants whom he has been seeking to deport.

“When we were a more serious nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be,” Mr Trump wrote.

“We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our country illegally.”

It comes as Mr Trump has faced opposition from judges over his attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport migrants without due process.

The Supreme Court last month ordered the Trump administration to pause the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador – a move federal judges have labelled illegal.

Plans to open a detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold up to 30,000 of what Mr Trump labelled the “worst criminal aliens”, have also met legal challenges.

Meanwhile, a proposal for a sprawling tent city to open at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas has been terminated, according to NBC.

Following the Alcatraz announcement, Mr Trump hit out at “radicalised judges” who want trials for “every single person that's in our country illegally”.

“That would mean millions of trials, and it's just so ridiculous what's happening,” he told reporters at the White House on Sunday evening.

By the time Alcatraz closed, authorities estimated it would cost between $3 to $5 million to restore and maintain the facility, with the maximum-security prison's walls corroded by sea salt.

It was also three times more expensive to operate than any other federal prison because of its island location, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website.

Despite housing relatively few inmates – less than one per cent of the overall prison population – its isolated location and high-profile personnel gave rise to some notorious attempted breakouts.

One of the most famous escapes involved Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers, John and Clarence, who have never been found after fleeing the prison in 1962.

Their breakout, which was dramatised in the 1979 Clint Eastwood film Escape from Alcatraz, involved using spoons and homemade tools to dig through ventilation ducts behind their cells, constructing a makeshift raft out of life vests and stolen raincoats and making dummy heads out of plaster to fool the guards on the night of their escape.

The FBI concluded they likely drowned. But as their bodies were never recovered, occasional leads have kept the case open for decades.

Responding to Mr Trump's statement, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said that the agency would “comply with all presidential orders”.

The spokesman did not immediately answer questions regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National Park Service's control of the island.

The Bureau of Prisons currently has 16 penitentiaries performing the same high-security functions as Alcatraz, including its maximum security facility in Florence, Colorado and the US penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is home to the federal death chamber.

Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic House Speaker, whose district includes Alcatraz, criticised the president's proposal, calling it “not a serious one”.

“Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than 60 years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The president's proposal is not a serious one,” she wrote on X.

			Huntington Beach haven has become known as California's Maga Capital

Along an idyllic stretch of the California coastline, a gaggle of bronzed surfers tackle magnificent waves whipped up in the Pacific Ocean by gale-force winds.

Most of the time, Huntington Beach is a surfing haven – but even when it isn't, nothing stops the long-haired, wetsuit-clad crowd who turn up with their boards in all weathers.

This is America's “surf city”, a title it fought a 15-month court battle to keep.

But in recent years, Huntington Beach has found itself another claim to fame as California's “Maga Capital”.

If the classic image of the west coast is of ultra-liberal, pot-smoking surfers, then “surf city” is a sign of the political revolution that is quietly under way in the Golden State.

Much of Huntington Beach's Republican resurgence has been driven by its surfing community, which locals attribute to Governor Gavin Newsom's short-lived and fiercely-resisted attempts to close beaches during the Covid pandemic.

The surfers here see it as a bastion of the “chill” surfing lifestyle that stands against the cultural mainstream and resists the big government instincts of state Democrats.

Today, all of the city council's members are Republicans – nicknamed the “Maga-nificent Seven”, who earlier this year posed in red caps emblazoned with the words: “Make Huntington Beach Great Again.”

Many of them are surfers or ex-surfers, including its mayor, Pat Burns.

Others involved in city politics, like campaign manager Richard Brown or local surfing legend Don Ramsey, sit on the board of the Surfers' Hall of Fame.

Huntington Beach's nine miles of palm tree-lined coastline is slanted south-west, where it can catch the swells thrown up further out in the Pacific for perfect surfing conditions.

“We have the most consistent surf... You can surf more days out of the year here than any other place in the world,” Mr Ramsey claimed.

The city is drenched in surfing culture. While the Walk of Fame in nearby Los Angeles honours film and TV stars, here it pays tribute to surfing champions.

When The Telegraph visited in April, the bleached-blonde wannabes hoping to get their name on a starry paving slab were struggling to make headway against the wind – one of them coming face-to-face with a sea lion as he toppled off his board.

A few bars of a Bruce Springsteen song being played on the pier could be heard before being snatched away by the gale.

Mr Burns and some of his political allies had ducked into Duke's, a bar on the beachfront where large, old-fashioned surfboards loom perilously above patrons.

“A cornerstone of surfing culture is you're relaxing, you're out there, it's just a chilled life, you know?” said Mr Burns, an ex-cop with a grizzled beard wearing a pink Hawaiian shirt. (Each of the council members were given one by the Surfers' Hall of Fame, which is based in the city).

“You're at one, just doing your own thing. That's kind of what Maga is – just let us live.”

Don Kennedy, a member of the council who was elected last year, agreed.

“If you look back in the 50s and the 60s, surfers were the outcasts – like, oh, there's just a surf bum,” he said.

“Now all that guy wants to do is surf. You know, surf, relax, listen to music. That culture is probably indicative of not wanting a bunch of government oversight or anybody on your back.”

In recent years, Huntington Beach's council has fought court battles against what they see as overreach by Mr Newsom's administration, declaring themselves an “anti-sanctuary city”, banning inappropriate library books and Pride flags, and are installing a Maga plaque at the local library.

Michael Gates, the city attorney who spearheaded the legal fights, recently left to join Donald Trump's justice department and quickly installed a surfboard in his Washington office.

Huntington Beach has long had a conservative streak, but it seems to have been galvanised by the Covid pandemic, when Mr Newsom attempted to lock down its famous beaches in April 2020.

The move drew a furious response – not just from local surfers but others who had flocked there as other surfing spots had been closed along the coast.

“Oh, hell, these people were p---ed,” said Mr Ramsey. “We said: ‘No f---ing way that you're shutting our beach.'”

Mr Newsom backed off following a legal challenge and negotiations between city and state officials, and from then on “surf city” became a centre of resistance to the California governor, later voting to outlaw mask and vaccine mandates.

Republicans took a majority on the local council in 2022 – a group of forerunners known as the “Fab Four” – and took a clean sweep later with three more members. All of them grew up locally and are keen surfers.

Mr Kennedy was one of them, recalling loading surfboards into a car and driving along the coast with his school friends to various surfing spots.

“Covid and closing our beaches and closing our restaurants really started to wake people up – like, ‘Hey, the government is really overstepping their bounds,” he said.

Now the city's leadership believes it is not just a Republican fortress in a blue state, but the symbol of a changing California – which hasn't elected a GOP governor since the days of Arnold Schwarzenegger – which has grown weary of Democrat overreach and edicts issued from Sacramento.

Earlier this month, Steve Hilton, the British political adviser turned Fox News host and now a Republican political candidate, launched his bid to become California governor in Huntington Beach.

Mr Burns claimed he is getting calls “all the time” from other cities who want to join its resistance against the Newsom administration, while Mr Brown, who masterminded the Republicans' clean sweep of council seats, believes Huntington Beach is at the centre of an unlikely political revolution.

“Sacramento has a target on Huntington Beach – they're used to threatening lawsuits and then getting people to capitulate. Our guys don't do that… we call our own shots and they don't like that,” he said.

He added, as the surfers nearby fought through the wind and angled their surfboards through the waves: “We're like the tip of the spear.”

Elon Musk's DOGE is inflicting crashes, hang-ups and hours-long waits on Social Security recipients, eroding trust.

In recent months, people trying to reach the Social Security Administration (SSA) have encountered website crashes, automatic hang-ups and hours-long waits on the phone or in person. But horrible customer service appears to be just the first step in Donald Trump and Elon Musk's plan to destroy Social Security — the United States' largest social welfare program, which provides benefits to 73 million people, or one in five U.S. residents.

President Donald Trump has granted Elon Musk's “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) team significant access and power within SSA. In just three months, the agency has implemented plans to decrease the staff count from 57,000 to 50,000 (with rumors of deeper cuts to come), started closing offices, made it harder for people to register and access benefits, spread lies about fraud, accessed recipients' personal information, and created an environment of chaos, fear and confusion. All the while, DOGE is on an obsessive hunt for widespread benefits fraud, which one federal judge characterized as “a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack.”

Advocates fear that as DOGE makes Social Security increasingly nonfunctional, trust in the enormously popular program will erode, allowing Musk and his allies the opportunity to further weaken or privatize aspects of the program.

Weakening Social Security has serious and even deadly consequences: Among older people who receive benefits, 39 percent of men and 44 percent of women derive more than half their income from it. Around 80 percent of recipients are retired workers (or their spouses and dependents), who paid into the system during their working years, while the rest qualify due to a disability or are children of deceased workers.

Despite its crucial role lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, Trump and Musk repeatedly disparage the program as dysfunctional, rife with fraud, or an outright scam. In February, Trump falsely claimed that millions of dead Americans were collecting benefits, alleging: “It's all a scam, the whole thing is a scam.” Meanwhile, in a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Musk called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” And in a FOX Business interview about DOGE cuts, Musk ominously called entitlements like SSA “the big one to eliminate.” (The White House insists Musk was referring to eliminating “waste and fraud,” not entitlement programs in their entirety.)

“Never before did we have a president claiming that there was all this fraud where there wasn't any, or all this waste where there wasn't any,” Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a political advocacy group that calls for expansion of Social Security, told Truthout. “And then using that to make changes precipitously, without any kind of thought — some of which are just going to create more fraud. And no one has ever had access to all this data, people's most personal data.”

Trump replaced his initial acting SSA Commissioner, Michelle King, a 30-year veteran of the agency, in February after she refused to allow DOGE unfettered access to recipients' private data. Her replacement is Leland Dudek, a mid-level staffer, who at the time was on administrative leave for leaking information to DOGE behind his supervisors' backs.

Unsurprisingly, Dudek has acted as a rubber stamp for DOGE's staff-cutting agenda.

“DOGE has been all over the Social Security Administration,” said Altman. “They're calling the shots.”

Under Dudek, SSA rapidly laid off employees, offered buyouts to the entire staff, ordered the entire workforce back into the office full-time, dissolved teams, announced the closure of 6 out of 10 regional offices and circulated plans to close dozens of field offices.

“It's not an exaggeration to say around 1,000 years of institutional experience and knowledge have walked out the door,” said Altman. “The top cyber security people, the top people who maintain the systems, and so forth. … There has really been an enormous brain drain from the agency, and that's continuing.”

Dudek admitted, behind closed doors, that he is following the orders of DOGE and the White House. “I work for the president. I need to do what the president tells me to do,” Dudek told senior SSA staff and advocates in a mid-March recording leaked to ProPublica. “I've had to make some tough choices, choices I didn't agree with, but the president wanted it and I did it.” Later in the meeting, Dudek said: “Again, I work for the president. DOGE is part of that.”

Trump's nominee to lead the agency, Frank Bisignano, is a financial services CEO with a net worth of around $1 billion. Bisignano, who told CNBC he is “fundamentally a DOGE person,” has a reputation for cutting staff, while taking home 380 times the compensation of the median employee at his company.

Bisignano apparently lied at a March 25 confirmation hearing, telling the Senate Finance Committee he hasn't had contact with SSA or DOGE. But a whistleblower told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) that Bisignano has had frequent conversations with SSA executives, requested explicit approval of all hires and intervened to ensure a DOGE engineer was hired and given immediate access to private data systems — claims that were confirmed by the Washington Post.

Although the Finance Committee voted along party lines to advance Bisignano's nomination in March, Senate Democrats are calling for Trump to withdraw the nomination. “There's a trust gap between the nominee and the American people before he's even gotten in the door,” Wyden said in a statement.

Social Security employees and beneficiaries are feeling the effects of the mayhem introduced under Dudek. Staff is stretched thin and demoralized, struggling to keep up with constant changes from above, and dealing with a growing backlog of claims. Spending freezes leave workers unable to purchase office supplies, make copies of documents or hire necessary services like interpreters for hearings.

“This chainsaw of the Musk-Trump co-presidency is gutting this agency. It is breaking it from within.”

The SSA website is crashing repeatedly, and callers find themselves hung up on or put on hold for hours. Meanwhile, the team in charge of monitoring customer experience was cut by DOGE. AARP reported that its help line is flooded with calls from confused, frustrated and angry older people.

“Morale is in the toilet,” an employee told the Washington Post in March. “We all know what DOGE wants to do, which is just break us, so they can privatize us.”

“What's going on is the destruction of the agency from the inside out, and it's accelerating,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told the Washington Post. “I have people approaching me all the time in their 70s and 80s, and they're beside themselves. They don't know what's coming.”

Even before Trump came into office, SSA was at a 50-year staffing low, following years of budget cuts forced by Republicans. Even as more than 11,200 Americans turn 65 each day, the agency's operating overhead costs remain incredibly efficient at below 1 percent, all the while never missing a month of payments. But it might not keep that record for long.

“This chainsaw of the Musk-Trump co-presidency is gutting this agency. It is breaking it from within,” Martin O'Malley, former SSA commissioner under President Biden, testified before the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on April 1. “And it ultimately will lead to cascading failures, interruptions and system shutdowns that will eventually — and I think within the next couple of months — lead to benefit interruptions for the first time in 90 years.”

A former deputy SSA commissioner under George W. Bush has expressed similar concerns that benefits could soon be disrupted.

“It would appear that what they're trying to do is crater this agency, and kneecap its ability to serve the public,” O'Malley testified. “They have to do that, because 80 percent of Americans believe that Social Security should be strengthened and made better. So they can't really rob it, until they wreck it and sour enough of the public against it.”

He warned: “I truly believe that the Musk-Trump co-presidency has already taken 90 percent of the actions necessary to crater this agency.”

While Trump and Bisignano insist they will not cut benefits, advocates and Democratic politicians argue that cutting services achieves the same end. “[T]here are backdoor ways to accomplish the same thing as a benefits cut,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) pointed out in Bisignano's hearing. “[L]onger lines, more errors, and everyone who gives up or dies before they get their benefits sorted out due to those delays is also a benefit cut.”

Bisignano deflected a question on whether Social Security should be privatized, stating, “I've never heard a word of it, and I've never thought about it.” In his 2000 book, Trump called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and called for its privatization. And in a leaked March email to staff, Dudek alarmed advocates by saying the agency would begin to outsource “non-essential functions to industry experts,” a seeming reference to privatizing aspects of the program.

Altman warned that as DOGE messes with SSA and makes system crashes more likely, it could open the door for privatization. “There's about $1.5 trillion that flows through Social Security. None of that goes to Wall Street or any of these for-profit companies,” she said. “But I think these ‘tech bros' and others would love to get their hands on it.” She fears that if the Trump administration breaks the system and disrupts benefits, “They'll say, ‘See? Government can't do it. We've got to get the private sector.'”

She also warns that if SSA outsources customer services, people needing assistance will find themselves “trapped in an AI nightmare.”

“There are so many reasons that artificial intelligence just cannot do what humans do on this program,” explained Altman. “People who call don't always know exactly what their issue is, or how to describe it, and it takes some conversation to figure it out. And sometimes they have one problem, and then they discover there's three others. And the other thing is that people call at very vulnerable times. You know, they've lost a loved one, or they're disabled and can no longer work.”

Another key strategy to destroy trust in Social Security is lying about widespread benefits fraud. Trump and Musk repeatedly tout the fact that millions of Social Security accounts exist for people born more than 100 years ago — even though the vast majority are not receiving benefits. In fact, of the 18.9 million centenarians in the SSA database without a recorded death date, 18.4 million haven't received benefits in over 50 years. The claim is so off-base that even Dudek has disputed it.

Musk also repeatedly suggests that millions of noncitizens illegally receive Social Security benefits. At an April rally that was part of Musk's failed attempt to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat, Musk and DOGE associate Antonio Gracias presented a so-called “mind-blowing chart,” showing that millions of immigrants have Social Security numbers. But this is not fraud: Immigrants who are legally authorized to work are issued Social Security numbers. In fact, undocumented immigrants (who do not receive Social Security numbers, but are required to pay federal taxes) contributed $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes in 2022, even though they are ineligible to receive benefits.

In an even more wild claim, Musk has repeatedly accused Biden of illegally handing out Social Security numbers to immigrants to encourage voter fraud in a “massive, large-scale program to import as many illegals as possible, ultimately to change the entire voting map of the United States.”

Musk, DOGE members and Vice President J.D. Vance have all also peddled the absurd lie that 40 percent of calls to SSA are fraudulent. This may be a gross misrepresentation of an entirely different statistic: That 40 percent of SSA direct deposit fraud incidents occurred via phone calls. In congressional testimony, O'Malley corrected the claim, noting that, in fact, just 0.032 percent of calls to SSA are successful attempts at direct deposit fraud.

Musk, who has promised to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget, seems to hope to find much of that in SSA. But the fraud and waste just aren't there: On average, SSA makes $9 billion in improper payments each year, representing less than 1 percent of total payments (largely through overpayments and error, not fraud), most of which is ultimately recovered, according to a 2024 Inspector General report.

“They have just done this over and over again on Social Security, just coming up with these wild claims that bear no resemblance to the truth,” Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told the Washington Post.

What's more, DOGE seems to be using its fraud allegations to justify major policy overhauls. “In the name of preventing fraud, they make these changes, and the changes keep coming,” said Altman. “It's created waste and inefficiency, and actually the opportunity for fraud.”

Citing fraud protection, SSA abruptly announced in mid-March that people would no longer be able to apply for benefits or make changes to their direct deposits by phone. Instead, these activities could only be done online or in-person at a field office.

Social Security advocates and recipients were alarmed. Many older Americans lack internet access or the technological savvy to apply for benefits online — a problem set to worsen if the SSA website keeps crashing. But to visit in person, they would have to wait hours on the phone to make an appointment, survive without benefits for weeks or months until the next available appointment and travel to the field office (at least a 45-mile round trip for 6 million older adults, many of whom don't drive). The SSA estimated that ending these phone services would add 75,000 to 85,000 new in-person office visits each week.

In response to public outcry, SSA scrapped the changes on April 9. But other changes remain in place, and the rapid announcements have created an environment of confusion and fear for recipients.

Rather than rooting out actual fraud, the confusion at SSA has made recipients more susceptible to scams. “Scammers have been sending out very official looking notices saying, ‘Okay, you've got to authenticate yourself, or your benefits are going to stop,'” said Altman. “It looks very official, and you're desperate, you can't live without your benefits.”

DOGE meddling also increases the risk of a data breach. In testimony, former SSA acting Chief of Staff Tiffany Flick described how, under Dudek, DOGE associates were given sensitive information without requisite training, which they viewed from within Trump's Office of Personnel Management offices, surrounded by White House staffers. In this environment, she warned, “Others could take pictures of the data, transfer it to other locations, and even feed it into AI programs. In such a chaotic environment, the risk of data leaking into the wrong hands is significant.” She also warned that SSA's IT is built on an “incredibly complex web of systems” that are extremely reliable, but could easily be broken by DOGE associates, leading to benefits delays.

In a lawsuit brought by unions and retiree advocacy groups, federal Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander issued a preliminary injunction in mid-April, blocking DOGE from accessing personal SSA data, and ordering them to delete any already obtained, including Social Security numbers, medical information, payment and bank records, earnings and tax information. She also required DOGE to remove software installed on SSA systems and stop accessing SSA code.

This was an extension of Hollander's March temporary restraining order, in which she noted that “the DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.” Complaining about the order to Bloomberg, Dudek initially claimed it would force him to essentially shut down the agency, and promising: “I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.” Hollander called Dudek's representation “inaccurate,” noting that her order “expressly applies only to SSA employees working on the DOGE agenda.” In response, Dudek walked back his threats to close down SSA.

Dudek has also helped Trump weaponize Social Security. In late February, SSA abruptly cancelled two contracts for the collection and maintenance of data on births and deaths in Maine, a move that would have forced parents to register their newborns at a Social Security office instead of the hospital. When a senior SSA official warned that the cancellations would increase fraud, Dudek emailed back: “Please cancel the contracts. While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.”

That “petulant child” was Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, whom Dudek believed had been “disrespectful” and “unprofessional” to Trump. Mills had drawn Trump's ire for insisting that Maine would follow state and federal law, and would not ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports. While the data contract cancellations were rolled back, Trump has continued other retaliatory attacks on the state.

The Trump administration is also using SSA to attack immigrants. In April, SSA added thousands of migrants to the agency's “death master file,” with the intention of cutting them off from banks, credit cards and government benefits.

And in March, it was reported that SSA has frozen a process called Enumeration-Beyond-Entry, in which immigrants who are granted work authorization are automatically issued and mailed Social Security cards. This change will create more work and costs for SSA, while adding hurdles for immigrant workers.

Despite being enormously popular, SSA has long weathered attacks from the right — often through claims the program is unsustainable. From the mid-1980s through 2020, Social Security collected more each year than it paid out, allowing it to build trust funds worth $2.8 trillion. But as the American population ages, the latest Social Security Trustees' Report indicates that by 2033, the agency may no longer be able to pay out full benefits.

But there are solutions to shore up the program. Currently, wages above $176,100 are not taxed for Social Security. Altman's organization, Social Security Works, supports bills from Democratic congressmembers that would lift or eliminate this so-called “wage cap.” In addition, the payroll tax could be increased, and promoting and expanding legal immigration would increase the size of the workforce.

Despite Republican attacks, Social Security has remained extremely popular over the years. And so far, public anger over the current problems seems to be directed at Trump, Musk and DOGE. Voters have berated Republican Congressmembers at town halls, demanding they protect Social Security and sharing their horror stories and fears. Trump's approval rating dropped in mid-March, including a drop among older people from 49 to 45 percent.

While Democrats have never attempted to destroy the Social Security system, many Democratic presidents have signed legislation reducing or cutting benefits for certain groups. In 1994, Bill Clinton supported cutting people off disability SSA benefits after 36 months if their disability was based on drug or alcohol use. And in a 2011 effort to compromise with Tea Party congressmembers obsessed with lowering the national debt, Barack Obama supported an ultimately failed “grand bargain” agreement that would have raised taxes on the rich while cutting social safety net programs, including Social Security. (In the final month of his presidency, Joe Biden signed legislation that boosted some recipients' benefits, by ending provisions that limit benefits for some public service retirees.)

Although SSA has long faced attacks, Altman said this time is “qualitatively different.”

“It strikes me what they're trying to do is convince everybody there's an enormous amount of fraud. Then they can say, ‘Hey, we're not cutting legitimate benefits. We're cutting fraud.' And also, perhaps make the whole thing collapse, and privatize the administration. And then beyond that — who knows.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

China-based Shenzhen Baseus Technology Co. Ltd. is recalling thousands of units of portable chargers from the United States as the lithium-ion battery in the product can overheat, posing a fire hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said in a May 1 recall notice.

The recall is applicable to roughly 55,380 units of Baseus 65W 30000mAh portable chargers, with model number BS-30KP365.

The China-manufactured item was sold online via Baseus, AliExpress, Amazon, and Walmart between April 2020 and April 2025 for $39 to $90.

The company received 76 reports of safety incidents involving the chargers, including 72 cases in which the products bulged and four instances of fires. Three of the reports cited property damage.

“Consumers will need to submit a photo of the recalled portable charger showing the model number and serial number to the firm's recall registration page. Consumers without an order number will need to submit a photo of the portable charger with their name and date written on the portable charger in permanent marker.”

To receive a replacement, customers must confirm they have disposed of the charger in accordance with applicable rules.

CPSC warned against throwing away lithium-ion batteries in the trash can or general recycling systems, such as curbside recycling bins. Lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of in a different manner than other types of batteries, as they pose a higher fire risk.

Multiple other products have been recalled in recent months over faulty lithium batteries.

The company had received 51 reports from customers complaining about the battery overheating or catching fire while charging phones. Six minor burn injuries were reported.

The bill comes at a time when fires from these batteries have grown “exponentially” in New York City, it said.

The bill has been sent to the Senate for approval.

“For years, it has been clear that unregulated lithium-ion batteries pose a clear and present threat to the public's safety, and it's long past time that we do something about it. My district specifically is acutely aware of the unmitigated disaster that urban fires pose and the urgent need for stronger safety standards,” Torres said.

“Today's success demonstrates the broad bipartisan support for this urgently needed legislation. I urge the Senate and President Trump to swiftly pass and sign the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act into law.”

“For far too long, members of the fire service have had to deal with these dangerous and toxic fires. It is time for this harm and destruction to come to an end,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

President Donald Trump on May 4 ruled out using military force to annex Canada, but said he wasn't ruling the possibility out in the case of Greenland.

During an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press,” anchor Kristin Welker asked Trump whether he would rule out military force against Canada. Trump replied, “I think we're not going to ever get to that point. Something could happen with Greenland. I'll be honest, we need that for national and international security.”

“But not with Canada?” Welker asked.

“It's highly unlikely,” Trump replied, laughing. “I just don't see it with Canada, I have to be honest with you.”

Trump said that action against Greenland was also unlikely, but added he could see circumstances where he would be open to it.

“I don't rule it out. I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,” Trump said.

“We need Greenland very badly ... for international security,” he added, promising that the United States would “cherish” the “very small amount of people” currently inhabiting the Arctic mega-island.

During the interview, Trump maintained that he was serious about the proposal and believed it would be to both countries' benefit.

Asked whether he would discuss the prospect of adding Canada to the United States with newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump replied, “I'll always talk about that.”

“If Canada was a state it wouldn't cost us. It would be great,” he said.

Speaking about a hypothetical map after a U.S.–Canada merger, Trump said, “I'm a real estate guy at heart. When I look down at that [map] without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago ... What a beautiful country it would be.”

The United States, meanwhile, would gain from Canada not being reliant on it when it comes to defense spending while existing as a separate country.

“Canada [spends] less money on military than practically any nation in the world,” Trump said. “They pay NATO less than any nation. They think we are subsidizing, they think we are going to protect them—and really, we are—but the truth is, they don't carry their full share, and it's unfair to the United States and our taxpayers.”

Trump has long had ambitions to add Greenland as a U.S. territory, first floating the idea of purchasing it from Denmark, which currently has control over the territory, in 2019 during his first term.

There are several reasons for his interest in the sparsely populated Arctic island.

Gaining American control of Greenland has been a central focus of Trump's foreign policy, which has been compared to the Monroe Doctrine in its focus on increasing American influence on Western Hemisphere geopolitics.

Russia's northern coastline circles the Arctic, and the adversary has long taken an interest in the region.

Since October, the two leading U.S. rivals have been conducting joint patrols in the region, an escalation from China's previously minimal involvement with Arctic affairs.

Vance said Denmark, which currently rules Greenland, has not “devoted the resources necessary to keep this base, to keep our troops, and ... to keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China, and other nations” in the region.

Aside from that, Pituffik Space Base is crucial to America's missile defense strategy, as the Arctic represents the shortest distance an ICBM missile would need to fly to strike the U.S. mainland.

China currently dominates the international market over several of these, making the United States heavily reliant on its leading adversary in this domain.

The area also neighbors several crucial shipping and strategic channels in the Arctic, increasing its potential value to the United States.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

President Donald Trump announced on May 4 that he was authorizing his administration to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside of the United States.

Trump said the move was necessary to protect the once globally dominant U.S. movie industry, as he noted that some countries have been offering incentives to attract American filmmakers and studios overseas.

He warned that the local industry is “dying a very fast death,” with Hollywood and many other local entertainment businesses facing devastation.

“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,” Trump stated. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

Trump imposed the tariffs to pressure the CCP into addressing the trade deficit with the United States. The White House stated on April 15 that China faces up to 245 percent reciprocal tariffs due to its retaliatory actions.

“At some point, I'm going to lower them because otherwise, you could never do business with them and they want to do business very much,” he said. “Look, their economy is really doing badly. Their economy is collapsing.”

Some analysts believe that China's restrictions on U.S.-made movies will have a limited impact on the industry. Seth Shafer, principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence Kagan, said the number of domestic films released in China has been declining.

“Only roughly 25 percent of domestic wide-release films are now released in China, and that percentage has dropped steadily over time due to increasing competition from China's local film production industry,” Shafer said.

Shafer said that for domestic films that are released in China, “typically less than 10 percent of the film's global gross box office revenue comes from China.”

Trump said the three envoys will serve as his “eyes and ears” in Hollywood, advising him on strategies to revitalize the entertainment industry and restore its former glory.

This reported subversion is contrasted with Hollywood's early days under the Hays Code, which set strict content guidelines until its erosion in the 1950s and replacement by the modern ratings system in 1968, which ushered in a more permissive era.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Every decade or so, the global aid industry finds that it must transform to survive. During these periods of change, donor countries restructure their aid agencies, shrink or expand their assistance budgets, and lobby for the creation or dissolution of a UN initiative or two. Typically, once the aid industry conforms to the whims of donor countries, the crisis is averted and business continues as usual. Since U.S. President Donald Trump began his second term, the aid industry has found itself at another inflection point. The Trump administration has gutted USAID, the world's largest development agency, ending 86 percent of its programs, shuttering its headquarters, and terminating nearly all its 10,000 employees. At the same time, the Trump administration has slashed funding for various multilateral initiatives on climate, global health, and education.

Today's crisis, however, is different from those that came before: this could truly be the end of foreign aid as we know it. For decades, global development—that is, the attempt to improve and save lives of the poor—has been driven mostly by foreign assistance provided by wealthy governments. Some scholars and analysts deride this process as the “aid-industrial complex.” But even advocates of foreign aid have come to see it as an industry, including in their efforts to reform it, which approach its defects as matters of business inefficiency. And now that governments in many rich countries have sharply lurched to the right and taken more skeptical stances on aid, this industry is collapsing. As a result, many charity workers, researchers, and academics will be out of jobs. More important, millions of poor people around the world will suffer.

Proponents of global development now face a choice. They can wait for attitudes in donor countries to shift back toward support for foreign aid at some point in the distant future. Or they can reimagine the entire concept of global development, detaching it from aid and rooting it instead in industrial transformation: helping countries shift from subsistence farming, informal employment, and primary commodity production toward manufacturing and services. In truth, the aid industry was already adrift. Its interventions had become spread too thin and often failed to address the key obstacles that poorer countries faced as they tried to upskill their workers, build energy and transport infrastructure, and access new markets. Raising people out of poverty in Africa, South Asia, and parts of Latin America will not only improve their lives but also allow rich countries to maintain their prosperity by creating new markets, and by now, industrial transformation has a strong track record for improving economies. If proponents of global development do not adjust its methods with the times, it will lose its relevance to rich and poor countries alike.

The foreign-aid industry's primary commodity is official development assistance (ODA), or money from donors that flows to governments, individuals, or groups in poorer places, either directly—such as through budget support to struggling governments—or through projects run by organizations such as Save the Children, Oxfam, or FHI 360. Governments in rich countries are the primary purveyors of ODA. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2023, governments spent $230 billion on development assistance, compared with $11 billion spent by private foundations. Like any industry, foreign aid has middlemen. But in this business, the middlemen are particularly conspicuous. Third-party entities known as “implementing partners” include international nongovernmental organizations, large private contractors, and consulting firms. If the U.S. government wanted, for example, to distribute fertilizers to small-scale farmers in Bangladesh, they might contract Chemonics, a U.S.-based development contractor, to do it. Indeed, in 2023, Chemonics received the most USAID funds of any of the organization's contractors: over $1 billion.

To take advantage of network effects and economies of scale, implementing partners cluster around the main sites of production of foreign aid, the capitals of the major donor countries: Berlin, Geneva, London, Paris, Rome, and Washington. As a result, very little aid is distributed by organizations or people in poor countries. In 2020, less than nine percent of U.S. aid was administered by recipient governments or firms based in recipient countries, according to Charles Kenny and Scott Morris, researchers at the Center for Global Development. The visibility of middlemen based in rich countries has long provided fodder to detractors who claim that the aid industry operates inefficiently or even unjustly. There is some truth to this critique. According to an analysis by Devex, a news organization, 47 of USAID's top 50 contractors are located in the United States.

Previous efforts to correct the distortions in the foreign aid industry focused on trying to reduce waste and increase the proportion of aid money that gets to beneficiaries. Ninety countries signed the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, an agreement that encouraged reforms such as aligning donors' objectives with recipient countries' priorities, harmonizing various development interventions, and involving more partners on the ground. Mark Green, USAID's administrator during the first Trump administration, tried to reduce recipient countries' dependence on foreign assistance by building their capacity to plan, finance, and manage their own development. Green's successor, Samantha Power, aimed to increase the share of funding administered by local organizations based in recipient countries to 25 percent by 2025.

The consensus over how much rich countries should spend on aid and what they should prioritize has shifted over time. A 1970 UN resolution recommended that countries should dedicate 0.7 percent of their gross national income to ODA, but as of 2023, only five countries had reached that goal: Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden. In the United States, successive Democratic and Republican administrations maintained a broad commitment to foreign aid, although arguments also simmered, even within the industry itself, about the proper goal of aid. Since 2000, when 189 countries agreed to the UN's Millennium Development Goals, the industry's main objective has been to reduce poverty; after the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, many governments embraced the idea that, in addition, aid should also be directed toward fighting climate change.

But behind these recent debates lurked a massive shift in the politics and public norms that had allowed the industry to survive. If one sees aid as a form of philanthropy, then rich countries appear as donors and poor ones as beneficiaries. But if one sees aid as an industry, then rich countries appear as sellers and poor ones as buyers. With their development assistance, rich countries are providing a set of projects and institutional norms to achieve a set of expected outcomes: improvements in material conditions in developing countries that will eventually boost their own economies and security—or, failing that, at least a sense on the part of rich countries that they have tried to make a difference. The role of poor countries is to consume these development projects in the hope of achieving desired outcomes—or, failing that, at least a sense that they might be possible someday.

Now this market is experiencing an unprecedented supply crisis. Around the world, people and politicians in the rich countries that had long bought into the basic idea that providing aid is valuable have become skeptical. The aid industry has, for decades, undergone boom and bust cycles resulting from shifts in the domestic politics of donor countries. What is different this time is a deepening disaffection about the prevailing economic model and the aid paradigm associated with it. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, many donor countries have experienced economic stagnation, slow productivity growth, declining competitiveness, and widening inequality. Citizens of rich countries who no longer feel economically secure are questioning why scarce public funds should be devoted to causes abroad when there are needs at home.

This doubt goes beyond the Trump administration. The United States is not the only donor that is cutting foreign aid: in 2024, eight of the top ten donors within the OECD's Development Assistance Committee reduced their foreign aid budgets and announced their intention to align international development programs more squarely with their national interests—such as by ensuring that development projects use goods and services produced in the donor country. In 2024, Germany, the world's second-largest bilateral aid donor, announced a $5.3 billion reduction to its foreign-assistance budget. In February, the United Kingdom announced a 40 percent reduction to its aid budget so that it could focus on defense spending. In March 2025, the Netherlands said it would cut 37 percent of its bilateral aid over five years and scale down its financial contributions to some UN agencies.

Many right-leaning voters in rich countries now see foreign aid as wasteful and excessively focused on promoting causes they perceive as linked to the left, such as climate action, gender equality, or democracy promotion. Voters are more dubious of technocrats, policy wonks, and academics committed to foreign aid. Consequently, even left-leaning politicians, such as the Labour government in the United Kingdom, are slashing aid in response to popular sentiment. According to a February 2025 YouGov poll, 65 percent of Britons are in favor of increasing defense spending at the expense of foreign aid.

The speed and scale of the policy changes make the crisis facing the aid industry existential. Donor governments are fast destroying the industry's marketplace of actors in irreversible ways. In January, Trump issued an executive order to freeze all U.S. foreign aid, ostensibly so that the secretary of state could review it to make sure that it is aligned with U.S. interests. Within weeks of the order, the world's largest bilateral development agency, USAID, functionally ceased to exist, and its destruction unleashed a domino effect.

Dozens of small and midsize nongovernmental organizations are folding. Large organizations that implemented projects for USAID, such as FHI 360, Chemonics, and DAI Global, have terminated some country programs, announced the closure of field offices, and laid off hundreds of staffers worldwide. Multilateral organizations are also suffering from U.S. aid cuts. UN agencies such as the International Organization for Migration, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the World Health Organization rely on the United States for 20 to 40 percent of their funding and have been forced to downsize.

This disruption will likely be compounded by funding cuts to universities. The Trump administration has canceled or frozen hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of research grants to leading American universities, such as Columbia, Johns Hopkins, and Princeton. These cuts will reduce the number of young professionals who are trained in fields related to development, end projects that evaluate the impact of aid, and erode the institutional memory of how aid projects are designed, delivered, and assessed. Entire academic and advocacy fields such as global health, climate action, gender equality, and democracy promotion may collapse.

The short-term impacts of the aid industry's demise are already appearing, but the long-term effects are unknown. Foreign aid makes up a large percentage of the gross national income of about 25 countries, including Burundi, Liberia, Malawi, Nauru, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen. These places have seen the termination of crucial education and health programs. And it is unlikely that private donors can fill the gap, because private philanthropy makes up less than ten percent of annual foreign aid flows tracked by the OECD. Furthermore, American individual and corporate philanthropists—which constitute more than half of the world's top 40 private donors—may well draw back, wary of retaliation from the U.S. government.

Foreign aid has rapidly become a sunset industry. But that does not mean that rich countries should give up fighting poverty entirely. It is in the interest of wealthy states to reduce the pressure of migration by trying to improve the economies and stability of countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Therefore, policy experts, intellectuals, activists, philanthropists, and humanitarians must save global development by decoupling it from the aid industry and anchoring it in a strategy of industrial transformation. A country becomes industrialized when it adopts technology that allows it to mechanize and digitize, leading to increases in productivity and the skills of its labor force. Eventually, an industrialized country's workers shift from subsistence agriculture toward higher-productivity sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, green technologies, and digital services. And closely associated with higher incomes and employment in these modern industries are social changes such as more women working in formal jobs, more girls in schools, and fewer child marriages.

Industrialization has transformed many once poor societies into prosperous ones. Over the course of several hundred years, countries including China, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States got rich by industrializing. Today, Thailand and Vietnam are undergoing industrialization thanks to foreign direct investment in manufacturing industries, good connectivity infrastructure, skilled labor, and expanded access to export markets.

Part of the problem with the aid industry is that its benefits have been spread too thinly across a multitude of domains and not focused enough on productivity-enhancing sectors. To this end, advocates of global development should focus on enabling poorer countries to access cheap development financing for targeted investments in sectors that connect people, such as electricity, telecommunications, and mass transit. Development financing must include efforts to stem illicit financial flows. African countries, for example, lose a combined total of about $90 billion every year to elite corruption, illicit capital flight, and tax evasion by multinational corporations. That is more money than the $60 billion of aid that donor governments used to send to the continent annually. Such waste could be reduced if rich countries tightened their regulations on tax havens and offshore financial centers and if the 138 signatories of the global tax treaty—an agreement reached in 2023 that sets a minimum rate of tax for large corporations—accelerated its implementation.



Poorer countries also need a stable trading environment to thrive. They need access to export markets in wealthy countries for goods and services they produce. And decades of evidence shows that neither poor nor wealthy countries ultimately prosper from protectionism or autarky. Firms in rich countries, especially those in rapidly changing fields such as artificial intelligence, batteries, drones, and renewable energy hardware, need to be able to sell to growing markets in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.

Professionals who work in global development will need new codes to guide their efforts to support industrial transformation. These may entail creating new rules to regulate the scramble for critical resources that wealthy countries need to manufacture electronics, such as cobalt from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or copper from Zambia. Ethicists and social scientists around the world must help craft rules for the limits of artificial intelligence, drone warfare, and other ways that new technologies directly interface with human societies.

If proponents of global development embrace industrial transformation as their lodestar, they can help lift people out of destitution while avoiding political blowback. If poor countries industrialize, the entire world will benefit. Global development has the best chance of surviving—and delivering results—if it is seen as more than just charity.

            • Immigration crackdown: The Department of Homeland Security said today it would pay undocumented migrants who leave the US. This comes as President Donald Trump said in a wide-ranging interview aired yesterday that he doesn't know whether he has to uphold constitutional rights to due process as he carries out sweeping deportations, but added that he'll abide by Supreme Court rulings.
    


            • Tariff uncertainty: Trump told reporters yesterday that some trade deals “could very well be” announced this week but insisted his administration holds full power over the negotiations. In an interview aired yesterday, Trump said tariffs on Chinese imports to the US will be lowered “at some point” as investors and businesses anxiously await word on potential trade deals.
    


• Trump's events today: Trump is expected this afternoon to announce that Washington, DC, will host the 2027 NFL Draft and then meet with an American freed from Russia, according to sources. The president is also set to sign more executive orders.
    


            President Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said today that rebuilding and reopening Alcatraz, the famous former prison off the coast of San Francisco, “should be on the table.”
    


            “Well, we need detention beds,” Homan said from the White House, one day after Trump said that he would order the government to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz to house “ruthless and violent” offenders.
    


            “I think it is certainly an option, especially for the significant public safety threats, national security threats,” Homan said.
    


            When pressed by White House reporters how much it would cost, Homan quickly replied: “ I have no idea.”
    


            The prison, which closed 60 years ago due to its crumbling infrastructure and high maintenance costs, “will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social yesterday. The president later told reporters it was “just an idea” he had as federal judges pushed to ensure deported migrants had due process.
    


CNN has reported that the Trump administration has started talks with the Department of Justice on next steps for reopening Alcatraz, according to a White House official.
    


            A group of 18 blue state attorneys general led by New York sued the Trump administration this morning, challenging an executive order that stymied offshore wind development in federal waters.
    


            More recently, the Interior Department issued a stop work order for an offshore wind project that was under construction off the coast of New York, going a step further than President Donald Trump's executive order signed in January.
    


                    “This administration is devastating one of our nation's fastest-growing sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,” New York attorney general Letitia James said in a statement, adding the order “threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments.”
                





            James' office estimates New York's wind projects alone support over 4,000 jobs, with the potential to create over 18,000 more in future years. Several other states that have offshore wind farms in various stages of planning and development — including Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island — are also suing.
    


            James and other Democratic attorneys general allege in their filing Trump's order blocking offshore wind development “directly contradicts” another day one executive order Trump signed declaring a “national energy emergency” that called for a boom in fossil fuel, nuclear, and geothermal energy, while targeting wind.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.
    


            The White House says no “final” decisions have been made on imposing new tariffs on films produced outside the US after President Donald Trump said he would apply a new 100% duty on foreign-made motion pictures.
    


                    “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.
                





            Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday he was directing the Commerce Department and the US Trade Representative to “immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.”
    


            He said the US film industry is “DYING a very fast death” and that “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.”
    


            President Donald Trump said he had a “good and productive” phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan today, where the two leaders discussed multiple global issues, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and Gaza.
    


            The president added in his Truth Social post that Erdoğan invited him to Turkey, and Trump said he also extended an invitation to the White House.
    


            “During my four years as President, my relationship with President Erdoğan was excellent. We worked together closely on numerous things, including the fact that he helped return Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned, back to the United States — Immediately upon my request,” Trump wrote in his post.
    


            Trump referenced his first term and highlighted his “excellent” relationship with president Erdoğan. The Turkish president is a controversial international figure who has been criticized for alleged human rights abuses and eroding democratic norms in the country.
    


            Trump is scheduled to visit the Middle East next week in his second foreign trip since he took office in Janaury, traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            “In any event, I look forward to working with President Erdoğan on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!” Trump added.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security said today it would pay undocumented migrants who leave the United States and return to their home country.
    


            President Donald Trump has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the US, and the offer announced by DHS could incentivize people to leave the country voluntarily and supplement the number of migrants who are forcibly removed from the country.
    


            In addition to “both financial and travel assistance to facilitate,” self-deportation, which a DHS spokesperson said included a complimentary one-way departure ticket, the agency said it would also pay an additional $1,000 to people who verify they have returned to their home country.
    


            Migrants can verify their departure from the US using the CBP Home App, the agency said. DHS added that those who participate in this process will be deprioritized for targeting by immigration officials for detention and removal from the country, and that it “may” preserve the option for migrants to re-enter the US legally in the future.
    


            At least one immigrant has already used the offer to return to Honduras, the agency said, adding that several other plane tickets were booked for this week and next week.
    


            President Donald Trump's administration has started talks with the Department of Justice on next steps for reopening the notorious Alcatraz prison, according to a White House official.
    


                    “Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders,” the president posted to social media Sunday evening.
                





            The Department of Justice oversees the Bureau of Prisons.
    


Some background: Alcatraz was closed in 1963 because, according to the Bureau of Prisons, it was “too expensive to continue operating,” costing three times more than any other federal prison at the time. The landmark is now a museum that generates approximately $60 million per year, per the National Park Service.
    


            The US Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said today his agency will “pursue all avenues” to implement President Donald Trump's plans for reopening Alcatraz.
    


            “The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda,” said Marshall in a statement. “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps. USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice. We will be actively working with our law enforcement and other federal partners to reinstate this very important mission.”
    


            Trump acknowledged the symbolism of the move Sunday evening, telling reporters: “It's a symbol of law and order and you know it's got quite a history, frankly, so I think we're going to do that and we're looking at it right now.”
    


            It remains unclear how much it will cost – but the move is almost certain to draw legal challenges.

CNN's Hannah Rabinowitz contributed reporting to this post. 



            President Donald Trump is expected to meet today with Ksenia Karelina, an American who was freed from Russian detention last month, a US official and two sources familiar told CNN.
    


            Karelina, a US citizen, was serving a 12-year prison sentence on charges of treason for giving a small donation to a US-based charity that supports Ukraine. She was released as part of a prisoner exchange.
    


            Karelina flew back to Washington, DC, and was greeted by a group of US officials, including special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler, deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus, and National Security Council official Sebastian Gorka. She did not meet with Trump at the time.
    


            NBC first reported that Trump and Karelina are expected to meet. The White House public schedule said the president “welcomes home a returned Citizen” this afternoon.
    


            Missed the news this weekend? Here's a quick look at some key headlines from the last few days as you read in this morning:
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to announce Monday that Washington, DC, will host the 2027 NFL Draft, according to a source familiar with the plans.
    


            He will make the announcement, first reported by Axios, in the Oval Office at 1 p.m. ET alongside NFL officials. Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser is also expected to attend, according to the source.
    


            A spokesperson for Bowser did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Trump made history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl in February, and he celebrated the winning Philadelphia Eagles last week.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with National Security Council staff today as he assumes his new role as interim national security adviser, according to a senior State Department official.
    


            Rubio plans to split his time between the State Department and the NSC, the official said, adding that this dynamic is not unusual. Rubio had already placed a premium on spending time at the White House throughout the last few months, CNN reported last week.
    


            But officials at the State Department and the NSC still have questions about how this is going to look. Some expect Rubio to make changes to NSC personnel and strategy, and delegate certain diplomatic priorities to Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau — but how that all looks remains an open question.
    


                    “There quite a bit of disarray right now,” said another senior State Department official.
                





Remember: Rubio was appointed interim national security adviser last week after Trump announced that he was nominating Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador.
    


            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN that President Donald Trump's comments over the weekend casting doubt over his oath to uphold the US Constitution were “shocking.”
    


                    “It was shocking and it tells you all you need to know about this presidency and this man. That he doesn't give a damn about the US Constitution and that is frightening in itself,” Hochul told CNN's Kate Bolduan this morning.
                





            In an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” that aired yesterday, Trump said, “I don't know” when asked whether he needs to uphold the Constitution. Trump was also asked if citizens and noncitizens deserve due process in legal proceedings. The president initially responded, “I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.” He later added that he was elected to deal with immigration and the “courts are holding me from doing it.”
    


            Hochul noted that she had to take the same oath 31 years when she ran for town board, “I knew I was supposed to uphold the Constitution. I got to think a president who took the oath of office not once, but twice understands that there are limitations and that is the body of the Constitution.”
    


            The New York governor added that it's important for Trump to keep his oath and follow the Constitution, “Otherwise the democracy that we fought for and upheld for 250 years is just going to go down the drain. And we're not going to let that happen.”
    


            President Donald Trump says tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States will eventually be lowered, after both Beijing and Washington appeared to soften their positions about potential trade talks.
    


            “At some point, I'm going to lower them because otherwise you could never do business with them,” he said in an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker,” which taped on Friday. “They want to do business very much … their economy is collapsing.”
    


            Weeks of tit-for-tat escalation between the world's two largest economies have driven US tariffs on Chinese products to a staggering 145% and Chinese levies on American goods to 125%. Over the past two weeks, both sides have appeared to moderate their rhetoric.
    


            In the interview, which aired Sunday, Trump acknowledged the toll the tariffs have taken on China, pointing to factory closures and unemployment “through the roof,” but insisted that he would not make the first move.
    


            “You're not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Welker asked.
    


            “Why would I do that?” Trump responded.
    


            On Friday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said the country was “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks, but that Trump must “cancel” his “unilateral tariff hikes” first.
    


            The US tariffs have already started to affect China's export-reliant economy. In April, factory activity there showed its steepest contraction in 16 months, while new export orders dipped to their lowest level since 2022, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to official data.
    


            On Sunday, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that he has no plans to speak to Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week. “But China and our people are talking about different things,” he added.
    


            Trump said he seeks a “fair” trade deal with China, while repeating his claim that the country has taken advantage of the US, in terms of trade, for years.
    


            Americans are learning what it's like to live with a president who sees no constraints on his actions and who apparently fears paying no price for them.
    


            In a blitz of recent policy moves, legal challenges, comments and interviews, Donald Trump is showing that he's shedding the last limitations of custom and the public's long understanding of how a president should behave.
    


            In an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” that aired in full Sunday, Trump said for instance, “I don't know” when asked whether he needs to uphold the Constitution, three months after swearing an oath to do so.
    


            As always, Trump's attacks and expansive policy initiatives seemed aimed at shattering normality and wrong-footing enemies, while creating fear and the impression of unstoppable momentum among his critics.
    


            Trump is also honoring supporters delighted by his assault on what they see as disdainful and liberal-dominated political, legal, educational, media and military establishments. Top aides argue that his extreme actions are justified by his election victory and works — for instance, in his stemming of southern border crossings.
    


            But Trump's behavior also points to darker potential outcomes of a second presidency fueled by his belief that he has near-uncheckable power after a second electoral triumph that followed his defiance of personal legal woes and two assassination attempts.
    


            The administration is repeatedly defying federal courts — in one case even the Supreme Court, over the fate of an undocumented migrant whose return it ordered the administration to “facilitate.” Trump is meanwhile wielding vast executive power against institutions that he wants to silence, including law firms and universities.
    


            And his sense of personal omnipotence sometimes seems to be leading the country toward authoritarianism. He said on NBC he wasn't “looking at” running for a third term in 2028 — as if it's a personal choice whether he obeys the Constitution on which US democracy depends.
    


Read Collinson's full analysis here. 



            In a wide-ranging interview that aired yesterday on NBC's “Meet the Press,” President Donald Trump floated potential successors, discussed taking Greenland by military force, said he doesn't know if he's beholden to the US Constitution, and doled out blame and credit for the state of the US economy.
    


If you unplugged for the weekend, here are the key moments from the interview:



            • Deportations and the Constitution: Trump said he doesn't know if he has to uphold constitutional rights to due process as he carries out his sweeping immigration crackdown, though he said he'll abide by Supreme Court rulings.
    


            Asked directly if it's his duty as president to uphold the Constitution, Trump said, “I don't know.”
    


            • Annexing Greenland: Trump would not rule out using military force to take Greenland, insisting again that the resource-rich island is needed for national security purposes.
    


            • Potential successors: The president said he is “not looking at” running for a constitutionally prohibited third term, despite his own recent statements and his organization's sale of “Trump 2028” hats. Asked about a possible successor, Trump praised Vice President JD Vance and his secretary of state and now-interim national security adviser, Marco Rubio.
    


            • Projecting confidence on the economy: Trump blamed his predecessor for the flagging US economy while touting his own efforts, saying “good parts are the ‘Trump economy' and the bad parts are the ‘Biden economy.'”
    


            Asked if he's worried about the volatile stock market and possibility of a recession, Trump pointed to recent market gains and said “anything can happen,” but even a short-term economic downturn would be followed by long-term success. That optimism is not shared by most Americans, a new CNN poll finds.
    


            • Fed chief's future: ﻿While Trump has repeatedly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, the president indicated he will not fire Powell and is content to wait for his term to end in 2026.
    


            • Military parade: Trump said there will be a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, DC, on June 14 — the Army's 250th birthday celebration and the president's 79th. He would not provide a cost for the event.

Follow:


            Maryland Gov. Wes Moore appears to be everywhere at the moment — popping up on “The View,” delivering a commencement address at a historically Black university in battleground Pennsylvania and, later this month, delivering an address to South Carolina Democrats, who could be pivotal in determining the Democratic Party's nominee in 2028.
    


            The rising star is part of a chorus of Democratic leaders putting forward a vision for how the party should take on Donald Trump as the president plows ahead with his second-term agenda.
    


            “We need to be a country that really gets to know each other again and works together and serves together,” Moore told CNN in an interview following his Sunday commencement address at Lincoln University, where he emphasized bringing Americans from different political ideologies together through a shared commitment to service.
    


            That cheerful outlook comes at a time of deep dissatisfaction among Democrats with the state of the party's leadership and approach to countering Trump. A recent CNN poll found that just 38% of Democratic-aligned Americans approve of their party's leadership, compared with 61% who say they disapprove.

Young Democrats challenge longtime incumbents as party grapples with generational divide



            Moore — Maryland's first Black governor and just the third Black person elected governor of any state — seemed uninterested in attacking fellow Democratic leaders directly, but acknowledged the widespread anger among the party's voters.
    


            “I think a lot of the frustration is justified. I get it. I don't see how you can look at the situation that many people exist in, and think that everything is OK,” he said.
    


            Moore suggested the best way out for Democrats is to lean into what he describes as a “culture of repair” to connect with people who have felt left behind by the status quo. But his vision for moving everyone forward includes a host of policy prescriptions that are arguably easier to advance in a Democratic-controlled state than one with divided government. For instance, he championed Maryland's accelerated minimum-wage increase, investments in apprenticeship programs, mass pardons for cannabis convictions and increased taxes on the wealthy as responsive to the moment.
    


            In his commencement address, Moore leaned into a sense of national pride, a message that is not a point of emphasis for many Democrats.
    


            The combat veteran told graduating seniors that “patriotism is a responsibility of a lifetime” as he recounted the legacy of his grandfather, the Rev. James Thomas, a Lincoln University alum. Thomas was forced to leave the US as a child when Moore's great-grandfather, a vocal community minister, fled with the family to his native Jamaica to escape the violence of the Ku Klux Klan.
    


            “Within my grandfather‘s journey, you find lessons about not just national pride or national spirit, but lessons about what it means to be an American,” Moore said.
    


            Moore's grandfather ultimately returned to the US out of a belief the country “would be incomplete” without him.
    


            “Loving your country doesn't mean lying about its history,” Moore said in his address.
    


            “Our country is currently divided into two camps, not left versus right or red versus blue, but between those who use patriotism as a club to beat others and those who feel ashamed to bear the flag, between those who think loving America means hating half the people in it and those who allow cynicism about our nation's history to obscure their aspirations.”

Inside JB Pritzker's public and private efforts to counter Trump and challenge fellow Democrats



            Across the country, leading Democrats are signaling different strategies for how to respond to the Trump administration's actions. Some, like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, are positioning themselves as fighters — fiercely opposing Trump's moves and calling on the Democratic Party to do more. Others have shown an openness to work with the president to find common ground, such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who recently secured a new fighter jet mission for an Air National Guard base in her state.
    


            When asked by CNN whether Moore saw room to work with the White House, he cast doubt on the idea that the president and his allies are willing partners.
    


            “While I will work with anyone, I will not bow down to anyone. We're not built that way,” he said.
    


            “I believe partnership has to go both ways. And the thing that we continue to see from this administration has just been an all-out assault on the state of Maryland,” Moore said before lamenting the thousands of federal workers in the state impacted by what he sees as the haphazard cuts in the president‘s first 100 days.
    


            While Moore faces reelection next year in Maryland, talk has already turned to a potential 2028 run for the 46-year-old governor.
    


            During an appearance on ABC's “The View” last week, Moore repeatedly said, “I'm not running” when asked about a presidential bid in the next cycle.
    


            Pressed on whether that meant he was ruling out launching a campaign in 2028, Moore said his focus “is exclusively on making sure this is going to be Maryland's decade.”
    


            “I think anybody who is positioning themselves in 2025 for 2028 is not taking 2025 seriously,” he said.
    


            Later this month, Moore will travel to the key early primary state of South Carolina to headline a dinner for the state Democratic Party. In his remarks, Moore is expected to emphasize the significance of strong leadership, according to an early excerpt of prepared remarks provided to CNN.
    


            “In this moment, our job is not to simply go into hiding until there's another election. The measure of our success will be how we choose to lead,” Moore is expected to say.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would order the government to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz, a former prison on a small island of the same name off the coast of San Francisco that once housed some of the most dangerous criminals in the country, including Al Capone, George “Machine Gun” Kelly and James “Whitey” Bulger.
    


            The prison, which closed 60 years ago due to its crumbling infrastructure and high maintenance costs, “will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Sunday, later telling reporters it was “just an idea” he had as federal judges pushed to ensure deported migrants had due process.
    


            On Monday, the US Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said his agency will “pursue all avenues” to implement Trump's plans for reopening Alcatraz.
    


            “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps. USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice. We will be actively working with our law enforcement and other federal partners to reinstate this very important mission,” Marshall said in a statement.
    


            Now a major historical landmark and tourist destination, Alcatraz was once one of the most heavily fortified military sites on the West Coast before it transformed into a notorious federal penitentiary in 1934.
    


            As a maximum-security prison surrounded by the Pacific's strong, cold currents, Alcatraz had a reputation for being a “last resort” facility where the most dangerous and most unruly in other prisons were sent. It was virtually impossible to escape, despite numerous storied attempts.
    


            Here's what else to know about its colorful history:
    


            The island of Alcatraz's strategic location at the entrance to San Francisco Bay made it ideal for defense.
    


            The US Army built a fort there in the 1850s and equipped it with artillery needed to protect the bay from foreign invasion amid growing US interests in the Pacific. It was also used to protect San Francisco from Confederate raiders during the Civil War. Soon after it evolved into a military prison, which it remained into the 20th century.
    


            In 1933 the US military turned Alcatraz over to the Department of Justice, beginning the island's nearly three decades as a federal prison. With its isolated location and barebones amenities, “The Rock,” as it came to be known, was meant to deliver a message to criminals.
    


            “The Federal Government had decided to open a maximum-security, minimum-privilege penitentiary to deal with the most incorrigible inmates in Federal prisons, and to show the law-abiding public that the Federal Government was serious about stopping the rampant crime of the 1920s and 1930s,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
    


            Prisoners at Alcatraz had four rights: food, clothing, shelter, and medical care –– all other privileges, including visits from family or access to books, art supplies and music, had to be earned.
    


            For all of its infamy, Alcatraz averaged a prison population of about 260 to 275 prisoners at any given time – less than 1% of the total federal jail population. Most of the prison's inmates were among those who refused to conform to rules at other federal jails or who were deemed “escape risks.”
    


            Alcatraz saw 14 separate escape attempts involving 36 men over its 29 years as a federal prison. Officially, no one ever succeeded in reaching the mainland alive.
    


            The most successful – and elaborate – escape attempt came in 1962, when Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin vanished from their cells and were never seen again. The escape was dramatized in the 1979 Clint Eastwood film “Escape from Alcatraz.”
    


            The FBI's investigation of the escape uncovered an “ingenious” plan devised over several months.
    


            Using spoons and homemade tools – including a drill made from a vacuum cleaner motor – the inmates dug through ventilation ducts behind their cells, which they used to establish a makeshift workshop on top of their cellblock.
    


            They created fake heads of themselves from plaster – complete with real human hair. The men secretly assembled a makeshift raft and life vests out of more than 50 stolen raincoats, using heat from steam pipes to seal the materials, investigators found.
    


            On the night of their escape, they used their dummy heads to fool the night guards while they slipped out of their cells. They then crawled through a ventilator shaft on the prison's roof that they had previously cut open and left temporarily secured with a bolt made from soap.
    


            It is believed that the group never made it to land and disappeared into the cold waters of San Francisco Bay. The FBI concluded they likely drowned, but no bodies were ever recovered.
    


            Occasional sightings and leads have kept the case open for decades.
    


            Among the most well-known prisoners of Alcatraz was Robert Stroud, nicknamed the “Birdman of Alcatraz” for his later interest in ornithology –– the study of birds.
    


            Originally imprisoned for manslaughter in 1909, Stroud later killed a prison guard and was sentenced to life in solitary confinement at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas.
    


            While in prison, Stroud began raising canaries and conducted research on birds, later publishing respected books on bird diseases. Though he was allowed to conduct his studies in his cell, prison authorities later found that equipment Stroud had requested for his experiments were used to construct a still for “home-brew,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons site.
    


            Stroud was then transferred to Alcatraz in 1942 where he was not allowed to keep birds. He left Alcatraz for another facility in 1959 and died four years later.
    


            By the time Alcatraz prison closed, its building walls were corroded from the salty sea air. Authorities estimated it would take roughly $3 million to $5 million to restore and maintain the facility –– excluding daily operational costs.
    


            “Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website.
    


            After it closed, the island sat mostly unused until 1969, when a group of Native American activists occupied it for 19 months in protest, claiming it under the Treaty of Fort Laramie.
    


            Today, Alcatraz is operated by the National Park Service as a tourist destination, welcoming approximately 1.2 million visitors a year.
    


            It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986, but such a designation “can be considered for withdrawal either at the request of the owner or on the initiative of the Secretary of the Interior,” according to the National Park Service.



            There are certain conditions that make a landmark eligible for losing the designation, such as ceasing “to meet criteria for designation; the qualities for which it was originally designated have been lost or destroyed.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Interior and the National Park Service for comment.
    


            Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, pushed back on the president's proposal, calling it “not a serious one.”
    


            “Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President's proposal is not a serious one,” the congresswoman wrote Sunday on X.

            Some Americans are still not doing their due diligence when it comes to washing their hands.
    


            That's according to a new survey that found nearly half of its respondents forget or choose not to wash their hands at key times, such as after visiting grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops and health care settings including a doctor's office or hospital.
    


            For some of us, the hygiene lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic apparently have not sunk in — although the survey, funded by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, did find that 33% of participants wash their hands more now than they did during the crisis.
    


            “We have been talking about handwashing probably back to the days when all of us were in preschool or even kindergarten,” said Dr. Robert Hopkins, the foundation's medical director. “I would have hoped that we would think of that as a core way of keeping ourselves healthy regardless of our other health behaviors.
    


            “It's a nonspecific way that we can reduce risk for exposure to infectious diseases, along with dirt, grime [and] all of the other things we don't like to see on our hands.”
    


            Released Monday, on World Hand Hygiene Day, the survey is part of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases' Hands in for Handwashing Campaign, which raises awareness of the importance of handwashing to help stop the spread of infectious diseases. The research was conducted by NORC (formerly called the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago.
    


            The report highlights when, where and why nearly 3,600 adults surveyed between December and March were most likely to wash or not wash their hands, and how some of those habits differed between age groups and genders.
    


            Sixty-two percent of participants correctly answered that washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds is the method that most effectively reduces the spread of germs, while 13% thought less time would be enough and 24% believed more time is needed.
    


            The top three situations that prompted respondents to wash their hands were using the bathroom, handling food and handling human or animal waste.

            “This is good news, given that a single gram of human feces can contain 1 trillion germs — including Salmonella, E. coli, and norovirus — that can cause disease,” the report stated.
    


            But only 30% of participants said they were most likely to wash their hands after sneezing or coughing, “which is concerning given how easily respiratory diseases such as influenza … can spread,” the report added.
    


            Among the nearly half of adults who didn't wash their hands at important times, forgetting was the most common reason why. But 20% actively chose to not wash their hands, with some thinking that the practice wasn't necessary, that they didn't have time or that they didn't want to dry out their hands.
    


            Men were more likely than women to not wash their hands at important times and to think handwashing requires less time.
    


            Adults older than 60 were most diligent in their handwashing habits, with 74% doing so after using the bathroom or handling food. The greater likelihood in this age group may be due to awareness of the fact that older adults have a higher risk of getting sick, according to the report.
    


            Or the trend could be caused by a longer lifetime of habits, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, who wasn't involved in the research.
    


            “Older folks, we didn't have the hand sanitizers when we were younger,” Benjamin said. “When I went outside to play, when I came back in, I was supposed to wash my hands. So I think that you're looking at behaviors that may have changed from a generation to another generation.”

            Some participants' handwashing habits depended on the season, with 26% reporting washing their hands more frequently in the fall and winter. The variance makes sense given that some respiratory illnesses peak during colder weather, the report stated. Public health messaging is also more prevalent during this season, Benjamin said.
    


            “However, other germs — like those that cause colds, norovirus, and other infectious diseases — can spread throughout the year,” according to the survey. “It is important to maintain proper hand hygiene all year round to help stay healthy.”
    


            Most adults surveyed said they wash their hands to protect their own health, feel clean, avoid spreading germs to others, and avoid getting sick and missing work or school.
    


            Handwashing can make a big difference. “Since about 80% of infectious diseases are spread by dirty hands, routine, proper handwashing throughout the year can significantly help prevent the spread of infectious diseases,” according to the report. “In just 20 seconds, handwashing can help prevent the spread of diseases like flu, COVID-19, and norovirus.”
    


            The habit can also prevent 1 in 3 people from getting diarrhea and 1 in 5 people from developing a respiratory illness, Dr. Vincent Hill, adjunct associate professor of environmental health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, told CNN in 2020.

            For people who often forget to wash their hands, an increase in public health signage in public — or in do-it-yourself signage at home — reminding people to do so could be worthwhile, Benjamin said.
    


            And if you're one of those people who doesn't wash their hands after using the restroom because they “only went pee,” Hopkins urged people to remember that in public restrooms especially, there are at least millions of bacteria on every surface you're touching, from the many people going in and out of that bathroom all day. Even if your urine is sterile, it doesn't mean everything else is.
    


            Hand sanitizer is great to have when you absolutely can't wash your hands, but you shouldn't depend on it, given its inability to kill certain bacteria or viruses such as C. diff and norovirus, Hopkins said.
    


            If you're worried about your hands being too dry after washing or sanitizing, you can carry a small bottle of lotion in your bag or car, experts said. Applying lotion when your hands are still slightly damp helps your skin lock in moisture.
    


            “Proper handwashing puts the power of health in our own hands,” said Patricia A. Stinchfield, immediate past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

            President Donald Trump has renewed his threat of using military force to annex Greenland, saying in an NBC News interview he wouldn't rule it out to make the self-governing Danish territory a part of the United States.
    


            It's the latest in Trump's many comments about seizing control of the resource-rich island, which he insists the US needs for national security purposes.
    


“I don't rule it out,” he told NBC News' Kristen Welker in an interview that aired on Sunday. “I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything.”
    


            “We need Greenland very badly,” Trump said. “Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.”
    


            He added that he doubted it would happen – but that the possibility is “certainly” there.
    


            Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in buying the island, or the US taking it by force or economic coercion, even as NATO ally Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected the idea.



            There are a few factors driving that interest; Greenland occupies a unique geopolitical position, sitting between the US and Europe, which could help repel any potential attack from Russia, experts have said. It also lies along a key shipping lane, and is part of the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap, a strategic maritime region.
    


            But experts also suspect Trump is eyeing other aspects of Greenland such as its trove of natural resources, which may become more accessible as climate change melts the territory's ice. These include oil and gas, and the rare earth metals in high demand for electric cars, wind turbines and military equipment.
    


            Since Trump began voicing plans for his presidency in December, his desire to annex Greenland has raised questions about the island's future security as the US, Russia and China vie for influence in the Arctic.
    


            But Greenland has pushed back strongly.
    


            “President Trump says that the United States ‘will get Greenland.' Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide our own future,” the island's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in March after Trump again suggested the use of military force.
    


            Greenland's not the only sovereign territory Trump has his sights on; the president has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada and make it the US' “51st state,” souring relations between the two longtime allies.
    


            Last week, Canada's Liberal Party swept to victory in federal elections, with Prime Minister Mark Carney riding on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment and using his victory speech to declare Canada would “never” yield to the United States.
    


            During the NBC interview on Sunday, Trump said it was “highly unlikely” he'd use military force to annex Canada.
    


            “I don't see it with Canada. I just don't see it, I have to be honest with you,” he said.
    


            He added that he'd talked on the phone with Carney after his election win, calling the Canadian leader a “very nice man.” Trump had congratulated Carney, but they did not discuss the threat of annexation of Canada, he said.
    


            Carney is set to visit Trump in Washington on Tuesday. When asked whether the topic would come up during that visit, Trump responded: “I'll always talk about that.”
    


            If Canada was a state, “it would be great,” Trump added. “It would be a cherished state.”

NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump is opening a new salvo in his tariff war, targeting films made outside the U.S.

In a post Sunday night on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he has authorized the Department of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to slap a 100% tariff “on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.”

“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” he wrote, complaining that other countries “are offering all sorts of incentives to draw” filmmakers and studios away from the U.S. “This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!”

The White House said Monday that it was figuring out how to comply with the president's wishes.

“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” said spokesperson Kush Desai.

It's common for both large and small films to include production in the U.S. and in other countries. Big-budget movies like the upcoming “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” for instance, are shot around the world.

Incentive programs for years have influenced where movies are shot, increasingly driving film production out of California and to other states and countries with favorable tax incentives, like Canada and the United Kingdom.




Yet Trump's tariffs are designed to lead consumers toward American products. And in movie theaters, American-produced movies overwhelmingly dominate the domestic marketplace.

China has ramped up its domestic movie production, culminating in the animated blockbuster “Ne Zha 2” grossing more than $2 billion this year. But even then, its sales came almost entirely from mainland China. In North America, it earned just $20.9 million.

In New Zealand, where successive governments have offered rebates and incentives in recent years to draw Hollywood films to the country, the film industry has generated billions of dollars in tourism revenue driven by the “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” films, which featured the country's pristine and scenic vistas. More recently, the blockbuster “Minecraft” movie was filmed entirely in New Zealand, and U.S. productions in 2023 delivered $1.3 billion New Zealand dollars ($777 million) to the country in return for NZ$200 million in subsidies, according to government figures.

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said he was awaiting more details of Trump's measures before commenting on them but would continue to pitch to filmmakers abroad, including in India's Bollywood. “We've got an absolutely world class industry,” he said. “This is the best place to make movies, period, in the world.”

The Motion Picture Association, which represents major U.S. film studios and streaming services, didn't immediately respond to messages Sunday evening.

The MPA's data shows how much Hollywood exports have dominated cinemas. According to the MPA, the American movies produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3 billion in trade surplus in 2023. 

Trump, a Republican, has made good on the “tariff man” label he gave himself years ago, slapping new taxes on goods made in countries around the globe. That includes a 145% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries, with even higher levies threatened.

By unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions. There are tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be subject to new tariffs in the weeks ahead.

Trump has long voiced concern about movie production moving overseas.

Shortly before he took office, he announced that he had tapped actors Mel Gibson, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone to serve as “special ambassadors” to Hollywood to bring it “BACK — BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!”

U.S. film and television production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hollywood guild strikes of 2023 and the recent wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Overall production in the U.S. was down 26% last year compared with 2021, according to data from ProdPro, which tracks production. 

The group's annual survey of executives, which asked about preferred filming locations, found no location in the U.S. made the top five, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Toronto, the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia came out on top, with California placing sixth, Georgia seventh, New Jersey eighth and New York ninth.

The problem is especially acute in California. In the greater Los Angeles area, production last year was down 5.6% from 2023 according to FilmLA, second only to 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. Last, October, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, proposed expanding California's Film & Television Tax Credit program to $750 million annually, up from $330 million. 

Other U.S. cities like Atlanta, New York, Chicago and San Francisco have also used aggressive tax incentives to lure film and TV productions. Those programs can take the form of cash grants, as in Texas, or tax credits, which Georgia and New Mexico offer.

“Other nations have been stealing the movie-making capabilities from the United States,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Sunday night after returning from a weekend in Florida. “If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States we should have a tariff on movies that come in.”

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The Trump administration says the sweeping tariffs it unveiled April 2, then postponed for 90 days, have a simple goal: Force other countries to drop their trade barriers to U.S. goods. 

Yet President Donald Trump's definition of trade barriers includes a slew of issues well beyond the tariffs other countries impose on the U.S., including some areas not normally associated with trade disputes. Those include agricultural safety requirements, tax systems, currency exchange rates, product standards, legal requirements, and red tape at the border. 

He's given countries three months to come up with concessions before tariffs ranging from 10% to more than 50% go into effect. Tariffs on China are already in effect.

On many issues it will be difficult, or in some cases impossible, for many countries to make a deal and lower their tariff rates.

In addition, many trade officials from targeted countries say privately that it isn't always clear what the Trump administration wants from them in the negotiations. 

Vice President JD Vance announced that India has agreed to the terms of trade talks with the United States, but other countries are still trying to set the contours for any negotiations. The White House has highlighted conflicting goals for its import taxes: It's seeking to raise revenues and bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but it also wants greater access to foreign markets and massive changes to other nations' tax and regulatory policies.

Here are several non-tariff areas the administration is targeting:




CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

Trump has accused Germany, China and Japan of “global freeloading” by — in his view — devaluing their currencies to make their exports cheaper. 

The European Central bank has been cutting interest rates to support growth. That could also weaken the euro, which has strengthened sharply against the dollar since Trump took office. The ECB says it doesn't target the exchange rate. 

In Japan's case, the Bank of Japan has been gradually raising rates anyway after keeping them at zero or in negative territory for years, which should drive the yen up against the dollar. The U.S. dollar has fallen recently to 140-yen levels, down from about 160 yen last summer. Shrikant Kale, a strategist at Jefferies, believes the dollar will fall to 120 yen over the next 18 months.

FARM PRODUCTS

Agricultural safeguards against importing pests or health hazards have been a sticking point with U.S. trade partners for years. They include Japan's restrictions on rice and potato imports, the EU's ban on hormone-treated beef or chlorine-disinfected chickens and Korea's ban on beef from cows more than 30 months old. 

Yet changes face stiff political resistance from voters and farm lobbies in those countries.

For years, U.S. potato growers have sought access to Japan's potential $150 million market for table potatoes. Japan has engaged in talks but taken years simply to supply a list of concerns to U.S. negotiators. The delay is “pure politics,” intended to protect domestic growers, says National Potato Council CEO Kam Quarles. If Japanese politicians perceive the pain from Trump's tariffs might be worse than from their own potato growers, “that makes it more likely to make a deal,” Quarles said. 

But “if they perceive the pain domestically will be worse than the Trump administration can bring to them ... we're going to be stuck where we are.”

Korea's beef restrictions started as a measure to keep out bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. The 30-month rule has been maintained in the wake of mass protests in 2008, even as the U.S. has become the largest beef exporter to Korea. 

“It's still politically controversial because of the scar at the time in 2008. I think the government will be very cautious,” said Jaemin Lee, professor of law at Seoul National University and an expert on trade issues. 

TAXATION

Trump has railed against value-added tax as a burden to U.S. companies, although economists say this kind of tax is trade-neutral because it applies equally to imports and exports. Value-added tax, or VAT, is paid by the end purchaser at the cash register but differs from sales taxes in that it is calculated at each stage of the production process.

Trump's view could mean higher tariffs for Europe, where individual countries levy VAT of 20% or more depending on the type of good, and for the more than 170 countries that use this kind of tax system. The U.S. is an outlier in that it doesn't use VAT; instead, individual states levy sales taxes.

There's little chance countries will change their tax systems for Trump. The EU for one has said VAT is off the table.

“The domestic taxation system has not been a conventional topic in trade negotiation because domestic taxation is directly related to national sovereignty or the domestic economic regime,” trade expert Lee said. “It's very hard to understand why VAT has become an important topic in the trade discussion.”

PRODUCT STANDARDS

U.S. officials have complained about Japan's non-recognition of U.S vehicle safety standards and its different testing procedures for car equipment. 

Japan also provides subsidies for the Japanese-designed ChaDeMo plug standard for electric cars, requiring foreign makers to use an outdated technology if they want the subsidy. 

BUREAUCRACY

Concerns about excessive or baffling bureaucratic procedures to get goods into a country are mentioned repeatedly in the administration's latest trade assessment. The U.S. has complained about expensive delays getting permission to export seafood to Japan. Meanwhile, Japan requires wheat imports to be sold to a government entity and has “highly regulated and intransparent” quota system that keeps rice imports from the U.S. to a minimum.

Most of these issues are years old, raising questions about whether 90 days is enough to make a deal over them. 

U.S. pharmaceutical companies have complained about Korea's system for drug imports, while automakers say environmental equipment standards are unclear and expose only importers to criminal penalties in case of violations.

BUY AMERICAN

Analysts say that despite the long list of non-tariff issues, the administration's main focus may lie elsewhere: on Trump's desire to reduce trade deficits, cases where a country sells more to the U.S. than it buys.

And the solution may be other countries buying more U.S. products, from energy to soybeans, and builingd more plants in the U.S. 

U.S. energy is already a major export to Europe. Trump has mentioned a figure of $350 billion for potential EU gas imports. The EU does need imported gas. But Trump's figure would be a stretch given that last year's exports of liquefied natural gas to the EU were around $13 billon, and that Europe is seeking to reduce its use of fossil fuels over the longer term.

THE HEART OF THE MATTER?

Discussions about non-tariff issues may simply be leverage to underpin Trump's stiff tariff levels. 

“It's just a thing that's there to justify my tariffs,” said Tobias Gehrke, senior policy fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations.

While lower level trade officials and industry representatives are acutely aware of non-tariff issues like agricultural safety, “Trump and his cabinet... don't really care about chlorinated chicken regulations in Europe and food standards,” Gehrke said. “They have much bigger thinking.”

“They want to have European companies significantly move production to America... and to export from America to Europe. That would change the trade balance.”

“And if that's the main logic, then there's no real deal to be had on non-tariff barriers.”

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Hard-right nationalist George Simion secured a decisive win Sunday in the first round of Romania's presidential election redo, nearly complete electoral data showed. The election took place months after an annulled vote plunged the European Union and NATO member country into its worst political crisis in decades.

Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, was far outpacing all other candidates in the polls with 40.5% of the vote, official electoral data shows, after 99% of votes were counted from Sunday's vote. 

Far behind in second place was Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan with 20.89%, and in third place the governing coalition's joint candidate, Crin Antonescu, with 20.34%. He conceded defeat after midnight, saying he believes it's an “irreversible result.” 

Eleven candidates vied for the presidency and a runoff will be held on May 18 between the top two candidates. By the time polls closed, about 9.57 million people — or 53.2% of eligible voters — had cast their ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau, with 973,000 votes cast at polling stations set up in other countries. 




The rerun was held after Romania's political landscape was shaken last year when a top court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.

In a prerecorded speech aired after polls closed, Simion said that despite many obstacles, Romanians “have risen up” and “we are approaching an exceptional result.” 

“I am here to restore constitutional order,” said Simion, who came fourth in last year's race and later backed Georgescu. “I want democracy, I want normalcy, and I have a single objective: to give back to the Romanian people what was taken from them and to place at the center of decision-making the ordinary, honest, dignified people.”

As in many EU countries, antiestablishment sentiment is running high in Romania, fueled by high inflation and cost of living, a large budget deficit and a sluggish economy. Observers say the malaise has bolstered support for nationalist and far-right figures like Georgescu, who is under investigation and barred from the rerun.

Georgescu, who appeared alongside Simion at a polling station on Sunday in the capital, Bucharest, called the vote rerun “a fraud orchestrated by those who have made deceit the only state policy,” but said he was there to “acknowledge the power of democracy, the power of the vote that frightens the system, that terrifies the system.”

The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.

Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) in 2016, ran on a pro-EU “Honest Romania” ticket. 

“It is about the trust of Romanians and our partners in democracy ... and in my opinion, it is a new beginning that we all have a responsibility to do correctly,” Dan said after the polls closed. 

Antonescu, 65, a veteran centrist who campaigned on retaining Romania's pro-Western orientation, said Sunday that he voted for “a united Romania, for a strong Romania, for a dignified Romania.”

“Democracy means a battle, sometimes taken to the maximum, but it is a battle of ideas,” he said after voting had closed. “Let's not forget that we are fellow citizens, sons of the same country, and we must move forward together.”

Victor Ponta, who was prime minister from 2012-2015, also pushed a MAGA-style “Romania First” campaign and boasted of having close ties to the Trump administration, stands in fourth place with 14.3% of the vote.

Elena Lasconi, who came second in last year's first round ballot and participated in the rerun, only obtained about 2.6% of the vote. She positioned herself as a staunchly pro-Western, anti-system candidate, railing against what she described as a corrupt political class.

Cristian Andrei, a Bucharest-based political consultant, said Simion's clear victory indicates a complete “reshape” of the political spectrum, and that if Dan reaches the runoff, “it will be a clear signal that the political class and the political establishment have lost.” 

“You have a populist or pro-sovereign movement ... and you also have this liberal, urban, pro-Western segment of Romania that wants change,” he said, adding that it would be a “huge rejection of the classic political parties ... and this will mean that the entire political spectrum will be reshaped.”

Distrust in the authorities remains widespread, especially for those who voted for Georgescu, a sizable electorate that Simion has sought to tap into.

“The antiestablishment sentiment is not like an anarchic movement, but is against the people who destroyed this country,” Simion told The Associated Press days before the rerun. “We are not a democratic state anymore.”

Simion said that his hard-right nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians party is “perfectly aligned with the MAGA movement,” capitalizing on a growing wave of populism in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trump's political comeback. AUR rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election, proclaims to stand for “family, nation, faith, and freedom,” and has since doubled its support.

Rares Ghiorghies, 36, who works in the energy sector and voted for Simion, says he hopes that if he secures the presidency, Romania can “return to the basic principles of democracy, regain our confidence.”

“What happened in December 2024 is definitely a dark chapter in the history of this country, and we can no longer accept it,” he said. “I'm hoping things will get back to normal.”

The election redo is a crossroads moment for Romania as it seeks to restore its democracy and retain its geopolitical alliances, which have become strained since the canceled election fiasco. 

The decision to annul the election and the ban on Georgescu's candidacy drew criticism from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Russia, which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun.

Three Democratic U.S. senators are asking the Trump administration to explain how it analyzed a proposed rule to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species and whether industry had a hand in drafting it. 

Senators Adam Schiff, Sheldon Whitehouse and Cory Booker sent a letter Monday to the departments of Interior and Commerce that also asks how the administration plans to protect species if the rule is changed. 

At issue is a long-standing definition of “harm” in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live — the No. 1 cause of extinction.

Last month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service proposed a rule that says habitat modification shouldn't be considered harm because it isn't the same as intentionally targeting a species, called “take.” Environmentalists argue that the definition of “take” has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of “harm” has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Under the new interpretation, industry, developers and others could simply say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, environmentalists say, which could lead to the extinction of critically endangered species like the Florida panther and spotted owl.

The proposal could threaten progress made to save species that once were endangered, including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales, they said.




The senators said it “represents an end run around the Endangered Species Act.”

“It is widely understood that a species cannot live without a safe place to call home,” the letter reads.

They also asked the administration to explain how it could enforce the act at all amid efforts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to fire federal staff and cut agencies' funding.

The proposal is in the middle of a 30-day public comment period. Environmentalists have vowed to challenge it in court if it's adopted. 

The Department of Interior said in an email that it would not comment on the letter but carefully reviews all correspondence from Congress. The Department of Commerce did not respond to an email sent Monday seeking comment.

 Former Vice President Mike Pence, in a national digital exclusive interview with Fox News, says any move by Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy 'needs to be opposed'

EXCLUSIVE - BOSTON – He is out of power, but former Vice President Mike Pence does not feel powerless. 

Pence, the once loyal vice president who broke with President Donald Trump as he defied his one-time boss's request to throw out the results of the 2020 presidential election, pledged to be a vocal GOP critic when Trump, during his second tour of duty in the White House, veers from the ""conservative agenda"" that defined the Trump-Pence administration.

""When you look at those Trump-Pence years, they were years that we governed on a conservative agenda,"" the former vice president said in an exclusive national digital interview with Fox News minutes after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in Boston on Sunday night.

Pence said he gives ""President Trump all the credit in the world for an historic victory last November, and for sparing the country one more liberal Democrat administration.""

He also praised Trump ""not only for his victory, but for securing our southern border, for restoring morale and recruitment in our military, for taking the fight to the Houthis.""

However, he argued that ""I truly do believe that some of the other steps the president is taking away from that conservative agenda should be a concern that would work against his legacy and ultimately the success of our party or our country. And so we're going to continue to be a voice against them.

""I really do believe that for prosperity…for the success of our country, we need to stick to those time-honored principles of strong defense, American leadership on the world stage, less government, less taxes, traditional moral values, and the right to life, and I'm going to be a voice for that,"" added Pence, long a champion of social and fiscal conservative values.

On the suggestion in recent weeks by some House Republicans to raise taxes on the wealthy to help pay for Trump's second-term agenda, an idea some in the White House contemplated before the president came out against the proposal, Pence was clear in his opposition.

""Any suggestion that I've heard among some in and around the administration that we raise the top margin rate, the so-called millionaires tax, would be an enormous tax increase on small business owners across America,"" Pence said.

He additionally emphasized that ""It needs to be opposed. Let's make all the Trump-Pence tax cuts permanent. That's a way to really lay a foundation to grow the economy in the days ahead.""

The former vice president, a proponent of a muscular U.S. foreign policy, has criticized the president's upending of longstanding U.S. foreign policy and has urged Trump to stand with longtime international allies.

Pence received a standing ovation from the audience at Boston's JFK Presidential Library when, in his acceptance address, he stressed that the U.S. ""must continue to stand with Ukraine.""

Pence ran on a traditional conservative platform, framing the future of the Republican Party against what he called the rise of ""populism"" in the party, as he bid for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, as part of a large field that unsuccessfully challenged Trump.

While Pence, who became the first running mate in over 80 years to run against their former boss, regularly campaigned in the crucial early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, his White House bid never took off. 

Struggling in the polls and with fundraising, he suspended his campaign just four and a half months after launching it.

When asked if there was another political chapter ahead, and possibly another bid for national office, Pence told Fox News Digital, ""I leave that up to the American people.""

He reiterated that he intends to ""be a voice"" for traditional and conservative values and ""we'll let the future take care of itself.""

As for Trump's repeated flirtations the past three months with seeking a third term in office in 2028 – which is forbidden by the 22nd Amendment in the U.S. Constitution – Pence said, ""I think there's no higher priority for a president or any elected official to keep faith with the Constitution of the United States.""

""Every single one of us takes the same oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and my hope and my prayer is for the president on down, Republicans and Democrats, will take that oath to heart, because that's the pathway forward for our country and all the American people,"" he added.

Pence spoke with Fox News Digital after receiving the Profile in Courage Award, which is named for a book the late John F. Kennedy published in 1957 before he became president.

The annual award honors public officials who take principled stands despite the potential political or personal consequences. Among the previous recipients were former Presidents Barack Obama, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford.

Pence was honored with the award for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, during the attack on the U.S. Capitol by right-wing extremists — including some chanting ""hang Mike Pence"" — who stormed the U.S. Capitol aiming to upend congressional certification of the 2020 election.

Hours later, after the rioters were cleared from the Capitol building, Pence resumed his constitutional duties by overseeing congressional certification of former President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.

""Vice President Pence put his life, career and that of his family on the line to execute his constitutional responsibilities. His actions preserved the fundamental democratic principle of free and fair elections, and we are proud to honor him,"" former Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, the late President Kennedy's daughter, said in presenting Pence with the award.

Pence, in accepting the annual award, emphasized that it is a ""distinction that I will cherish for the rest of my life.""

The former vice president, pointing to his actions on Jan. 6, said to a standing ovation, ""I will always believe by God's grace that I did my duty that day.""

Additionally, Pence, in his interview, noted that ""in all my travels across the country in the last four years, I've been deeply humbled by how many Americans have come up to me and just taken a point to encourage us and support us, and it convinces me that the American people know that what ever differences we may have, the Constitution is the common ground on which we stand.""

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum speaks at a ceremony renaming a Texas wildlife refuge for Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Houston girl who was killed in June 2024 by two alleged illegal immigrants affiliated with Tren de Aragua.

EXCLUSIVE: Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is planning to introduce a bill that would enshrine into law President Donald Trump's executive order to rename a national park after a 12-year-old Houston girl allegedly killed by two illegal immigrants. 

The bill is being brought forward by Cornyn and U.S. Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, to make it more difficult for future administrations, Republican or Democrat, to change the name of the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge.

""Jocelyn Nungaray was taken from this world far too soon at the hands of brutal killers who were in the U.S. illegally due to President Biden's open-border policies, and her legacy deserves to live on forever,"" Cornyn told Fox News Digital. ""I am proud to lead this legislation alongside Congressman Babin to ensure President Trump's renaming of this sanctuary to the Jocelyn Nungaray National Wildlife Refuge is made permanent.""

During his joint address to Congress in March, Trump announced the renaming of the 39,000-acre sanctuary, formerly known as the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge, along the Texas Gulf Coast. 

In April, officials held a renaming ceremony for the park.

""One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America,"" Trump said during his address. 

The bill would codify the park's new name into law, making the process to change it more difficult. 

""The heartbreaking murder of Jocelyn Nungaray shook our community to its core, and it never should have happened,"" Babin said in a statement. ""Today, we are introducing legislation to honor Jocelyn's life and to send a clear message: securing our border and restoring the rule of law is not optional, it's essential. President Trump's leadership is making America safe again, and we are proud to stand with him to ensure that no family ever has to endure such a tragedy again.""

""Honoring Jocelyn isn't a Republican or Democrat issue — it's an American issue,"" he added.

""Ms. Nungaray loved animals and, given the close proximity of her hometown of Houston, it is fitting that the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge be renamed in her honor,"" the bill's text states. 

Cornyn said he learned of Nungaray's love of nature while getting to know her family.

Nungaray's killing, as well as others involving illegal immigrant suspects, became a flash point during the 2024 presidential election as Trump campaigned on a platform of deporting criminals in the U.S. illegally. Nungaray, who lived in Houston, was kidnapped, sexually assaulted before she was strangled to death and left dead under a bridge in June 2024 by Franklin Pena, 26, and Johan Martinez-Rangel, 22, Harris County prosecutors said.

Responding to a question from the Daily Signal about his timeline and criteria for making future judicial nominations, President Donald Trump said, ""we're putting 'em in rapidly,"" and seeking to ""get very good ones.""

Trump suggested there are ""radicalized"" and ""crazy"" judges who want a trial for each illegal immigrant who enters the U.S.

The nation needs judges who will not demand a trial ""for every single illegal immigrant,"" he indicated. ""We have millions of people that have come in here illegally, and we can't have a trial for every single person, that would be millions of trials.""

President Donald Trump claimed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is afraid of the cartels after she rejected his offer to send U.S. troops to Mexico.

President Donald Trump said Sunday that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected his offer to send U.S. troops to Mexico to help fight against cartels because she is afraid of them.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he floated the idea of sending American troops to deal with the Mexican cartels facilitating drug trafficking, and criticized Sheinbaum for refusing his offer.

""She's so afraid of the cartels she can't walk … And I think she's a lovely woman. The president of Mexico is a lovely woman, but she is so afraid of the cartels that she can't even think straight,"" Trump said.

His reaction came after Sheinbaum confirmed that Trump pressured her in a call last month to allow the U.S. military to play a larger role in tackling drug cartels in Mexico.

Sheinbaum said she told Trump at the time that Mexico would ""never accept"" a U.S. military presence.

""No, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable,"" Sheinbaum claimed to have said. ""We can collaborate.

There has been a larger American military presence at the U.S.-Mexico border after Trump issued an order in January to increase the army's role in slowing the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.

In addition to fighting illegal immigration, Trump said American troops are needed to slow the amount of fentanyl being brought into the U.S. by drug cartels.

""They are bad news,"" Trump said Sunday, referring to the cartels. ""If Mexico wanted help with the cartels, we would be honored to go in and do it. I told her that I would be honored to go in and do it. The cartels are trying to destroy our country. They're evil.""

U.S. Northern Command has deployed troops and equipment to the southern border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and requested expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels.

In February, Trump designated many gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as ""foreign terrorist organizations,"" giving law enforcement more resources to take action against the groups.

House Budget Committee Chair Rep. Jodey Arrington discusses House Republicans working on advancing President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful' budget bill and Democrats claiming the GOP is attempting to make Medicaid cuts.  

Bloated bureaucracy and growing debt are holding back President Donald Trump's economic ""golden age,"" according to one House Republican who is urging lawmakers to have the ""political courage"" to execute Trump's America First agenda and pass a budget reconciliation bill.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" where he was asked about his concerns over out-of-control spending and the rising national debt – a combination that he previously said is ""the greatest threat to our country and our children's future.""

""The question is, will we have the political courage to execute on that and right-size the bloated bureaucracy, as was reflected in the president's budget, and deal with this wartime-level debt, $2 trillion in annual deficit spending that's going to double, and interest payments that exceed not only national defense, but Medicare payments,"" said Arrington, who is chair of the House Budget Committee.

Arrington warned that this would prove to be a ""pivotal"" moment for America.

""The wheels are coming off the wagon,"" he said. ""We can't get to the president's rocket ship economy, we cannot usher in the golden age. In fact, we risk a sovereign debt crisis if we don't deal with the unsustainable deficits and national debt.""

Arrington said that he believed the pro-growth policies in the budget reconciliation bill and a reduction in deficit spending, along with entitlement reform, ""will bend the curve on debt to GDP and deficit to GDP.""

""So if we follow the framework that we laid out in the budget resolution, then we will restore fiscal health,"" he said, though he did not provide specifics on the bill's policies.

GOP FIRES BACK AT DNC'S ‘POLITICAL STUNT' TARGETING ‘VULNERABLE' REPUBLICANS OVER MEDICAID FIGHT

Democrats, however, have accused Republicans of trying to cut costs by slashing Medicaid, affecting America's ""most vulnerable.""

The White House has maintained that public entitlements, including Social Security and Medicaid, will not be cut in the Republicans' budget bill. 

Arrington conceded that the bill alone would not solve America's debt crisis.

""It won't get us out of the debt hole overnight, but it is a good first step and a down payment for our kids to actually be on good fiscal footing, a sustainable path, and enjoy the same opportunities and freedoms that we have,"" the lawmaker said.

President Donald Trump is expected to announce on Monday that Washington, D.C., will host the 2027 NFL draft.

The district last held the NFL draft in 1941, and it was largely held in New York City until the last decade.

Trump will announce the event alongside NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Commanders owner Josh Harris. The event in Washington will come after Pittsburgh holds it in 2026. Detroit and Green Bay held the draft in 2024 and 2025, respectively.

The event usually brings millions of dollars to the region where it is held and generates significant buzz. The draft is expected to be held on the National Mall.

The announcement of the large sports event comes after the Washington Commanders said last week they would be moving back to the district, occupying the abandoned RFK Stadium grounds after a $4.7 billion redevelopment of the area. The stadium isn't set to open until 2030.

Goodell said a new stadium would “dramatically” raise the district's chances of hosting a Super Bowl.

“I didn't come here to announce that, but I would say dramatically,” he said during an event.

 “I really do think this community could be a great host for a Super Bowl. The [new] stadium is always the missing piece,” he said.

WASHINGTON COMMANDERS ANNOUNCE DEAL FOR NEW NFL STADIUM AT RFK SITE 

The Commanders franchise hasn't won a Super Bowl since 1992, though it went to the AFC championship game earlier this year. The Washington area has never hosted a Super Bowl.

A group of young state lawmakers gathered at the White House last week to discuss how to build on the inroads President Donald Trump made with their demographic in the 2024 election.

Twenty-five state lawmakers, ages 25 to 35, traveled from across the country with Run GenZ, sponsored by the American Legislative Exchange Council, to meet with the White House, Defense Department, and House GOP leadership to discuss how to reach younger voters and get their generation involved. 

“Bringing these young leaders to D.C. during this milestone sends a clear message: The next generation isn't waiting its turn. Gen Z is stepping up now. The next generation of conservative leadership doesn't begin in Washington — it begins in the states,” Run GenZ Executive Director Adam Pennings told the Washington Examiner.

“When bold, young people lead at the state level, the national conversation shifts,” he added. “And when young people lead, real change begins — community by community, chamber by chamber, election by election.”

According to a poll by Stay Tuned NBC, Generation Z, both women and men, favor Trump less than the older generations. However, former Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed with young voters in November, with men in particular shifting away from the Democrats.

As more Gen Z lawmakers enter office, Republicans feel they have an opening to keep chipping away at Democrats' traditional dominance with the youth vote.

Kentucky state Rep. T.J. Roberts, a 27-year-old lawyer, outlined to the Washington Examiner the messaging the lawmakers discussed with the White House on how to reach younger voters. 

“​​We discussed the importance of free speech,” he said. “That was one of the first policy platforms that President Trump discussed in Agenda 47. We have a censorship industrial complex that needs to be addressed at every level of government in order to make sure that Americans, by their birthright, have the right to speak their mind.”

“Government efficiency has been a huge thing that people knew was coming,” Roberts added, naming school choice as a state priority and the border at the federal level. “Those were some of those issues that really stuck with me.” 

Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX), 31, was sworn into Congress three months ago, just days before Trump returned to the Oval Office and Republicans started their work with a trifecta in Washington. The Texas lawmaker became the youngest GOP member in the 119th Congress and was also named the Republican freshman class president. 

Many Gen Z lawmakers at the state level look to Gill for guidance on messaging, which makes them feel that the younger generation has a place at the table. 

“I think one thing [the future] looks like is not being hemmed in by political correctness,” Gill told the Washington Examiner. “[Diversity, equity, and inclusion], for instance, we can talk about it is unjust, but this is flagrant anti-white racism, and that's how I have framed it. That's the truth.” 

“You just have to say things in a direct and blunt way that really reveals the truth,” Gill continued.  

A Newsweek analysis of major pollsters since early March shows support from younger voters has fallen off since the 2024 election, with 37% approving and 58% disapproving of his job performance today.

But Republicans believe Trump offered a template that future candidates for office can build upon. Social issues featured prominently in the president's campaign rhetoric, but he also focused heavily on the economy, as voters still felt the effects of inflation under former President Joe Biden.

“While he isn't doing as well with Gen Z, I do think that the president has engaged an entirely new electorate of young voters that were politically apathetic before, that are now actually getting involved in politics because they watched COVID ruin their lives, ruin their prom, ruin their high school graduations or college graduations,” South Dakota state Sen. Amber Hulse told the Washington Examiner. 

Hulse is one of the 25 who traveled to Washington last week. She is the youngest female Republican state senator in South Dakota's history, reaching many young voters on social media. 

“On social media, I think I try to be a lot more relatable, and I share my life,” Hulse said. “I'm just trying to be authentic.”

Hulse, who was Miss South Dakota in 2019 and Miss South Dakota USA 2023, graduated from Georgetown Law. The 26-year-old shares bits and pieces of her life on Instagram while promoting her campaign. She said the White House shared ways to be effective surrogates for the president's agenda as they try to appeal to younger voters.

“They want to see more state and local elected officials promoting, especially our age, promoting President Trump's agenda, probably to push more younger voters to see from our perspective, obviously we're very supportive of the president, and so when you have someone your own age sharing that message of support, it may resonate in a different way than hearing someone who's a 40-year-old white man sharing the same message,” Hulse said. 

Throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump made many appearances on podcasts and media outlets that young voters pay attention to, including Joe Rogan's podcast. 

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) demonstrated Republican interests in these newer formats by inviting conservative podcasters Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh to Trump's joint address.

THE FOUR FACTIONS SPEAKER JOHNSON MUST PLEASE TO PASS TRUMP'S BUDGET MEGABILL

Many Democrats, for their part, have agreed they could take a page out of the GOP book when it comes to utilizing these mediums after Republicans succeeded with their campaign strategy in November. 

“I think we've got to be active on podcasts. We've got to be active in speaking to young voters. We've got to be going to college campuses. We've got to really speak at sporting events, and football games, and get young people where they're at,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.

The Trump administration is seizing record-setting amounts of illegal drugs heading for the United States in the months after President Donald Trump declared a new war on drugs upon taking office in January.

The U.S. Coast Guard, a branch of the military housed under the Department of Homeland Security, has surged more crew and ships to international waters where drug smugglers move narcotics, typically from South America to the U.S. In 100 days, the Coast Guard has tripled its forces operating near the southern border.

In that time, Coast Guard cutters returning to U.S. ports following their deployments are offloading more cocaine than ever. Historical records of $50 million to a few hundred million dollars' worth of cocaine have been smashed in just the past month, which a Coast Guard spokesperson told the Washington Examiner was no coincidence.

“Cocaine seized has increased due to the Coast Guard surging assets to increase operational presence in key areas and protect America's maritime borders, territorial integrity, and sovereignty,” the Coast Guard official wrote in an email. 

In May, the Coast Guard announced $509 million worth of illegal drugs — mostly cocaine — seized from smugglers near Ecuador, Peru, and the Galápagos Islands. The 48,400-pound seizure was composed of more than 90% pure, uncut cocaine, as well as 3,800 pounds of marijuana.

FBI Director Kash Patel attributed the massive seizure to the Trump administration's comprehensive approach of bringing in military forces, DHS personnel, and other entities to take on traffickers outside the country collectively. Smugglers arrested at sea are brought back to the U.S. and prosecuted for federal drug trafficking crimes.

“This is what it looks like when the United States whole-of-government approach brings every resource to bear,” Patel said during the press conference on April 9.

Weeks earlier, the Coast Guard set a record high for cocaine seized at sea. In late March, the Coast Guard announced a $517 million seizure of illicit drugs, mostly cocaine, while deployed off the coast of Mexico, Central America, and South America. During the deployment, the Coast Guard intercepted 14 smuggling boats.

Last week, the crew of another Coast Guard cutter returned to port with more than $214 million worth of cocaine on board.

Catching drugs before they reach the U.S. puts less pressure on customs officers from Customs and Border Protection, another DHS agency, to find them while inspecting all incoming people, goods, and vehicles at the ports of entry.

The Coast Guard's authority starts beyond 12 miles out from the U.S. coast, and it has the authority to patrol international waters, according to Jamie Mortensen of the radar company SpotterRF.

“Coastguards work hard to perform their duties, but are often unable to exert total control over their entire coast and the sea surrounding their nation's borders. It's not like monitoring a road,” Mortensen wrote in a post. “Traveling over open water, errant vessels can sail in at hundreds of different points, from hundreds of different angles.”

To patrol the seas, the Coast Guard relies on CBP's Air and Marine Operations arm. AMO agents fly 10- to 12-hour stints daily over international waters during deployments to Central and South America. They get a bird's-eye view of suspicious boats out at sea and call them in to the Coast Guard, which then moves in and interdicts the boat and crew.

“Their operations are significantly helped, however, by reliable satellite, sonar, and radar surveillance, making them able to detect and track potential threats at long distances and over wide areas of open sea,” Mortensen wrote.

Josh Wallshein, a fellow at the independent Orion Policy Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., explained that cartels use the ocean to move drugs because it is immune from land border checkpoints.

“Cartels use maritime routes in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea because it has less risk and high reward, and it is easy to bypass security measures,” Wallshein wrote in an op-ed. 

Shortly after taking office, Trump clamped down on cross-border drug smuggling, imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico because fentanyl was slipping into the country from both of the U.S.'s neighboring countries. He's cited a “public health crisis and national emergency” regarding drugs to underpin his trade policies on foreign countries.

The Trump administration also declared eight Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and deployed 10,000 troops to the southern border.

The military's U.S. Northern Command, which handles protecting the U.S. and its coastlines, deployed the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely in March to interdict drugs in the Gulf Coast and surrounding areas.

“There's a sea component” to stopping illicit smuggling and immigration, which is “part of the mission of the USS Gravely,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said at the time.

In February and March, CBP personnel who work on the U.S. border seized a total of less than 10,000 pounds of cocaine — a small amount compared to how much was prevented from making it to the border as a result of being intercepted while in transport.

CBP's AMO arm, which works with the Coast Guard, caught 33,000 pounds of cocaine in that same period.

Let's go 🇺🇸….#MondayMotivation pic.twitter.com/LamXDAolgy

Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia — in that order — are most responsible for the thousands of tons of cocaine cultivated annually, according to a 2024 report by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

Globally, cocaine is one of the most sought-after drugs in the world, and its production levels have only increased.

“In 2022, cannabis remained the most used drug world-wide, with an estimated 228 million users in the past year, followed by opioids, with 60 million, amphetamine-type stimulants, with 30 million, and cocaine and ‘ecstasy', with 23 million and 20 million, respectively,” the UNODC concluded.

Drug overdose deaths involving cocaine have risen steadily over the past two decades. In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 6,784 cocaine-related deaths.

TRUMP'S CBP NOMINEE RODNEY SCOTT SAYS HE WILL DELIVER ‘REAL BORDER SECURITY'

The reason for the increase is due to illicit drugmakers mixing fentanyl into cocaine, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

“The number of deaths in combination with fentanyl has increased significantly since 2015 and is the main driver of cocaine-involved overdose deaths,” NIDA wrote in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump floated his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, as an option to be his next national security adviser after he ousted Mike Waltz from the role last week.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump revealed that Miller, a stalwart of his administration who has made frequent, sometimes fiery appearances before the media defending Trump's deportation operations, is “at the top of the totem pole” for the high-profile post.

“I think he sort of indirectly already has that job. Because he has a lot to say about a lot of things. He's a very valued person in the administration, Stephen,” the president said.

Trump also said he will fill the national security adviser role, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio is temporarily serving in, within six months.

That timeline means Rubio will likely be serving in four roles — specifically secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and now national security adviser — for a significant amount of time.

Democrats, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), targeted the administration on Sunday over the amount of work Rubio will now have, suggesting it's not sustainable.

“Especially since there's such incompetence over at DOD, with Pete Hegseth being Secretary of Defense, and just the hollowing out of the top leadership, there's no way he [Rubio] can carry all that entire load on his own,” Duckworth said.

Trump's most recent comments on possible selections for the national security adviser role follow his move to nominate Waltz to U.N. ambassador late last week. This marked the end of a tumultuous few months for Waltz in the national security role that was dominated by Signalgate.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The GOP spending cut fights in Congress are about to become all the more contentious.

Lawmakers face rolling deadlines throughout May to submit so-called earmarks for the annual budget, a popular mechanism that Republicans have a love-hate relationship with but that offers members of Congress a chance to score funding for local projects.

Republicans see them as either a chance to grab a piece of the pie for constituents or a nasty “gateway drug” to wasteful government spending. The answer depends on who you ask.

“If the money's there, we'd rather our state get it than anybody else because it's going to be spent,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), who is weighing a run for governor, told the Washington Examiner. “But I think you're going to see less and less of that over the years with DOGE running around.”

Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Ron Johnson (R-WI), among the more hawkish GOP senators on fiscal matters, derided earmarks as the “gateway drug” to bloated pork barrel spending.

“That's why we're in such deep doo-doo here,” Johnson said.

With a GOP trifecta controlling Congress and the White House, Republicans are in cost-cutting mode, which fiscal conservatives say runs counter to spending items such as earmarks. But GOP leaders say the mechanism is once again up for use in the fiscal 2026 budget that starts Oct. 1 despite slashing $16 billion in earmarks from the 2025 budget in a stopgap funding bill signed into law earlier this year.

Compounding the friction among dueling factions of conservatives are negotiations over crafting a so-called budget reconciliation bill to advance President Donald Trump's economic agenda on taxes, energy, and the border. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is managing friction over the megabill between warring groups within his razor-thin majority, while Senate Republicans draw their own red lines over fiscal discipline and preventing Medicaid cuts.

The official policy of the Senate Republican Conference bans earmarks. In reality, it is widely ignored because it's nonbinding, greenlighting members to submit the very funding requests many vehemently oppose.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is among the anti-earmark senators who vow not to submit any.

“I need to grit my teeth and resist throwing any of my colleagues under the bus,” Lummis told the Washington Examiner. “It's odd that Senate Republicans have a rule against it, and they just ignore the rule. It seems kind of disingenuous to me. I'm not going to ask for any.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), perhaps the Senate's most stringent fiscal hawk, held a “March Earmark Madness Tournament” last year to blast the “most egregious” requests he dubbed the “Shameful 16.”

Trump praised earmarks during his first term and is a wildcard who could significantly influence the process now that Republicans control both chambers, should he choose to weigh in. Congress's use of them in recent decades has varied widely, including former Speakers Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), John Boehner, and Paul Ryan either scaling them back or eliminating them over members facing allegations of political corruption and bribery.

Lawmakers may request funding for nonprofit groups and state and local governments. For-profit companies are ineligible. Members are eventually required to make available on their government office websites the funding requests they submit for the budget. Some lawmakers solicit requests directly from would-be recipients with submission forms on their office websites.

“Earmark” is often viewed in Washington as a dirty word associated with pork barrel spending to fund lawmakers' pet projects. They're known as “community project funding” or “congressionally directed spending.”

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) preferred the phrase “congressionally designated expenditures.” He defended the process as one that takes control from bureaucrats in Washington over how already allocated federal funds will be used and places it with lawmakers or local entities more in tune with specific community needs.

“It's not extra money. It's money that would probably be spent either within the programmatic plan and laid out by a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., as opposed to specifically determined by elected members in their individual states,” Rounds said. “A bureaucrat in Washington may or may not like [an] idea. I think we're better suited than they are to make those determinations on a project-by-project basis.”

Rounds cited some of his previous earmark requests for things in his state, such as road projects for Native American reservations, rebuilding damaged bridges, and improving rural water systems.

More than 8,000 earmarks totaling almost $15 billion were included in the fiscal 2024 budget. Earmark figures, while typically in the billions of dollars, are but a fraction of the nation's annual spending, which is nearly $7 trillion.

TRUMP'S BUDGET CHIEF SHOWS ‘TOTAL' COMMITMENT TO SHRINKING GOVERNMENT

Earmarks are capped at 1% of total discretionary spending, which in 2025 represented the $16 billion that Congress stripped from the $1.6 trillion spending plan.

Trump released his 2026 budget request on Friday that represents a blueprint for congressional appropriators as they craft a final version that lawmakers must eventually pass. His proposal calls for $163 billion in nondefense cuts, or about a 22.6% decrease, to multiple federal programs and offered a window into the president's political priorities for reshaping the federal government.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

As President Donald Trump secures the U.S. border and executes a high-profile deportation operation, the unconventional methods he has employed have been curbed by courts and raised legal concerns.

The Trump administration has used the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to fast-track deportations, which have been stopped by courts, has contracted with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to send suspected terrorists to a megaprison, and has even arrested a Wisconsin judge who tried to help an illegal immigrant avoid ICE detention.

DEMOCRATS TO REVIVE ABREGO GARCIA SPOTLIGHT WITH SENATE TRANSPARENCY VOTE

As Democrats and the American Civil Liberties Union have raced to the courts to stop deportations and demand due process for illegal immigrants, public interest in civil liberty protections has increased and given some Republicans pause.

“Do they have to be careful not to deport the wrong people or make sure everybody has their day in court? Sure! That's kind of what the court has said,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said. “The court hadn't really completely stopped this. The court has kind of said, you know, these people need their due process.”

The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order shielding him from returning to his home country, has thrust the issue into the national spotlight, becoming a flashpoint in the broader clash over immigration enforcement and judicial power.

Some Republican lawmakers concede, both publicly and privately, that the Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland is entitled to due process. Still, they are wary of provoking a direct clash with the White House.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who is up for reelection next year, expressed concern over the lack of fair legal procedures in the case, noting that while the administration first acknowledged an error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvadar in violation of a court order, it has since appeared to reverse its position.

“To me, we have a federal judge that found that there was not due process, and that is very troubling to me,” Collins told reporters. “Initially, the administration said that a mistake was made. They seemed to have backed off that.”

“That's why you have due process, to find out what the facts are,” she added.

Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally in 2012 and is subject to deportation, though an immigration judge in 2019 granted a withholding of his removal to his home country of El Salvador due to fear of persecution.

Trump's team accuses Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, and his wife has filed for protective orders against him on the grounds of domestic violence, though he was never charged.

Federal judges have sharply criticized the Trump administration's handling of Abrego Garcia's deportation. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis described the deportation as “wholly lawless” and accused the administration of a “willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.” 

Additionally, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit condemned the government's inaction, stating that officials are not permitted “to do essentially nothing” in facilitating Abrego Garcia's return, emphasizing that due process must be upheld regardless of allegations.

Trump's comments in response to court rulings have also fueled the concerns, as Democrats have argued the United States is on the brink of a constitutional crisis.

When he was asked in an interview that aired Sunday on whether citizens and noncitizens are entitled to due process, Trump said, “I don't know.” 

Pressed by NBC's Meet the Press about whether the president should uphold the protections of the Fifth Amendment, Trump said, “I don't know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”

Paul, the senator from Kentucky, emphasized that the Constitution guarantees due process rights to everyone living in the U.S., regardless of status. However, he sidestepped questions about whether Abrego Garcia was afforded those protections.

“I'm all for due process. I'm all for the Constitution applies to everybody. But I'm not sure I can give you an answer,” Paul said, explaining he didn't have enough information to conclude whether Abrego Garcia was denied due process.

Paul pointed out that the Trump administration maintains Abrego Garcia has already gone through two legal proceedings and would face deportation again if he reentered the U.S. from El Salvador.

“I can tell you that, by and large, I think the public is supportive of removing people who are criminals and are violent in our country,” Paul added.

New polling appears to show a growing unease with perceived executive overreach and erosion of constitutional rights. A YouGov survey in April found that nearly half of Americans believe everyone in the country, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to due process.

YouGov's tracker of the issues that people care about the most shows a sharp increase in “civil rights and civil liberties” since Trump returned to office, with 16% of registered voter respondents saying it's the most important issue, second only to inflation and prices at 20.7%. Meanwhile, immigration dropped to 7.6%.

In the latest survey, 90% of respondents said “civil liberties and civil rights” are important, including 60% who said very important. At the start of Trump's term, 88% said it was important, and 54% said it was very important.

Separate polls by AP-NORC and the Washington Post also reveal that majorities of Americans think the federal government is overstepping its authority, with many worried about threats to free speech, press freedoms, and legal protections. 

Recent polling has raised alarm among some Republican lawmakers, who are increasingly uneasy about the administration's escalating clashes with the judiciary, although they are hesitant to speak up about it publicly.

“I think this should be a sign that the administration should proceed with caution moving forward. We've seen it is not popular with some voters, even though it is with some of our base,” said an adviser to a GOP senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 

The adviser pointed to the number of border crossings, which has plummeted in recent months to just 7,200, recorded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in March, making the case that Trump should focus on the economy.

“The president has done his job with shutting down the border. The numbers are remarkable. Now it's time for him to turn his focus on the issues that the voters want him to tackle, like improving the economy,” the person said. 

Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), have called on Trump to recognize the judiciary's equal standing under the Constitution and to comply with its decisions. 

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said many people support the president's tough immigration stance because they see it as a way to stay safe but that they also expect him to follow legal boundaries and respect whatever the courts decide.

“Here's what I believe the perception is right now. No. 1, they want America to be safe. They think that the president is protecting them by getting folks that should not have been here in the first place out of the country, and so they're willing to give him leeway on that,” Rounds said, speaking to the Washington Examiner. 

“The second part is they want him to do it according to the law. And if there is a question in the law, we have to determine what the law is. The courts will make that determination. I fully expect that the president will adhere to what the court decisions are,” he added.

The majority of congressional Republicans are brushing off the polls and portraying Democrats' support for Abrego Garcia as proof that they prioritize the rights of illegal immigrants over the safety of U.S. citizens.

“I have yet to run into a person, I'm sure they exist in my district, who thinks that an MS-13 gang member should actually come back to Maryland,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD) said. “He is an MS-13 gang member. MS-13 is a foreign terrorist organization. Therefore, he has no right; he has no immigration rights at all.”

Harris said the reason the threat of immigration has dropped in concern is that Trump fixed the problem.

“America is not worried about [immigration] anymore, because the president did exactly what he did,” Harris said. “He shut down the border.”

GOP strategist Dennis Lennox argued that Republicans won't be punished for backing tough deportation policies but could face political backlash if they fail to deliver on Trump's agenda.

“No Republican is going to lose a midterm election on deporting gangbangers,” Lennox said. “They will lose the election if Republicans on Capitol Hill don't start passing what President Trump and Republicans ran on last year.”

Late last week, federal agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of obstructing justice after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant exit her courtroom through a side door to avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement. FBI Director Kash Patel drew attention to the arrest by posting a photo of Dugan in handcuffs.

Republican lawmakers argue the judge may have obstructed an immigration enforcement effort and possibly violated the law, but some admitted the image of federal agents arresting a local judge was unsettling.

“I'm not sure why they did it the way that they did it,” Rounds said. “But if she was in violation of a federal law, then she is subject to arrest like anyone else.”

TRUMP 100-DAY REPORT CARD: TARIFF ROLLOUT ‘THE BIGGEST UNFORCED ERROR IN AMERICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY'

Senate Democrats are seizing on recent polls to claim the political tide is turning, arguing the data show their message is resonating — and that the public is increasingly rejecting Trump's agenda.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) argued that voters are strongly invested in defending the country's democratic values.

“When you look at the polling data, Americans care deeply about this issue,” he said. “Americans' foundation and love of democracy is deep, and they understand that Trump is violating that due process when you take people without any due process, without any acknowledgement and publication of what they did wrong, and refuse to allow it to go to a court with an impartial judge and let the public hear it. You are trampling on what America is all about, and the American people realize it.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) said he's had numerous conversations with GOP colleagues who have voiced concerns privately about due process protections.

“I have had conversations with GOP colleagues who have expressed real misgivings about Donald Trump's violation of constitutional due process rights — I've heard that from a number of Republican senators,” said Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to visit Abrego Garcia. 

“The public overwhelmingly supports making sure we protect due process rights for people who reside in America. That is very clear from the response that we're seeing in these public surveys,” he added.

Why would the World Health Organization want to call “old age” a disease?

In 2021 Dr. Kiran Rabheru, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Ottawa and a geriatric psychiatrist, found himself at the center of a medical debate. The World Health Organization wanted to officially designate “old age” as a disease, but with more than 40 years of work with aging populations, Rabheru saw this as another example of ageism that needed to be challenged. Dr. Rabheru talks with Yasmin Tayag about how he fought the WHO and about the impact such designations can have on research and our understanding of growing old.

The following is a transcript:

[Phone ringing.]

Natalie Brennan: I'm Natalie Brennan, producer at The Atlantic.

Yasmin Tayag: And I'm Yasmin Tayag, a staff writer with The Atlantic.

Brennan: You've reached How to Age Up. Leave us a voicemail after the beep.

[Beep.]

Jennifer Motiff: Hi. I am 60 years old.

Toscan Lahy: Most people think I'm 45, 50, but I'm actually going to be 63.

Marla Mclean: And I am 60-wonderful years old. That's 61.

Brennan: Yasmin, over the last few weeks, we've been asking people to call in and tell us their age and about some of their experiences of aging.

Myron Murray: I'm 75 years old. Thank God I'm Italian, and I don't wrinkle, so I don't look my age. I feel 20.

Susan Brown: My age is almost 80, so I am actually aged, not aging.

Doug Rutholm: I'm 88 years young. I'm only 88, and I'm married to a younger woman: only 85. So one of our secrets is youthing. We're not aging, we are youthing. And we eat well, we exercise, and looking forward to getting older. But we're getting younger. So that's it. Bye-bye.

Tayag: Youthing! I like the sound of that!

Brennan: Not wrinkling because I'm Italian … I like the sound of that! But as I was moving through the collection of voicemails, I noticed a pattern. We also received a lot of callers sharing very similar anxieties about the unknowns of what could lie ahead …

Gary Schuberth: And what aspects of aging am I nervous about? Living to a very old age, and not being very healthy.

Jes Chmielewski: I am nervous about feeling older. Just all the aches and pains and failures of organs and body parts.

Jennifer Moffat: The things that make me nervous about aging are just physical breakdown, like, I don't want to break a bone. I don't want to get cancer.

Stella K.: I'm really afraid of getting dementia. I mean, it just seems like a terrifying thing, and the older I get, the more afraid of it I am.

Brennan: And Yasmin, you know, we asked about aging, and we heard a lot about disease and decline.

Tayag: Yeah. I mean, I'm not totally surprised to hear that people are worried about getting sick as they age. I mean—I do think culturally we conflate aging and disease. It actually made its way to the center of a debate in the medical field. A few years ago, the World Health Organization tried to connect aging and disease more officially.

Brennan: How so?

Tayag: Well, they proposed defining aging itself as a disease.

Brennan: To make aging a disease?

Tayag: A classified disease. In the ICD—The International Classification of Diseases.

Brennan: What benefit would that have?

Tayag: Well, the idea is that if old age is officially considered a disease, then drugs can be developed to treat it … the way we have drugs to treat diseases like diabetes and cancer. So a lot of it comes down to funding.

Brennan: But how do you treat old age? Aging is … time passing. How do you stop that?

Tayag: You make a good point! And these kinds of details are exactly what I wanted to know more about.

Kiran Rabheru: We don't have a good clear definition of old age. And that is still up for debate. What is old age?

[Music.]

Tayag: Natalie, that's Dr. Kiran Rabheru—he's a professor of psychiatry at the University of Ottawa and a geriatric psychiatrist. He's been focused on aging populations for over 40 years. And he spearheaded the team that challenged the World Health Organization when it wanted to officially designate “old age” in the ICD. But before we get to that, it can help to know more about Dr. Rabheru and why he's so interested in aging populations.

Rabheru: That's an easy one: my grandmother.

Tayag: Oh! Tell me more!

Rabheru: [Chuckling.] My parents were, they were around, but they were busy: setting up a business and so on. And when I was growing up, my grandmother was the main sort of person in my life. She had a huge amount of influence on me. She was not educated. She couldn't even write her own name. But she was, in my opinion, totally biased, probably the wisest and smartest person I've ever met in my life. And every time I see an older person, I see a bit of her in them.

Tayag: That is lovely. So how did that shape your view of older people? You had, what sounds like, the privilege of getting to know a grandmother. But that hasn't always been common, right?

Rabheru: So aging, historically: If you go back a century or two, if you look at the numbers, if you were walking on the streets in the year 1800, most people would not have been old. You would hardly see an older person. Most people died by the time they got to the age of 30.

Tayag: Yikes; I would have been long gone.

Rabheru: If you fast-forward a hundred years, if you were walking around the streets in 1900, most people would be no more than 40. So there's a difference of 10 years in that 100-year span. But if you fast-forward another hundred years, in the year 2000, that number went from 40 to 70. So now, even across the lower- and middle-income countries, most people live to old age. So, on one hand, we've increased the lifespan of people. But on the other hand, we have devalued that population.

Rabheru: And therein lies the crux of the matter that we're talking about, and that is the way people think and feel and behave or act towards the whole aging population.

Tayag: So it sounds like there have been some big, positive improvements for aging, but that may have led to an increase in the disparaging thinking we call ageism.

Rabheru: It's very subtle, and it's largely unconscious,  and it's institutionalized. It's part of our policies and laws, and it's part of our processes. It's structures, in every sector, and that's embedded as an unconscious bias.

Tayag: Sure.

Rabheru: The COVID-19 pandemic really shone a light on the gaps we have in our system, particularly towards older people. And ageism became so much more rampant. The future is not about young versus old. Although our government sometimes tries to pit the old against the young. But it's about designing a society where everyone, at every age, can live together with dignity and purpose and opportunity.

Tayag: One thing that I think makes those conversations difficult is that we don't have agreed-upon language to talk about age, and our society's perspective on aging seems to reflect that. Like, to me, our conception of age seems very rudimentary. Old and young are relative terms. I understand that one of the attempts to assign a definition to old age came when the World Health Organization wanted to classify it as a disease in the ICD. Can you explain what that actually means, and the implications for how we think about age and illness?

Rabheru: Oh, Yasmin, absolutely. I used to teach the course on classification diseases, and classification is really important. It's not perfect. We have to adapt it as societal values change and our thinking changes, and we gather more data. Biologically, the environment changes, and we need to change the classification system to match it, right? The ICD is not published every year. It's published every 10–15 years apart. So, once it's in there, it can change a whole generation of people going through the treatment and through the hospital or clinical system.

Tayag: You know, I'm thinking, for example, of alcohol-use disorder. You know, it used to be seen as this moral failing, a failing of willpower. And then it was classified as a disease, and that seemed to change some of the cultural thinking around it. So that's an example of defining a disease that really helped the culture find more empathy—and also more investment in the recovery and success of many people. Could you give me an example of a condition that, you know, went through the process of being considered and classified as a disease but is no longer considered to be one?

Rabheru: You know, we've gone through “diseases” like homosexuality—classified as a disease. And think about the stigma associated with those terms. We don't use them anymore. And words matter; it tells people what value you place on that human being.

Tayag:  It's so obvious to me that these official classifications matter. You know, it makes me think of the legalization of marijuana in Canada. where I grew up. My parents were always super strongly opposed to it. But ever since it was legalized, I've noticed their tone softening a little. It's not like they've gone and flipped and started using it, but now they talk about it as a thing that some people do, and that's okay. And it's been fascinating to watch that shift just because there is some sort of, like, binding declaration of this being legitimate.

Rabheru: Exactly.

Tayag: So I want to talk about disease classification specifically in relation to aging. In December 2021 you found yourself in the middle of some very high-stakes deliberation. Set the scene for me.

Rabheru: It was the most fascinating experience, I've got to tell you, Yasmin. As part of my work, I've worked with a lot of people, across the world, that lead different organizations in aging. And it came to our attention that the WHO was updating the International Classification of Diseases, the ICD. And part of the changes that they were proposing was to include “old age” as a disease.

Tayag: Wow; just old age.

Rabheru: Just old age, quote, unquote, as a disease. And, you know, look: The WHO is highly respectable. but it's an unconscious bias. And this is an example of ageism within WHO. Now, in March of 2021, the same organization put out the global report on ageism. To combat ageism.

Tayag: It seems a little hypocritical.

Rabheru: In the same organization. Yeah. So we wrote; we got together and we organized a campaign. There were like eight or 10 different organizations that all wrote to the WHO, and collectively we represented millions of people across the world. Our team and the people that I work with immediately thought: Aging is a privilege. That's not the disease. And you know, look. As a clinician, I know that it's not always easy. The older people are much more challenging to see and treat because of the multiple medical and psychosocial conditions they have. Having a diagnosis of “old age” would automatically just lead people to put them into that category, that “This person's just old”—and they move on to something that's easier to deal with.

Tayag: Well, one of the big questions that the proposal to call aging a disease brought up for me was: Where do you draw the line? Where does aging start?

Rabheru: It's not the age. Like, Yasmin, if you have a car accident and you can't walk tomorrow because of a spinal-cord injury, you would have the same level of intrinsic capacity as someone who's had a stroke at the age of 80. So the number, chronologically, is—not that it's not important; it is a risk factor, of course. Every organ ages over time. So it is definitely part of the risk factor, of course, but it's not the main driver of functional capacity.

Tayag: And so what happened next after you wrote to the WHO?

Rabheru:  They did, in fact, give us, four hours of their time. It was Thanksgiving Day!

Tayag: Thanksgiving Day?

Rabheru:  And we went through it in a systematic, scientific way. And we explained we understand what they're trying to do, and they want to go after the biological aspects of aging—which absolutely we need to do! There's no question. There is a lot of pathology that we can reduce the risk of, etcetera. But to call old age a disease is not going to play well in society.

Tayag: Okay; so sounds like it was a worthwhile way to spend your Thanksgiving that year.

Rabheru: Totally, 100 percent.

Tayag: So how did it turn out?

Rabheru: They came back to us a few weeks later saying they've met several times, and they've decided to change it. We were very happily shocked that they rescinded it. And that was the right thing to do. We were very pleased. Aging is universal and should not be pathologized. And it's time to reframe aging in a more positive way.

[Music.]

Brennan: Okay, Yasmin, I want to work through some of this tension I'm feeling.

Yasmin: I can see the wheels turning.

Brennan: I'm having a hard time. Because hearing Dr. Rabheru talking about challenging the WHO—it does sound like a win for how health professionals and society in general think about older people. And, as we know, this perception has tangible effects on the care and treatment that people receive. So that's a win!

Tayag: Yeah.

Brennan: But I'm still trying to work out if treating aging is a worthwhile pursuit or not. On the one hand, I'm like, Okay, if we think about aging as time. And time has a physical effect on our cells—building up damage, getting worn out. I could understand a world where we are working to heal or repair that damage, and if we were able to do that, I am guessing it would relieve some of the anxiety that we heard in so many of the voicemails we received. But at the same time, I'm like, What does treating aging even look like? 

Tayag: Well, there are existing drugs that are being repurposed to maybe slow aging.

Brennan: Okay, so what does that mean?

Tayag: Metformin is used for diabetes. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant. And researchers are trying to determine if those or other existing drugs could slow the passage of time for cells, or clear out old cells, or the molecular junk that time leaves behind.

Brennan: I have Timothy Caulfield in my ear from Episode 1 telling me to assume nothing works! I'm skeptical about the ability to achieve these things. And I'm just immediately wondering if something else is going on here.

Tayag: I mean—a lot of this does come down to money. There's a hope that there will be more investment in research on slowing aging. Which, in turn, will save money in the long run, because if people get sick less often as they age, it will bring down the costs of health care.

Brennan: Hmm.

Tayag: So that's one argument for exploring it. There was a report in 2021 from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission showing that much older people tend to be the most costly to the government, health care–wise.

Brennan: Right. I guess what I am trying to understand is: Although aging is not a disease in and of itself, and it should not be classified as such, it is associated with disease, right? And we could work harder to address the concerns that people have when it comes to aging.

Tayag: Exactly. So aging is a risk factor for disease. But aging itself isn't a disease. This was something I was really trying to work out, too, when I was talking with Dr. Rabheru.

[Music.]

Rabheru: It's a risk factor. Aging is a risk factor—in fact, the strongest risk factor—for cognitive impairment or dementia, barring, you know, all other illnesses. So, if you have a stroke or a genetic predisposition, that's different. But if you're healthy and you're getting older, the biggest risk factor is aging. One in three people by the time you're 80 will have some form of dementia, regardless of any other conditions. And the biology of that should be explored to mitigate it.

Tayag: Being a science journalist, I'm always looking at new research going on. And it does seem like there is continuing research that still treats aging like a disease, even though the World Health Organization decided not to classify it that way. One thing I saw recently was an effort to delay or stop menopause altogether, which is complicated, right? Because, on the one hand, the symptoms of menopause can be really tough to deal with. And not to mention, the way that postmenopausal people are treated in society. And so I can understand why there's a desire to delay menopause or stop it altogether.

Rabheru: Mmhmm.

Tayag: But, on the other hand, menopause is a part of aging. It's just a normal life stage.

Rabheru: Exactly.

Tayag: And it's in these sorts of questions that I'm not really sure where to fall.

Rabheru: The solution depends on what your agenda is; like, where you put your values. So for example—if your values are coming from the financing side of things, the aging industry, the anti-aging industry, is huge.

Tayag: Oh yeah, I have been victim to a lot of face creams.

Rabheru: There might be things that you can do from a scientific point of view, from a medical point of view, to make the person's life better. But to completely alter the course of a human being: Just because you can doesn't mean you should, right? We don't really understand the medium- and long-term implications of doing some of those things. And the science is advancing so quickly with AI and with technology, but the long-term ramifications of what it does to humans and our society are not well studied.

Tayag: Okay, so we don't know if reversing or stopping aging is even going to work, and you're saying it's something that maybe we shouldn't pursue. Yet we still have this problem of people assuming that old age means they will get sick. But, you know, I think a lot about my grandfather-in-law. He's 96 years old and walks two miles every other day!

Rabheru: Good for him.

Tayag: He's my hero. He's awesome. And so, he's definitely old in numbers, but I would never think of him as unhealthy. Nobody would.

Rabheru: Or worth less!

Tayag: Or worthless, exactly.

Rabheru:  The older population is growing. We have, you know, we're going to—we'll have billions of people by the year 2050 who are older. And that's a resource; that's not a burden. If we keep them safe and healthy and happy, they can provide support for the world.

[Music.]

Brennan: Okay, Yas, I have to admit when I hear those statistics about risk for diseases as you age. I do pretty immediately tense up. Disease does still sound so inevitable to aging.

Tayag: I hear you. I mean when I think about my family's heart-health trajectory, I feel like it's inevitable that I'm going to get all the same diseases as my parents as I get older.

Brennan: Oh my god, I hope my dad isn't listening right now, because I had slightly high cholesterol this year, and I couldn't bear to tell him after years of me pestering him about this. [Laughter.] Here I am on my little lentil-and-sweet-potato high horse, and I still had slightly high cholesterol. Meaning the same genes that came for his heart might just come for mine.

Tayag: You know, I have been on this same spiral lately!

Brennan: Yeah.

Tayag: But have you heard of the concept of healthspan?

Brennan: I have not.

Tayag: It's what comes to mind when I think about my grandfather-in-law. And all the other older people who called in telling us how they're thriving and living their best lives. Healthspan is the idea of extending the period that a person is healthy. And that's different from lifespan, which is about how long you actually live.

Brennan: Okay so, instead of trying to live longer, until 105, it's about making it longer in your life without disease?

Tayag: Exactly. Just like: staying healthy for as much of your life as possible, no matter how long you live. Which is the case for a lot of older people.

Brennan: Okay—how do we do that? How do we extend healthspan?

Tayag: So we don't know how to guarantee an extended lifespan yet. But we do know how to increase healthspan: Eat well, exercise, sleep a lot, connect with people. It's all the stuff we've been talking about this season.

Brennan: And did Dr. Rabheru have any more advice, too?

Tayag: Well I thought you might ask. So I asked Dr. Rabheru what his advice to his patients is.

Rabheru: So for many, many years, I have given the same prescription to every single patient I see.

Tayag: That's after the break.

[Music.]

[Midroll.]

Tayag: Dr. Rabheru, I have one last question for you. As a person who is aging yourself, like all of us are, what is one piece of advice you think we could all benefit from?

Rabheru: Well, I'll tell you—so, for many, many years, I have given the same prescription to every single patient I see. When you leave my office or clinic or hospital, when you go home, here's my prescription for you. It's the rule of 20s. So: I need you to give at least 20 smiles a day. Okay? Because as soon as you're smiling, it changes the way your brain works. Second is to do 20 minutes of activity of some sort; and I usually say walking, because physical activity is really important for health, right? But try and get 20 minutes of walking. And thirdly: Socialize for 20 minutes a day. And not just with the person you're living with; that's fine too, but try and do something outside of yourself. So, those are three basic things you can do, and then all the treatment I give you will be much more effective.

Tayag: I love it; the 20 rule. I'm going to do this today. It seems easy enough. I'm smiling a lot after this conversation, and so I smiled a lot. I've talked to you for way more than 20 minutes, and I guess I just have to go on a walk later. Dr. Rabheru, thank you so much.

Rabheru: Likewise, Yasmin; thank you.

[Music.]

Brennan: Yasmin, I do think that a really important part of this conversation is making sure we highlight the aspects of aging that people are excited about. When we asked listeners for those voicemails, we didn't just ask what people were nervous about as they aged.

Sue: What are you looking forward to? Well, the biggest thing is no more shoulds. I'm tired of shoulds. You should do this. You should do that. I don't care about shoulds anymore, and the freedom of doing what I want when I want to.

John Shuey: What are you looking forward to as you age? Well. Staying mobile and fit and able to get around. And I really do get around. I, despite my age, I can shovel snow for two hours. I ride bikes 35 miles at a time. I just, I basically feel like I'm 40. Is there someone in your life who has made you excited to get older? And yeah. It's this girl from high school. I married her, and we have a great time together.

Lynn Clark: I wanted to leave this message for all the women who are nervous about aging. At age 30 I started my own business. I've raised two children and was widowed by age 59. At age 60, I started weight-resistance training and cycling. I am slowly backing out of my company towards full retirement. I moved part-time to another state, something I wouldn't have dreamed of when I was younger.

Susan Anthony: I do stand-up comedy. I do all sorts of weird and wonderful new sports, whatever really takes my fancy. And I kind of enjoy that, and I can just, like, head off in whatever direction I feel like. And all of it is about just that desire to continue to grow. The next question you had was: Who do you hope to be like when you are older? That phrase that I think Clint Eastwood is known for—“Don't let the old man in”—and I think that's really where the secret lies. I see so many people who just let the old person in, and I don't want to do that. And so I admire anyone who really doesn't allow that to happen.

Tayag: Don't let the old man in.

Brennan: Or, maybe better: Change your idea of what the old man is like!

Tayag: Right. My dad is on a 70+ senior basketball team, and I like the old man they let in. Like, they are just always looking forward to the next game, the next tournament, and just getting to hang out. And they're still so excited for what's to come.

Brennan: Yeah, I think for me it's like: healthspan, lifespan … I want to extend my curiosity-span.

Tayag: Zest-span.

Brennan: Joie de vivre–span.

Tayag: Exactement. Looking forward–span.

[Beep.]

Myron Murray: I want to see 'em land on Mars. I want to see 'em land and live on the moon. I want to see all the new things that are gonna come and we're going to get to see.

I don't know what's happening, but I'm stocking up on ibuprofen.

In February 2020, my husband was away for a few weeks, and I was home writing stories, taking care of our old dogs and infant son. The economy was great; the health system stable; the novel coronavirus an ocean away. Still, many days, when the baby woke up before dawn, I'd take him to a 24-hour grocery store or pharmacy and stock up on paper towels, formula, pasta, dog food, and liquid ibuprofen. I started listening to the evening news while making dinner, and subscribing to doctors' social-media feeds. I was preparing, even if I did not know what I was preparing for.

This month has felt similarly ominous. The economy is fine, according to many of the headline numbers; households are spending; prices are stable; car lots are full; shelves are stocked. But the other day I found myself buying my kids shoes to grow into. I left some cash in my checking account rather than moving it into my savings fund. I was going to purchase hydrangeas and planters and decided against it. Perhaps less relatably, I keep checking a live map of container ships and webcams of West Coast ports, to watch the trade war, live and in action.

A tariff-induced recession is here and not here, visible and invisible—about to happen or already happening. The economy is in a state of imminence. And we should be preparing, even if we are not sure what we are preparing for.

Annie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun

Last week's economic-data releases reflect this queasy sense of change. The economy contracted at a 0.3 percent annual rate from January to March, the Commerce Department determined, having grown at a 2.4 percent annual rate the quarter before. The data suggest that the Trump slump has started, but it's complicated. The sharp drop in GDP is in part a statistical artifact, a reflection of giant changes businesses made in anticipation of the White House's trade policies. “Core GDP,” a measure of growth that cuts out volatile inventory and trade figures, remained stable in the first quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, kept chugging along, softening just a bit.

But companies rushed to buy big-ticket items before “Liberation Day,” on April 2. Firms padded their inventories, filling up warehouses and locking in input prices. Imports skyrocketed, climbing at a 41 percent annual pace. The jump in investment and inventories pushed up GDP by nearly four percentage points; the surge in imports pulled it down by five percentage points, enough to leave the quarter in the red.

Partisans of President Donald Trump cheered the report. “When you strip out inventories and the negative effects of the surge in imports because of the tariffs, you have 3 percent growth,” the trade adviser Peter Navarro said on CNBC. “That's the best negative print I have ever seen in my life.” Maybe Navarro believes that, but there was nothing great happening in the first quarter. The yet-to-be-announced tariffs distorted business practices, affecting hundreds of billions of dollars of output. They did not improve the underlying economy.

Now that the tariffs—145 percent on goods from China, 10 percent on goods from other countries—are in place, they are damaging the economy, even if a recession is not yet evident in the country's quarterly GDP and monthly unemployment reports. The White House has gotten nowhere in negotiations with other governments. Weekly jobless claims are rising. Layoffs are spiking. Consumer confidence is tanking. Businesses are flummoxed, and putting off plans for expansion. Prices are starting to rise; economists expect the average family to pay $4,900 a year more for items at the grocery store and from online retailers thanks to trade restrictions.

Something stranger than a recession is brewing too. Fewer container ships are leaving Shanghai and Shenzhen. Fewer container ships are docking in Seattle, Tacoma, Los Angeles, and Oakland. The West Coast longshore union is warning of mass layoffs, given the decline in import volume. A link in the supply chain has broken, and I expect others to crack soon: freight haulers, trucking companies, last-mile contractors, delivery drivers.

Read: What would be worse than a recession?

A supply shock is beginning to ripple across the nation. In the coming months, consumers worried about looming shortages and rising inflation are likely to make panic orders and hoard household goods. Businesses worried about empty shelves are likely to restrict purchases. Even Americans who pay little attention to the news will notice their neighbors stocking up, and start to do the same. Companies are likely to capitalize on the chaos, hiking prices even if they are unaffected by tariffs. Costs will go up, perhaps by a lot. Shortages seem likely, though I am not sure what goods will end up affected.

As inflation climbs, the economy is going to slow down. The Trump administration and Republican Congress are seeking to slash government spending. At the same time, businesses will decline to hire new workers; existing employees will cling to their jobs. That alone will be enough to push up the unemployment rate. Perhaps by the time the economy is in a formal recession, the Trump administration will have signed a few trade deals. Still, as the coronavirus pandemic taught us, supply chains take years to repair once disrupted. Inflation tends to take a long time to return to normal once elevated.

This is not February 2020. Whatever is happening will be less deadly than a pandemic, less damaging, less frightening, and less long-lasting, I hope. Still, it is a polycrisis: globe-encompassing and hard to understand. I don't know what to do. I might pick up some dog food and ibuprofen this weekend.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If the Trump administration wants more babies, it needs to embrace a different kind of parent.

American households don't look like they used to. They've been changing for decades, in part because fewer people have been having kids—but also because different people have been having kids. More unmarried couples have been starting families. More single people have been parenting on their own. Some are even raising children with their friends. According to a report from Pew Research Center, in 1970, 67 percent of Americans aged 25 to 49 lived with a spouse and at least one child; by 2023, that number had plummeted to 37 percent. That's a profound shift: Most adults in this age group, over the course of roughly 50 years, went from being married with children to not. What some refer to as the “traditional” family is no longer a majority.

Pronatalists across the political spectrum argue that the first trend, dropping birth rates, poses an urgent, existential threat: Fewer children born could eventually mean fewer working people to support the economy, pay taxes, and care for the elderly. Some of these pronatalists have the ear of Donald Trump, who, according to The New York Times, is weighing policies intended to nudge people toward childbirth. Vice President J. D. Vance and DOGE chief Elon Musk are both enthusiastic pronatalists. But the administration also wants to promote marriage—most likely a certain kind of marriage. Project 2025, a set of policy suggestions that have been called a road map for Trump's second term, is very clear about who should be encouraged to have children. “Married men and women,” it decrees, “are the ideal, natural family structure.”

A pronatalist policy that defines family so narrowly—acknowledging only a type of household that most Americans don't fit into—wouldn't just be a moral mistake; it would also be a strategic one. The United States is full of people yearning for children, but who are struggling to find a partner, or to pay for IVF, or to afford caring for kids beyond those they already have.

Not everyone agrees that more babies are necessary to sustain a society: Some argue that governments can find other ways to invest in the economy, fund social services, and support older adults. But if raising fertility rates is the goal, Trump's team should be embracing the many kinds of families that already exist—and lowering barriers for all the people hoping to start new ones.

Not every pronatalist is the same. Some advocate for using technology—AI-assisted in vitro fertilization, genetic engineering, artificial wombs—to “optimize” humanity and stave off what they see as a potentially apocalyptic demographic collapse. (If the birth rate doesn't spike soon, Musk has said, “civilization will disappear.”) Others make a progressive case for pronatalism: spurring childbirth by prioritizing aid to working families, thus smoothing the way for women to have as many kids as they'd like. (If such a model “helps women manifest the lives they imagine for themselves,” Elizabeth Bruenig recently wrote in The Atlantic, it's “arguably feminist.”) Many pronatalists want a return to bygone family norms: stay-at-home moms having lots of kids. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, which advocates for “familial, in-home childcare,” fits into this bucket.

The White House may not follow Project 2025's family plan to a T. The policies it's considered so far, according to the Times, run the gamut from sensible if insufficient (a $5,000 “baby bonus” for every new American mother) to somewhat strange (a plan to help women understand when they're ovulating—as if low fertility rates are caused largely by people who are trying to conceive but just haven't figured this out).

Read: Grandparents are reaching their limit

Still, the administration hasn't exactly been shy about how it defines family. “I want more happy children in our country, and I want beautiful young men and women who are eager to welcome them into the world,” Vance declared at this year's March for Life anti-abortion rally. And the White House evidently wants its straight couples betrothed. Research shows, though, that efforts to boost marriage or birth rates don't actually need to be lumped together—though research generally shows that children fare better across several metrics when raised in two-parent households.

Typically, marriage-incentive programs encourage unmarried couples to wed based on the idea that marriage will make them more likely to pool incomes, create stability, and raise kids in a two-parent household—a setup generally associated with better educational and workforce outcomes for children. But marriage itself hardly guarantees those successes, Christina Cross, a Harvard University sociologist and the author of the forthcoming book Inherited Inequality, told me.

Families often benefit from two parents working as a team; it's just not a magical fix-all. The people most likely to marry are affluent, educated, white or Asian, and straight. Cross's research indicates that what's influential for kids is not just the resources that tend to accompany marriage, but also the resources that people who end up marrying already tend to possess. When Cross studied Black, low-income families, she found that even when children were raised in two-parent homes, they did not end up with the same resources, educational achievements, or prospects in the labor market as children from more affluent families. The benefits of the two-parent structure, she said, “are just not universal.” And of course, anyone raised by two miserably married, constantly arguing parents might tell you the same thing.

Read: The slow, quiet demise of American romance

At least half a century of research supports the idea that a household arrangement itself isn't what makes a kid happy and healthy. Susan Golombok, a University of Cambridge psychologist and the author of We Are Family: The Modern Transformation of Parents and Children, has for decades studied nontraditional families: gay couples who adopt, gay couples who rely on IVF and surrogacy, single parents by choice. Again and again, she and other researchers have found that what counts more for kids is two things: the quality of their relationships with family members, and whether they're accepted by the outside world. Golombok has even found that parents in nonconventional family structures tend to be more involved than straight, married parents on average, probably because they are more likely to have deliberately chosen parenthood. Gay couples and single parents by choice have to be intentional, to overcome obstacles. “These were really wanted children,” she told me. Now she's seeing many politicians and commentators blatantly ignore such findings. “All of this very painstaking research,” she said, “is just being brushed to the side as if it didn't happen.” And erasing it isn't likely to lead to a baby boom.

Consider, for instance, how many people want kids but don't have anyone to raise them with. The United States is already in the midst of a romance recession: Fewer Americans, and especially people without college degrees, are marrying or living with partners; more people are identifying as single. Badgering people to hurry up and get hitched isn't likely to change this. Straight women, in particular, are trying to pull from a pool of men who—with their growing rates of addiction, isolation, unemployment, and even suicide—may not seem stable or healthy enough for parenthood. As these women search and search for a partner, their window for having children might close. For her 2023 book, Motherhood on Ice: The Mating Gap and Why Women Freeze Their Eggs, Marcia C. Inhorn, a medical anthropologist at Yale, interviewed 150 women who'd frozen their eggs; more than 80 percent of those participants, it turned out, were single. They were putting up with a hugely expensive and uncomfortable process just to buy themselves a little more time to find a co-parent. Some never did.

The White House has plenty of options to make having and raising a kid alone more feasible. It could start by subsidizing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization, which Trump has said he might do—or then again, maybe he won't. In March, he called himself “the fertilization president,” and his aides are reportedly planning to recommend ways to make IVF more accessible. But his administration has also been cutting federal programs that research fertility and maternal health, including one that tracked the success rates of different IVF clinics. And Project 2025 explicitly states that ART should be a last resort even for married couples—instead recommending “restorative reproductive medicine,” a vague term for methods such as fertility tracking that are far less likely to work for people striving to conceive.

Read: This might be a turning point for child-free voters

Policy makers could also think beyond conception, accounting for the loved ones whom single people (and parents in general) may turn to for help when they need it. Cross, the sociologist, mentioned that a lot of families—especially low-income, Black, and Latino families—depend on extended relatives to help raise kids. That lines up with my recent reporting on grandparents, many of whom are pushing themselves to their limits providing child care. (Researchers told me that reliance on grandparents has likely increased along with the rise in single parents.) Given these realities, family-leave policies should arguably extend not only to spouses and their children, as many are limited to now, but to anyone responsible for taking care of a family member. The U.S. could even follow Sweden's example and let parents transfer paid-leave time to grandparents in the first months after their kid's birth.

Or what if the government, acknowledging all those partnerless adults, were to encourage Americans to raise kids with friends? Some people are already doing it. Golombok has been studying platonic co-parents in recent years, and so far, she told me, the data suggest that their children are just fine. And if pooling incomes is good for kids—well, a group of pals combining finances, skills, and sets of hands might be even better.

The Trump administration hasn't shared the details of its pronatalist agenda; it could take some of the recommendations reported in the Times, or go another way entirely. Offering that “baby bonus” would be a good start. Subsidized child care, guaranteed paid parental leave and sick leave, tax credits or cash assistance totaling more than a few thousand dollars would be even better. Such policies, as long as they're not limited to straight, married couples, would help a wide range of households—including traditional ones.

But if the Trump administration doesn't institute policies that help the actual majority of American families, it won't be advancing a family-forward agenda at all. And it won't be likely to create “more happy children.” Its goal has always been regression: not to open up the circle of parenthood, but to shut it.

The most surprising consequence of Trump's trade war.

by  Eric Levitz

The immediate costs of President Donald Trump's trade war are fairly clear. Prices for imported goods are rising while economic growth is slowing. Manufacturers are slashing orders, small businesses with Chinese suppliers are on the brink of insolvency, interest rates are rising, Americans' retirement savings are bleeding value, and consumers are losing confidence. The severity of these consequences remain to be seen. But even the administration's defenders concede that Trump's tariffs will entail some economic pain in the near-term. 

The real question concerns the long-term impacts of Trump's misgovernance. The US economy has rebounded from severe shocks twice this century. If neither the 2008 financial crisis nor the Covid pandemic durably reduced America's living standards, it's reasonable to suppose that our nation will shake off the effects of Trump's misrule in due time.

Yet there are reasons to fear that his policies will render Americans permanently poorer — at least, relative to the level of prosperity they might have otherwise attained. Trump's defunding of scientific research threatens to lastingly hinder US innovation, while his discouragement of immigration could constrain long-term economic growth.

To many financial analysts, however, the biggest risk is that Trump could permanently reduce the value of the dollar. 

Currently, the US dollar is the world's reserve currency — the one used in a majority of the world's international transactions. To see how this works, consider what happens when a Mexican farmer wants to sell pig meat to a South Korean restaurant chain. The South Korean company probably doesn't have a ton of pesos in the bank, and the Mexican farmer doesn't have much use for the South Korean won. The two parties need some medium exchange that is widely accessible, universally trusted, and easily convertible into their local currencies. The dollar is that medium: The South Korean company exchanges won for dollars, buys the pork with those dollars, and then the Mexican farmer exchanges his hard-won greenbacks for pesos. 

The dollar's reserve status keeps demand for America's currency and debt artificially high, and thus, our nation's borrowing and consumer costs unusually low. 

But Trump's erratic and belligerent trade agenda has shaken global investors' confidence in both America's economic and political stability. Among bankers and foreign governments, talk of “de-dollarization” has spiked. 

The dollar's dominant role in international finance is unlikely to end any time soon. But Trump's policies have increased the odds of the currency's future displacement, while driving down its current value.

What makes the recent decline in the dollar's worth alarming is that it wasn't supposed to happen.

Most of the Trump trade war's adverse consequences were widely anticipated. Tariffs virtually always increase consumer prices, trigger retaliatory measures by other countries, and depress stock values.

But conventional economic wisdom held that Trump's tariffs would make the dollar more valuable. 

To understand why, one needs to recognize that the international value of currencies is relative: The dollar's strength is determined by how much foreign currency it can buy. It therefore gains value as other major currencies lose value.

Further, the value of a nation's currency is partly determined by demand for its exports. To purchase Japanese products, American importers must exchange dollars for yen (because Japanese companies require payment in yen). This leads them to bid up the yen's price on international currency markets.

Instead of responding to this crisis by piling into US assets, capital appears to be fleeing the United States. 

In theory, Trump's tariffs should have led Americans to buy fewer foreign goods and thus, demand fewer yen, euros, yuan, pesos etc. That should have mechanically reduced the value of those other currencies, thereby increasing the dollar's international value.

What's more, Trump's trade agenda was sure to increase economic uncertainty. And in recent decades, whenever global investors got jittery, they tended to buy US Treasury bonds, widely considered the world's safest asset. These periodic surges in demand for US Treasuries have always driven up the value of the dollar (since investors need dollars to buy US debt).

Trump's advisers tacitly cited these dynamics when they first tried to sell his trade agenda to the public. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued in January that Trump's tariffs wouldn't actually raise the cost of imported goods by that much, since his policies would increase the value of the dollar.

But this is not what happened. Rather, to the surprise of Trump's supporters and critics alike, the US Dollar Index has lost about 9 percent of its value since Trump took office. 

This may be partly due to a benign and temporary factor: The announcement of Trump's tariffs actually generated a surge in US imports, as American consumers tried to stock up on foreign goods before the duties took full effect. 

But that doesn't fully explain the dollar's decline. Even with the jump in imports, the dollar still shouldn't have fallen much in recent weeks. After all, Trump's tariffs have triggered even more global economic uncertainty than anticipated, due to their extraordinary size and scale. And yet, instead of responding to this crisis by piling into US assets, capital appears to be fleeing the United States. 

One can see this in the rising gap between the yield, or expected return, on American and German bonds. As of this writing, a 10-year US Treasury bond offers a roughly 4.18 percent return, while the yield on a German 10-year bond is only 2.4 percent. Normally, investors would respond to a gap this large by buying less German debt and more American debt, since our nation's bonds offer a much higher return and are typically considered as safe (if not more safe) than German bonds. 

And yet now — despite both high US interest rates and global economic uncertainty — investors appear to be moving money out of American assets and into European ones: The dollar has lost 5 percent of its value relative to the euro since the start of April. 

This extraordinary development has led global analysts to wonder if the dollar's preeminence might be coming to an end. 

In 1944, the Bretton Woods Agreement established the dollar as the world's reserve currency. But that framework for international trade broke down in the 1970s. For the past half-century, the dollar has owed its dominant role in the global financial system to America's economic strengths and political stability, rather than to any diplomatic accord.

Those economic strengths are straightforward. The United States boasts the world's largest economy. This has historically provided global businesses and countries with confidence that the dollar's value would remain relatively stable over time: A vast and diversified economy is less vulnerable to local shocks than one that is small or highly dependent on the strength of a single sector. 

And since international economic players have trusted the dollar to retain its value, they've been inclined to price goods in that currency and sign contracts that require payment in dollars.

There is no reason why the United States should run a trade surplus with every country at once.

Meanwhile, the American economy's size ensures that there are always lots of buyers and sellers in our bond markets. This makes US Treasuries a relatively stable store of value, since one can buy or sell them in large quantities without triggering large price changes, since there are so many other participants in the American bond market.

The depth of the Treasury market was historically reinforced by America's political stability, which encouraged confidence in our capacity and willingness to pay our debts. Together, these factors have made American debt into a uniquely safe and scalable savings instrument for foreign central banks and investors, a fact that reinforces demand for the dollar.

Trump's policies haven't eliminated America's exceptional economic strengths. But they have called our nation's long-term prosperity, political stability, and creditworthiness into question.

What has made Trump's tariffs so alarming to investors is their sheer irrationality. On “Liberation Day,” the US government declared that every country that runs a bilateral trade surplus with the United States was — by definition — cheating America. And Trump imposed tariffs as high as 46 percent on the exports of US allies in retaliation for this supposed cheating.

Yet the administration's reasoning was nonsensical. There is no reason why the United States should run a trade surplus with every country at once. And there are plenty of innocuous reasons why a foreign nation would sell more goods to Americans than it buys from them. The people of Bangladesh simply cannot afford to buy very many US-made goods, while Americans can easily afford to buy large volumes of Bangladeshi clothing. 

The administration ultimately paused its so-called reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. But it refused to revoke them outright and kept a 10 percent universal tariff in place, a policy that is itself mindless (why would the US put a tariff on all foreign products, including agricultural goods it cannot physically produce at scale, such as bananas and coffee)? Meanwhile, America abruptly jacked up its tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent, effectively ending trade between the world's two largest economies.

The fact that the US government was capable of pursuing policies this unhinged — and hostile toward its core allies — raised questions about its competence as a steward of growth and reliability as an economic partner. As Mark Sobel, US chair of the global economic think-tank OMFIF, told the Financial Times in April, “The trade war is just the latest example of this administration's contempt for the rest of the world. Being a trusted partner and ally is a key pillar of the US dollar's dominance, and has been tossed to the wind.”

More concretely, if Trump has utter contempt for conventional economic reasoning, norms, and international agreements — as his trade policy indicates — who can be certain that he won't end the Federal Reserve's independence or even entertain defaulting on some of America's debts?

This line of thinking appears to have driven investors to look for “safe havens” outside the United States: While the dollar has fallen in recent weeks, the opposite has been true for the world's other secure stores of wealth, such as the Swiss franc, yen, and gold. 

The dollar's status as a global reserve currency isn't an unmitigated boon to the US. Since that status inflates the dollar's international value, it renders US exports more expensive to foreign consumers, reducing the global competitiveness of American firms.

Nevertheless, the dollar's dominance is likely beneficial on net to the United States. At the very least, its displacement as global reserve currency would impose significant economic costs on American households. 

Since investors and nations worldwide need dollars to fulfill their contracts, pay off their debts, and complete financial transactions, there is massive and persistent demand for American assets in general, and sovereign debt in particular. This has enabled the United States to run large budget deficits without suffering a commensurate increase in its borrowing costs. As a result, Americans have faced less of an imperative to choose between paying low tax rates and sustaining their favorite social welfare programs.

The end of dollar dominance would force the US government to pay much higher interest rates. That would exacerbate the burden of America's debt, and make it harder for our government to avoid broad tax hikes or entitlement cuts (or both) in the coming decades.

Meanwhile, a permanently weaker dollar would reduce Americans' living standards. Our nation's trade deficit is often framed as a great imposition. But to an extent, it means that we are effectively trading something we can effortlessly produce — our currency and debt — for goods and services that other human beings must labor to generate. Most countries would not be able to do this indefinitely without seeing their currencies decline in value. But since the dollar is in such high global demand, we have, in a sense, been able to live off exporting our own money. 

Were dollar dominance to end, Americans would see their currency devalued — and thus, the real worth of their incomes and savings decline. It is possible that America could eventually develop a new, similarly prosperous economic model. But the attendant process of economic adjustment would be painful.

For now, the world is only de-dollarizing in relative terms. The US Dollar Index has fallen sharply, but remains higher today than it was in early 2021. 

And one fundamental obstacle to the dollar's displacement remains in place: the lack of a viable alternative.

Only a similarly large economy with a trusted political system could support a reserve currency as effective as the dollar. And no such economy currently exists.

The European Union could theoretically become one. But at present, unlike the US, the EU is a monetary union and not a political and fiscal one (all EU countries use the same currency, but they do not all pay taxes to the same government or fund their sovereign debt through common bonds). Europe's lack of a centralized treasury or debt-issuing authority undermines its ability to effectively manage its collective economy during times of crisis, as it demonstrated in the aftermath of the 2008 crash. 

More critically, there isn't a single unified eurobond market. Instead, Europe offers only fragmented markets for national debt. This means that none of its bond markets boast anywhere near the scale and liquidity of the market for US Treasuries.

China, meanwhile, puts heavy restrictions on the movement of money across its borders. This means that the yuan cannot be easily converted into foreign currencies, and is therefore unsuited to global reserve status. Even if China were to remove all capital controls, its weak commitment to the rule of law and relatively small bond market would still make the yuan less attractive than the dollar as a store of value, at least for the foreseeable future. 

All of this said, discontent with the dollar system was growing even before Trump's second inauguration. In recent decades, America has repeatedly weaponized the dollar's centrality to the global financial system. Specifically, we've forced other countries to abide by our sanctions or else lose access to the US banking system. That's caused nations with close economic ties to Iran, Russia, Venezuela, other US adversaries to pine for an alternative reserve currency.

Now, Trump has vastly expanded global governments' and investors' appetites for another way of organizing global monetary relations. Were the European Union to ever move to greater fiscal union or China to embrace greater financial openness and a modicum of political reform, it's conceivable that the world would readily transition to an international monetary system with multiple dominant currencies, in which the dollar's role would be greatly diminished.

For ordinary Americans, the more practical and immediate concern is that the dollar appears poised to grow marginally weaker in the coming months and years. With Trump's tariffs simultaneously spooking foreign investors and diminishing America's growth prospects, Goldman Sachs expects that the dollar will lose another 6 percent of value relative to the euro and yen over the coming year. 

With Trump's tariffs already reducing Americans' purchasing power — by driving up the cost of imports — the dollar's depreciation threatens to hit Americans' finances especially hard. 

His supporters insist that this “short-term pain” is necessary to bring “long-term gain.” But that is false. Trump's trade agenda will make Americans poorer both now and in the future. The only question is how extensive and reversible the damage will prove to be.

Auto workers supported tariffs to protect their jobs. They caused layoffs instead.

Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley was once synonymous with America's industrial might. 

The region was known for its booming manufacturing economy anchored by companies like Mack Trucks and Bethlehem Steel, the latter of which employed over 30,000 workers at its peak in the 1950s. 

But manufacturing began to struggle in the 1970s and collapsed by the turn of the century. Bethlehem Steel went bankrupt in 2001 (the site now houses a casino). All of this made the Lehigh Valley into a symbol of the ills of de-industrialization. There's even a Billy Joel song about it.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

President Donald Trump has said his ongoing trade war is meant in large part to bring manufacturing jobs back to communities like this. But, in the Lehigh Valley, it's having the opposite effect: Last month, Mack Trucks announced it would be laying off about 10 percent of its unionized workers at its Lehigh Valley plant, and pointed to tariffs and the economic uncertainty they've caused as the reason.

“We were very surprised,” Mack Trucks employee and UAW Local 677 District 1 Committeeperson Dan Hand told me. “We have people that just started working on the shop floor Monday of last week. … They're scared.”

When I saw a local news story about these layoffs, I knew I had to drive up to the valley from my home in Philadelphia to talk to Hand and his coworkers in person. I expected them to be mad. But I found a more complicated story — and more complicated feelings about the tariffs.

Last summer, Mack Trucks' parent company, Volvo, announced it was building a massive new truck plant in Mexico. The company said it planned to supplement its American workforce, not replace it, but Hand and his union members were upset and scared that their jobs, like so many others in their industry, would eventually move south of the border. In March, UAW 577 put out a press release blasting Mack's decision and endorsing tariffs as a tool to fight it. 

Now, even with the impending layoffs, Mack's Lehigh Valley workforce is split on Trump's tariff policy. “It doesn't seem like there's a good game plan,” said Hand, who voted for Trump in 2016, but then soured on him because of his treatment of organized labor in his first term.

John Taniser, on the other hand, told me short-term pain is worth it for long-term change. He voted for Trump in 2024 and remains confident in the president's vision.

“It could be a year. It could be two years. But what we're looking for is a path forward to thrive and not just sustain and exist,” said Taniser, a 27-year veteran of Mack's production line. “In this economy that we're in currently, there's no going forward.”

Nearly all economists agree that it's unlikely manufacturing will ever play as big a role in the American economy as it did in the mid-20th century. My colleague Dylan Matthews wrote an article recently about how, as countries get richer, they all see manufacturing jobs replaced with service industry jobs. 

That was the case across the US over the last century, and that's true in the Lehigh Valley too: The largest employers in the county now are hospitals and Amazon warehouses. Manufacturing itself has changed over time, too. Even if companies like Mack buck the trend and invest more in the United States, that ultimately won't translate into many new jobs: As manufacturing technology has improved, factories need fewer and fewer human workers. 

But that's a hard pill to swallow for people in communities that were built around manufacturing and that have suffered from its decline. Many hope tariffs will still, despite what experts say, rewind the clock and reverse that decline. 

“Those great jobs — they built the Valley,” Taniser said. “Those workers are the ones who bought all these homes, who shopped at all these stores. It's not there anymore. And we want to bring it back. I want it back.”

How to get parents and friends to get serious about doing good.

by  Sigal Samuel

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form or email sigal.samuel@vox.com. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I have family and friends who are relatively well-off but don't spend much time thinking intentionally about how to do good. So I've been wondering whether or how much to challenge them to do more good and take doing good more seriously. 

For example, I've always given a percentage of my income to charity. I've got parents who are lovely people, but they donate basically not at all. It's hard to know how to bring this up to them. They're retired. They have a house and a summer house. They clearly have enough money. I'd love for them to answer the question of “How much should we be giving back?” I have the sense that they haven't actually thought about it, so the default decision is to do nothing.

And especially with people in my generation, it feels uncomfortable to talk about this. I don't want it to feel accusatory or make people defensive. I want people to make an affirmative decision they're happy about and not have it live in the ambient guilt zone. How can I bring it up in a way that makes clear I just want people to be actively making a decision, even if it's not the same as mine?

Dear Do-gooder,

“The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change,” the 20th-century psychologist Carl Rogers once wrote.

I think the same is true about changing other people. Start by accepting them just as they are, and you may find they're a lot more receptive to what you say. 

It sounds like you're not trying to shove your own ideological commitments down your family and friends' throats, and I think that's great. But I'd encourage you to go even further. 

Rogers' insights are helpful here. Contrary to the views of other psychologists, Rogers didn't think it took any special therapy for a person to change for the better. He believed that just a few conditions were necessary: The person has to feel that you view them with unconditional positive regard — that you like and accept them as they are, not only if they change in this or that way. The person also has to feel that you're able to truly empathize — that you understand how things feel to them from within their own internal frame of reference. 

Meet those conditions, Rogers said, and the person will naturally move toward greater consistency between their values and actions, becoming healthier and more integrated.

You sound like you're already pretty good at the “unconditional positive regard” part — you write that your parents are “lovely people” despite not donating to charity. But ask yourself if you've truly understood how the world feels to them from within their own internal frame of reference. 

Maybe they're nervous about money, and maybe there's a good reason why they're like that. Yes, they've got a lot of resources now, but was there a time when they didn't? That can lead to an enduring scarcity mindset. Take me, for example: I grew up in a family on welfare, and even though I started earning a decent salary as an adult, I kept grappling with money dysmorphia — feeling nervous about money even after becoming financially stable.

Or maybe your family and friends just have a different idea about what counts as “doing good.” It's possible they already see themselves as very committed do-gooders, only their approach isn't about giving charity; it's about volunteering or helping the environment or engaging in political activism. Are you sure your way is better? Or is it possible that there are multiple moral perspectives that are equally valid, even if they conflict with each other? Philosophers call that latter view moral pluralism, and I think it's worth taking really seriously.

But even if you do think your way is better or your loved ones are ignoring a pretty powerful way to do good, you'll still want to be very careful about how you express that.

I say that because of the Stanford psychologist Benoit Monin's research on “do-gooder derogation.” Monin's studies showed people tend to feel less warm toward those who are extremely moral and altruistic. And the more people sense that the altruist might judge them, the more they put down the altruist. For example, Monin's study participants rated vegetarians more negatively the more they expected the vegetarians to see themselves as morally superior to meat eaters.

People really, really don't like to feel morally judged. And if they get even the slightest hint that you might be judging them, your approach is likely to backfire. Again, a personal experience: In college, a friend who was studying environmental science looked at me with disgust when she saw me once eat my lunch — a vegan lunch, for goodness' sake! — with a plastic spoon. Her reaction turned me off environmentalism for longer than I care to admit. 

So, what actually works? If you understand what it really feels like to be the other person, a la Rogers, that might give you clues about what it would take for them to become more open to your views. Often, I think you'll find that they need carrots, not sticks. 

That was the case for me. Because of my money dysmorphia, donating to charity felt genuinely scary to me for a long time. I worried: What if I need that money for myself down the line? Then I got a job where my colleagues were super-excited about donating. They seemed to genuinely derive a lot of joy and meaning from giving to charity. I wanted that joy and meaning, too! So I started small, giving in increments of $10, then $50, then hundreds and thousands of dollars. And believe it or not, I enjoyed it so much that Giving Tuesday actually became one of my favorite days of the year. 

If I'd felt pressured to donate, I would have pulled back in fear and resentment. But because it was fine to approach it in a way that felt safe to me, and I was given the sense that there was an awesome feeling waiting for me on the other side, I willingly made the change. 

As for environmentalism, I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I didn't reengage until, as an adult, I was re-exposed to the beauty of nature and of the animal kingdom. It started when someone invited me to try birding. To my surprise, I fell in love with birds! They turned out to be a gateway drug: I soon found myself watching monkeys, listening to bugling elk, and snorkeling with colorful fish. And caring deeply about the natural world they inhabit. 

In other words, sometimes people need to feel safer or to have positive experiences that show them just what's at stake for them personally before they'll engage. 

The research bears this out. As psychologist Molly Crockett has shown, when people judge how good a “good deed” is, they consider the benefits that those deeds bring about — but they also consider how good it feels to perform them. If anything, Crockett's data suggests that people put more weight on how good it feels to them. So they might think that a good deed that brings very little benefit but gives them a really warm, fuzzy glow is actually more praiseworthy than a good deed that feels detached and emotionless but brings about a lot of benefit. 

That's a bit bizarre — but that's human psychology! And you can work with it by talking about the personal satisfaction that you get from donating or other ways that you do good. Don't emphasize the moral arguments (lest you fall victim to do-gooder derogation). Instead, emphasize joy. 

Since it's tough to find ways to slip this into conversation organically, you'll probably be better off doing this as part of a ready-made ritual that you share with family or friends. That could be, say, your birthday party. But, since neuroscientific research indicates that practicing gratitude can prime our brains to be more altruistic, I'd suggest piggybacking on a holiday traditionally associated with feeling thankful for all we have — whether that's a religious holiday, like Judaism's Sukkot, or a secular holiday, like Thanksgiving. 

Say you offer to host Thanksgiving. (In the invite, give people a heads-up that you'll be doing a short reflection.) After people have had something to eat but before they're totally comatose, ask everyone to reflect on what they're grateful for. Then say, “I feel really grateful that I've been able to donate 10 percent of my income to charity X this year. I just got an update from the charity, and it said that my money helped 10 poor families put food on the table and send their kids to school. It felt amazing!”

Then you can ask everyone, “What makes you feel amazing? Is there something helpful you've done this year that felt super-satisfying? Do you want to set an intention to do more of that between now and next Thanksgiving?”

Don't expect people to magically change their entire personality then and there. More likely, you'll be planting a seed that will germinate over months or years. This patient approach might take longer than direct persuasion, but it typically creates more sustainable change and preserves your most important relationships in the process.

If you want to nudge the seed along, remember Rogers's advice about providing the optimal growing conditions. Help people feel safe. Help them feel understood. And then help them fall deeper in love with the world by putting them in contact with what's beautiful and good. Chances are they'll naturally gravitate toward it.

Aging could be about to change for women forever.

by  Anna North

Will my generation be the last to go through menopause?

Just a few years ago, that would've seemed like a bizarre question — I've always assumed that I and every other human being with ovaries would eventually experience what my grandmother called “the change of life.” But now, researchers are calling into question what once seemed like basic facts of human existence. “What if menopause happened later?” they are asking. “What if it never happened at all?“

In recent years, patients have gained access to a wider variety of medications to treat menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. But newer treatments, one already in clinical trials, go deeper: The goal is not just to treat the symptoms, but to actually slow down ovarian aging so that the hormonal changes associated with midlife happen later — or maybe even never. “For the first time in medical history, we have the ability to potentially delay or eliminate menopause,” Kutluk Oktay, a reproductive surgeon and an ovarian biologist at Yale University, said in a release last year.

I cover reproductive health, and my inbox has been filling up for months with news of research like this. As an elder millennial barreling toward the uncertainty of perimenopause (which some research suggests can start as early as one's 30s), I've received these updates with interest, sure, but also with a fair amount of trepidation. 

On the one hand, the loss of estrogen that comes with menopause is associated with a host of illnesses and conditions, from cardiovascular disease to osteoporosis. Delaying the menopausal transition even five years “would result in an enormous improvement in terms of women's health and decreased mortality,” Zev Williams, the chief of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told me. “It's a really exciting opportunity.”

On the other hand, the idea of getting rid of menopause can feel like yet another way of insisting that women remain young and fertile forever. At a time when JD Vance is talking dismissively about the “purpose of the postmenopausal female,” I'm unsettled by the prospect of treating women's aging out of their childbearing years, in particular, as something that must be cured. 

If the idea of stopping menopause is a fraught one, though, it's also an opportunity to think about what we want from our later lives, and to consider what it would look like to balance the real medical concerns of midlife and beyond with the fact that women are flesh-and-blood human beings who, like everyone else, get old. As Ashton Applewhite, author of the book This Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism, put it to me, “you can't stop aging, or you're dead.”

To understand menopause, it helps to understand a little bit about ovaries, the human reproductive organs that store and release eggs. Starting in puberty, these glands ramp up their production of estrogen, a hormone that leads to breast development and a host of other changes to the body. Throughout the reproductive years, the ovaries make estrogen and other hormones according to a monthly cycle to help prepare the body for potential pregnancy. 

Starting around a person's late 30s, however, estrogen production starts to drop off. By the mid-40s, people typically enter perimenopause, which means “around menopause.” This period is characterized by unpredictable ups and downs in estrogen, though on a general downward trend (Mary Jane Minkin, an OB-GYN who teaches at the Yale School of Medicine, likens the pattern to the stock market during the Great Recession). That hormonal decline can lead to symptoms like irregular periods, hot flashes, and night sweats. 

A lot of the symptoms most commonly associated with menopause actually start in perimenopause, and they can range from annoying to devastating. Perimenopause has been getting a lot of media attention lately, along with more focus from brands who may want to sell you stuff to help you manage it. Problems like hot flashes and brain fog can cause women to miss work, resulting in $1.8 billion in lost work productivity in the US per year, according to one study. The loss of estrogen can cause vaginal dryness, which can cause discomfort during sex and, in some cases, constant pain.

At some point, the ovaries stop producing eggs, and menstruation stops entirely. This is menopause, and it's diagnosed when someone has gone without a period for a full year. It happens at an average age of 51, though Black and Latina women reach menopause earlier than white and some Asian American women. Though some symptoms, like dryness, persist after menopause, others, like hot flashes, often resolve, Minkin told me.

Hormonal changes in the body around menopause are also linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic's Center for Women's Health and medical director of the Menopause Society, told me. Blood pressure and cholesterol tend to rise during this time, as does insulin resistance, a condition that can lead to diabetes. Bone density also falls during and after the menopause transition, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.

Some experts believe that menopause is part of the reason women spend more time than men living with chronic diseases. “Women live longer than men,” gerontology professor Bérénice Benayoun told Vox last year, “but they usually do so in a much more frail state.”

Given all this, it's reasonable that more experts are looking at menopause and wondering, what if we could just…not?

Hormone therapy — typically estrogen taken on its own or with progesterone, sometimes in the form of birth control pills — already exists to treat the symptoms of menopause. The treatment was stigmatized for decades after a 2002 study linked it to breast cancer and other ailments, but doctors now say the benefits often outweigh the risks. Taking estrogen can dramatically reduce hot flashes, and even reduce cardiovascular risk while patients are on the medication.

When you look at illnesses and conditions like dementia, heart disease, and stroke, “there's a much, much lower rate in women compared to men, until ovarian function stops. Then they start to catch up,” Williams said. “If we have a way of extending the ovarian lifespan in a way that's safe, then you're allowing the ovary to provide all these incredible health benefits” for a longer period of time.

Estrogen therapy can replace some of the estrogen a person's ovaries are no longer producing, but it doesn't actually stop those organs' decline. To do that, some researchers are looking at more involved procedures. 

In one recent study, Oktay, the Yale biologist, and his team used a mathematical model to predict how a technique called ovarian tissue cryopreservation might work in healthy patients. The process, typically used in cancer patients undergoing treatment that could harm their fertility, involves removing a section of ovary, freezing it, and reimplanting it at a later date. This technique, if used in healthy patients under 40, “would result in a significant delay in menopause,” according to the study.

Oktay and his team have begun preserving ovarian tissue from healthy patients, with the goal of reintroducing it when the patients are close to menopause. Since the women are still young, the team will have to wait years for real-world results, Oktay told me. But the technique does work to restore ovarian function in cancer survivors, he said. 

About 10 percent of women enter menopause at age 55 or older, Oktay told me, and they tend to have longer life expectancy and less risk of osteoporosis and diabetes than people who go through the transition earlier. “We're saying, why not make everybody that lucky?”

Williams, the Columbia endocrinologist, and his team are working on a different, less invasive option. They're currently in the midst of their first human trial of rapamycin, an oral medication typically used as an immunosuppressant in higher doses. Rapamycin has been found to extend lifespan in some animal studies, suggesting to some that it might help humans live longer. Williams and his team have also found that the drug can extend ovarian function and fertility in mice. 

The Columbia researchers are now monitoring 50 women between the ages of 35 and 45 who have taken either rapamycin or a placebo, asking them questions about their mood, memory, and sleep quality, as well as checking their ovarian function through blood work and ultrasounds. They don't have results yet, but they've seen no serious side effects so far.

The goal isn't just to extend fertility, though “as a fertility specialist, that's obviously something that I think about all the time,” Williams said. It's also about extending the benefits that ovaries provide to women's health, potentially reducing their lifetime risk of chronic illness.

Research like Williams's has generated significant excitement, as the idea of pushing back menopause starts to move into the mainstream. Toward the end of the Biden administration, Jill Biden launched a women's health initiative dedicated to studying the idea.

The ovaries are “the only organ in humans that we just accept will fail one day,” Renee Wegrzyn, director of the agency in charge of the first lady's initiative, told the New York Times last year. “It's actually kind of wild that we all just accept that.”

Some are skeptical, though, that delaying or eliminating menopause would be an entirely good idea.

For one thing, the link between menopause and illness isn't completely clear-cut. People who go through menopause later tend to have better health outcomes, “but is it chicken or egg?” Faubion asked. “Do their ovaries last longer because they're otherwise in better general health than the other people that go through menopause early?”

Prolonging ovarian function — and thus increasing people's lifetime exposure to estrogen — could also come with risks of its own, like increases in breast cancer or blood clots, which have been linked to the hormone, Faubion said (going through menopause after age 55 is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer). For some, the tradeoffs might be worth it, but it's not necessarily true that later menopause would mean better health across the board.

With more invasive treatments, there are also other questions to consider. “What are the ethics of taking out a healthy organ from a healthy person” — a surgical procedure that could fail — “all in the name of ‘delaying menopause?'” Faubion asked. 

Oktay, the biologist studying ovarian tissue cryopreservation, told me the procedure is a minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, and can be performed at the same time as another abdominal surgery like a C-section. Many participants in his study have a family history of severe menopause complications or conditions that can worsen with menopause, he said, giving them a reason to want to delay the transition.

For Minkin, the Yale gynecologist, the experimental treatments are intriguing if they can extend fertility. But for dealing with the physical challenges of menopause, she's not sure they're necessary: “There are plenty of easy ways to give people hormones.”

Some people, including survivors of certain cancers, aren't able to take hormones, and new treatments could be helpful for them. Meanwhile, some experts see delaying menopause as most beneficial for people who experience the transition early. About one percent of women go through menopause before age 40, and five percent before age 45. Cancer treatments or autoimmune conditions can cause early menopause, but sometimes, the cause is unknown. Since early menopause is associated with elevated health risks, a new way to treat it “would probably result in a net benefit for population health,” Nanette Santoro, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, told Time.

Going through menopause early can be deeply upsetting to people, especially (though not exclusively) if they're hoping to have children. But when it happens at the average time, this stage of life can come with social and emotional benefits, despite the physical challenges. 

“It's liberating,” Applewhite told me. “No more mood swings, no more worries about getting pregnant.”

“I don't know any woman, including yourself, who wants to be bleeding every single month,” Denise Pines, creator of the menopause summit WisePause, told me.

Indeed, research has found that women often become happier as they age, especially after midlife — potentially because they're less consumed with caring for children and other family members. Some anthropologists believe that female humans, unlike other animals, live beyond their reproductive years to help care for grandchildren (it's called the “grandmother hypothesis”). But Minkin offered a more expansive view of this theory: In early human settlements, pregnant people couldn't do heavy labor like moving rocks around. The grandmother was “somebody who moves the rocks,” she said. She also described postmenopausal women as “shooting saber-toothed tigers.”

Even the troublesome symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats, can be a useful “disruptor” in people's lives, Pines said. “Where women have been so giving and outwardly focused, suddenly you have to focus on yourself.”

“That gives you a chance to reset everything else around you,” from relationships to career, Pines said. “It's such a great time to really reimagine who we are.”

Applewhite welcomes the recent surge in awareness around menopause, and says hormone therapy to treat its symptoms can be helpful — “I'm not saying, keep your body pure and avoid the temptations of Western medicine.” But when it comes to putting off menopause or eliminating it entirely, she said it's concerning “when inevitable transitions of aging are pathologized.” That's especially true for women's aging, which is doubly stigmatized in American culture. “Under patriarchy, a woman's value is linked to her reproductive value,” Applewhite said. It's why there's so little research into the health of older women: “because we are no longer reproductively useful.”

As appealing as the idea of extending a person's healthy lifespan is, I can't quite get past the ovary of it all. I, too, have heard from post-menopausal people about the liberation they feel when they exit their reproductive years. I, too, have at times been frustrated by doctors' focus on my reproductive capacity over other aspects of my health. I want to be healthy as I get older, but I also want to accept my aging (and for the people around me to accept it), rather than feeling constant pressure to stave it off.

Applewhite wants women of all ages to see “later life as a time of enormous power and liberation and possibility,” and I'd like to see it that way too, not as something to be avoided at all costs.

When I shared some of these concerns with Williams, he asked me if I'd feel the same trepidation around treatments that focused on other areas of the body. “You want to extend normal heart function, liver function,” he said. But “for some reason, if you say, we want to slow ovarian aging, that touches on a very different note.”

It's a fair point, especially since a lot of the health outcomes he and others are trying to promote aren't about fertility or attractiveness or any of the attributes our culture demands that women maintain in our quest to remain forever young — they're about things like cardiovascular and mental health. I want those!

Williams argued that understanding ovarian aging might actually remove some of the negative messages around menopause and getting older more generally. He also studies recurrent miscarriage, which “has always had a tremendous amount of stigma associated with it.” What's helped reduce that stigma has been “when it goes away from this realm of myth and taboo and folklore, and we start to understand the process,” he says.

It's worth noting that research into menopause, like so much work on reproductive health and indeed health in general, is imperiled under the Trump administration. When I tried to visit the website for Jill Biden's menopause initiative, I found that it was gone. Renee Wegrzyn, the head of the initiative, was fired in February. In a time when a lot of medical research is simply disappearing, it's hard to look askance at treatments that could improve people's lives.

After talking to Williams and other experts, I'm not against the idea of a medication that could help people live longer without heart attacks or cognitive decline. But as I get older, I'm also keenly aware that what happens outside our bodies can affect our health as much as what happens inside them. 

When I asked Pines what she'd like to see for people in perimenopause and menopause right now, she said she wants a future when people in this stage of life “are not dismissed,” when “we can talk about menopause the same way we talk about puberty.” She'd also like to see workplaces support women experiencing perimenopause symptoms, including by offering insurance plans that cover the treatment of them. And she wants OB-GYNs, internists, and other doctors to be specifically trained in perimenopause and menopause, something that's often lacking.

“When we have those kinds of things in place,” she said, our society “will start looking at aging and aging women differently.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Google is heading to Hollywood to upgrade its star power","https://www.businessinsider.com/google-tv-movie-hollywood-boost-tech-image-hundred-zeros-2025-5","Mon, 05 May 2025 15:56:00 GMT","

Google wants to use Hollywood to upgrade its cool factor.

The tech giant has quietly launched a new film and TV production initiative, Business Insider has learned.

The effort, called 100 Zeros, is a multiyear partnership with Range Media Partners, the talent firm and production company whose notable films include ""A Complete Unknown"" and ""Longlegs."" It's tasked with identifying projects that Google can help fund or produce. The goal is to get behind an array of scripted and unscripted films and TV shows. (The companies wouldn't comment on a number or timeframe.)

Google has a few goals with 100 Zeros. The company sees it as a way to get the creative community to adopt its newer tech products and services, like its Immersive View feature that lets you see things in 3D, spatial tools that blend the physical and virtual worlds, and AI.

Google also wants to promote a positive view of its products — and tech generally — through entertainment to young audiences by helping shape pop culture.

Last year, 100 Zeros quietly dipped a toe in the water, putting some marketing dollars behind an indie horror film from Neon, ""Cuckoo."" In exchange, 100 Zeros' logo was prominently shown in the opening credits. Google didn't seek any publicity for the move, but it was indicative of the alignments it wants: A celebrated indie studio (""Parasite,"" ""Anora"") and a movie aimed at Gen Z and starring Hunter Schafer, known for ""Euphoria"" and the ""Hunger Games"" franchise.

In another step in that direction, Google and Range announced a partnership this spring called ""AI On Screen"" to commission short films about AI, with the goal of making two into feature films. Here's how it described one of the shorts, ""Sweetwater"": ""When the son of a late celebrity visits his childhood home, a piece of fan mail reveals a startling AI, forcing him to reconcile his mother's legacy.""

""Through our continued partnership with Range, we aim to collaborate with the Hollywood creative community in a thoughtful and productive way, upkeeping our ongoing commitment to responsibly support creative expression and explore the possibilities of technology through storytelling,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

In projects where Google is involved early on, the company wouldn't mind if characters clutched Android phones instead of iPhones and used its features like ""Circle to Search."" That's provided the integration isn't forced. Product placement isn't 100 Zeros' main focus, however. Google has a separate effort with United Talent Agency for marketing partnerships like its recent ones with ""The White Lotus"" and ""Wicked"" to promote the Pixel.

One of the ways Google will judge the success of the initiative is how it impacts popular sentiment around the company's products and services. Google dominates the global mobile phone market, but is outsold by Apple in the US. Apple has gained a strong following with Gen Z with its luxury image and blue text bubbles that can make Android users feel left out. Its phones have become entrenched in pop culture, appearing in buzzy titles like ""Succession"" and ""Knives Out."" Piper Sandler's spring survey found 88% of US teens owned an iPhone.

Beyond Android, Google search is losing its hold on young people, who are increasingly going to AI or other platforms like Amazon and TikTok for answers to their questions.

Consumer brands are increasingly using Hollywood-style entertainment to spread their messages, as it's gotten harder to get people's attention with traditional ads. The interest is welcome in cash-strapped Hollywood.

A common approach by brands is to lean on established filmmakers and agencies to develop or produce projects. A handful of brands like Procter & Gamble and WeTransfer have gone further and hired in-house expertise. Google's efforts are similar to those of Waffle Iron Entertainment, a studio Nike set up to make original entertainment that aligns with the company's goals while operating at arm's length.

100 Zeros has a small dedicated staff: Penny Lin, a film producer at Range, and development execs Casey Durant and Tony Nguyen. Rachel Douglas, partner and manager at Range, oversees the relationship with Google. On the Google side, the point person is Jonathan Zepp, the managing director of emerging content experiences.

""This initiative is different in that it's staffed by full-time people who come out of Hollywood and are housed at and supported by Range,"" Douglas said of 100 Zeros.

Consumer brands' flirtation with films isn't guaranteed to last. Some have been halting or slowing film projects amid President Donald Trump's tariffs and attacks on DEI. Even before the tariff news hit, some corporations that had made commitments to the space — including Starbucks, Marriott, and Southwest Airlines — laid off marketers who worked in filmed entertainment as a part of larger corporate cuts, a reminder of the tenuous nature of the work.

One aspect of 100 Zeros that people might find surprising is that it's not looking to leverage YouTube as a primary distribution platform. YouTube has become a TV juggernaut and has been working to make itself a home for premium programming. But 100 Zeros isn't trying to recreate YouTube Originals, the platform's onetime stab at making original shows, or even use YouTube as the first stop for these projects. Instead, the goal is to sell projects to traditional studios and streamers like Netflix.

An international volunteer who fought in Ukraine told Business Insider that Russia's armed forces have such a reputation for brutality that his unit agreed never to be captured alive.

Russian forces are ""incredibly dangerous, oftentimes fanatical or desperate people that would torture you and kill you if they caught you,"" said Macer Gifford, the nom de guerre of British former trader Harry Rowe.

A veteran of the Ukrainian army, who previously volunteered to fight in Syria, Gifford fought in key locations in Ukraine, including in Kherson and Lyman.

He spoke to BI's Authorized Account about the realities of fighting Russia, and the tough decisions his unit had to take.

While some Russians have reported torture and ill-treatment at the hands of Ukrainian captors, it has largely happened at the point of capture and ""stopped when prisoners arrived at official places of internment,"" a UN investigation found last year.

Not so Russia. The investigation said that there is ""widespread and systematic torture and ill-treatment"" of prisoners of war throughout Russia's entire system of internment. This includes beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence, suffocation, sleep deprivation, and mock executions, it said.

There have also been killings: Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr Matsievsky became a cause célèbre after he was forced to dig his own grave before being shot in captivity, the BBC reported.

""Russia has gone to every depth of depravity you could possibly imagine,"" Gifford said.

That's why his unit entered into a pact — even expelling one member who tried to surrender during a firefight, he said. There was an agreement that ""no one in the unit was allowed to be taken alive.""

Acknowledging that all wars are violent, Gifford said he was nonetheless ""genuinely shocked"" by what he saw fighting against Russia.

Gifford believes that Russian forces learned many of their more brutal tactics in Syria.

Russian President Vladimir Putin gave military support to Syria's then-president, Bashar Assad, starting in 2015, supplying military equipment and air strikes to push back rebel groups, including the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

But it's the jihadist group that appears to have provided a model for Russian troops in Ukraine, Gifford said.

The ""level and scope"" of Russia's barbarity on civilians, he said, reminded him ""of the same tactics that the Islamic State used.""

Gifford recalled how, during his time fighting in Syria, he would find cages, torture instruments, and mattresses with chains next to them for holding female captives in Islamic State-controlled areas.

""I thought that the Islamic State was a fringe, that it was a unique thing,"" he said, but in his view, ""many of their brutal practices have been adopted by Russia — mainly, I suppose, because they were so effective in Syria,"" he added.

Gifford described Russia's war machine as ""incredibly big and incredibly dangerous.""

But while Russia leads in scale — its army is on track to grow to 1.5 million active troops — its forces have been ""decimated"" in Ukraine, he said.

Russia's approach to war is about scale and ""meat wave"" attacks in which astonishing numbers of casualties are tolerated, Gifford said.

The ""real differences"" between the countries come down to ""the way they value life,"" he added. ""The Ukrainians are fighting for their lives. Russia is just fighting for more territory, and that's the difference.""

But Gifford stressed that Ukraine's allies need to stop seeing the war as ""a conflict on the edge of Europe,"" and that for Putin it means much more.

For him, it's ""a war of annihilation,"" Gifford said. It's ""the war to end all wars in the eyes of Vladimir Putin.""

Russia has routinely denied allegations of war crimes. The Russian Ministry of Defence didn't respond to a request for comment.

Hours after Warren Buffett stunned the crowd at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting by announcing that he'd step down at the end of the year, its board voted unanimously for Greg Abel to replace him.

Buffett — who is 94 and has been the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway for 55 years — will remain as chairman of the board of directors, according to a press release. Greg Abel will become the new CEO and president as of January 1, 2026.

""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,"" Buffett told the audience on Saturday, referring to Abel, one of his top hands.

Abel, 62, has been Berkshire Hathaway's vice chair of non-insurance operations since 2018. He's also chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which Buffett hailed as one of the conglomerate's four ""jewels"" in his annual shareholder letter in 2021, the same year Buffett first tapped Abel as his successor.

While Buffett's approval was a major plus, the company's board of directors was tasked with confirming his successor, and did so on Sunday.

Investors and shareholders expect that Abel will maintain Berkshire Hathaway's investment philosophy. He told shareholders at this weekend's meeting that he would start by maintaining the company's ""fortress of a balance sheet,"" which allows it to make large investments without relying on banks, Barron's reported.

Abel is known, however, for having a more hands-on management style than Buffett.

He was estimated by Forbes to be worth $484 million in 2021. In 2022, he sold his 1% stake in the company's Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit for $870 million.

Abel has risen through the ranks with a persistent focus on energy.

The Canadian native played hockey in his early years and attended the University of Alberta. He graduated in 1984 with a degree in commerce.

He joined PwC after graduation and quickly moved on to a small company called CalEnergy. In 1999, CalEnergy acquired MidAmerican Energy and adopted its name. That same year, Berkshire Hathaway bought a controlling interest in MidAmerican Energy. Abel took over the reins of MidAmerican in 2008 — renamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy in 2014 — and helmed it until 2018.

He's also served on the board of several major companies, including Kraft Heinz, and has been affiliated with organizations and institutions like the Mid-Iowa Council Boy Scouts of America, Drake University, American Football Coaches Foundation, and the Horatio Alger Association.

He lives in Des Moines, Iowa. Those who've spotted him at a hockey rink in town, watching his son practice, say he comes across as a ""regular guy,"" the Des Moines Register reported.

Buffett also has a reputation as a folksy and down-to-earth person, living in Omaha, Nebraska.

At Berkshire Hathaway, succession doesn't seem to be just about handing over a job. With the title, Buffett said he's passing down traditions — like writing letters — and a mindset, too.

In Berkshire Hathaway's 2024 annual report, Buffett wrote, ""At 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire creed that a 'report' is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to owners. 

""And he also understands that if you start fooling your shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be fooling yourself as well.""

Trump's Immigration Policy:

Since President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada a US state with “economic force,” Canadians have boycotted the US.

Economically dependent on their northern neighbor, business owners in Washington state are laying off employees and shutting their doors.

Canada's boycott of all things American has caused the US measurable pain. Airline bookings from Canada to its southern neighbor have dipped significantly from last year, and the Federal Reserve's latest snapshot of the US economy noted widespread declines in Canadian spending.

But few places in the US are hurting more than the border towns of Washington state, where local economies are almost entirely dependent on the other side. “We do not survive without Canada.

Task forces that specialize in fighting organized crime, drug cartels and human traffickers were told to shut down by Sept. 30, according to documents and people familiar with the matter

Damian Williams, then-US attorney for the Southern District of New York, holds a ""confidential"" binder during a news conference at the Department of Justice in Washington DC on April 14, 2023. The Justice Department announced charges against several leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel and its facilitators. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces were involved in the investigation and capture of the cartel's leader, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.

The Trump administration is “decommissioning” a Department of Justice unit that has long been at the center of dismantling transnational organized crime networks, drug cartels and human trafficking rings. 

Leaders of the unit, called the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, or OCDETF, were told they had until Sept. 30  to shut down operations, people familiar with the matter said.

Six theories (maybe seven) try to get at the root of Elon Musk's pet project.

Disruptor-in-chief.

Photographer: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images

Just before the election last fall, Elon Musk predicted that he could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. By early January, a couple of weeks before President Donald Trump returned to the White House and appointed Musk head of the newly created not-quite-department dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency, he was calling $2 trillion “the best-case outcome” and saying “we've got a good shot” at getting $1 trillion in cuts. In late March, he said DOGE would deliver $1 trillion in deficit reduction by the end of May. By April 10, that was down to savings of $150 billion. Draw a trendline through Musk's pronouncements so far, and it shows the DOGE savings number going negative on May 21 and becoming a deficit increase of more than $2 trillion on Dec. 1.

This is not meant as a serious forecast. But with Musk's time as a “special government employee” due to end this month, and the Partnership for Public Service estimating that the cost in lost productivity, rehiring of fired workers and other side effects of his chaotic approach will top $135 billion this year, it does seem fair to conclude that the direct annual savings from DOGE's efforts will be less than $150 billion, which amounts to about 2% of federal spending. And with spending up 10% since President Trump took office relative to the same period last year; the “one big beautiful bill” addressing taxes and spending currently working its way through Congress almost certain to increase the deficit; and a tariff-induced, tax-revenue-reducing recession perhaps on the horizon, I guess it's not impossible that deficit will rise by $2 trillion.

EToro offers a platform where users can trade and follow top investors in assets including stocks and crypto.

EToro Group Ltd. and some of its shareholders are seeking to raise as much as $500 million in a US initial public offering, after the trading and investment platform paused its listing plans amid tariff-related stock volatility.

The Israel-based company and some of its shareholders are offering 10 million shares for $46 to $50 each, according to a filing Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. At the top of the price range, EToro would have a market value of about $4 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filing.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

SINGAPORE — Rich countries ""owe it to the world"" to get themselves down to net zero emissions, according to Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

Gates, who is also chairman of the non-profit Gates Foundation, was speaking at the opening dinner of Ecosperity in Singapore on Monday, the flagship sustainability event for state investor Temasek. In a fireside chat with Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action Ravi Menon, Gates said that rich countries must get to net zero, regardless of ""whether the entire world gets to [net zero].""

""There are levels of emissions that are small enough that the temperature worsening actually is not a problem,"" he said.

Therefore, it is not a must for all countries to achieve ""absolute zero,"" but richer countries must do so in order to show that there are solutions to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.

Net zero is defined by the United Nations as ""cutting carbon emissions to a small amount of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere.""

Gates also called for the world to be more bold with innovation investments that seek to combat climate change, saying that even though he was a huge believer in innovation, ""the notion that the entire world is going to get [to net zero] by 2050 is at this point not realistic.""The UN has said that to keep global warming to no more than 1.5°C  — as called for in the Paris Agreement — emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

""The sooner we get there, the better. [But] we need the examples."" Gates said, pointing out that the main obstacles include securing risk capital to fund these solutions.

On Monday, Gates also met with Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who said in the Gates Foundation would be setting up an office in the city state.

""We had a wide-ranging conversation on the challenges ahead, from clean energy to vaccine development. Singapore looks forward to working closely with the Gates Foundation to advance innovation and improve lives — here in Asia and around the world,"" Wong said in a Facebook post.

The former Microsoft CEO also met with Singapore Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong to discuss how the foundation could work with more entities in the country, such as universities.

""We welcome the Gates Foundation and others to continue to bring their businesses and interests here to Singapore and invest in our ecosystem and deepen our ties with the region,"" Lee said in a post on Facebook.

In this article

Investors in Hollywood's top studios and streaming services were trying to make sense Monday of President Donald Trump's proposed 100% tariff on movies made overseas.

Shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery briefly fell in early-morning trading, with Comcast-owned Universal also trading slightly down. Here's how those stock moves shook out before shares rebounded:

Trump called tax incentives offered by foreign countries ""a national security threat"" in a post on Truth Social Sunday night. He said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose a levy on all films produced abroad that are sent to the United States.

How Trump intends to implement these duties is unclear, as is exactly who is being targeted and who would foot that potential tariff bill.

Hollywood studios have long filmed movies overseas, either for tax benefits or to capture the natural setting of international locations. Some films are shot in multiple countries, with many studios having satellite production hubs around the globe.

""We think the large studios and distributors ... and various independent studios carry a significant amount of risk as they will have to lobby the Trump administration to set a reasonable standard for films that require live sets in foreign settings while otherwise moving productions stateside for studio-based scenes,"" Wedbush's Alicia Reese wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Reese estimates that 75% of Netflix's overall content is produced internationally, with foreign language content made internationally and a significant portion of its domestic product filmed in Canada and the U.K.

""Realistically, most of Netflix's content is filmed by third party studios, and the company has little control over where the vast majority of its content is produced,"" Reese said.

When Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, a popular filming location for Hollywood movies and television shows, industry experts told CNBC that it wouldn't have a major impact on production.

After all, the majority of projects are shot digitally, and transporting the final product can be done online or with a data storage device. There isn't a physical good that exchanges hands in the same way as, say, toys or clothing that's made in another country.

""Tariffs typically apply to the import of 'goods,' so a tariff on DVD imports is easy to enforce and a tariff on intellectual property is nearly impossible to enforce,"" Reese wrote.

Questions are already swirling. What part of the production process would be hit with this duty? Would it apply only to movie projects or will TV shows filmed internationally also incur this levy? Are already completed projects exempt?

Additionally, as with the first round of tariff announcements earlier this year, industry experts worry about how these duties will impact relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies on international box office sales to recoup lofty film budgets. China has already closed its doors to Hollywood product. Other regions could retaliate and do the same.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.

In this article

Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, ending its nearly three-decade run as a public company, the retailer announced Monday.

The price 3G Capital agreed to pay represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current valuation on the public markets, which is in line with similar takeover deals. Shares of Skechers soared more than 25% after the transaction was announced.

""With a proven track-record, Skechers is entering its next chapter in partnership with the global investment firm 3G Capital,"" Skechers' CEO, Robert Greenberg, said in a news release.

""Given their remarkable history of facilitating the success of some of the most iconic global consumer businesses, we believe this partnership will support our talented team as they execute their expertise to meet the needs of our consumers and customers while enabling the Company's long-term growth,"" he said.

The transaction comes at a difficult time for the retail industry and in particular, the footwear sector, which relies on discretionary spending and overseas supply chains that are now in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war. 

Last week Skechers signed onto a letter penned by the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group asking for an exemption from Trump's tariffs.

And, a little over a week ago, Skechers withdrew its full-year 2025 guidance ""due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies"" as companies brace for a drop in consumer spending that will disproportionately impact the footwear and apparel sectors. 

Skechers declined to say how much of its supply chain is based in China, which is currently facing 145% tariffs, but cautioned that two-thirds of its business is outside of the U.S. and therefore won't see as much of an impact. 

A source close to the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details said the trade environment didn't force Skechers into a deal and that 3G Capital had been interested in acquiring the company for years.

Tariffs do present some uncertainty in the short term, but 3G Capital believes the long-term outlook of Skechers' business remains attractive and is well positioned for growth, the person said.

Skechers is the third-largest footwear company in the world behind Nike and Adidas.

Greenberg will stay on as Skechers' CEO and continue enacting the company's strategy after the acquisition is completed.

The world's 25 most valuable soccer teams are worth an average of $2.76 billion, according to CNBC's Official Global Soccer Valuations 2025.

On average, the 25 most valuable teams generated revenue of $520 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $54 million last season, according to CNBC's valuations. For the 22 European teams on CNBC's list, figures are for the 2023-24 season. For the three U.S. teams, figures are for the 2024 Major League Soccer season.

Soccer valuations are far behind the National Football League, in which the average team is worth $6.5 billion, and the National Basketball Association, in which the average team is worth $4.7 billion, but are ahead of Major League Baseball, at an average of $2.6 billion, and the National Hockey League, at a $1.9 billion average, according to CNBC's valuations.

The most valuable team is Real Madrid, worth $6.7 billion, according to CNBC's calculations. The Spanish team posted revenue of $1.13 billion. Manchester City had the second-most revenue, at $902 million. According to the 2025 Deloitte Football Money League report, Real Madrid's revenue increased 26% from the 2022-23 season, in part because the completion of renovations to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium fueled a doubling of match-day revenue to $268 million.

In addition, according to Real Madrid's annual report last year, the club earned $174 million from the Champions League competition, which the team won in 2024 for a record 15th time.

Two teams on CNBC's list should see their revenue increase soon due to improved stadium economics: Barcelona and MLS' Inter Miami. Barcelona, Real Madrid's archrival, is expected to move back into its upgraded Spotify Camp Nou stadium in the coming months, according to reports. Inter Miami will be moving into the new Miami Freedom Park in 2026, according to the team.

CNBC's Official Global Soccer Team Valuations list for 2025 includes 11 English teams, three of which are in the top five. This is in large part because the Premier League has the richest broadcasting deals in soccer, with its domestic and international rights worth an annual average of about $4.4 billion, according to a person familiar with the leagues' broadcasting deals, who asked to remain unnamed in order to speak freely about nonpublic information. That is more than double what No. 2 Spain's La Liga gets, the person added. The Premier League's next three-year broadcasting rights cycle, beginning with the 2025-26 season, will average about $5.1 billion a year, the person said.

Here is CNBC's methodology for ranking the world's most valuable soccer teams.

In this article

The Berkshire Hathaway board voted unanimously on Sunday to make Greg Abel president and CEO on Jan. 1, 2026, and for Warren Buffett, 94, to remain as chairman, the company said.

Buffett shocked Berkshire shareholders and Abel by announcing in the final minutes of the company's annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he would be asking the board to replace him as CEO at year-end with the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations for Berkshire.

Buffett, who is both chairman and CEO, did not make it clear at the time whether this would mean he would relinquish the chairman title as well, although he did say he would be hanging around to help where he could. Buffett did make clear that the final word on company operations and capital deployment would be with Abel, 62, when this transition takes place.

However, with Buffett staying as chairman, shareholders may be comforted that the ""Oracle of Omaha"" will remain to help Abel with any big acquisition opportunities that may arise in possible volatile markets ahead as the conglomerate Buffett took over in 1965 sits on more than $347 billion in cash.

""I could be helpful, I believe, in that in certain respects, if we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything,"" Buffett said on Saturday.

Berkshire shares were down only about 2% in premarket trading, even after Buffett said he would be stepping down eventually as CEO and as the company reported somewhat disappointing earnings over the weekend. Berkshire also warned about the uncertainty to its outlook that tariffs could bring.

Berkshire shares closed at a record Friday with a market value of more than $1.1 trillion, bucking the recent stock market downturn.

Abel has been the designated CEO successor to Buffett since 2021. The board vote result was first reported by CNBC's Becky Quick early Monday.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday sketched out the roadmap of President Donald Trump's ""America First Vision"" in a pitch to a roomful of global investors on the future of the United States economy.

""We have uprooted government waste and harmful regulations. We have planted the seeds of private investment. And we have fertilized the ground with fresh tax legislation. Next, we harvest. And we want you to harvest with us,"" Bessent said in a speech at the Milken Institute Global Conference.

The Cabinet secretary highlighted tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation as the three core components of Trump's economic agenda, echoing his op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal earlier Monday morning.

But where that piece prioritized boosting Main Street alongside Wall Street, Bessent's remarks to the private-jet crowd at the Milken conference were an explicit appeal to a tiny group of ultra-wealthy investors and entrepreneurs.

""The administration's goal is to make it even more appealing for investors like you,"" Bessent said.

Bessent's remarks came as markets eagerly await developments about the high-level negotiations with numerous trading partners that the administration insists are proceeding apace behind the scenes.

In an interview on CNBC's ""Money Movers"" after the speech, Bessent said he believes the U.S. is ""very close to some deals.""

""As President Trump said last night on Air Force One, maybe as early as this week,"" he said.

He added that there could be ""substantial progress in the coming weeks"" with China, even as the U.S. maintains embargo-level tariffs on the top exporter.

Trump's claim that dozens of countries were eagerly seeking to make deals with the U.S. was used to justify his decision on April 9 to abruptly scale back his so-called reciprocal tariff plan just hours after it took effect.

He placed a 90-day pause on most of the high tariff rates that had been unveiled a week earlier on what he touted as America's ""liberation day."" Instead, Trump swapped in a 10% tariff across the board, though he raised the import duty on China to an effective 145%.

Since implementing the tariff pause, the Trump administration has consistently signaled that a slew of revamped trade deals with individual countries are in the pipeline.

Trump in an April 22 interview said he has ""made 200 deals,"" and that his administration would be ""finished"" negotiating in as little as three weeks. His top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, repeatedly said that the U.S. could strike 90 deals in 90 days.

More than three weeks after Trump pulled back on his sweeping tariffs, no deals have been announced. But administration officials strongly hinted that a deal was quickly shaping up with India, whose prime minister, Narendra Modi, has close ties with Trump and recently met with Vice President JD Vance to discuss trade.

Australia and New Zealand vowed to advocate for their film industries on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a plan to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made movies.

Australia and New Zealand have emerged as popular filming locations for Hollywood movies in recent years, given lower costs and tax incentives from federal and state governments.

Earlier, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that it was due to incentives offered by other countries to lure filmmakers that the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"".

He said he was authorizing the relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.

Australia's home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said he had spoken to the head of government body Screen Australia, which offers funding to support the development, production and marketing of screen content, about the proposed tariffs.

""Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,"" Burke said in a statement.

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the government was awaiting further details on the proposed tariffs.

""We'll have to see the detail of what actually ultimately emerges. But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,"" he said.

The Australian film and television sector was worth over A$4 billion ($2.58 billion) in 2022, according to the country's statistics bureau.

Australia was the filming location for the Matrix franchise and is a permanent base for studios, including Marvel, while New Zealand is best known as the filming location of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.

The Australian government has committed A$540 million in tax incentives since 2019 to attract international productions, with the bulk going to Hollywood movies such as Marvel's ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", Universal's ""The Fall Guy"" and Legendary Pictures' ""Godzilla vs Kong"".

In New Zealand, the film sector generates NZ$3.5 billion ($2 billion) annually, with around a third of revenue coming from the U.S., its foreign ministry said in a March 2025 report.

Just weeks after announcing a 100% withholding rate on new overpayments of benefits, the Social Security Administration has slashed the rate down to 50% for certain beneficiaries.

Yet that clawback on monthly benefit checks may still cause a financial burden for individuals who are affected, experts say.

For new overpayment notices sent on or after April 25, the 50% default withholding rate will apply to so-called Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors and disability insurance, according to an emergency message released by the Social Security Administration.

The withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains 10%.

""Obviously, it's better not to lose all of your income,"" said Kate Lang, director of federal income security at Justice in Aging, a national organization focused on fighting senior poverty.

""But if you're relying on your benefits to pay your rent or your mortgage and buy food, losing half of that income is going to be devastating and can still result in people becoming homeless,"" Lang said.

Beneficiaries may owe the Social Security Administration money due to overpayments — when their monthly benefit checks are more than what they are owed. The erroneous payments can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if a beneficiary fails to report a change in their circumstances to the agency or if the agency does not process information promptly or enters errors in its data.

When the Social Security Administration determines a beneficiary has been overpaid, a notice is sent to request a full and immediate refund, according to the agency.

Beneficiaries typically have 90 days to request a lower rate of withholding, a reconsideration or waiver of recovery. If they do not make such a request within that 90-day window, the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the sum of the amount that was overpaid is fully recovered, according to the agency's update.

The Social Security Administration had previously announced that it would increase the default withholding rate for overpayments to 100%. Under President Joe Biden's administration, the default withholding rate had been dropped to 10% of a beneficiary's monthly benefit or $10 — whichever was greater. Generally, the rate beneficiaries are subject to is based on the terms at the time they were notified.

""In the last 100 days, we've gone from as low as 10 [percent] to 100 and now to 50,"" said Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans.

The 100% withholding rate was ""ridiculously draconian and cruel,"" Fiesta said. The Social Security Administration had said the change to that full recovery rate would generate about $7 billion in program savings in the next decade, based on estimates from the chief actuary.

Yet even with the default withholding rate cut in half, beneficiaries may still struggle financially.

""Losing 50% [of benefits] for a lot of people could put them into immediate economic hardship,"" Fiesta said.

In most cases, it wasn't the beneficiary's fault that they were overpaid, Fiesta said. ""They shouldn't be put in a worse situation because of something they never caused in the first place,"" he said.

While beneficiaries do have the ability to negotiate the payments, there is no guarantee they will be successful and the outcomes may vary, according to Lang.

""There are thousands of employees that individual beneficiaries are going to be dealing with to ask for a waiver or ask to negotiate a different repayment rate,"" Lang said. ""And those employees have a lot of discretion in what they decide.""

Beneficiaries who are dealing with overpayment issues also face long wait times to make an appointment to visit a Social Security Administration office, which can interfere with their ability to exercise the options available to them, she said.

The Social Security Administration did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

As sky-high tariffs kill U.S. orders for Chinese goods, the country has been striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market — a move that threatens to drive the world's second-largest economy into deeper deflation.

Local Chinese governments and major businesses have voiced support to help tariff-hit exporters redirect their products to the domestic market for sale. JD.com, Tencent and Douyin, TikTok's sister app in China, are among the e-commerce giants promoting sales of these goods to Chinese consumers.

Sheng Qiuping, vice commerce minister, in a statement last month described China's vast domestic market as a crucial buffer for exporters in weathering external shocks, urging local authorities to coordinate efforts in stabilizing exports and boosting consumption.

""The side effect is a ferocious price war among Chinese firms,"" said Yingke Zhou, senior China economist at Barclays Bank.

JD.com, for instance, has pledged 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) to help exporters and has set up a dedicated section on its platform for goods originally intended for U.S. buyers, with discounts of up to 55%.

An influx of discounted goods intended for the U.S. market would also erode companies' profitability, which in turn would weigh on employment, Zhou said. Uncertain job prospects and worries over income stability have already been contributing to weak consumer demand. 

After hovering just above zero in 2023 and 2024, the consumer price index slipped into negative territory, declining for two straight months in February and March. The producer price index fell for a 29th consecutive month in March, down 2.5% from a year earlier, to clock its steepest decline in four months.

As the trade war knocks down export orders, deflation in China's wholesale prices will likely deepen to 2.8% in April, from 2.5% in March, according to a team of economists at Morgan Stanley. ""We believe the tariff impact will be the most acute this quarter, as many exporters have halted their production and shipments to the U.S.""

For the full year, Shan Hui, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs, expects China's CPI to fall to 0%, from a 0.2% year-on-year growth in 2024, and PPI to decline by 1.6% from a 2.2% drop last year.

""Prices will need to fall for domestic and other foreign buyers to help absorb the excess supply left behind by U.S. importers,"" Shan said, adding that manufacturing capacity may not adjust quickly to ""sudden tariff increases,"" likely worsening the overcapacity issues in some industries. 

Goldman projects China's real gross domestic product to grow just 4.0% this year, even as Chinese authorities have set the growth target for 2025 at ""around 5%.""

U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on imported Chinese goods to 145% this year, the highest level in a century, prompting Beijing to retaliate with additional levies of 125%. Tariffs at such prohibitive levels have severely hit trade between the two countries.

The concerted efforts from Beijing to help exporters offload goods impacted by U.S. tariffs may not be anything more than a stopgap measure, said Shen Meng, director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co.

The loss of access to the U.S. market has deepened strains on Chinese exporters, piling onto weak domestic demand, intensifying price wars, razor-thin margins, payment delays and high return rates.

""For exporters that were able to charge higher prices from American consumers, selling in China's domestic market is merely a way to clear unsold inventory and ease short-term cash-flow pressure,"" Shen said: ""There is little room for profits.""

The squeezed margins may force some exporting companies to close shop, while others might opt to operate at a loss, just to keep factories from sitting idle, Shen said.

As more firms shut down or scale back operations, the fallout will spill into the labor market. Goldman Sachs' Shan estimates that 16 million jobs, over 2% of China's labor force, are involved in the production of U.S.-bound goods.

The Trump administration last week ended the ""de minimis"" exemptions that had allowed Chinese e-commerce firms like Shein and Temu to ship low-value parcels into the U.S. without paying tariffs.

""The removal of the de minimis rule and declining cashflow are pushing many small and medium-sized enterprises toward insolvency,"" said Wang Dan, China director at political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group, warning that job losses are mounting in export-reliant regions.

She estimates the urban unemployment rate to reach an average 5.7% this year, above the official 5.5% target, Wang said.

Surging exports in the past few years have helped China offset the drag from a property slump that has hit investment and consumer spending, strained government finances and the banking sector.

The property-sector ills, coupled with the prohibitive U.S. tariffs, mean ""the economy is set to face two major drags simultaneously,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a recent note, warning that the risk is a ""worse-than-expected demand shock.""

Despite the mounting calls for more robust stimulus, many economists believe Beijing will likely wait to see concrete signs of economic deterioration before it exercises fiscal firepower.

""Authorities do not view deflation as a crisis, instead, [they are] framing low prices as a buffer to support household savings during a period of economic transition,"" Eurasia Group's Wang said.

When asked about the potential impact of increased competition within China's market, Peking University professor Justin Yifu Lin said Beijing can use fiscal, monetary and other targeted policies to boost purchasing power.

""The challenge the U.S. faces is larger than China's,"" he told reporters on April 21 in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. Lin is dean of the Institute of New Structural Economics.

He expects the current tariff situation would be resolved soon, but did not share a specific timeframe. While China retains production capabilities, Lin said it would take at least a year or two for the U.S. to reshore manufacturing, meaning American consumers would be hit by higher prices in the interim.

President Donald Trump on Sunday announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a ""very fast death"" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers.

""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,"" Trump said on Truth Social.

Trump said he was authorizing the relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100% tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.

He added: ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X: ""We're on it.""

Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on how the tariffs would be implemented.

It was unclear if the tariffs would apply to movies on streaming services as well as those shown in theaters, or if they would be calculated based on production costs or box office revenue. Hollywood executives were trying to sort out details on Sunday night. The Motion Picture Association, which represents the major studios, had no immediate comment.

In January, Trump appointed Hollywood veterans Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson to bring Hollywood back ""bigger, better and stronger than ever before.""

Movie and TV production has been exiting Hollywood for years, heading to locations with tax incentives that make filming cheaper.

Governments around the world have increased credits and cash rebates to attract productions and capture a greater share of the $248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.

All major media companies, including Walt Disney DIS.N, Netflix NFLX.O and Universal Pictures CMCSA.O, film overseas in countries such as Canada and Britain.

Shares in Disney, Warner Bros Discovery WBD.O, Paramount GlobalPARA.O and Amazon.com AMZN.Owere lower in early trade on Monday.

On Monday, leaders in Australia and New Zealand responded to Trump's tariff announcement by saying they would advocate for their local industries. Some Marvel superhero movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was the backdrop for ""The Lord of the Rings"" films.

The British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the government to move swiftly to protect the country's ""vital"" film industry.

""These tariffs, coming after COVID and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering,"" said Bectu head Philippa Childs.

She said they would also threaten tens of thousands of jobs of freelancers who make films in the UK.

Film and high-end TV production in the UK was worth 5.6 billion pounds ($7.45 billion) in 2024, a 31% increase over 2023, according to the British Film Institute.

The government's Department for Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

In 2023, about half of the spending by U.S. producers on movie and TV projects with budgets of more than $40 million went outside the U.S., according to research firm ProdPro.

""I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),"" said Scott Roxborough, Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter.

Film and television production has fallen by nearly 40% over the last decade in Hollywood's home city of Los Angeles, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region's production.

The January wildfires accelerated concerns that producers may look outside Los Angeles, and that camera operators, costume designers, sound technicians and other behind-the-scenes workers may move out of town rather than try to rebuild in their neighborhoods.

A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most preferred place to film in the next two years, behind Toronto, Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia.

Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state's tax incentives to better compete with other locations.

Trump's proposed movie tariff follows a series of trade conflicts initiated by his administration, which have roiled markets and led to fears of a U.S. recession.

Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump's film tariffs would be devastating.

""The retaliation will kill our industry. We have a lot more to lose than to gain,"" he said, adding it would be difficult to make a national security or national emergency case for movies.

President Donald Trump again is downplaying the threat of supply shortages from his tariffs, even if it means fewer toys for American children.

""All I'm saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old-girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old-girl, doesn't need 37 dolls,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.

""She could be very happy with two or three or four or five,"" Trump said.

The comments are the third time in less than a week that the president has brushed aside concerns about the effect on U.S. consumers from his new steep tariffs on China, and suggested that Americans should be comfortable with fewer things.

""I'm just saying [Americans] don't need to have 30 dolls, they can have three,"" Trump told NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker during an interview that aired Sunday.

""They don't need to have 250 pencils,"" he said. ""They can have five.""

Days earlier, Trump acknowledged during a Cabinet meeting that Americans could see emptier shelves because of his tariffs.

But he insisted that China would still struggle more from the 145% tariff he imposed on imports from that nation.

""Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.""

Trump's comments have drawn strong pushback from critics who have painted a picture of a billionaire as out of touch with everyday Americans.

""Billionaires like Trump and [Elon] Musk and do not have a clue about what it means for a working-class family trying to buy presents for the kids or to take care of the basic necessities,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on CNN last week.

""It's an incredible arrogance and ignorance on the part of these people,"" Sanders added.

Republican strategist Karl Rove told Fox News on Sunday that Trump sounds like ""Mr. Scrooge"" when he talks about the possibility of fewer toys for Americans because of his tariffs.

Trump fired back at that later Sunday, writing on Truth Social: ""I don't need to have Karl Rove of Fox News to tell me what to do.""

The S&P 500 moved lower to start the week as investors monitored the latest developments on global trade, including another surprise set of tariffs from President Donald Trump.

The broad-market index shed 0.2%, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped about 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 115 points, or nearly 0.3%, meanwhile.

The major indexes cut losses after data Monday from the Institute for Supply Management reflected stronger-than-expected service sector activity in April, even as company executives reported rising concern about tariffs. At its lows, the Dow fell as much as 253.99 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost around 1% each before rebounding.

Sentiment also improved after Bloomberg reported, citing sources, that India has proposed zero tariffs on steel, auto components and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis and up to a certain amount of imports.

Investors remain uncertain about the timeline of tariff deals between the U.S. and other countries.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Monday that ""we're very close to some deals,"" echoing comments from Trump on Sunday that deals could come as early as this week.

Trump told reporters on Sunday that ""we're negotiating with many countries, but at the end of this, I'll set my own deals — because I set the deal, they don't set the deal."" Trump added that has no plans to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping, dashing hopes that progress is being made to ease U.S.-China trade tensions.

Trump on Sunday also authorized relevant government agencies to begin imposing a 100% tariff on films produced abroad, calling efforts from other nations to attract film productions a ""national security threat."" It remains unclear if the levies would impact movies shown in theaters or movies on streaming services. Shares of Walt Disney and Netflix, which are companies that film abroad, traded lower on Monday.

""I am worried, I was hoping trade deals would be announced by now. They're not. I don't think the impact has hit us yet,"" said Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and Wisdom Tree chief economist.

Wall Street is looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting beginning on Tuesday, with a rate decision expected Wednesday. Fed funds futures trading points to just a 3.2% chance of a rate cut, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Still, traders are keeping a close eye on any commentary from the central bank or Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the outlook for the economy amid heightened uncertainty stemming from the trade war. 

Last week, sentiment ran higher on hopes for a U.S. trade deal with major trading partners. The S&P 500 advanced nearly 1.5% on Friday, its ninth straight day of gains — its longest winning run since November 2004.

Goldman Sachs now expects U.S. crude oil prices averaging $56 per barrel this year, down $3 from its previous forecast due to OPEC+ rapidly increasing supply to the global market.

The group of eight producers, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed on Saturday to surge supply by 411,000 barrels per day in June, after previously making a decision to do the same in May. 

""Our key conviction remains that high spare capacity and high recession risk skew the risks to oil prices to the downside despite relatively tight spot fundamentals,"" Daan Struyven, head of Goldman's oil research, told clients in a Sunday note. 

U.S. crude oil prices were last down 87 cents, or 1.49%, to $57.42 a barrel. Prices are down about 20% this year.

Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. could strike trade agreements in the coming days but he did not identify specific countries where talks were closest to the finish line. 

""We're very close to some deals. As President Trump said last night on Air Force One, maybe as early as this week,"" Bessent told CNBC on ""Money Movers.""

The Treasury leader did indicate that China is still further away from a potential deal and that formal discussions with that country have not begun. 

""I think we could see substantial progress in the coming weeks, we'll see,"" Bessent said on China.

India has proposed removing tariffs up to a certain limit for steel, auto components and pharmaceuticals as it seeks to strike a trade deal with the U.S. ahead of the July deadline for reciprocal tariffs, according to a report.

The deal would apply to a set threshold, after which normal tariffs could apply, according to the report from Bloomberg News, which cited people familiar with the matter.

In recent days, U.S. officials have said they are near a deal with several nations, citing India as one potential agreement that could be reached soon. The report said Indian officials floated the proposal when they visited Washington in late April.

—Jeff Cox

Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman told Bloomberg News that he believes President Donald Trump is using tariffs in a ""tactical way"" but said the president should take more steps to reduce or further delay the potential damage to American companies.

""He did the right thing in pausing reciprocal tariffs for 90 days ... and I think the next step probably should be, I call it a 180-day pause, [and] take down the China tariffs,"" Ackman said.

Ackman also said that most companies in his portfolio, outside of Nike, do not face major direct impacts from tariffs.

Service sector activity in April was stronger than expected even as company executives reported rising concern about tariffs, according to a report Monday from the Institute for Supply Management.

The ISM services reading came in at 51.6, up 0.8 points from March and better than the Dow Jones estimate for 50.4. The index measures the percentage of companies reporting expansion, so anything about 50 is considered a sign of growth.

Within the survey, indexes measuring new orders, inventories, export orders, employment and backlogs all saw growth. Imports tumbled 8.3 points to 44.3, following a March in which purchase and supply managers increased orders ahead of President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement.

Commentary from respondents reflected worry over tariffs, with many noting a general sense of uncertainty and being forced to grapple with higher prices.

Footwear company Skechers USA has agreed to go private in a $9 billion deal.

Investment firm 3G Capital will pay $63 per share in cash for the outstanding stock, which is a 30% premium from the stock's 15-day volume-weighted average, the company said.

Skechers shares jumped about 25% on the news. Prior to the deal being announced, Skechers shares have been underperforming the market, with a decline of 26% year to date.

Other footwear stocks were trading higher as well. Crocs was up nearly 3%, while Deckers gained more than 1%. The sector, which produces many products outside the U.S., has been hard-hit by tariff news. Most stocks have logged double-digits declines in 2025.

Streaming companies were trading lower in Monday's premarket hours after President Donald Trump announced in a Sunday Truth Social post a 100% tariff on movies produced outside of the U.S. to save the ""dying"" American movie industry.

""The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,"" he wrote. ""This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!""

Trump added: ""WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!""

Berkshire Hathaway's board on Sunday voted unanimously to make Greg Abel president and chief executive of the conglomerate come Jan. 1, 2026, while keeping Warren Buffett as chairman, sources told CNBC's Becky Quick.

This comes after Buffett shocked Berkshire shareholders at the company's annual meeting Saturday, saying in the last few minutes that he would recommend the board vote to make Abel CEO by year-end.

Investors came into this earnings season looking for clues on how companies plan to adjust to higher U.S. tariffs and guidance on how it would impact them. RBC's Lori Calvasina doesn't think much new information was provided during last week's deluge. 

""On tariffs, we didn't learn too much in the way of new information after the prior week's avalanche of Industrials earnings,"" wrote the firm's head of U.S. equity strategy. ""With a heavier dose of Tech companies taking the spotlight from the Industrials sector, the tariff discussions overall seemed a bit less front and center as well. Positive comments on tariffs tended to emphasize mitigation strategies, footprint adjustments either in the future or the past, pricing, USMCA compliance, and an ability to manage through.""

""More negative comments tended to center on fluidity of the policy backdrop, heightened uncertainty, and a difficulty in knowing where the policy will settle. We don't have a great feel for the exact contours at the moment, but have been paying close attention to discussions of the timing of impacts for when mitigation strategies go into effect or stop having an impact,"" Calvasina added.

More than 160 S&P 500 companies reported earnings last week, including megacaps Apple and Amazon.

U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 4% on Sunday, after OPEC+ agreed to surge production for a second month.

U.S. crude was down $2.49, or 4.27%, to $55.80 a barrel shortly after trading opened. Global benchmark Brent fell $2.39, or 3.9%, to $58.90 per barrel. Oil prices have fallen more than 20% this year. 

The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed on Saturday to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. The decision comes a month after OPEC+ surprised the market by agreeing to surge production in May by the same amount.

Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy (MSTR) added modestly to its bitcoin holdings last week.

The company purchased 1,895 BTC for $180.3 million, or an average price of $95,167 each, according to a Monday morning SEC filing.

The buys were funded via sales $128.5 million of common stock and $51.8 million of STRK preferred stock. The common stock sale notably used up the remainder of MSTR's 2024 $21 billion at-the-market offering. MSTR last week introduced a new $21 billion ATM offering.

Strategy now holds 555,450 bitcoin purchased for $38.08 billion, or an average price of $68,550 each. At bitcoin's current price around $94,000, the holdings are worth north of $52 billion.

MSTR is lower by 2.7% in premarket action.

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired 1,895 Bitcoin worth $180 million last week, capping off a $21 billion at-the-money equity offering program unveiled in October, according to a filing on Monday.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns roughly 555,500 Bitcoin worth $52.4 billion, based on current prices, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase represented its smallest acquisition of the asset since the first week of January.

Strategy funded its most recent purchase by selling $52 million worth of so-called perpetual “STRK” preferred stock and $128.5 million worth of common shares. Although Strategy can still issue $20.87 billion worth of preferred stock, it said it can no longer sell common stock through the equity offering program that “has been substantially depleted” over the past six months.

Strategy, however, doubled down on its ambitions to buy as much Bitcoin as possible during its first-quarter earnings call last week, unveiling a similar equity offering program, in which the company will sell another $21 billion in common shares. Strategy also plans to issue $21 billion in corporate debt, targeting a total of $84 billion in under three years.

The Bitcoin treasury firm, which also has a software business, meanwhile disclosed a $5.9 billion loss, due to a decrease in the value of its Bitcoin holdings in the first quarter. 

Strategy's stock price fell 4.6% on Monday to $376 per share, according to Yahoo Finance. Alongside Bitcoin's recovery to $94,000 from as low as $74,800, Strategy's shares have surged 29% over the past month.

On Friday, analysts at asset manager Bernstein reiterated an “Outperform” rating for Strategy with a price target of $600 per share, highlighting the firm's ability to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisition plans, despite headwinds from the latest market correction. 

The analysts also wrote that Strategy continues to serve as a Bitcoin proxy for institutional investors that may not be able to get exposure to the asset through vehicles like exchange-traded funds tracking the asset's spot price.

“MSTR continues to hyper-scale its Bitcoin acquisition strategy,” Bernstein analysts wrote. “We continue to like MSTR as the most scalable Bitcoin vehicle tapping into large institutional pools unable to access Bitcoin/spot ETFs.”

Benchmark Senior Research Analyst Mark Palmer reiterated a “Buy” rating for Strategy last week, stating his $650 price target for Strategy's shares was partly based on Strategy's “ability to accelerate its accumulation of bitcoin.”

“Strategy's Bitcoin acquisition strategy has continued to grow rapidly,” he wrote, calling the company's $84 billion capital-raising target ""audacious.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Wants to Make Ethereum Simpler Ahead of Pectra Upgrade","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/05/vitalik-buterin-wants-to-make-ethereum-as-simple-as-bitcoin","Mon, 05 May 2025 12:15:17 GMT","

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is calling for a major simplification of the protocol, aiming to reduce its complexity to a level closer to Bitcoin's while preserving its unique strengths in programmability and scalability.

In a blog post published Saturday, Buterin argued that Ethereum's growing technical sprawl — from its consensus mechanisms to its virtual machine — has made it harder to maintain, audit, and onboard new developers.

He proposed a multi-year strategy to shrink Ethereum's “consensus-critical” codebase and reduce the risk that the protocol becomes too technocratic and fragile.

“Even a smart high school student is capable of fully wrapping their head around and understanding the Bitcoin protocol,” Buterin wrote. “A programmer can write a client as a hobby project.”

Ethereum's base layer has become increasingly complex due to feature additions, new consensus designs, and legacy code requirements. While this has enabled powerful use cases like smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, it has also increased the risk of bugs, made protocol upgrades harder, and raised the barrier for new developers.

In contrast, bitcoin's core protocol remains relatively unchanged and minimal: blocks, transactions, proof-of-work, and coin outputs.

Area of simplification proposed by Buterin includes an overhaul of Ethereum's current consensus layer (the “beacon chain”), which involves complex mechanics like epochs, slot shuffling, and sync committees.

Another is patching the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) incrementally, but eventually replacing it entirely with a simpler virtual machine like RISC-V. This lightweight, open standard could bring performance boosts for zero-knowledge provers and drastically reduce code complexity.

However, one of the main challenges is preserving backwards compatibility with existing Ethereum applications.

Buterin outlined a phased approach where the current EVM and the new VM could run side-by-side, and legacy functionality could be moved into “non-consensus” layers.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed replacing Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM) with RISC-V, aiming to boost the chain's performance while making it simpler in the process.

Buterin, in a May 3 blog post, claimed that through the proposed changes, Ethereum could ""become close to as simple as Bitcoin"" within five years.

""One of the best things about Bitcoin is how beautifully simple the protocol is,"" Buterin wrote, describing how Bitcoin transactions and proofs work.

Keeping the protocol simple brings benefits that are key to making it ""a credibly neutral and globally trusted base layer,"" Buterin wrote.

The proposed transition to RISC-V would see an open-source instruction set defining how software communicates with processors.

For Ethereum, the change would make Ethereum run faster by cutting out extra translation steps. Applications could work directly on the execution layer, potentially making some operations up to 100 times faster while keeping existing smart contracts working.

By contrast, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is custom-built for Ethereum and requires translation to other formats first, slowing processes.

RISC-V, meanwhile, can handle operations directly and is ""simpler to reason about,” potentially ""increasing the number of people who understand and can participate in protocol research,"" Buterin claims.

If applied to Ethereum, RISC-V could also decrease ""the cost of creating new infrastructure,"" reduce ""long-term protocol maintenance costs,"" the ""risk of catastrophic bugs,"" and minimize the ""social attack surface"" with fewer moving parts, Buterin explained.

Despite these ambitions, Buterin admits his failures at improving Ethereum.

The network has often not done this ""sometimes because of my own decisions,"" and not doing so has led to actions done ""in pursuit of benefits that have proven illusory,"" he wrote.

Buterin's latest proposal could ""break backward compatibility, demand massive developer retraining, and rely on immature tooling,"" Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, told Decrypt.

Ethereum's governance also ""requires broad consensus across fragmented stakeholders, a massive coordination challenge."" John said.

Still, some see potential for Ethereum beyond its market value.

""Price isn't the scoreboard for technological maturity."" Thad Pinakiewicz, researcher at Galaxy, wrote in a newsletter on Friday afternoon. ""Ethereum isn't failing because the price is flat. It's succeeding because it's laying down infrastructure others are copying.""

Crypto traders aiming to profit from a volatility surge should watch the Binance-listed ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio, which could soon experience wild swings, according to a key indicator called Bollinger Bands.

Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day simple moving average of an asset's price.

The so-called Bollinger band squeeze occurs when the bands contract tightly around the price, suggesting low volatility and a period of consolidation. The market typically builds energy during the squeeze, which is eventually released in either direction, leading to a volatility explosion.

The Bollinger Bands on the ETH-BTC chart are now the tightest they have been since June 2020, according to TradingView.

The squeeze indicates that ether could soon experience increased volatility against BTC. Traders watch closely to see which way the price breaks out of the bands because, often, the big move happens in the same direction.

The volatility bullish signal comes as Ethereum's Pectra upgrade, which aims to improve the blockchain's scalability and validator operations and may sput market activity.

The impending upgrade, due May 7, greatly increases the maximum ETH a validator can stake, from 32 ETH up to 2,048 ETH. It also raises the number of ""blob"" data units per block from 3 to 6, allowing for a maximum of 9. Additionally, the upgrade will start the transition to the EVM Object Format (EOF), a new structure designed to make smart contracts more efficient.

""Layer-2 networks stand to benefit the most. By doubling blob capacity and making call data more expensive, Pectra solidifies blobs as the standard for rollup data posting. This reinforces Ethereum's role as a data availability layer and strengthens its rollup-centric scaling strategy,"" analytics firm Nansen said in a report shared with CoinDesk.

""DeFi will also see a lift,"" the firm noted, saying, NFTs and blockchain games may benefit from the broader improvements.

A widely followed crypto analyst thinks that two altcoins have strong fundamental narratives while flashing bullish price action.

Pseudonymous trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,400 followers on the social media platform X that the native assets of Curve DAO (CRV) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are among the few “solid” altcoins in crypto.

Curve Finance is a stablecoin-focused ecosystem, specializing in the efficient and low-slippage trading of dollar-pegged crypto assets. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid is a layer-1 protocol serving a decentralized exchange (DEX).

Says Altcoin Sherpa,

“But if you're an investor that relies on these types of fundamentals, there are a few good ones like CRV and HYPE, those charts look pretty solid overall.”

At time of writing, HYPE is worth $20.55

At time of writing, CRV is worth $0.697.

Turning to the memecoin Bonk (BONK), the trader says he plans to accumulate the altcoin at current levels.

“Staying patient for BONK and would love to buy in the green box if it gives.”

At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.0000164.

As for Bitcoin, the trader says BTC looks bullish on the high time frame after the crypto king retested the $74,000 level as support.

“Higher time frame view of BTC: higher low formed in that chop period, it was similar to that May 2021 area where price formed a low. 

I think it's a great low given the amount of time (two months) and volatility that we saw. While there are going to be some small pullbacks, I think we strongly break $100,000 in the next several weeks as long as equities don't completely sh** the bed (sadly, I see a lot of lower high / it's over type of posts).”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,921.

You're scrolling through X late at night, and suddenly you see it, another influencer dropping a token name you've never heard of. 

Lately, those names aren't top-tier coins, they're micro-cap altcoins trading under $0.05. That's where the real momentum is building. 

The best altcoins to buy now are the ones catching attention before they explode, like Dawgz AI, a low-cost presale getting early traction for its AI-focused utility. 

Let's take a closer look at the ones influencers are already watching.

You won't always see these coins on front-page lists, but scroll through crypto Twitter for a bit, and you'll notice something: the same low-cap altcoins keep showing up in threads, replies, and alpha groups. 

Here are a few tokens under $0.05 that influencers are already stacking behind the scenes:

Dawgz AI feels like one of those coins you hear about right before it takes off. Influencers aren't blasting it publicly yet, but it's showing up in Discord calls and low-key Twitter spaces. 

It's got just the right mix: presale pricing, Ethereum-based tokenomics, staking rewards, and AI-powered tools built into the roadmap. Plus, over $3.4 million raised and a SolidProof audit doesn't hurt.



Dawgz is priced for early entry, and the traction is already happening while most retail traders are still sleeping on it.

Here's what early buyers and influencers are pointing to when they talk about Dawgz AI under the radar:

For a deeper look into $DAGZ, you can check the video below by Crypto Chino where he explains why Dawgz AI could be one of the top altcoins to invest in this year.



Gala isn't new, but it's still trading under $0.02, and some influencers are betting it's due for a bounce. 

At around $0.0155 with a market cap just under $690M (according to CoinMarketCap), GALA has been quietly rebuilding after its recent contract migration.

What's keeping it on watchlists? The project's gaming ecosystem. Gala continues to build out Web3 games and launch entertainment-focused assets in a market that's slowly circling back to gaming.

Here's why some think GALA's current dip might be an opportunity:

Algorand has been around for years, but some influencers are circling back now that it's dipped under $0.21. 

According to CoinMarketCap, ALGO is currently trading at around $0.206, with a market cap of just under $1.8 billion. While it's not a brand-new altcoin, it's one of the most undervalued L1 networks in terms of adoption vs. price.

What's interesting is that ALGO still sees consistent developer activity, DeFi expansion, and cross-chain integrations, and all of that is happening at a discount right now.

Here's why it's not being ignored despite the dip:



If you've been watching closely, there's been a noticeable shift. The same influencers who used to pump every BTC breakout or ETH ecosystem upgrade are now hunting quiet, early-stage altcoins instead. 

Why? Because the upside on big caps just isn't what it used to be, at least not in the short term.

Early-stage altcoins, especially those priced under $0.05, let influencers build positions before the retail wave hits. The lower the market cap, the higher the potential multiple. Plus, these coins tend to ride momentum fast once social buzz kicks in, it's part strategy, part instinct, and part timing.

Influencers don't need a token to hit $1B to win. They just need to ride a well-positioned project from $5M to $50M and they know their communities will follow once the breadcrumbs are dropped. 

That's why coins like Dawgz AI and other low-cap players are making the rounds in crypto circles before they ever show up on mainstream lists.

When it comes to finding the best altcoins to buy now, most people wait until it's trending. But by then, the real gains are usually gone.

If you're seeing smart money and influencers accumulating quiet, underpriced tokens like Dawgz AI, it's probably worth paying attention.

This market doesn't reward hesitation, it rewards research, timing, and the guts to move before the crowd does.

Dawgz AI might not be in the top 10 by market cap yet, but it's starting to show up in early watchlists. Meanwhile, the current leaders include Ethereum, BNB, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Toncoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Chainlink – the heavyweights of the crypto space.

Dawgz AI is one of the few projects some investors think could deliver outsized returns, thanks to its low entry price and AI-powered utility. As always, 1000x is rare, but historically, those gains have come from small caps with smart timing and community momentum.

Dawgz AI is gaining attention for its strong blend of tech, staking rewards, and meme-driven branding, all wrapped in a low-cost presale. Broader potential also lies in infrastructure altcoins building tools the next bull market will rely on.

Dawgz AI is one of the early picks being mentioned in tight-knit circles as a potential breakout. If the team keeps delivering and the market shifts bullish, it could be among the altcoins leading the next wave in 2025.

[ccpw id=""39382""]

Written By: 





Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed a bold vision for Midnight, Cardano's data protection-focused sidechain, saying it was “built for stocks on the blockchain.”

Speaking alongside Midnight CEO Eran Barak in a May 1 conversation, Hoskinson emphasized that full privacy, programmability, and interoperability are essential to bringing traditional equities into the blockchain era.

Midnight, developed by Input Output Global (IOG), uses zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable confidential smart contracts. Originally framed as a privacy-enhancing protocol, it's now being positioned as a key infrastructure layer for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, especially equities.

“You need a private side, full programmability, RWA standards, and trade across all blockchains and legacy exchanges,” Hoskinson said, underscoring what's needed to onboard global stock markets.

Privacy ensures confidentiality for institutions, programmability allows for complex financial instruments, and interoperability enables seamless trading between blockchains and traditional financial platforms.

According to Hoskinson, this infrastructure opens access to a $10 trillion market today, with the potential to scale toward $100 trillion.

To achieve these goals, Midnight combines several technological frameworks drawn from other networks. Hoskinson explained that the protocol integrates consensus mechanisms inspired by Aptos, development components from the Polkadot SDK, and many features from Cardano itself. 

In addition, the team drew insights from Zcash's approach to privacy, incorporating zero-knowledge cryptography as a core element of Midnight's architecture. This setup allows developers to create confidential smart contracts that prioritize both user privacy and legal compliance. 

Midnight CEO Eran Barak highlighted this as a response to growing concerns about personal data sharing with artificial intelligence. Barak stated that the protocol is designed to allow AI to access private data without breaching ownership rights, offering a controlled, transparent framework for secure data interaction.

Meanwhile, Hoskinson also pointed to stablecoins as a primary use case for Midnight. These assets, he said, already account for over 73% of Ethereum's economic activity and represent over $250 billion in total market size.

Midnight's expansion also includes institutional collaborations. Hoskinson revealed that IOG recently joined the Confidential Computing Consortium under the Linux Foundation, aligning with firms such as Microsoft and Amazon. These organizations are exploring secure hardware enclaves and GPU-based systems for private AI computation. 

The protocol's launch has long been expected to impact the Cardano ecosystem significantly. In December 2024, Hoskinson confirmed that Midnight would make Cardano a multichain network by enabling interoperability with chains such as Ethereum and Solana. 

Hoskinson also disclosed a partnership with Fairgate Labs to advance Midnight's cross-chain vision. This development drew attention from the Cardano community, especially due to IOG's earlier involvement with BitcoinOS. 

Responding to inquiries from an analyst at Angry Crypto Show, Hoskinson clarified that Fairgate created the base technology for BitcoinOS. He also noted that Fairgate does not plan to issue a token, a subject that has caused friction between BitcoinOS and Cardano supporters.

Global cryptocurrency exchange Binance has entered a landmark partnership with the Kyrgyz Republic aimed at accelerating the country's transition toward a digitally empowered economy. The collaboration was formalized on May 4, 2025, during the inaugural meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets in Bishkek, which was attended by President Sadyr Japarov. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Binance and the National Agency for Investments of Kyrgyzstan.

Central to this strategic alliance is the rollout of Binance Pay, a contactless cryptocurrency payment solution that will now be available across Kyrgyzstan. The system is designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and borderless digital transactions for both residents and visitors. It is expected to enhance financial inclusion while also strengthening the region's integration into broader crypto-enabled economic networks, particularly within the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).

Another key component of the partnership is the implementation of national blockchain education programs. Binance Academy will collaborate with Kyrgyz governmental agencies, universities, and financial institutions to introduce tailored curricula and workshops that aim to improve digital and financial literacy. These programs will target a wide range of audiences, from civil servants and banking professionals to entrepreneurs and students.

By investing in human capital, the initiative hopes to cultivate a local ecosystem capable of driving innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and blockchain governance. The programs are part of a larger national push to ensure that Kyrgyzstan's workforce is prepared for the technological demands of a digital-first economy.

In addition to education, Binance will assist Kyrgyzstan in developing a comprehensive digital asset infrastructure. This includes the exploration of blockchain use cases in public sector operations, the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve strategy, and support for the pilot and potential nationwide deployment of the digital som—Kyrgyzstan's central bank digital currency (CBDC).

This partnership aligns with Kyrgyzstan's broader policy objectives of enhancing digital sovereignty and financial resilience. In April 2025, President Japarov signed a constitutional law granting legal tender status to the digital som, making Kyrgyzstan one of the few countries to institutionalize a CBDC through constitutional reform.

Moreover, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has reportedly agreed to serve as an advisor to Kyrgyz officials on matters of blockchain strategy and crypto regulation. His involvement is expected to lend additional technical expertise and global credibility to the country's digital transformation efforts.

As the global crypto landscape continues to evolve, Kyrgyzstan's forward-leaning stance and partnership with Binance may serve as a regional blueprint for how emerging economies can responsibly integrate digital assets into national development strategies.

The move comes in the context of the island nation's efforts to find alternative revenue sources due to growing concerns over its external debt obligations. 

The project, titled the Maldives International Financial Centre, is set to be built in the capital Malé over a five-year period. According to the project's masterplan, the hub will span 830,000 square metres and accommodate up to 6,500 residents while employing around 16,000 people. It is designed to operate as a financial free zone focusing on blockchain technologies and digital assets, with government projections suggesting the initiative could triple the country's GDP within four years and generate over USD 1 billion annually by the fifth year.

 



 

MBS Global Investments, a private family office reportedly managing USD 14 billion in assets, has committed to lead the funding. It's worth noting that the USD 8.8 billion investment surpasses the Maldives' current annual GDP of approximately USD 7 billion. A representative from MBS stated that over USD 4–5 billion in funding has already been secured through a mix of equity and debt, sourced from a network of wealthy individuals and family offices. The official acknowledged the scale of the commitment but said partnerships and financial arrangements were in place to proceed with the plan. 

Officials from the Maldives government view the initiative as a strategic pivot away from dependence on tourism and fisheries. A finance ministry official described the country's current financial strain as its ‘biggest challenge,' pointing to significant repayments due in the next two years. According to the Financial Times, Debt obligations include between USD 600–700 million due in 2025 and a further USD 1 billion in 2026, among them a USD 500 million sukuk. 

The government recently accepted a USD 760 million support package from India to help avoid default, and international ratings agencies continue to highlight the nation's vulnerability to external liquidity shocks. Maldivian officials noted that while traditional partners such as India and China remain significant for infrastructure and aid, the financial hub represents a shift toward a more commercially driven model of development.

 Users' hot wheel NFT collections and the Mattel Digital Collectibles Marketplace will continue operating as usual through 2025, while the company evaluates what to do next. 

Toymaking giant Mattel is putting the brakes on its Hot Wheels Virtual Garage non-fungible tokens, pending a decision on the collection's future.

There will be no future releases of any new NFT series or feature drops for the “foreseeable future,” Mattel said in an update on its website. The company said it will decide on the “long-term future” of Mattel digital collectibles.

“Your unwavering support and enthusiasm for the Hot Wheels Virtual Garage has been legendary, and we're incredibly grateful to have been on this journey with you,” the company said.

“As we evaluate the changing world of virtual collectibles, we've determined the time has come to end our Series and Feature Drops in 2025 and onward.”

In the meantime, users' hot wheel NFT collections, the Mattel Digital Collectibles Marketplace, the community Discord and other channels will continue to operate as normal through at least 2025, according to Mattel.

Holders can still buy, sell and trade their Hot Wheels NFTS on the Mattel Digital Collectibles Marketplace, while existing and outstanding redemptions will be “fulfilled as promised.”

However, there is no option to transfer the NFTs to other wallets or marketplaces at the moment. Mattel says it's exploring possible options around this feature.

“We are developing a long-term plan for Virtual Collectibles and will share updates with the community in the future,” the company said.

Mattel launched series one for its Hot Wheels NFT Garage in November 2021 in partnership with the Worldwide Asset eXchange. The latest release, series 10, went live in December last year.

Mattel isn't the only company winding down its NFT services — sporting footwear and apparel giant Nike sunset its NFT marketplace RTFKT in January. Holders have since launched a lawsuit, alleging Nike has caused them financial harm by shuttering the marketplace.

However, other companies continue to support NFT holders. FIFA, which launched its NFT collection ahead of the 2023 Club World Cup, announced on April 30 that it was creating a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain for its digital collectibles.

The overall NFT market dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plunging 63% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024.

STEPN has formed a partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA) to issue NFT digital sneakers in honor of the legendary football team. For the next two years, the social lifestyle app and the AFA will collaborate to pay tribute to fans with prizes and lotteries, while the Association expands into Web3. 

Summary

The Argentine Football Association (AFA) seems to have chosen the social lifestyle app STEPN to expand into Web3. 

In fact, to honor the legendary football team, STEPN will issue new Genesis NFT digital sneakers, which will unlock real rewards for the fans. 

“STEPN x @Argentina The world saw them lift the trophy. Now, we team up with the champions. We are proud to announce our long-term partnership with the Argentine Football Association, one of the most iconic teams in the history of football. The reigning world champions with the latest three-star logo, the legends of the game, the AFA, inspire the next generation of players! As part of this collaboration, we will launch the Genesis Sneakers in co-branding and unlock exclusive real-life rewards, including autographed jerseys and match tickets. This is just the beginning, stay tuned for more information! #STEPNxAFA – Move like a pro”

The new partnership signed by STEPN and AFA has a duration of two years and includes the issuance of a series of Genesis NFT sneakers that will be distributed among fans through lotteries. 

This is just the beginning for the famous Argentine football team to enter the world of Web3. In this regard, Leandro Petersen, commercial and marketing director of the AFA, stated: 

“The journey of AFA in Web3 continues to grow and thanks to the experience of STEPN, AFA will be able to reach millions of users in the Web3 space with the goal of consolidating the passion and excellence that our team conveys to the next generation of Argentina National Team fans”.

At the same time, STEPN plans to increase its already significant number of registered users in the app. Currently, the move-to-earn project based on Solana has over 5.7 million users globally. 

STEPN GO had launched its own Genesis NFT collection also in collaboration with Adidas, last September 2024. 

It was about 1000 digital sneakers, in the Non-Fungible Token format, which were sold at the price of 10,000 GMT per entry, with a refund for those who would not win. 

Even in that case, STEPN GO had issued its NFT sneakers through a lottery on MOOAR, the NFT marketplace of FSL. 

That of September was only the second phase of the initiative that involved STEPN GO and Adidas, in a bull partnership of a year started in April 2024.

Analysis from blockchain tracker Lookonchain reveals that an investor who participated in Ethereum's initial coin offering (ICO) has traded nearly $30 million worth of ETH after years of dormancy.

In a post on the social media platform X, Lookonchain says that the Ethereum holder awoke from a long slumber to unload thousands of ETH in less than four weeks.

Data shows the entity sending its coins to the crypto exchange Kraken, presumably to be sold.

“The Ethereum ICO participant sold another 1,500 ETH ($1.76 million) again [on May 3rd.]. Since ending a long dormancy on April 17th, [the entity] has sold 16,500 ETH ($29.35 million) at an average price of $1,779 and still holds 13,500 ETH ($24.82 million).”

ETH is trading for $1,830 at time of writing, a 4.8% decrease on the day.

The analytics firm also finds that deep-pocketed holders of the Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin are offloading the asset as well, albeit at a loss.

“Two whales dumped 765,128 TRUMP ($8.58 million) at a loss of $2.34 million! 3kjP9L made $196,000 on TRUMP before, sold 337,560 TRUMP ($3.81 million) [on May 4th] and lost $1.38 million. 

7X6Vun made $732,000 on TRUMP before, sold 427,568 TRUMP ($4.77 million) [on May 4th] and lost $961,000! Not only did they wipe out all previous gains, they also lost ~$1.42 million in principal.” 

TRUMP is trading for $11.00 at time of writing, a 4.55% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, Lookonchain spotted a different whale who went long on Bitcoin (BTC) and a slew of altcoins – including ETH – and is currently sitting in profit.

“A whale has been long BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, XRP, LINK and other 16 tokens in the past month, with a total profit of more than $9 million. Additionally, this whale bought 309 BTC ($24.68 million) at an average price of $79,792, currently sitting on unrealized profits of more than $5 million.”

Turbo is experiencing a significant surge in trading volume today, accompanied by a 12% price rally. 

Due to its recent strong performance, analysts and investors are closely monitoring the project, with projections suggesting the potential for returns of 10x, 20x, or even 50x in the coming months. 

As the market enters its next phase and with growing momentum, Turbo seems well-positioned to capitalize on further upside and is quickly gaining attention as a top contender today.

Meanwhile, some analysts and investors believe that MIND of Pepe could soon follow a similar rally, drawing comparisons to Turbo's current breakout.

Summary

Turbo token has been gaining significant attention in the market lately, and for good reason. Despite being a relatively new project, having launched after 2021, it's making major moves, with volume surging by 101%.

The current volume is nearly equivalent to the token's market cap, signaling heightened interest. For those considering an entry, this could represent a favorable opportunity, as Turbo remains well below its previous all-time highs.

At its peak, Turbo's market cap neared $1 billion, while it currently stands at approximately $375 million. Looking at the 7-day price chart, Turbo has displayed the typical volatility often seen with meme coins.

From April 29 to May 1, the token experienced a downtrend, hitting its lowest point as the selling pressure intensified. However, this dip likely served to clear out weaker holders, laying the groundwork for a potential rebound.

Following this, the token experienced a sharp price spike, indicating renewed buying interest. This rally reached its peak around May 3 before pulling back, but the price remained resilient, which suggests that the bullish sentiment is still intact.

After a brief pullback, Turbo found solid support near $0.0050, signaling that buyers are still actively engaged. This higher low indicates confidence in the market, and just today, the price surged again, aiming to break through the $0.0055 to $0.00575 range.

This growing momentum is a clear sign that buyers are becoming more confident with each dip.

As Turbo transitions from a downtrend to a bullish pattern, marked by higher highs and higher lows, breaking and holding above $0.00575 could confirm a breakout, setting the stage for further upward movement in the coming days.

While Turbo makes waves in the meme coin space, another project gaining attention is MIND of Pepe, which also integrates AI to offer something unique to its investors.

Unlike Turbo, which is AI-generated, MIND of Pepe goes a step further by using Hive-Mind analysis. This sophisticated AI system tracks market sentiment, monitors influencers, and follows trending narratives, providing investors with detailed reports to guide their decisions.

The AI does the heavy lifting, offering clear predictions on which projects are likely to perform well. For those looking for an edge in the meme coin space, MIND of Pepe provides valuable insights and a more data-driven approach to investing.

To ensure secure and efficient asset management, holders of MIND of Pepe or other tokens must select the right wallet. Best Wallet stands out as the ideal choice, offering full support for ERC20 tokens and delivering a seamless user experience.

As a non-custodial solution, it grants users complete control without requiring ID verification or personal documentation, ensuring both convenience and privacy.

Supporting over 60 blockchains, this wallet provides exceptional flexibility along with advanced portfolio management tools.

Additionally, users can earn rewards in the form of BEST tokens by completing daily tasks, making it an excellent option for those looking to generate passive income while growing their holdings.

With MIND of Pepe's presale nearing its conclusion and its ICO raising nearly $9 million so far, investor demand is surging.

With only 25 days left before the presale ends, now could be the ideal time to buy at its lower price of $0.0037515 — with the potential to surge like Turbo once it hits exchanges. Visit MIND of Pepe.

A string of sculptural sanctuaries by architect Ico Parisi on the banks of Lake Como helped cement the area as the heartland of Italian modernism; we explore his work in an article from the Wallpaper* archives


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Leafy Como, whose rolling hills hide luxury villas in every shady grove, happens to be the centre of Italian modernist architecture. It is the centre of Italian modernism not because it has the best buildings – although, despite the developers, there are still some choice examples. It is the centre not because it has the most modernist buildings, far from it – but simply because Como is where the architect and designer Domenico Parisi, known as Ico, started his career.

Born in Palermo in 1916, Parisi studied in Lausanne and then moved to Como in 1935, where he swiftly established himself as one of the area's key architecture and design scene movers and shakers. Upon his arrival, Parisi joined the studio of Giuseppe Terragni, an ambitious promoter of strict rationalism, local modernist pioneer and designer of the (in)famous Casa del Fascio, completed in 1936. Terragni laid firm foundations for modernist Italian architecture, but Parisi took his work to new heights after the war.



At Casa Parisi, a narrow staircase, surrounded with artworks by Parisi, leads to the small second floor

In the following two decades, Como made regular appearances in Italian architecture magazine Domus, thanks to several significant design exhibitions that took place there – including the 1957 show 'Colori e Forme nella Casa d'Oggi' (Colours and Forms in Today's Home), for which husband-and-wife team Ico and Luisa Parisi designed a holiday home concept – as well as the construction of a string of local modernist residences.

Como's Sant' Antonio apartment block and Villa Bolgiana were both designed by Parisi and are both, in their different ways, highly representative of the architect's approach after the war. He and his then-wife-to-be Luisa Aiani established their La Ruota studio in 1948, committed to incorporating all fields of art into a single design expression. These two buildings, and indeed all of Parisi's work, are characterised by a fine integration of sculpture, painting and design.



 An original fire place on the second floor of t he penthouse

Situated in the narrow lanes of Como's Monteolimpino neighbourhood, along with three other Parisi-designed residences, Villa Bolgiana is a first-class example of the architect's typically lyrical style. It takes the formality of Terragni's pre-war designs and makes it more human, shifting architecture away from being a 'machine for living' and more towards a fine-art form of hedonistic enjoyment of life that reflects both the international organic design styles of the time and the Italian post-war optimism, infused with a hefty dose of local atmosphere.



A custom-built radio and bedside table, characterised by Parisi's typical abstract morphology

Villa Bolgiana and the three neighbouring villas, Zucchi, Bini and Bertacchi, were all constructed between 1951 and 1953. With this unique complex of residences, Parisi, Luisa and architect Giampaolo Allevi worked towards a Gesamtkunstwerk ('total work of art') exercise; the complex not only works with its surroundings, but showcases a series of artistic collaborations in the form of the villas' unique, custom-made designs.

Parisi was involved in all the fine details, as well as the furniture design. The pieces designed for the villas demonstrate his delicate organic style: a balance between the elegance of Gio Ponti and the more formal experiments of Carlo Mollino, Parisi's furniture from the 1950s has become highly sought-after at design auctions around the world (some furniture from the Bini and Zucchi villas was auctioned at Chicago's Wright auction house in the 2000s, with one piece fetching $240,000).

A miniature example of his architecture, Parisi's furniture is perfectly documented at Villa Bolgiana, where oblique surfaces, aerodynamic shapes, overhung cornices and freestanding architraves create a dynamic, expressive structure reminiscent of South American villas from the same period. Parisi's villas are further enriched with sculpture by the likes of Fausto Melotti, Mario Radice and Francesco Somaini (his abstract ceramic plates still feature in the villa). A custom-designed fireplace, with decorative floral wallpaper, an abstract painting panel by Mario Radice, and a colourful staircase with its flowing wooden ribbon of a bannister are just a few of Villa Bolgiana's intriguing features.

Parisi collaborated with artists throughout his life, culminating in his work in the late 1970s, when the architect virtually turned into an artist, designing buildings as artistic installations. Residences such as the Fontana House (1968) and the Bartoletti House (1969), both located on the banks of Lake Como, were created in the spirit of radical design that verges on postmodernism. Parisi later went even further, designing utopian skyscrapers in the form of human limbs and extravagant artistic interventions, such as the Apocalisse Gentile project in 1979, for which he had a car placed on a monumental concrete wall in the streets of Rome.

The apartment, in which the architect lived until his death in 1996, provides a unique insight into his entire body of work, from the early post-war modernism days to the radical thinking of the 1970s and 1980s artist-philosopher. The duplex apartment, Casa Parisi, situated at the top of his Sant' Antonio block and reached by private elevator, was designed in 1958 and, at the time of Wallpaper's visit in 2011, was the home of his great-niece, who religiously kept her relative's legacy almost untouched.

'I attempt to preserve the atmosphere of my ingenious great-uncle. There are many of his paintings on the walls, complemented with works of art by my mother, Leo's niece, who is also a competent artist,' said the owner, with her eyes on a miniature model of one of Parisi's automobile installations from the 1980s.



Villa Bolgiana's intriguing main staircase features a colour scheme and diamond-shaped handrail, custom-designed by Parisi

This modernist residential building on the steep slopes of Como is undoubtedly one of the architect's masterpieces. The brickwork, with prefabricated concrete units applied on the façade and bannisters, gives the building a sculptural feel.

Within it, the apartment feels almost like an independent object, an attic refuge with dynamically shaped windows and a terrace offering breathtaking lake views. It is home to a unique selection of artworks, most by Parisi himself, but there is also a discreet Lucio Fontana piece on concrete tiles on the terrace floor. At Parisi's request, Fontana created an intimate relief painting on which he incorporated decorative glass marquetry.

Internally, Parisi makes extensive use of dark varnished wood, found not only in some of his most iconic furniture creations, such as his 'Lerici' bookcase, but also in tiling and built-in storage systems in the apartment, as well as other projects. An accordion door between the living room and bedroom, and a small open staircase leading to the attic study area, with its original crystal-shaped fireplace, create privacy between spaces yet at the same time maintain a spacious feel in the relatively small apartment.

It's this combination of art and design in every project that makes Parisi's architecture distinct and his legacy clear. A true representation of his philosophy, his apartment was gradually put together, a diverse, yet cohesive whole, mixing bespoke design with his own models, works of art made by friends, and all the objects that moved him and contributed to his unique creative and theoretical explorations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Wallet 0x932c Scores 1.69M BDAG in Buyer Battle as BlockDAG Presale Gains Top ICO Spot","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-analytics-insight/wallet-0x932c-scores-169m-bdag-in-buyer-battle-as-blockdag-presale-gains-top-ico-spot","Mon, 05 May 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Big wins aren't always about chasing hype. Sometimes, it's all about sharp timing and clear action. On April 28, wallet 0x932c...bde made a decisive move in BlockDAG's Buyer Battle, locking in a major purchase of 1.69 million BDAG. With total daily volume at 30.04 million BDAG, the buyer saw the chance and seized it, grabbing a large share of the remaining daily allocation while the competition was relatively mild.

As BlockDAG's presale moves toward its final phase, this win sends a clear message, momentum is building, and acting fast can still lead to big rewards. The $0.0019 offer ends May 13, leaving a narrow window to grab one of the year's most promising cryptocurrency ICO entries.

BlockDAG's Buyer Battle system proves that smart entries can make a huge difference. April 28 was a perfect example. With total volume not peaking, wallet 0x932c...bde used that to their advantage. By committing to a 1.69 million BDAG buy, they outpaced others and secured the top spot, plus a hefty reward from the day's unclaimed bonus pool.

This system doesn't depend on chance. It's designed to benefit those who act with purpose. Unlike standard ICOs, BlockDAG encourages competitive participation where top buyers can grow their holdings faster. And with time running out before the listing announcements, players who understand the rhythm are taking the lead. April 28's result shows how even a mid-volume day can deliver outsized returns.

BlockDAG's presale is quickly becoming one of the biggest talking points of the year. With more than 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold and $226 million raised, interest is growing rapidly. The current presale batch, Batch 28, is priced at $0.0262, but buyers still have until May 13 to lock in tokens at the special $0.0019 rate. That spread signals a clear value for anyone joining in now.

Early-stage buyers have already seen a 2,520% return, and new buyers still stand to gain from the pricing gap and active reward systems. With its blend of fixed deadlines, aggressive bonus incentives, and rising demand, BlockDAG presents more than just another cryptocurrency ICO. It's a well-timed opportunity for buyers to benefit from smart entry and active participation.

As May 13 approaches, BlockDAG is entering its final presale push. After that, the low $0.0019 entry will be gone, and the project will head toward its public listing announcements. This creates urgency for those who want to take advantage of the current value gap and still compete in daily Buyer Battles.

What sets BlockDAG apart isn't just the numbers; it's how the entire presale is structured to keep buyers engaged. With referral bonuses, leaderboard rewards, and interactive features, participants can earn more than just tokens, they're part of a growing ecosystem that values active contributors.

For those arriving late, the chance isn't over yet. Strategic buyers still have time to climb the leaderboard, especially on days when volume is moderate. As exchange listings announcements draw near, BlockDAG offers a final entry path that blends accessibility with real potential, something rare in traditional ICOs.

Wallet 0x932c...bde's April 28 win of 1.69 million BDAG wasn't luck, it was a strategic move that captured the kind of upside still on offer. With $226 million raised and 19.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is already outpacing expectations.

But it's the limited-time price of $0.0019, the built-in 2,520% ROI, and the daily Buyer Battles that separate it from other cryptocurrency ICOs. With the May 13 deadline fast approaching, those who want in on the action still have time, but not much. The final stage is here, and BlockDAG is delivering more than hype; it's offering a calculated shot at real gains.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","70 organizations join ECB's digital euro innovation platform","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/70-organizations-join-ecbs-digital-euro-innovation-platform/","Mon, 05 May 2025 11:22:42 GMT","

The European Central Bank (ECB) announced the launch of its innovation platform for the digital euro central bank digital currency (CBDC). Seventy organizations have signed up to participate, including startups, merchants, fintechs, banks and other payment service providers. 

One of the workstreams is for “Pioneers” and will focus on conditional payments, where a payment is only triggered if a condition is met, such as the arrival of a parcel. The other group involves “Visionaries”, who will explore other potential use cases with societal impact, such as financial inclusion. During the call for participants last October, the central bank also mentioned tokenization amongst the Visionary applications.

Only four of the participants are banks, one each from Austria, Cyprus, Germany and Spain, with Spain's CaixaBank by far the largest. Two other entities, Italy's ABI Lab and Spain's Iberpay, have historically worked on DLT and digital euro projects in collaboration with many of their nation's banks. 

Meanwhile, the ECB is providing a simulated digital euro platform for Pioneer participants to integrate with, whereas the Visionary group's work is less hands on. The Visionaries are participating in workshop presentations to the central bank this month, with the Pioneers due to submit a report to the ECB later in the year, and the ECB will itself publish a report on this work. 

With the digital euro's two year preparation phase ending in October 2025, the ECB is scheduled to deliver a larger report. At the same time, it is expected to announce a decision on whether to launch a digital euro, although that is subject to the passage of legislation. 

Prior to last year's European elections, the passage of enabling legislation seemed extremely likely, but afterward there was less support, with the legislative coordinator, the rapporteur, stepping aside. The ECB has long seen the digital euro as needed to protect monetary sovereignty, given the dominance of foreign providers such as Visa and Mastercard in the payments landscape. Since the United States announced plans to expand dollar stablecoins globally, the ECB has been using this as a lightning rod to garner legislative support, despite the EU's crypto MiCA regulations that cover stablecoins containing monetary sovereignty protections. 

The potential impact on citizens remains a key consideration in the digital euro debate. Proponents highlight convenience, monetary sovereignty, and reduced reliance on private payment networks, while critics raise questions about privacy safeguards, the technical learning curve for some populations, and whether it truly addresses unmet payment needs.

French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency entrepreneur from his kidnappers Saturday night, but found he'd had one of his fingers severed – the latest in a spate of abductions tied to cryptocurrency.

The victim, who has not been publicly identified, was forced into a van by four men wearing ski masks on a street of Paris Thursday morning. He was held hostage in an Airbnb 12 miles south of the French capital for two days before being rescued.

The kidnappers contacted the victim's son, sending a video of the mutilated victim and demanding millions of euros in ransom money, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV.

Five people between the ages of 23 and 27 were brought into police custody following the raid, according to the Paris Prosecutor's office.

The kidnapping shares striking similarities with other recent kidnappings tied to cryptocurrency in France and surrounding countries.

In January 2025, David Balland, co-founder of the crypto wallet company Ledger, was kidnapped with his wife from their home in central France.

Before the couple was freed by police, the assailants cut off Balland's finger, sending a video of the severed appendage to his business partner Eric Larchevêque and demanding ransom money.

In December 2024, the wife of crypto investor and influencer Stéphane Winkel was kidnapped from the couple's home in Belgium. She was rescued after her kidnapper crashed his car in a dramatic police chase, Winkel wrote in a post on X.

It is unclear whether the recent spate of crypto kidnappings is connected or not.

“Obviously there's at least a link in the modus operandi. Now, whether it's the same team or not is for the investigators to say,” said internal security expert Guillaume Farde speaking on French television Sunday.

Police have opened an investigation into the latest kidnapping, including for extortion by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy, the Paris Prosecutor's office told CNN.

The European Central Bank (ECB) announced the launch of its innovation platform for the digital euro central bank digital currency (CBDC). Seventy organizations have signed up to participate, including startups, merchants, fintechs, banks and other payment service providers. 

One of the workstreams is for “Pioneers” and will focus on conditional payments, where a payment is only triggered if a condition is met, such as the arrival of a parcel. The other group involves “Visionaries”, who will explore other potential use cases with societal impact, such as financial inclusion. During the call for participants last October, the central bank also mentioned tokenization amongst the Visionary applications.

Only four of the participants are banks, one each from Austria, Cyprus, Germany and Spain, with Spain's CaixaBank by far the largest. Two other entities, Italy's ABI Lab and Spain's Iberpay, have historically worked on DLT and digital euro projects in collaboration with many of their nation's banks. 

Meanwhile, the ECB is providing a simulated digital euro platform for Pioneer participants to integrate with, whereas the Visionary group's work is less hands on. The Visionaries are participating in workshop presentations to the central bank this month, with the Pioneers due to submit a report to the ECB later in the year, and the ECB will itself publish a report on this work. 

With the digital euro's two year preparation phase ending in October 2025, the ECB is scheduled to deliver a larger report. At the same time, it is expected to announce a decision on whether to launch a digital euro, although that is subject to the passage of legislation. 

Prior to last year's European elections, the passage of enabling legislation seemed extremely likely, but afterward there was less support, with the legislative coordinator, the rapporteur, stepping aside. The ECB has long seen the digital euro as needed to protect monetary sovereignty, given the dominance of foreign providers such as Visa and Mastercard in the payments landscape. Since the United States announced plans to expand dollar stablecoins globally, the ECB has been using this as a lightning rod to garner legislative support, despite the EU's crypto MiCA regulations that cover stablecoins containing monetary sovereignty protections. 

The potential impact on citizens remains a key consideration in the digital euro debate. Proponents highlight convenience, monetary sovereignty, and reduced reliance on private payment networks, while critics raise questions about privacy safeguards, the technical learning curve for some populations, and whether it truly addresses unmet payment needs.

With the ECB seen as favoring a digital euro, the actual decision is likely in the hands of parliamentarians.

Although the XRP price is hovering above $2, a crypto analyst contends that this level is still low. Comparing XRP's current price action to its explosive rally in 2017, the analyst argues that the market has not recognized the full scope of the cryptocurrency's evolving fundamentals. 

XRP Price At $2.2 Is Still Undervalued 

Pumpius, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), firmly believes that the XRP price is poised for a stronger rally, arguing that a $2.21 target remains significantly undervalued. The market expert's analysis starkly compares the current market positioning with its historic rally in 2017. 

Back in 2017, the altcoin skyrocketed from a low price of $0.005 to a staggering all-time high of $3.84, marking its most historic price rally. At its peak, XRP briefly overtook Ethereum's market cap, securing the position of the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world, just behind Bitcoin. 

During this historic rally, the XRP price soared by an astonishing 64,000%, reflecting a monumental gain despite lacking real-world use cases, institutional backing, or regulatory clarity. According to Pumpius, this surge was purely driven by retail Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), with no stablecoins, IPOs, or financial infrastructure supporting the cryptocurrency's rapid ascent. 

Fast-forward to today, and the landscape surrounding XRP has evolved significantly. Ripple Labs, an enterprise blockchain company and the largest holder of XRP, has launched its stablecoin, RLUSD, which indirectly strengthens XRP's position in the digital currency space. The company has also secured prime brokerages and regulatory clarity from the US, expanding Ripple's market reach and creating a stable environment for XRP's growth. 

With an IPO allegedly in the pipeline, the infrastructure supporting XRP is more robust than ever, far exceeding the conditions seen in 2017. However, despite these developments and milestones, the altcoin's price has yet to revisit its former all-time high and continues to trade above $2. As a result, Pumpius claims that the cryptocurrency has still not been “activated,” suggesting that it has not fully realized its potential or experienced the level of growth expected of it. 

Why This Time Could Be Different

Unlike in 2017, the potential for XRP is no longer based on hype alone. Pumpius's analysis estimates that if XRP were to repeat its historical 64,000% rally, starting from $2.21, its price could reach $1,414.40. 

While this target is purely speculative, the number underscores the massive upside that could follow if institutional capital and real-world adoption combine with retail momentum. Pumpius's commentary also includes a conspiracy narrative, alleging that powerful, unknown entities have worked behind the scenes to suppress XRP's rise.

According to this theory, the analyst claims that the US SEC's lawsuit against Ripple wasn't just about compliance but a calculated move to delay adoption and shake out retail momentum. The underlying message is that XRP's disruptive potential posed an early threat, allegedly leading to attempts to delay its growth and prevent widespread accumulation before institutions were ready to enter the market.

Crypto World News

May 5, 2025 by Mutuma Maxwell 

President Donald Trump has maintained robust support for crypto assets by acknowledging their ability to resist market downturns. The United States needs to advance digital asset innovation to maintain its position as a leader over competitors, especially China. His statements came when the Official Trump token (TRUMP) experienced significant growth in its market valuation.

Donald Trump explained that cryptocurrency maintained stability as a financial asset when other markets faltered. Because of current market trends, the popularity of digital currency shows its fundamental importance. The official believed that government support for innovation would be better than regulations to inhibit new developments.

He endorsed using crypto technologies because multiple industries were showing increased acceptance. Trump used worldwide developments to illustrate the importance of leading in digital technology. He established his support of crypto through arguments about boosting national competitiveness and developing long-term growth opportunities.

The TRUMP token lost most of its $15 billion value before experiencing intense price swings. Former Trump installations caused their value to decrease substantially, but it regained ground to reach approximately $2 billion. The token value increased by more than 70% after Donald Trump declared his plan to host a private dinner with his most significant token holders.

Only 220 wallets among millions will join the limited attendance at Trump National Golf Club on May 22. The announcement rapidly increased TRUMP token interest, generating temporary profit gains. According to market observers, the investor interest jumped after the event was unveiled.

Many critics viewed the special event warily because they believed it developed into a questionable ” pay-to-play” arrangement. Supporters of the presidential dinner for token holders believe that such rewards create problematic ethical issues. According to supporter opinions, the dinner supports Trump's continuous dedication to digital assets while facilitating community engagement.

After the TRUMP token event, both Republican and Democrat lawmakers requested an ethical examination. Two key senators, Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff, doubted possible personal financial advantages because of their political positions. According to legislators from both sides of the political spectrum, the decision to provide special benefits through token holding could potentially violate ethical boundaries.

Congress members who support Trump still have doubts about the significance of this event. According to her recorded comments, Senator Cynthia Lummis paused after the announcement. The senator stressed the importance of maintaining absolute clarity between private opportunities and public responsibilities.

Donald Trump refused to acknowledge making profits from crypto while insisting his backing of cryptos existed before his campaign started. He declared ownership of token facts unimportant to him and stated he intended no financial benefit from the event. During his presidency, Trump established a plan to keep donating his yearly salary as president.

The government of the Maldives has announced the creation of a 9 billion dollar crypto hub with the aim of attracting international investments and innovating the national economy. 

This ambitious project, signed on May 4th, will focus on blockchain technologies and Web3, marking a significant breakthrough for the small archipelago in the Indian Ocean.

Summary

The Maldives have historically based their economy on two main sectors: tourism and fishing. However, the strong dependence on these activities exposes the country to risks related to external factors such as global tourism fluctuations or climatic conditions. 

For this reason, the government has decided to focus on new emerging technologies.

The agreement with MBS Global Investments, a family office based in Dubai, aims to develop an innovative platform focused on blockchain technologies, considered strategic for attracting capital and creating jobs locally.

This is a significant change, aimed at strengthening the economic stability and sustainable growth of the country.

The new hub, named Maldives International Financial Centre (MIFC), will cover an area of approximately 830,000 square meters in Malé, the capital. 

This impressive structure will host offices, coworking spaces, and services dedicated to technology companies interested in the blockchain and Web3 sector.

The MIFC anticipates the creation of an ecosystem that could provide jobs for up to 16,000 people, giving a direct boost to local employment. 

Furthermore, the invested capital will be higher than 7 billion dollars, an amount greater than the current annual gross domestic product of the Maldives, which underscores the ambition and scope of the plan.

The time forecast to complete the entire project is about five years, a relatively short timeframe considering the complexity and vastness of the initiative.

The main focus of the hub will be on blockchain technologies, decentralized and transparent data recording systems used primarily in the financial sector, but also applicable in other sectors. 

Together with these, the project will focus on Web3 solutions, a term that indicates a more decentralized and interactive internet, based on blockchain networks.

This strategy aims to position the Maldives as a competitive international financial center in the digital sector, capable of attracting global investors interested in crypto assets and technological innovations. 

In this way, the country could significantly diversify its economy, reducing vulnerability linked to traditional sectors. The launch of such an ambitious crypto hub represents a historic turning point for the Maldives. 

However, there are still numerous details to define and critical factors to monitor. The success of the project will depend not only on the capital invested, but also on the country's ability to build a favorable regulatory framework and attract specialized technical expertise.

Furthermore, the creation of thousands of jobs in the next five years could have a profound social impact, improving living standards and encouraging professional training in the digital sector.

It is not specified in the report how the government intends to manage any risks associated with the volatility of the cryptocurrency market or the rapid evolution of emerging technologies. 

However, it can be assumed that a project of this magnitude will require forward-looking policies and constant dialogue with international investors.

A particularly significant fact is that the overall value of the capital invested in the Maldives International Financial Centre exceeds the country's annual gross domestic product. This demonstrates the strategic importance attributed to this initiative.

Such investment could position the Maldives as a benchmark for other developing nations that want to innovate their economy using crypto and blockchain technologies. 

As a result, the project could open new routes for regional and global economic development.

The agreement with MBS Global Investments, based in Dubai, reflects the growing importance of Gulf investors in the international landscape of digital finance. Dubai, in fact, is recognized as a key hub for technological and financial innovation.

Through this collaboration, the Maldives aim to leverage the network of contacts and expertise of MBS Global Investments to attract the capital and know-how necessary for the development of the MIFC.

Furthermore, this connection could facilitate cooperation between different emerging financial centers, creating positive synergies in the blockchain sector.

While the Maldives International Financial Centre project promises great benefits, there remains a need to address several challenges, such as:  

Despite these difficulties, the government of the Maldives seems determined to carry forward this digital transformation plan, confirming its vision of a stronger and more global economy.

In other words, the project of a 9 billion crypto hub in the Maldives marks a bold step towards economic innovation and diversification of the country. 

If successfully implemented, the Maldives International Financial Centre could transform into a model for other island states and emerging countries, laying the foundations for an inclusive and dynamic digital future. 

The future developments therefore deserve careful observation, while the global interest in this new financial frontier is growing.

Chainlink is rolling out a new community rewards program to incentivize participation in its ecosystem, starting with a token distribution from decentralized data platform Space and Time (SXT).

The program, called Chainlink Rewards, allows those projects based on the network to reward eligible Chainlink node operators and community members who help secure the network.

Founded in 2022, Space and Time is a decentralized data network that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify database queries and deliver them to smart contracts.

Space and Time has made 4% of their total SXT token supply (200 million) available to Chainlink ecosystem participants, including LINK Stakers. The first batch of SXT tokens, consisting of 100 million SXT, will become claimable by eligible historical and active LINK Stakers on May 8.

The remaining 100 million SXT, as well as any unclaimed SXT, are planned to be made available in a separate campaign in the future. SXT will be offered to both historical and active LINK stakers. Claims will remain open for 90 days.

Token incentives help drive money and users to a blockchain network, adding to demand for that network's token and a user base that may have previously not interacted with that ecosystem.

Chainlink Rewards is expected to expand over time, with additional Build partners likely to participate in future reward seasons. While token distribution will be project-specific, the broader goal is to create new incentives for users to stake LINK and engage with the Chainlink network more actively.

No details have yet been shared about upcoming reward partners or the long-term schedule of the program as of Monday.

Crypto traders aiming to profit from a volatility surge should watch the Binance-listed ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio, which could soon experience wild swings, according to a key indicator called Bollinger Bands.

Bollinger Bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day simple moving average of an asset's price.

The so-called Bollinger band squeeze occurs when the bands contract tightly around the price, suggesting low volatility and a period of consolidation. The market typically builds energy during the squeeze, which is eventually released in either direction, leading to a volatility explosion.

The Bollinger Bands on the ETH-BTC chart are now the tightest they have been since June 2020, according to TradingView.

The squeeze indicates that ether could soon experience increased volatility against BTC. Traders watch closely to see which way the price breaks out of the bands because, often, the big move happens in the same direction.

The volatility bullish signal comes as Ethereum's Pectra upgrade, which aims to improve the blockchain's scalability and validator operations and may sput market activity.

The impending upgrade, due May 7, greatly increases the maximum ETH a validator can stake, from 32 ETH up to 2,048 ETH. It also raises the number of ""blob"" data units per block from 3 to 6, allowing for a maximum of 9. Additionally, the upgrade will start the transition to the EVM Object Format (EOF), a new structure designed to make smart contracts more efficient.

""Layer-2 networks stand to benefit the most. By doubling blob capacity and making call data more expensive, Pectra solidifies blobs as the standard for rollup data posting. This reinforces Ethereum's role as a data availability layer and strengthens its rollup-centric scaling strategy,"" analytics firm Nansen said in a report shared with CoinDesk.

""DeFi will also see a lift,"" the firm noted, saying, NFTs and blockchain games may benefit from the broader improvements.

Bitcoin-holding public companies may be sitting on a powerful market catalyst: untapped issuance capacity that could meaningfully raise bitcoin's (BTC) price, according to new research from NYDIG.



In a report published this week, Greg Cipolaro, the firm's global head of research, points to the “dry powder” in the form of share issuance potential among bitcoin treasury companies. If these companies take advantage of their elevated equity valuations to raise new funds and buy more bitcoin, it could trigger a significant upward move in the market.



Cipolaro uses a back-of-the-envelope model to estimate the impact: applying a 10x “money multiplier” — a historical rule of thumb describing how capital inflows have historically influenced bitcoin's market cap — he projects a potential $42,000 per-coin price increase. That would mark a roughly 44% jump from current levels near $96,000.



This market dynamic has gained new urgency following the launch of Twenty One, a bitcoin accumulation vehicle backed by Tether, Bitfinex and Cantor Fitzgerald. Unlike other firms that have folded bitcoin into broader business models, Twenty One exists solely to acquire and hold bitcoin, and has already been seeded with a substantial BTC position.



Its SPAC partner, Cantor Equity Partners, has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 347% since the deal was announced.



Across the sector, 69 public companies hold around $69.6 billion worth of bitcoin. Cipolaro's analysis suggests that their current stock premiums over net asset value could fund even more purchases — effectively creating a feedback loop, where equity issuance fuels BTC buying, which drives up the value of both the bitcoin and the issuer's shares.



“The implication is clear,” Cipolaro writes. “This ""dry powder"" in the form of issuance capacity could have a significant upward effect on bitcoin's price.”



Whether or not these companies pull the trigger, the growing interest from institutions and the performance of bitcoin-forward stocks signal a shift in how capital markets approach bitcoin exposure — through balance sheets rather than just ETF flows.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Donald Trump gives conflicting answers over memecoin profits","https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-conflicting-answers-memecoin-profits","Mon, 05 May 2025 06:12:27 GMT","

 Donald Trump said in an interview that he's “not profiting from anything” related to his crypto memecoin, but quickly admitted that he hasn't checked if he made a profit. 

US President Donald Trump gave clashing answers to whether he has profited from the crypto memecoin he launched in January, just days before he re-entered the White House.

In a wide-ranging interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News' Meet the Press released on May 4, Trump said he was “not profiting from anything” when asked to respond to critics who said he's profiting from the presidency through the memecoin.

“So you're not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.

“I haven't even looked,” Trump admitted.

Trump launched his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 17, which hit a peak of $73.43 two days later, just a day before he was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, according to CoinGecko.

The token has been in a steady decline since launch, but it surged late last month after its website offered top holders a chance to dine with Trump on May 22. It's currently trading at $11.35, down nearly 85% from its peak.

Trump was apparently unaware of his token's recent surge, repeatedly asking how much it was now worth.  

Two companies, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of Trump's sprawling Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is co-owned by CIC Digital, together own 80% of the token's total 1 billion supply.

Most of those tokens are locked up and will be released over the next three years. The first unlock on April 18 saw 40 million tokens, worth $454 million, go to CIC Digital. 

Trump's memecoin project has made at least $350 million so far, according to a March analysis from the Financial Times, which found those behind the token made $314 million from selling them and $36 million from fees.

Trump has been criticized over his many crypto dealings, which his opponents say are a conflict of interest as he looks to unburden the sector from regulators. 

Even those in his own party, Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Lisa Murkowski, have criticized Trump's dinner offer to his top tokenholders. 

Trump said during the interview that he would contribute his presidential salary “back to the government,” prompting Welker to ask if he would also contribute any potential crypto earnings.

“I never thought of that,” Trump answered. “I mean, should I contribute all of my real estate that I've owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I'm president and doing a good job? I don't think so.”

In a part of the interview, Trump made a meandering statement that reiterated his campaign promise to support crypto.

“I want crypto. I think crypto's important because if we don't do it, China's going to. And it's new, it's very popular, it's very hot,” he said.

Trump claimed former President Joe Biden “went after it violently, and then, before the election, he changed his tune entirely” to garner the crypto vote. Biden did not run against Trump in the last election, instead handing the baton to then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

The president again made his point when speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn on May 4.

CBS News' Jennifer Jacobs reported on X that Trump said “crypto is very important,"" and wanted “to keep it away from China.”

He claimed China “will take it over, just like AI, just like so many other industries, or whatever you want to call them.”

 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said rollups should decentralize only when proof systems are strong enough to make centralization the greater risk. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained when rollup-based layer-2 platforms should go decentralized, and why “as soon as possible” is not the correct answer.

In a May 5 X post, Buterin said there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system's failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.

Buterin's thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

Rollup development is classified into stages: stage zero, stage one and stage two. Each stage is increasingly decentralized, with stage two being fully decentralized and trustless.

Cryptocurrency systems that manage significant assets are exposed to profit-motivated bad actors worldwide. Even if a project does not feature a bug bounty program promising payments to people who find vulnerabilities, it is still taken apart under a microscope — it may just pay more for its faults.

This threat is growing as nation-state-backed bad actors increase their crypto activity level. One such example is the Lazarus hacking group, responsible for many high-profile hacks in the crypto space, including the $1.4 billion Bybit hack.

Wang suggested introducing a new metric for veteran code that survived the pressure of being exposed to highly motivated advanced hackers and hacker groups: “BattleTested.” The BattleTested badge would be awarded to a rollup that consistently secured at least $100 million of assets for at least six months, with at least $50 million in Ether (ETH) and a major stablecoin.

Also, this badge would be lost at every update, as the new code needs to survive the onslaught of attackers to earn it. Buterin commented on the analysis:

Analyst at Kronos Research Dominick John told Cointelegraph that “to responsibly transition from stage 1 to stage 2, rollup teams must […] take a hard look at correlated risks like shared custody weaknesses or geopolitical chokepoints that can compromise the reliability of multisig security councils.” He said that such risks often go unnoticed until the locked value crosses $100 million. He added:

Buterin said the best time for a protocol to go decentralized is when its onchain proof system is safe enough that the centralized components serving as a point of failure or collusion risk becoming the bigger threat. This is because until a system is proven to be secure enough, decentralization, which increases the reliance on this system, may end up making the system less secure.

Mike Tiutin, chief technology officer at decentralized compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “going decentralized too early […] can leave users vulnerable.” 

Kronos Research's John said that “decentralization isn't a race, it's a long-term responsibility shared by the entire ecosystem.” He added that rushing to stage two puts ideology before safety and increases risks:

While going decentralized right away is recognized as problematic, some experts highlight not going decentralized at all. Arthur Breitman, co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told Cointelegraph that “prominent Ethereum L2s” are fundamentally custodial, adding:

Yishay Harel, CEO and co-founder of rollup-centric blockchain Dymension, highlighted that “Ethereum wasn't originally built to settle rollups.” This leads to tradeoffs:

Harel said that while Buterin's idea of gradually staging decentralization as a system matures is “smart,” it also highlights a concern — that the underlying architecture wasn't originally designed for sovereign execution environments.

 Notcoin co-founder Vladimir Plotvinov told Cointelegraph that the tap-to-earn gaming era has come to a close as developers focus on creating fun games. 

Notcoin, one of the most prominent Web3 gaming projects of 2024, said the tap-to-earn genre is “probably dead” as Web3 gaming shifts to more fun and engaging projects.

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 

Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players' interests. 

“We're going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they're not sustainable,” he said. 

In 2024, Notcoin was one of Telegram's most popular tap-to-earn games, onboarding more than 30 million users within three months of its release. In a previous interview, Sasha attributed the game's growth to its ability to “solve the issue” of onboarding Telegram users into crypto. 

While Telegram gaming exploded in 2024, gamers soon went game-hopping, moving to other games as soon as they “farmed” what they could in one project. Sasha told Cointelegraph: 

He added that while Telegram's first wave of games didn't provide that social element, Web3 can still play a vital role in the platform's gaming ecosystem.

He told Cointelegraph that Telegram games started to shift to models that move away from simply “farming” tokens. In these new experiences, the Web3 economy part becomes an “add-on” instead of the main value proposition. 

However, development may take some time. Sasha told Cointelegraph that Telegram has no “real games” yet, but is optimistic for the future.

Vladimir told Cointelegraph that artificial intelligence and Telegram have made creating games easier for Web3 developers. 

The Notcoin co-founder said that the advent of AI technology allowed developers to be faster and more efficient when writing game code:

However, he urged developers to pay attention when using AI when creating their projects. 

“You have to pay a lot of attention, have the expertise and experience because you have to see like how the API will work, how it will be connected to each other, how it will work on high load with a lot of users,” Vladimir said.

When asked if Telegram's Web3 gaming industry will still grow despite the perceived death of tap-to-earn, Salo told Cointelegraph that Telegram has a market similar to Facebook and WeChat, which are platforms with their own gaming ecosystems. 

“We believe in our chances because we already have a similar platform like WeChat and Facebook, which already have their game ecosystems, and it's a huge market. The number of users is practically the same,” she said. 

Salo noted that Telegram's gaming scene currently lacks major publishers and investor funding, but she expects exponential growth.  

Salo added that they're trying to get to a point where gamers play not just to get tokens but because it's fun. “We're trying to get this extra part, like this ‘fun' with something that people are doing not only for money, just for themselves,” Salo said.

Here's What Einstein Would Tell Trump



Einstein offers a lesson for scientists who are protesting an out-of-control nationalist administration attacking U.S. science today

By Alexander Soifer 

Albert Einstein.

Germany was once a beacon of science. On January 31, 1933, that all changed, when Adolf Hitler became the chancellor of Germany. In early April of that year, he had dismissed nearly all of the Jewish professors and students in Germany. Nazis publicly burned books written by Jewish authors and others perceived as enemies of the regime. Personal loyalty to Hitler and Nazism became more valuable than professionalism and talent.

America saved from Hitler many top European scholars. One of them, Albert Einstein, authored the general theory of relativity, which explained how mass and radiation warp space and time to produce gravity. He had also felt the weight of the warped politics of his time, facing official derision in Germany, where physicists either denied or downplayed that his physics worked. Nazi publications denounced relativity as “Jewish Physics” and contrasted it to the “German Physics” of the Third Reich. The great majority of German physicists rejected the theory of relativity as “Jewish.” Werner Heisenberg, who was a rare exception in teaching Einstein's view of physics and labeled a “white Jew” for it, asked none other than Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler for protection in a July 21, 1937, letter. A year to the day later, on July 21, 1938, Himmler granted the protection, allowing Heisenberg to teach relativity theory. But he added a cautionary note about citing Einstein: “I do find it appropriate, though, that in the future you separate clearly for your students acknowledgement of scientific research results from the scientist's personal and political views.”

Einstein's example today has much to offer us in the U.S., as scientists once more confront a political administration bent on bending science and scientists to its will. For instance, the attacks on Einstein's physics feel uncomfortably close to ones today on climate science, derided in April for “exaggerated and implausible climate threats” by the Trump administration's Department of Commerce, even as Earth's atmosphere has continued warming. In late March nearly 2,000 members of the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine protested the Trump administration's attacks on science. “We all benefit from sciences, and we all stand to lose if the nation's research enterprise is destroyed,” they warned.

Einstein stands apart from the views of too many today in speaking out against real threats from a political regime. Many of my fellow scholars want from the government just one thing: to be left alone to do their labor of love. The price for that is to keep their discontent to themselves, hoping that a closed mouth catches no flies.

An Einstein contemporary, the celebrated Dutch mathematician Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, disagreed with this conformist view of the majority, which held that mathematical theorems are all that matters, as it ignored correct credits to their authors and moral foundations of the profession. In a February 24, 1929, letter to Austrian mathematician Hans Hahn, Brouwer wrote that “it is my opinion that the tiniest moral matter is more important than all of science, and that one can only maintain the moral quality of the world, by standing up to any immoral project.”

Einstein was one of the first public critics of the Nazi regime, which he never ceased to criticize. Today his powerful stance may appear natural and uncontroversial. It was different then. Abraham Flexner, founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., described in a September 28, 1933, letter to New York philanthropist Felix M. Warburg his pressure on Einstein to stop criticizing the new Nazi regime:

Last night Professor Lefschetz, who holds the highest professorship in mathematics in Princeton University and is himself a Russian Jew, came to see me and asked me if I could not in some way shut Einstein up, that he was doing the Jewish cause in Germany nothing but harm and that he is also seriously damaging his own reputation as a scientist and doing the Jewish situation in America no good.

Flexner continued: “I may add for your private information that I am seriously concerned as to whether it is going to be possible to keep him and his wife in this country.”

In a June 26, 1933, letter, Nobel laureate physicist Max von Laue urged his friend Einstein to abstain from politics: “Here they are making nearly the entirety of German academics responsible when you do something political.”

Einstein summed up his position in his reply to von Laue. His words called on scholars to leave the ivory tower and assume responsibility for affairs of the world, to be counted in the struggle for truth and justice:

I do not share your view that the scientist should observe silence in political matters, i.e., human affairs in the broader sense.... Does not such restraint signify a lack of responsibility? Where would we be had men like Giordano Bruno, Spinoza, Voltaire, and Humboldt thought and behaved in such a fashion? I do not regret one word of what I have said and am of the belief that my actions have served mankind.

Some of the European scholars saved by America returned to Europe after the war. They thought that America was a wasteland of culture. It was not. But now that the Trump administration has been firing thousands of scientists and cutting funding for scientific research, America is in danger of becoming a wasteland of culture and science indeed.

What would Einstein tell Trump today? Einstein would urge Trump to strive for high morality in his actions, as the scientist so eloquently presented in a 1950 letter to a minister in Brooklyn, N.Y.:

The most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions. Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it. Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life.

Rather than warping American ethics, as well as science, the Trump administration should heed that wisdom, and those of scientists protesting today. Warping science to conform to one's politics will not change reality and will only ruin the nation that embarks on this folly.

Ancient Poems Reveal the History of the Endangered Yangtze Porpoise

Mentions of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise in ancient Chinese poetry have revealed missing information about the habitat of the world's only freshwater porpoise

Around 1745, Chinese emperor and poet Qianlong was sailing on the Yangtze River toward the eastern city of Zhenjiang when he encountered a breathtaking sight: a group of what we now call Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) emerged from the water's surface. “Porpoises chased moonlight on silvered tides, as dragons summoned storm-clouds loom in sight,” he wrote in a poem that was later published in the Imperial Collection of Poems, Volume II.

Almost 300 years later, scientists wanted to chart the historical range of this critically endangered, bulbous-headed cetacean—so they combed hundreds of ancient Chinese poems to seek mentions of it, hoping to map its historical distribution and thus better understand threats to this fragile subspecies. Found exclusively in China's Yangtze River, it is the world's only freshwater porpoise. About 1,250 individuals are left in the wild.

“Having access to past data allows us to detect when declines began and correlate those changes with potential threats like habitat destruction, climate change, overhunting, disease or the introduction of invasive species,” says Yaoyao Zhang, an ecologist at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A Ming Dynasty woodblock-printed illustration from ""Sancai Tuhui"" (in English, Compendium of the Three Powers), compiled by Wang Qi (1573–1620), which is a 49-volume book of poems on birds and animals. This poem meticulously documents the Yangtze finless porpoise through morphological details, surfacing postures, and maternal care behaviors.

Zhang and her colleagues turned to ancient poems because official records rarely mentioned these animals. Using an online database of Chinese literature, “we searched for various historical names of the Yangtze finless porpoise across dynastic poetry, manually verifying each mention to ensure it referred to the porpoise and not other animals,” Zhang says.

“The poets vividly described the actual behaviors of the porpoises [using language] such as ‘blowing waves...,' ‘surging waves ...' and ‘bowing to the wind,'” she adds.

The research, published on Monday in Current Biology, revealed 724 poems that mentioned the porpoises. Half contained information about where they were seen.

This window into the past revealed that the porpoises' range has decreased by around 65 percent over 1,400 years, with an accelerated decline in the past century. Poems from the distant past mentioned these animals living in tributaries and lakes along the Yangtze, but in more recent poems, these references dramatically decreased. The researchers concluded that the subspecies' range in these tributaries and lakes has declined by 91 percent.

The study “builds on many prior examples on how historical texts of various kinds can help understand past species distributions and, not least, human-caused biodiversity losses,” says Jens-Christian Svenning, a macroecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, who was not involved with the new research. For example, scientists reconstructed the former composition of fauna in Greece with the aid of descriptions from ancient epic poems. Though there can be challenges to this approach—and sometimes inaccuracies—there's “certainly much potential” to apply this method to other species and in other areas of the world, Svenning says.

For their next step, Zhang says she and her team are planning to dig back into the poems they have collected to search for information about “what the river looked like in the past, how big the groups of porpoises used to be and how they might have behaved before their numbers dwindled.”

Cuttlefish May Communicate with Discolike Arm Gestures

Scientists identified four arm wave signals cuttlefish use: “up,” “side,” “roll” and “crown”

Cuttlefish wave their expressive arms in four distinctive dancelike signals—potentially letting them communicate visually and by vibration.

These marine invertebrates, which have eight sucker-lined “arms” and two tentacles near their mouth, can alter their body's color patterns to blend in with the background or create zebralike stripes to attract a mate. Some have been known to raise their arms to intimidate predators or to extend their fourth arm to signal a desire to mate.

But cognitive neuroscientist Sophie Cohen-Bodénès and computational modeler Peter Neri, both then at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, noticed cuttlefish doing something that hadn't been described before: making specific, repeated and relatively complex arm gestures at each other.

Studying two species, common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and dwarf cuttlefish (Sepia bandensis), the two researchers have identified four arm-waving signs, which they call “up,” “side,” “roll” and “crown.” The scientists recently posted their observations in a paper on the preprint server bioRxiv.

The four cuttlefish gestures: “up,” “side,” “roll” and “crown.”

Cohen, Sophie (2025), “Cuttlefish interact with multimodal arm wave sign displays”, Mendeley Data, V4, doi: 10.17632/f3sp55762b.4, CC BY 4.0

The “up” sign involves cuttlefish extending one pair of their arms upward as if swim dancing to the Bee Gees song “Stayin' Alive” while twisting their other arms together in the middle. For the “side” sign, the animals bring all their arms to one side of their body or the other. The “roll” sign involves cuttlefish folding all their arms beneath their head (making their eyes bulge out), as if they are about to do a front flip. And the “crown” sign is rather like when a person puts the fingertips of both of their hands together to form a pyramid shape.

Cohen-Bodénès and Neri recorded cuttlefish signing in different contexts and played the videos back to other individual cuttlefish.

“We found that when they see [others] signing, the cuttlefish sign back,” Cohen-Bodénès says. “We don't think it's a mimicking signal because when they sign back, they sometimes display different types of signs.” This suggests a possible communication signal, Neri adds.

The researchers also used a hydrophone—a device used to record sounds underwater—to capture the vibrations each sign created in the water. They then played those vibrations back to cuttlefish that couldn't see the signs but could feel the water pressure changes—and the cuttlefish still responded with their own signs. This is the first piece of evidence that cuttlefish might communicate with one another by emitting specific vibrational signals, Cohen-Bodénès says. Cuttlefish may detect these signals with saclike sense organs called statocysts or an array of sensory cells running along the skin similar to the lateral line system used by fish.

The researchers “have found some fascinating behaviors,” says Willa Lane, a marine biologist and psychologist at the University of Cambridge, who says she has seen the crown behavior in cuttlefish in her lab. She finds it particularly compelling that the arm movements are present in two species.

Because the species Cohen-Bodénès and Neri studied don't overlap in their geographic ranges, and because cuttlefish are quite solitary, Lane wonders if the signals might be used during hunting to confuse prey or to scare off predators—or even as part of interactive hunting with other species, a behavior that has been observed in octopuses.

“It's interesting that they communicate visually and maybe acoustically,” says Sam Reiter, a neuroethologist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University in Japan. He and Neri agree that before this behavior can technically be called a “sign language,” researchers must show the signals' distinct meanings in particular contexts.

Still, the signals do add to the evidence of how smart cuttlefish are. “In terms of intelligence, they are, in my view, very much comparable to octopuses,” Cohen-Bodénès says.

‘Agreeing to Disagree' Is Hurting Your Relationships—Here's What to Do Instead

Agreeing to disagree on too many topics can put a strain on relationships. Conversational tactics such as looping and reframing may help

By Lisa Pavia-Higel & The Conversation US 

Constantine Johnny/Getty Images

The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.

As Americans become more polarized, even family dinners can feel fraught, surfacing differences that could spark out-and-out conflict. Tense conversations often end with a familiar refrain: “Let's just drop it.”

As a communications educator and trainer, I am frequently asked how to handle these conversations, especially when they involve social and political issues. One piece of advice I give is that “agree to disagree,” or any other phrase that politely stands in for “stop talking,” will not restore harmony. Not only that, but it could also do permanent harm to those important family bonds.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Conversation is the currency of relationships. When families talk about anything – from “What are your top five favorite movies?” to “What possessed you to load the dishwasher like that?” – they are not just exchanging information. They are building trust and creating a shared story that deepens the relationships within the family unit.

According to communication researcher Mark L. Knapp'smodel of relationship development, all relationships have a life cycle. People come together and solidify their connection through five stages, from “initiation” to “bonding.” But many relationships eventually come apart, going through five stages of breakdown.

No relationship is as linear as the model assumes, but it can help pinpoint potential danger zones – moments when a bond is at risk of coming apart. One stage, in particular, illustrates why avoiding these hard conversations is so dangerous: “circumscribing.”

Imagine circumscribing topics of conservation with yellow police tape around them – topics that almost instantly trigger conflict. Having a few of these “no-go” topics in a relationship probably will not doom a marriage or cause family estrangement. However, marking too many ideas as off-limits makes it easier for people to avoid conversation altogether.

Circumscribing is one of the “coming apart” stages in Knapp's model. If problems aren't addressed, a relationship can keep sliding down the slope toward the last stage: termination.

Sadly, this estrangement from loved ones is not a theoretical problem. In a 2022 poll of 11,000 Americans, more than 1 in 4 people reported that they were now estranged from close family.

What's more, these relationships are not always replaced by other close ties. About half of Americans say they only have three or fewer close friends. In 2023, then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared widespread loneliness and isolation an “epidemic.”

Social connection is a basic human need. Relationships do more than provide support; they play a key role in how people define themselves. According to psychology's “social penetration theory,” conversation with close family and loved ones deepens relationships while helping people learn to articulate their deepest values.

So if “agree to disagree” is not the answer, what is?

There is no one-time process that will fix all conflict over the course of a family dinner. These techniques take time, patience and compassion – all things that can be in short supply amid conflict. However, there are two techniques I not only recommend to others, but I use in my own conflicts: “looping for understanding” and “reframe and pivot.”

Looping, which was originally developed for legal mediation, helps both people in a conversation understand each other. Feeling misunderstood tends to escalate conflict, so this is a great starting place.

During a “loop,” each person uses active listening, meaning they pay careful attention to what their partner is saying without judgment or interruptions. Then the listener shows their understanding by using what's called “empathic paraphrase”: restating what they heard from the speaker, but also what emotions they perceived. Finally, they ask the original speaker for confirmation.

That might sound something like this:

So if I understand what you are saying, you think that people should not have to get a flu shot at your office because you are not sure if it's effective, and you're frustrated that you are being told what to do by your company. Do I have that right?

If the speaker says no, then the listener “loops” by asking them to explain what they got wrong, and tries to paraphrase again. The participants keep looping until the answer to “Did I get that right?” is an emphatic “yes.” This practice ensures that both people are sure of the actual issue at hand.

Looping has other benefits, too. In one study, emphatic paraphrasing not only made participants less anxious but also made the speaker see the paraphraser in a more positive light. Feeling fully heard and understood can go a long way to turning down the heat on difficult conversations.

However, that understanding may not be enough. Once both parties understand each other, another technique, “reframing,” can help pivot the conversation away from confrontation and move toward resolution.

In reframing, the speakers find and discuss a single point of agreement. By emphasizing what they agree about, instead of what they disagree about, they look for a starting place to tackle the problem together, instead of facing off.

For example:

I think you and I can both agree that we want to keep the family safe. However, I think we disagree about what role having a gun in the house would play in that safety. Is that right?

Finding a point of agreement is not always possible. However, this reframing presents both communicators as having a key shared value – a starting place for a more constructive discussion. Reframing also moves the conversation away from inflammatory language that could automatically reignite the fight. `

No technique will ever be a perfect, one-size-fits-all solution for every relationship – or a quick fix. Careful communication can be mentally exhausting, and pressing pause is always OK:

I don't think we are going to solve our nation's financial issues tonight, but thank you for talking about it. Let's keep doing it. But for now, I think there's pie. Want some?

It's also important to accept that not all relationships can or should be saved. However, it is always good to know that the relationship ended for a clear reason, and not over a misunderstanding that was never addressed.

Hopefully, though, these tactics will help keep communication open and relationships healthy, no matter what topic is brought up at dinner.

Who were the owners hiding the gold from? 

A field in an overgrown Czech Republic forest has, for nearly 100 years, served as the hiding place for a secret stash of nearly 600 gold coins and other precious metal goods tucked into a stone wall. 

But the cache of treasure is hiding no more. Two hikers traversing the Krkonoše Mountains (Giant Mountains) came across the small aluminum can, which had been hidden in a crevice in the wall, and opened it up to find the collection of gold coins. Just a few feet away, they found another hidden cache—this one an iron box holding jewelry, cigarette cases, and other personal items all made from gold. The lucky hikers wound up finishing their trip with an extra 15 pounds of precious cargo.

They eventually took their discovery for an assessment by experts at the Museum of Eastern Bohemia. “To store valuable objects in the ground in the form of treasures, so-called depots, have been common practice since prehistoric times,” Miroslav Novak, head of the archaeological department of the Museum of East Bohemia in Hradec Kralove, said in a translated statement. “At first, religious movements were more common, later it was property stored in uncertain times with the intention of returning later for it.”

Still, the latest find—considering its unusual weight of precious metal—is quite unique, Novak said.

Whoever stashed the treasure may have done so to conceal valuables while fleeing the Nazis' annexation of the region, or it could have been Germans hiding the small fortune under fear of expulsion. 

Two hikers first found the aluminum container sticking out above the surface of a stone wall. Inside were 598 gold coins 11 separate stacks wrapped in  black fabric. The iron box was only about three feet away, and contained its own bounty of metal goods that included 16 cigarette cases, 10 bracelets, a small purse woven from silver mesh, a powder compact, a comb, and a chain with a key.

The 15 pounds of gold coins and jewelry is valued at over $330,000. However, Novak said the historical value of the treasure is incalculable.

Using the stamping on the coins, the museum team dated them all to between 1808 and 1915. They come from far and wide across Europe, with coins originating from France, Turkey, Belgium, Romania, Italy, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. The coins from Austria-Hungary—which were likely intended for use in Yugoslavia—feature a specific composition in use until the 1930s.  

The range of provenances makes it difficult to track how the coins got to where they were—or just why they were stashed away at all. “It is hard to say whether it was Czech, German, or Jewish gold,” said Petr Grulich, museum director, according to Arkeo News.

The museum plans to display the collection, after the finder's fee of 10 percent is doled out to the hikers who brought in the collection to the museum. “When he opened it,” Novak said, according to the Daily Mail, “my jaw dropped.”

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is nearly 40 years in the making, and its most complex component is now ready for assembly.

The typical tagline you'll often hear about fusion energy is the idea that scientists are trying to “bottle the Sun.” While technically correct—humanity is attempting to harness the power of the Sun's proton-proton fusion chain reaction using isotopes of hydrogen—tokamaks like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) are more an exercise in extreme engineering. 

ITER is a decades-long effort involving 35 countries, and the stats of the machine highlight the cooperation and expertise of that talent pool. When completer, ITER will be able to withstand temperatures 10 times hotter than the core of the Sun (150 million degrees Celsius) while also keeping certain components of itself near absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius). At the heart of this engineering miracle is a 3,000-ton magnet system central to creating an “invisible shield” that keeps superheated plasma contained long enough to kickstart a fusion reaction. On Wednesday, the ITER team announced that the last piece of this magnetic puzzle—the Central Solenoid—has been built and tested in the U.S. and is now ready for assembly at the ITER facility in France. 

Once assembled, this solenoid will be the world's most powerful magnet. The magnet is so powerful, in fact, that it's capable of completely levitating an aircraft carrier, according to an ITER press release. It will be contained inside an “exoskeleton”—made of 9,000 individual parts from eight U.S. suppliers—which will support the Central Solenoid as it generates extreme forces capable of kickstarting a fusion reaction. 

Although ITER is fundamentally different from our Sun (of course), it does work in a somewhat similar fashion. The Sun uses a “too big to fail” fusion regime—its sheer mass (330,000 times more than that of the Earth) is enough to fuse hydrogen nuclei into helium. On Earth, however, scientists need to compensate for this lack of mass with even more heat. 

At a certain temperature threshold, deuterium, and tritium—isotopes of hydrogen that will be used as fuel in ITER—overcome electromagnetic repulsion via quantum tunneling and fuse. Some quick calculations using everyone's favorite equation e=mc2 show that converting a little mass can give you tons of energy. ITER's 10,000 tons worth of superconducting magnets (with a combined energy of 51 gigajoules) will maintain the plasma for long enough at high enough temperatures for this fusion reaction to take place. By the scientists' estimates, ITER should produce 500 megawatts of power for only 50 megawatts of input heating power—a 10 fold increase. 

However, that's still a long ways off, as recent ITER estimates place the reactor's first plasma date at around 2035. But once this gargantuan machine of human ingenuity is completely, we will have truly bottled a star—or, at least, a close approximation of it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Saving the Asian 'unicorn' -- if it still exists","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505121440.htm","Mon, 05 May 2025 17:16:38 GMT","

Is it extinct, or does it still roam somewhere deep in the misty highland forests of Vietnam and Laos? It has been nicknamed the Asian unicorn due to its almost mythical rarity, and it is the most recently discovered large land mammal, becoming known to science as late as in 1992. Even then, it was already endangered. Today, even the most optimistic estimates say fewer than 100 saola individuals (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) remain, but it could also be extinct by now. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was in 2013.

Researchers have been searching for it ever since, but so far without success. The task is made even more difficult by the fact that the saola lives only in the remote, rugged forests of the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam and Laos.

""Right now, the existence of live saolas can neither be proven nor disproven. The last evidence we have was from 2013, when one was captured on a camera trap. But given the remoteness of its habitat, it is extremely difficult to say for sure whether there are still a few out there. There are some signs and indications that still give us hope,"" says Nguyen Quoc Dung from the Forest Inventory and Planning Institute in Vietnam.

He is one of the authors of a new international study, in which researchers from Denmark, Vietnam and many other countries have mapped the saola's genome for the first time ever. Up until now, almost no genetic data on the saola have been generated. The study is published in the scientific journal Cell.

By analyzing fragments from saola remains collected from hunters' households, the researchers generated complete genomes for 26 saolas. This has provided brand new insights into the history of the enigmatic bovine -- and its future prospects.

How It Might Survive

""We were quite surprised to find that the saola is split into two populations with considerable genetic differences. The split happened between 5,000 and 20,000 years ago. That was completely unknown before, and there was also no way we could have known without genetic data. It is an important result because it affects how the genetic variation in the species is distributed,"" says lead author Genís Garcia Erill, a former PhD student at the Department of Biology.

The genetic analyses also show that both populations have been in decline since the last Ice Age. According to the researchers' estimates, the total saola population never exceeded 5,000 individuals in the last 10,000 years. And this long-term decline means that both populations began losing genetic diversity. But crucially, they did not lose the same genetic diversity.

""This means that the genetic variation lost in each population complements the other. So, if you mix them, they could compensate for what the other is missing,"" says Genís Garcia Erill.

And that could potentially be the solution to saving the saola from extinction. The researchers have calculated the probability of the species surviving under various conservation scenarios. Their models show that the best survival chances occur if the two populations are mixed in a captive breeding program.

""If we can bring together at least a dozen saolas -- ideally a mix from both populations -- to form the foundation of a future population, our models show the species would have a decent chance of long-term survival. But it hinges on actually locating some individuals and starting a breeding program. That has worked before when species were on the brink of extinction,"" says Rasmus Heller, senior author of the study and Associate Professor from the Department of Biology at UCPH.

But Does It Even Still Exist?

Finding 12 saolas, however, is no simple task. But the new research might help solve that problem. The genetic mapping opens up new possibilities for using various technologies to locate the last remaining saolas.

""Many researchers have unsuccessfully tried to find traces of saola through methods like environmental DNA in water and even in leeches, the blood suckers inhabiting the same habitat. These techniques all rely on detecting tiny DNA fragments, and now that we know the complete saola genome, we have a much larger toolkit for detecting those fragments,"" says Minh Duc Le, co-author on the study from Vietnam National University.

But even if it turns out the saola is extinct, the new research findings might still be useful: ""Our results could in theory be used if we were ever to succeed in bringing the saola back through genetic de-extinction technologies, which are a hot topic right now. In that case, our new insights into saola genetic variation could make a huge difference in creating a viable population,"" says Rasmus Heller.

Still, he has his doubts about the chances of finding living saolas.

""Scientists have been searching for saolas since the 1990s, and it's only gotten harder since then, because there were more of them back then. I'm not overly optimistic, I have to admit -- but I really hope the saola is still out there,"" Rasmus Heller concludes.

Metrics details

Research from high-income countries has found negative outcomes associated with physical punishment. Yet, the extent to which such research evidence generalizes to children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely unknown. The objective of the current pre-registered study (PROSPERO: CRD42022347346) was to conduct a meta-analysis of the associations between childhood physical punishment and individual outcomes in LMICs. We identified eligible articles by searching for keywords related to physical punishment in six languages across 11 databases, with search periods from April to August 2021 and June to July 2024. This process yielded 5,072 unique records, of which 189 studies, comprising 1,490 unique effect sizes and representing 92 LMICs, met our inclusion criteria. Findings from random-effects multilevel meta-analyses indicated that physical punishment was associated with detrimental outcomes, including mental health problems, worse parent–child relationships, substance use, impaired social–emotional development, negative academic outcomes and heightened externalizing behaviour problems, among others. Despite some variation by contextual and study-level characteristics, all subgroup estimates were consistent in direction. Sensitivity checks indicated that these findings were not typical of other non-violent methods of discipline but were specific to physical punishment and psychological aggression. The analysis confirmed that physical punishment is associated with detrimental outcomes for individuals in LMICs. Additional research is needed to inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and interventions to prevent the physical punishment of children and adolescents worldwide.

The survey asked more than 3,000 UK teens about their experiences using social media.Credit: Ute Grabowsky/Photothek/Getty

Teenagers with mental-health conditions spend more time on social media than their peers — on average, 50 more minutes on a typical day. They are also more likely to be dissatisfied with aspects of the experience, such as their number of online friends, a survey of 3,340 adolescents in the United Kingdom has revealed.

The study, published today in Nature Human Behaviour1, explores how teens with specific mental-health conditions use social media, finding that participants with disorders such as anxiety and depression are more vulnerable to negative online experiences than are those with conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). “That is a question that very few studies have addressed, especially on such a large sample,” says study co-author Luisa Fassi, a specialist in young people's mental health and social-media use at the University of Cambridge, UK.

The results are “a good warning to families that if your youth is vulnerable because of anxiety, a tendency to have depression or be low in mood, then social media is something that really needs to be carefully monitored”, says Anne Marie Albano, a clinical child and adolescent psychologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.

The researchers analysed data from a 2017 survey of 11- to 19-year-olds conducted by the UK National Health Service (NHS). Participants underwent an in-depth clinical assessment and were asked about their use of social-media sites and how they feel about them. Sixteen per cent of respondents had at least one mental-health condition. Of those, 8% had ‘internalizing' conditions, such as depression and anxiety — characterized by negative emotions towards the self — and 3% had externalizing conditions, such as ADHD, characterized by negative emotions towards others.

Governments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?

The analysis found that young people with mental-health conditions spent more time on social media overall, and those with internalizing conditions were more likely to compare themselves with others online than were those with externalizing conditions or no mental-health condition. Those with internalizing conditions were also more affected by comments or reactions to their posts and had less control over how much time they spent on platforms.

Whether it's developing artificial-intelligence tools, clean technologies or medical treatments, governments around the world are seeking to leverage their research institutions and workforces to compete strategically with other nations.

The strategy behind one of the most successful labs in the world

The strategy behind one of the most successful labs in the world

Through our decades of leadership in research and development (R&D) in corporate settings, national laboratories and research universities, we've seen at first hand how one crucial acknowledgement — recognizing non-conventional career paths or roles — strengthens workforces1. Yet, too often, one group remains overlooked: skilled technical staff. The technicians who devise the instruments, techniques and materials that go hand in hand with scientific discoveries are often the unsung heroes of research. Numerous studies2–4 and historical cases5–7 in leading labs show how close collaborations between researchers with PhDs and technicians often lie behind major breakthroughs.

Today's trailblazing research increasingly relies on technological advances, such as gene editing, high-performance computing or nanofabrication, creating a growing demand for technicians with specialized training, practical experience and the ingenuity to solve problems with complex instruments, equipment and software. In many areas, however, this demand exceeds supply. In the semiconductor industry, for example, only about 1,000 technicians enter the field in the United States each year8 — too few to supply the predicted 75,000 extra technicians needed for all manufacturing and research operations between 2024 and 2029 (see ‘Don't take technicians for granted').

Source: Ref.8

The boundaries between science and technology are increasingly blurring, and so, too, should those between doctoral-level researchers and technicians in research institutions. We urge leaders of institutions to remove conventional occupational boundaries between these groups. To achieve excellence, leaders should take three steps.

Innovative research labs around the world have long orchestrated team-management synergies between doctoral-level researchers and technicians. We urge leaders to foster cultures — the shared values, assumptions, beliefs, norms and expectations that impact how their members think, behave and perform9 — that cultivate a sense of belonging in which all individuals, including technicians, are valued.

Examples of such institutes include: Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia2,3; the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK5; the original incarnation of Bell Labs2,3,6,7 in Murray Hill, New Jersey; and US National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers4,10,11 — a network of research hubs across US universities that work in partnership with industries.

Janelia, founded in 2006 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, fosters close collaborations between life scientists, physicists, engineers and technicians. When it comes to recruitment, practical research experience can substitute for academic degrees, according to chemist Luke Lavis, who leads the molecular tools and imaging group at Janelia. For example, engineer Dan Flickinger “doesn't have a PhD but is the brains behind many of the microscopes developed at Janelia. He is an expert optical engineer who simply makes things work”, Lavis told us.

Leaders can learn from Janelia's approach, which includes a strategic focus on projects that require patience and sustainable financial resources, encouraging commitment by personnel to be physically present at Janelia at least 75% of the time, and prioritizing collaborations between researchers and technicians for tool building. One example of its success involved major developments in protein biosensors, which required technicians who could carry out painstaking work over long periods, and support through deep financial resources2.

Want to speed up scientific progress? First understand how science policy works

Want to speed up scientific progress? First understand how science policy works

Cambridge's Laboratory of Molecular Biology has an exemplary history of facilitating a feedback loop between scientists and technicians. Principal investigators act as interpreters to translate scientific terms into technical engineering requirements to develop research instruments5. Cryo-electron microscopy, for example, a technique to create 3D images of biological molecules, was developed by integrating software and advanced cooling techniques. Rather than being supervised by one individual, this work was carried out by a self-organized multidisciplinary team of scientists and technicians who collaborated in iterative steps and adjustments.

Metrics details

NMR spectroscopy of biomolecules provides atomic level information into their structure, dynamics and interactions with their binding partners. However, signal attenuation from line broadening caused by fast relaxation and signal overlap often limits the application of NMR to large macromolecular systems. Here we leverage the slow relaxation properties of 13C nuclei attached to 19F in aromatic 19F–13C spin pairs as well as the spin–spin coupling between the fluorinated 13C nucleus and the hydrogen atom at the meta-position to record two-dimensional 1H–13CF correlation spectra with transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy selection on 13CF. To accomplish this, we synthesized [4-19F13Cζ; 3,5-2H2ε] Phe, engineered for optimal relaxation properties, and adapted a residue-specific route to incorporate this residue globally into proteins and a site-specific 4-19F Phe encoding strategy. This approach resulted in narrow linewidths for proteins ranging from 30 kDa to 180 kDa, enabling interaction studies with small-molecule ligands without requiring specialized 19F-compatible probes.

Metrics details

Advances in long-read sequencing have enabled routine complete assembly of human genomes, but much remains to be done to represent broader populations and show impact on disease-gene discovery. Here, we report highly accurate, near-complete and phased genomes from six Middle Eastern (ME) family trios (n = 18) with neurodevelopmental conditions, representing ancestries from Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Qatar and Afghanistan. These genomes revealed 42.2 Mb of new sequence (13.8% impacting known genes), 75 new HLA/KIR alleles and strong signals of inbreeding, with ROH covering up to one-third of chromosomes 6 and 12 in one individual. Using assembly-based variant calling, we identified 23 de novo and recessive variants as strong candidates for causing previously unresolved symptoms in the probands. The ME genomes revealed unique variation relative to existing references, showing enhanced mappability and variant calling. These results underscore the value of de novo assembly for disease variant discovery and the need for sampled ME-specific references to better characterize population-relevant variation.

Advances in long-read sequencing and bioinformatics have enabled the generation of high-quality genome assemblies from various ancestries, ranging from Korea1 to Puerto Rico2,3. Recently, over a hundred near-complete and fully phased genomes have been produced by the Human Pangenome Research Consortium (HPRC)4 and the Chinese Pangenome Consortium (CPC)5, in addition to complete telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes for a haploid genome of primarily European ancestry (CHM13)6 and a diploid Han Chinese male (CHN1)7. This has allowed major gaps in GRCh38 to be filled, especially in complex and repetitive regions6,8, capturing previously inaccessible variation9 and uncovering genome mechanistic insights9,10. Nevertheless, complete genome assembly is yet to be leveraged in disease-gene discovery, especially in under-represented populations where there is a particular need for understanding haplotype diversity and structure, which is important in assessing variant pathogenicity.

The Middle Eastern (ME) populations lie at a historical intersection of human migration and civilization11,12,13,14. They are generally characterized by isolated structures and high consanguinity, leading to increased incidence of genetic conditions impacting normal development15,16,17, often due to founder mutations. Recent studies have identified peculiar ancestral groups such as Peninsular Arabs who were found to be the closest to the ancient population that migrated out of Africa11,14 and harbor a differential mutational spectrum of Mendelian disorders and cancer predisposition18,19. Currently, ME populations are heavily under-represented in genomic literature, lacking high-quality assemblies20,21 needed to shed light on how inbreeding shapes genome structure and disease architecture20,21.

In this study, we use a de novo genome assembly approach to characterize six family trios from diverse ME ancestries (Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Qatar and Afghanistan), involving probands with various unresolved neurodevelopmental conditions whereby we (1) assemble near-complete genomes and map their high-resolution features, (2) apply assembly approach to identify disease-causing variants and (3) assess the value of ME-specific genetic reference in improving read mapping and variant calling (Extended Data Fig. 1). We assemble near-complete phased genomes which we interrogate for various structural features, comparing against the latest genome references. Using trio analyses, we identify previously undetected deleterious variants. Finally, we demonstrate the value of population-specific references, emphasizing the need for a carefully sampled pangenome for ME ancestries.

Our study samples consist of six parent–child trios (n = 18) from five different nationalities spanning the wide ME region: two trios from Qatar (Qatari 1 and Qatari 2) and single trios from Sudan, Jordan, Syria and Afghanistan (Fig. 1a). The children, male (XY) except for the Afghani female (XX), are aged 3–15 years and were ascertained with multiple symptoms of developmental disorders (Extended Data Fig. 2). Three of these families (Sudanese, Jordanian, Qatari 2) have undergone genetic testing previously based on microarrays and selected panels, returning negative results. Subsequent analysis using whole-genome sequencing from Illumina (Methods) did not identify plausible pathogenic variants except for Qatari 1, where we found a likely pathogenic variant (a de novo SNV in splice donor site) in the transcription factor nuclear factor IX (NFIX) reported to cause Malan syndrome22. This finding explained some of this patient's symptoms, namely global developmental delay and tall stature.

Source data

Given the lack of diagnosis of these diverse ME families, we used the latest technologies of long-read sequencing and de novo assembly methods to gain insight into high-resolution genomic structure and disease-causing genetic variants. For each participant, we generated high-quality PacBio HiFi long-read and Illumina short-read data and subsequently processed them using established pipelines (Methods). For the long-read data, the average read length is 19 kb (range = 15.1–21.3 kb), while the average coverage is 38.8× for the children and 37.2× for the parents (Supplementary Fig. 1). For the short-read data, the average coverage is 31–38× (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To explore the detailed genetic ancestry of the ME trios, we conducted admixture inference of global and local ancestry based on a diverse population dataset as a reference panel based on 1000 Genomes (1KG) and Qatar Genome Program (QGP) phase 1 cohort (Methods). As expected, CHM13 is predominantly of European ancestry (Fig. 1b). The Sudanese trio has >99% African ancestry, while the Afghani, Syrian, Jordanian, Qatari 1 and Qatari 2 participants in this order showed a prominent trend of increasing General Arab (GAR) and Peninsular Arab (PAR) ancestries and decreasing European ancestry. The highest proportion of GAR was shown in Qatari 2 participants (63%), the highest PAR was in Qatari 1 and Qatari 2 (15% and 16%, respectively), while the highest West Eurasian and Persian (WEP) ancestry was found in the Syrian, Jordanian and Qatari 1 (20–22%; Fig. 1b). The highest East Asian and South Asian ancestries were found in the Afghani participants (8% and 12% respectively). Consistent with this, an overlay of the dominant global ancestries on principal components showed that the family trios co-clustered with samples of similar ancestries, namely GAR, PAR, WEP14 (for Syrian, Jordanian, Qatari 1 and Qatari 2), Africans (for Sudanese), while the Afghanis are found between Europeans, West Eurasians and Asians (Fig. 1c). Next, we conducted local ancestry inference to assign ancestry components to individual chromosomal segments (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3). We could see relatively high ancestral homogeneity for the Sudanese participants as well as CHM13, while more admixture is seen for the remaining participants. The average ancestry segment length across the samples is 570 kb. Notably, the longest non-African stretches were found in Qatari 2 (PAR), Syrian (GAR) and Qatari 1 (WEP).

We generated de novo phased assemblies for the six ME trios using trioHifiasm23, incorporating PacBio HiFi long reads and parental Illumina short reads, as per the best recommended workflow for phased genome assembly23. Standard quality check (QC) metrics were calculated to evaluate assembly contiguity and accuracy (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1). The obtained assemblies were of high quality as indicated by the various metrics, the ranges and averages of which are as follows: coverage (30.4–49.1×, 37.7×), contig N50 (52.9–98.2 Mb, 77.3 Mb), contig count (146–372, 263.4), longest contig (133.5–232.6 Mb, 169.2 Mb) and per-base accuracy quality value (QV; 44.0–59.3, 53.7). Of note, the children were better than the parents for most metrics, reflecting the higher mean coverage (38.8 versus 34.9), higher average HiFi read length (19.9 kb versus 18.8 kb) and the complementary use of parental data for assembling and phasing. The assembly with the best contig N50 was for Qatari 1 child (94.6 Mb for haplotype 1 and 97.4 Mb for haplotype 2) which also had the best QV (59.3 for haplotype 1 and 58.8 for haplotype 2), the best coverage (49.1×) and second highest HiFi read length average (21.0 kb). The longest contig was 232.6 Mb, belonging to the Jordanian child participant.

Source data

Using the parental short reads, we evaluated the phasing accuracy for the child assemblies using haplotype-specific markers (hapmers)24, whereby contigs are plotted as a function of hapmers assigned from maternal and paternal libraries (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5). All assemblies show a clear segregation of the parental haplotypes indicating the high quality of phasing. Furthermore, N* plots indicate low levels of haplotype switch errors (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6). In addition, inherited hapmer plots show balanced distributions of k-mers private to children, fathers, mothers and those shared between the parents (Supplementary Fig. 7). Furthermore, we performed an independent evaluation of the accuracy of the assemblies using the Flagger pipeline which assesses coverage and variants from the alignment of HiFi reads to the respective assemblies4. We found that >99% of the assemblies' sequences consisted of reliable (haploid) blocks (Fig. 2d).

Alignment of the child assemblies to CHM13 using Minimap2 (ref. 25) showed high mappability across various chromosomes, with an average of 91% of contigs with high alignment coverage mapping to a unique location (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8). Using CHM13 as reference, the ratio of completeness per chromosome was 93% on average, with 43 chromosomes from all six participants having >99% completeness including 14 T2T chromosomes, which we verified confirming the presence of telomeric repeats (Fig. 3b). Qatari 2 shows the highest overall completeness of 92%. Notably, 14 chromosomes were spanned by a single contig covering the centromeric region, including a T2T single contig for chromosome 10 from a Qatari 2 child (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 9).

Source data

We checked the sequences of insertions identified from the alignments of the assemblies to CHM13 against a diverse set of highly curated calls of structural variations from HPRC8, HG002 (Ashkenazi Jews) and CN1 (Han Chinese)7, from which we excluded any regions identified with Flagger to be unreliable. This led to the identification of 42.2 Mb of new sequences across all the samples, ranging from 6.4 Mb for the Sudanese to 10.6 Mb for Qatari 1 (Fig. 3d). Of these sequences, 10–40% were in the centromeres, highlighting the relatively higher divergence and mutation rate in these regions26. By size, 86.2% of the new sequences are found in intergenic regions, while 12.6% are in intronic or untranslated regions (intronic/UTR) and 1.2% in exonic regions (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Also, 89.7% of the new sequences are found in repetitive regions, notably satellite (58.1%) and simple repeats (24.1%; Fig. 3d, middle). New sequences outside repetitive regions are enriched for exonic and intronic/UTR (Fig. 3d, right). We also noticed most new sequences (79.3%) occur outside segmental duplications (Supplementary Fig. 10b). For those inside segmental duplications, nearly a quarter overlap with intronic/UTR and 3.9% overlap with exonic regions (Supplementary Fig. 10b).

Consistent with the closer genetic distance to HG002 (ref. 27), the sequences from our assemblies, which were also absent from CHM13 and HPRC, have more shared sequences with HG002 than CN1 (Supplementary Fig. 10c). The new sequences are well spread across the chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. 10d,e).

We annotated the assemblies with genes of various types based on the publicly available CHM13 annotation. The distribution of genes identified across the chromosomes was found to be proportionate and similar to CHM13 (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Stratifying per-gene category, the number of genes across the assemblies is relatively uniform and similar to CHM13 for all established 27 gene categories, except for rRNA genes known to vary in number of copies between individuals28 (Fig. 4a). Specifically, the assemblies show 97–100% coverage for the six largest gene categories in the genome namely protein coding, LncRNA, pseudogenes, miRNA, transcribed pseudogenes and snoRNA (Fig. 4b). The number of genes observed for sex chromosome was consistent with the sample sex (Supplementary Fig. 11b,c). Per participant, Qatari 1 and 2 haplotypes demonstrate exceptionally high coverage, exceeding 99% for protein-coding genes.

Source data

We annotated HLA and KIR genes in the assemblies using a recent whole-genome-assembly-based method and compared the annotated genes against a set of 220 pre-annotated assembly haplotypes, including HLA assemblies, HPRC, CPC, CHM13, CN-T2T and GRCh38 (ref. 29). The ME child assemblies had alleles in 47 genes, all of which had one copy except C4B which had two copies (Supplementary Fig. 12). The genes harbored 233 alleles, including previously reported alleles in the HLA-A locus, which are consistently found to be largely common or well documented in populations of ME ancestry30 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Furthermore, amongst the 47 genes, we found 33 genes that contained 75 new alleles (that is absent from the Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD)) with intact coding DNA sequence (CDS) region (Extended Data Fig. 3a). These alleles, of which there are 17–30 per assembly (Extended Data Fig. 1b), are found in regions of reliable assembly as determined using Flagger. They include 11 unique alleles, each having one to seven mutations in CDS regions (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14a). In terms of impact on protein sequence, ten are new missense, five are known missense and ten are synonymous (Supplementary Fig. 14b,c). The DNA and protein sequence alignments highlighting these mutations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 15. Phylogenetic trees show the known alleles in the study participants are spread over multiple diverged lineages while some of the new alleles are found to be closely clustered, pointing to potential common founder lineages (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 16).

To gain insight into the genetic variation in the ME assemblies, we compared them against the widely used genome references GRCh38 and CHM13, whereby we performed assembly-based alignment and called single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels) and various types of structural variants (SVs). Assembly-based alignment relies on mapping assembled contigs against a given reference instead of individual reads in classical read-based alignment, and was shown previously to lead to better accuracy31. Consistent with this, using this approach, we observe more accurate calls than using read-based alignments (Supplementary Fig. 17). Overall, there were an average of 6.6% more variants against CHM13 than GRCh38, the largest being shown for Sudanese (10.3%; Fig. 5a). This is most prominent for SV deletions which are 61.5–87.2% higher. The exception to this trend is for inversions, whereby, on average, they are 43.2% less against CHM13 than GRCh38. Comparing the assemblies, the Sudanese has 18.6% more SNVs and indels on average than those of other participants, whereas SV counts are more uniform (Supplementary Fig. 18). We found that 1,177–1,568 deletions and 1,325–1,641 insertions across the six families were entirely absent from the HPRC dataset. Also, more than half of them (51–56%) fall in repetitive regions, notably simple repeats, while 19–22% overlap with segmental duplications (Fig. 5b).

Source data

Next, we overlaid the generic variants on local ancestry segments. The aggregated counts per ancestry were reflective of the global ancestry of individual participants, rather than showing specific enrichment (Supplementary Fig. 19). When we plotted the number of variants per 1 Mb of ancestral segment as a function of chromosomal coordinate, we saw that the counts across segments fluctuated between ancestries, as illustrated for the near-complete chromosome 10 (Supplementary Fig. 20a). When we aggregated that, we observe 12–30% lower variant counts relative to African segments (Fig. 5c), in line with population distances (Supplementary Fig. 20b).

In light of the background consanguinity known to characterize ME populations, we explored ROH in the assemblies, which we calculated from the assembly-based alignments to CHM13. We classified ROH to medium (1–3 Mb) and long (≥3 Mb), which respectively reflect distant and recent inbreeding32,33. ROH segments are found genome-wide up to nine per chromosome, with variable cumulative ROH per chromosome (Extended Data Fig. 4). Cumulatively, the ME participants had an average 43.8 Mb medium ROH and 69.1 Mb long ROH, which is fivefold greater than a reference Yoruban trio (Fig. 5d). The father in the Jordanian trio exhibits the largest cumulative ROH (212.3 Mb), of which 174.6 Mb is of the long type which is remarkable given that he has not presented any clinical phenotypes. There is a high correlation between ROH segment size and gene content (Pearson correlation coefficient, R = 0.8, P < 10−4; Supplementary Fig. 22). Various types of genes are found in these ROH segments, including protein coding, pseudogenes and LncRNA without any category being particularly enriched (Supplementary Fig. 21c). Notably, the Jordanian father, who is a healthy participant, harbors exceptionally long ROH segments on chromosomes 6 (52.9 Mb) and 12 (37.6 Mb), the longest amongst all participants, spanning 30% and 28% of the chromosomes and covering 794 and 620 genes, respectively (Fig. 5e). We confirmed these long ROHs by examining the alignments of HiFi reads against CHM13 which showed homozygous genotypes throughout the region and introduction of heterozygous sites at the ends (Extended Data Fig. 5). We note that of the 537 ROH segments identified in the study participants, 72% (386) encompass at least one protein-coding gene with high probability of loss-intolerance (pLI) score >0.9 (ref. 34; Fig. 5f).

We performed a trio-based analysis to search for disease-causing variants that explain the disease phenotypes in the child participants (Methods). We examined the SNVs, indels and SV variants obtained for families against CHM13. Given that only the children are affected, we considered recessive and de novo modes of inheritance. We prioritized variants that were rare in population databases (allele frequency, AF < 0.01), including gnomAD35, 1KG36, HPRC8 and QGP phase 1 cohort14,37, have high predicted functional scores and whereby the proband conditions are consistent with gene phenotypes reported in ClinGen38, Gene2Phenotype (G2P) panel on Developmental Disorders39 and DECIPHER40.

Overall, we shortlisted 23 candidate variants relevant to the various phenotypes across the six probands, comprising 16 deletions, 6 insertions and 1 SNV, each participant having between 1 and 8 variants (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 23). In terms of inheritance mode, 12 are recessive while 11 are de novo. Regarding their location, four are shown to impact exons, whereas the rest impact intronic regions and overlapping regulatory features, therefore providing strong candidates as disease-causing (Supplementary Table 2). Based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, two of the variants are classified as pathogenic and one as likely pathogenic, found in the well-established genes of NFIX (associated with Malan Overgrowth Syndrome) and TSC2 (associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex), in addition to ABO which is less known to be implicated in neurodevelopment. Furthermore, 20 variants were classified as variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in genes reported to have strong evidence of association in the literature (ACMG total score ≥ 0.45). These include 10 that we classified as high interest VUS (ACMG total score = 0.60–0.75; Supplementary Table 2), such as SOX5 (delayed speech and language development) and BRSK2 (neurodevelopmental disorders). Notably, in Qatari 1 proband who has global developmental delay, we identified a 234 bp Del in intron 5 of KIF1A, which encodes a motor protein essential for axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors. A de novo mutation in this gene has been previously reported to cause cerebellar atrophy and epilepsy in an Egyptian child from a consanguineous marriage41 and other variants in this gene have been classified by ClinGen and G2P to have a ‘definitive' association with autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. The largest shortlisted variant is a homozygous Del (2.2 kb) in the intronic region of GABRG1 in the Jordanian proband who has seizures and autism. Variants in GABRG1 are associated with seizures and global developmental delay42. This gene encodes the γ1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor and has been associated with epileptic encephalopathy under ‘limited' class on G2P. Therefore, our finding supports a more assertive classification for this gene.

We observed that 50% of candidate variants we shortlisted using the assembly-based alignment approach were not called based on the classical approach of aligning long reads, either entirely or by calling the wrong zygosity (Fig. 5g). We checked that the assembly-based variants occurred in regions of high-quality assembly as indicated by Flagger. Furthermore, when we repeated the exercise of trio analysis based on variants obtained using the classical read-based approach, we shortlisted seven de novo variants for the six participants (Supplementary Table 3). We found that two of those were already detected using an assembly-based approach, including the SNV variant for NFIX, while the others were not valid de novo upon further examination of the read alignments, since they also appeared in the parental genomes as illustrated for the variants in TRPM3, AKT3 and KMD4B (Supplementary Fig. 24). Notably, that became clearer when the alignments were done against closer references, as illustrated by aligning Syrian participants against Jordanian father or HG002 (Supplementary Fig. 24).

The assemblies generated in this study allow us to assess the impact of a ME genome reference. First, to illustrate the relationship between genetic distance to the genome reference and the number of called variants, we aligned test samples with diverse ancestries from 1KG and ME populations against each of the ME child assemblies. For each assembly-ancestry combination pair, we used two test samples per population as follows: one closest and one furthest from the assembly, as identified based on principal component analysis (PCA). A significant linear correlation was observed between the number of variants and the Euclidean distance to the test samples for all assemblies except the Sudanese (R = 0.18; Fig. 6a).

The shape of the markers differentiates the samples with maximum and minimum distance from our assembly for a given ancestry. Regression lines and coefficients of the Pearson correlations are shown. Corresponding P values are <10−4 for all except Sudanese (P = 0.54), calculated using two-sided t test. b, Ratio of unmapped read pairs over mapped and number of singletons relative to MER1 in the replacement chromosomes for ME query samples (n = 15) for various reference genomes. Values were calculated per 1 Mb regions and averaged over chromosomes. c, Differences in variant counts per 1 Mb for ME query samples (n = 15) from various ME ancestries against various reference genomes relative to MER.

Source data

Next, to specifically compare the performance of a ME reference relative to the published T2T references controlling for completeness, we examined the impact on read mappability and variant calling of SNVs and SVs from aligning 27 short-read test samples with diverse ME Arab ancestries encompassing PAR, GAR and WEP against GRCh38, CHM13, HG002 and MER, a hybrid assembly based on CHM13 in which we replaced six chromosomes with diverse T2T haplotypes from Qatari 1 (chromosomes 4 and 18), Jordanian (chromosomes 10 and 12), Syrian (chromosome 6) and Qatari 2 (chromosome 11), which we denote as MER1. In terms of read mappability against the six chromosomes, MER1 shows a subtle but consistent trend of improved metrics relative to CHM13, HG002 and CN1 in this order (Fig. 6b). The difference in the normalized ratio of unmapped reads pairs over mapped relative to MER1 is highest for CN1 (median = 0.22) and lowest for CHM13 (median = 0.06). The number of singletons follows a similar trend with CN1, showing 3.6-fold more singletons relative to MER1 than CHM13. On the other hand, the metrics show a prominent improvement relative to GRCh38 (Supplementary Fig. 25). Regarding variant calls, more variants per MB relative to MER1 are obtained against other references, with HG002 being the closest. Respectively, GRCH38, CN1 and CHM13 show 7.1-, 2.3- and 1.3-fold more median variant counts in comparison to HG002 (Fig. 6c).

With the increasing ability to produce high-quality genome assemblies at a larger scale, generating population genome references has become more compelling than ever. However, the challenge remains in the strategy for sampling diverse admixture. While the HPRC pangenome included many East Asian genomes, the CPC pangenome revealed substantial diversity outside HPRC4,5. ME populations, with their distinct genetic structures and history, require more refined sampling methods. Our findings show varied admixture patterns linked to geographical dispersal, even among populations sharing language and culture. Thus, future efforts to construct accurate population references must consider historical and anthropological factors, instead of solely relying on modern delineations of regions and territories.

The use of parental information has long been considered the gold standard for phasing genome assemblies43; however, new methods relying on methylation, Hi-C and Strand-seq have substantially improved phasing quality for individual samples44,45,46. Nevertheless, in endogamous/consanguineous populations, parental phasing remains essential in resolving the extensive homozygosity. Trio datasets like the one presented here will help in developing population-specific recombination maps facilitating larger-scale phasing.

Our assemblies are nearly complete compared to CHM13, revealing 7–11 Mb of new sequences per participant, consistent with previous reports47. Some regions, such as centromeres and acrocentric p-arms, are not necessarily missing; however, they are difficult to align due to their divergence and ectopic recombination. Ninety percent of new sequences are in repetitive intergenic regions and the remaining are enriched for gene elements. Gene coverage is high with some decrease for rRNA genes, known to have multiple copies28. We identified 75 new HLA/KIR alleles in the assemblies, including 11 with CDS mutations. Four alleles were unique to Sudanese ancestry, consistent with its greater African genetic divergence. We map these alleles' phylogenetic context, which will serve as a valuable addition to understanding HLA/KIR diversity and their role in immune-mediated processes across populations48.

Soon, assembly-based methods are expected to replace read-based methods for alignment and variant calling, leading to higher accuracy49,50, especially when the query is divergent from the genome reference. This is highlighted by our comparison of DeepVariant (read based)51 and phased assembly variant caller (PAV) (assembly based)52. The ME assemblies exhibited 6.6% more variants against CHM13 than GRCh38, consistent with CHM13 having 8% more sequence than GRCh38 (ref. 6). We observed fewer SV deletions and more inversions against GRCh38, reflecting known imbalances8 and misorientations in the latter9,53. Nearly half of the new SVs in ME genomes span intronic and exonic regions, with a balanced distribution between repetitive and non-repetitive regions, suggesting a broad biological impact.

We show that assembly-based variant calling, especially with T2T references like CHM13, enhances variant detection and inheritance analysis in rare disease trios54. However, while this improves the identification of disease-causing variants, it may not immediately increase genetic diagnosis yield due to limited functional annotation, especially in non-coding regions55. Intronic variants are increasingly implicated in rare diseases56 but are often classified as VUS under current ACMG criteria due to the lack of algorithms scoring complex non-coding variants57. This makes functional validation a bottleneck for confirming many genetic diagnoses. As sequencing advances near-complete variant landscapes, large-scale genome annotation efforts—such as the IGVF consortium58—are urgently needed for systematic interpretation and prioritization.

Phased genome assembly allows more accurate ROH calculation, essential when studying consanguineous populations. As expected, we observe high ROH levels in the ME trios, especially long ROH, indicative of recent inbreeding32,33. This includes extended ROH in healthy individuals, leading to the autozygosity of many genes, uncovering extensive benign variation. Also, it harbors recessive deleterious variants contributing to disease phenotypes16. While de novo variants are a major cause of developmental disorders59, recessive variants, as shown here, are relevant in consanguineous populations, and multiple variants can co-occur, explaining comorbidities and variable penetrance60.

Finally, we demonstrated that using ME assemblies as references reduces variant calls and improves mappability compared to unmatched references, highlighting the need for population-specific genome references to capture relevant variations, including pathogenic ones. As more disease cohorts undergo long-read sequencing and de novo assembly, these data could enhance pangenome efforts with informative haplotypes as long as they lack gross chromosomal abnormalities. While there is a need for a universal pangenome reference cataloging global variation61, its wide adoption remains challenging. That is also compounded by the shift toward direct genome comparisons using multiple alignments. Nevertheless, integrating ME pangenomes and other regional datasets would greatly enrich the genomic and biomedical landscape.

The study participants consist of six parent–child family trios (n = 18) from the local population in Qatar recruited at Sidra Medicine, whereby children were ascertained for neurodevelopmental disorders. Previously, three families (Sudanese, Jordanian and Qatari 2) had negative genetic diagnoses based on microarrays and selected panels.

The families are from various nationalities from the greater ME region—Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Qatar (2X) and Afghanistan. Whole peripheral blood samples were collected from the individuals, stored in EDTA tubes at −80 °C and subsequently processed for DNA and RNA sequencing as described below.

Written informed consent and assent were obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Sidra Medicine Ethics Committee.

Whole-genome Illumina short-read sequencing was performed at Sidra Medicine. First, genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples on the QIAsymphony System (QIAGEN) using the DSP DNA Midi Kit, per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA quantity and quality were assessed using NanoDrop 8000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific); the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths was used to check DNA purity. A fluorescence-based quantification was performed on FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices) using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA integrity was checked on LabChip GX (PerkinElmer). Next, 150 bp paired-end read libraries were constructed and sequencing was performed on a HiSeq X System at Sidra Medicine at 30× coverage. QC was done using FastQC62 and MultiQC63. All reads that had more than an average of 450 million unique paired-end reads were retained. SAMtools v1.17 (ref. 64) and Mosdepth v0.3.2 (ref. 65) were used to calculate coverage and number of mapped reads.

PacBio HiFi sequencing was performed at the University of Washington, as previously described66 with some modifications. Briefly, high-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from the flash frozen peripheral blood samples using the QIAGEN MagAttract HMW DNA Kit (67563). After quality and quantity checks (Agilent FEMTO Pulse, M5330AA and FP-1002-0275; Denovix, DS-11 FX; Thermo Fisher Scientific Q32854), DNA was sheared on Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode, B06010003 and E07010003) twice using settings 29/31 to obtain a peak size around 22 kb. SMRTbell library preparation with the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (PacBio, 100-938-900) and size selection on Sage Science PippinHT (HPE7510) were performed as previously described in ref. 66. Next, sequencing was performed using 3–4 SMRT cells on the Sequel II platform with chemistry version 2.2, 30-h movie times and 2 h pre-extension (PacBio, 101-894-200), leading to coverage of 30–50× per sample. Data quality was evaluated using SMRTlink v.10.1 QC reports from which we used the awk v4.0.2 {print [field]} command to extract the fields relating to sequencing quality, read length distribution and coverage. CCS reads with QV ≥ 20 were retained for subsequent analysis.

de novo genome assembly was conducted by running the trioHiFiasm pipeline23 (hifiasm -o sample.asm -t32 -1 pat.yak -2 mat.yak HiFisample.fq.gz), using the parental short reads to create k-mers generated using yak/0.1 (yak count -k31 -b37 -t threads -o output.parental_yak) to construct a pair of haplotype-resolved phased assemblies. The fasta files for the assembly pipeline was generated from gfa files using awk v4.0.2 (https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/).

Various assembly quality metrics were calculated on the haploid assemblies using stats.sh script in BBmap (v38.69)67. Phasing quality was evaluated using Merqury v1.3 (ref. 24) by examining blob plots, switch error rates and phased blocks to ensure completeness, accuracy and reliability. The QV score was used to quantify phasing accuracy and completeness. Telomer count checks were made using seqtk telo68, confirming the presence of telomere repeats (TTAGGG) at chromosomal ends of the assemblies.

HiFi read-based evaluation of the assemblies was performed by running the Flagger v0.3.3 pipeline following the standard workflow as previously described4. For each assembly, it classifies segments of the assembly sequence into five categories, namely Haploid (reliable), unknown, duplicated, collapsed and erroneous.

Assembly-to-assembly alignment was conducted using Minimap2 (ref. 25) with options -x asm5 -c, which produced paf files with CIGAR string. To allow visualization with SafFire69, the paf files were converted to SafFire format using rustybam v0.1.31 (ref. 70) with the command rb break-paf --max-size 5000 | rb orient | rb filter --paired-len 100000 | rb stats –paf. The SafFire files were uploaded to an internally deployed SafFire server, which provided an interface to visualize the alignments of haplotypes to GRCh38 and CHM13 (v2.0).

For the variant calling in ME assemblies relative to GRCh38 and CHM13, we used two approaches: One based on HiFi read alignments and the other on assembly-based alignments. For the first approach, pbmm2 1.13.0, a wrapper for minimap2 (ref. 25) was used to generate the alignment and DeepVariant v1.5.0 (ref. 51) was used to call both SNVs and indels, while PBSV was used to call SVs71. For the second approach, PAV v2.3.3 (ref. 52) was used to do both the alignment and calling of SNVs, indels and SVs including insertions, deletions (≥50 bp) and inversions.

For variant calling of various reference samples from the 1KG and QGP against the assemblies, Illumina short reads were aligned using BWA-MEM72 and DeepVariant v1.5.0 (ref. 51) was used to call SNVs and indels. Variants with the PASS filter were retained for downstream analysis.

PCA was performed using SNVs from a dataset combining the 18 study participants, 2,504 samples from the 1KG phase 3 dataset36 and 6,216 samples from the QGP phase 1 (refs. 14,37) in addition to an internal diverse set of ME participants at Sidra Medicine (n = 1,693). For the published datasets, SNVs with the PASS filter were used. For the study participants, SNVs were obtained from the Illumina data by aligning to GRCh37 and calling the variants using the GATK best practice workflow73, retaining only SNVs with the PASS filter. The combined dataset was generated using BCFtools isec v1.17 (ref. 64) and contained 21.3 million SNPs. We applied a minor allele frequency (MAF) filter with a 0.01 threshold, resulting in 7.9 million variants from which principal components were calculated using PLINK v2.00a2LM 64-bit Intel (7 January 2019)74.

RFMix v2.0.0 (ref. 75) was used to assign global and local ancestry for the genomes of each study participant based on VCF file containing Illumina-derived SNPs and indels, using as reference a diverse panel from the 1KG and QGP phase 1 cohort which consists of 176 representative individuals identified as having a dominant ancestral fraction >90% for eight distinct ancestral fractions14. This was derived from Admixture analysis of 6,216 samples from QGP and 2,504 samples from 1KG14, ensuring diversity encompasses various continental populations including various ME groups. Output from RFMix consisted of ancestry estimates for chromosomal painting as well as global ancestry estimates (.Q file). RFMix requires phased genotypes, therefore, these were generated using EAGLE v2.4.1 (ref. 76), which was run with three iterations and by providing genetic map and default parameters.

Insertions from PAV alignment for the assemblies against CHM13 (2.0) were collapsed per participant using truvari77 (truvari collapse -r 500 -p 0.95 -P 0.95 -s 50 -S 100000). Unique sequences were identified by comparing with the cohort of 47 samples from HPRC for which SVs were previously called8 using truvari (truvari bench -r 1000 -C 1000 -O 0.8 -p 0.8 -P 0.0 -s 50 -S 15 --sizemax 100000). An 80% reciprocal overlap was used. In addition, insertions from various participants were also collapsed into a unique set of sequences using the same process starting from collapsed insertions per participant. Subsequently, the resulting sequences were checked similarly for overlap with HG002 (v. 1.0.1) and CN1.

We used bedtools v2.30 (ref. 78) with default options including overlap threshold of 1 bp to intersect SVs with bed files obtained from the CHM13 public resource, namely genetic features (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/009/914/755/GCF_009914755.1_T2T-CHM13v2.0/GCF_009914755.1_T2T-CHM13v2.0_genomic.gtf.gz), repetitive regions (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/annotation/chm13v2.0_RepeatMasker_4.1.2p1.2022Apr14.bed), segmental duplications (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/annotation/chm13v2.0_SD.full.bed), centromeric and satellite repeats (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/annotation/chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed).

To annotate assemblies with known genes, we used Liftoff v1.6.3 (ref. 79), using NCBI Refseq GTF file for CHM13 (https://github.com/marbl/CHM13?tab=readme-ov-file) with default parameters. The pLI scores for individual genes were obtained from gnomAD35 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads#v4-constraint).

We used Immuannot to annotate the alleles of HLA and KIR genes per genome haplotype29. We typed the alleles of these genes using default options and extracted CDS mutations and CDS distance for new gene alleles. The results were compared with previously published annotations of 220 pre-annotated reference haplotypes, including HLA assemblies and those from HPRC, CPC, CHM13, CN-T2T and GRCh38.p14 downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/8372992.

Phylogenetic trees were generated by first extracting the DNA sequences of each immune gene from the study assemblies using SAMtools v1.17 (ref. 64). These sequences were combined with the publicly available reference sequences into a single FASTA file per gene. This was used as input to generate a multiple-sequence alignment and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using Clustal Omega80. The trees were plotted using TreeViewer81. Sequences were retrieved from the IPD48. Alignment figures were generated using Jalview82.

Allele frequencies for HLA-A alleles were obtained from the CIWD catalog v3.0 (ref. 30). Population ancestry of source samples for the closest alleles to the new alleles identified in the assemblies was obtained for the IPD48.

ROH segments were identified per participant using Automap v1.2 (ref. 83) using default parameters and variant calls from PAV for the assemblies against CHM13 as input. GTF file was also provided as input, which resulted in the annotation of ROH segments using genes. A selection of ROH regions was visually verified using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)84.

Using SNVs, indels and SVs produced from the trios called against CHM13, we perform trio-based analysis for each family following the workflow of Exomiser v14 (ref. 85), which itself does not support the CHM13 reference. This method combines variant prioritization and phenotypic concordance86. Given that the disease symptoms affect the children only, we considered the modes of inheritance of recessive and de novo. First, we shortlisted variants that met each mode of inheritance and then did a lift over to GRCh38 coordinates followed by running annotation using Jannovar87 and annotSV v3.4.2 (ref. 88) to retrieve various functional scores and allele frequencies from various public databases including allele frequencies from various public databases including gnomAD v4.0 (ref. 35), dbVar and 1KG36, to which we appended allele frequencies from Qatar Genome Project Phase 1 (refs. 14,37). For the SV annotation with annotSV v3.4.2 (ref. 88), we adopted minimum 80% reciprocal overlap to account for breakpoint imprecision. We selected variants with AF < 0.01 in various population databases and have genotype–phenotype association P vaue of <0.05 and a gene combined score and genotype–phenotype score of >0.8. Further filtering was performed based on variants with a high functional consequence. Finally, we cross-checked in ClinGen38, DECIPHER38 and Gene2Phenotype39 to confirm the relevance of the link obtained to the proband's condition. We checked that variants were in regions flagged as reliable by Flagger v0.3.3 (ref. 4).

We performed variant classification for SNVs and Indels based on the guidelines recommended by ACMG89, and for SVs based on the joint recommendations by ACMG and ClinGen90 and as implemented in Franklin (https://franklin.genoox.com/clinical-db/home). For the latter, we classified variants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS if they have total ACMG scores ≥ 0.99, 0.90–0.98 and −0.89 to 0.89, respectively.

To assess read mappability against various genome references, we selected 27 representative samples with diverse ME Arab ancestries encompassing PAR, GAR and WEP for which Illumina reads (30×) were mapped against each reference using DRAGEN91. Metrics of the ratio of unmapped read pairs over mapped, percentage of properly paired reads and number of singletons were calculated based on values obtained from the output of DRAGEN and were tabulated to generate the various plots.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are typical of those used in the field of study. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Pearson correlation with two-sided significance was calculated. The tools and packages used for the processing and analysis of data in this study have been reported in the Methods and Study summary, with the specific versions allowing the reproducibility of the results. In all box plots in this study, the boxes indicate the middle 50% of the data, while whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range. The lower quartiles are dark shaded and the upper ones are light shaded.

The ultra-fast-fashion company Shein spent years carefully curating its corporate identity. Its apparent goal was to create a brand born from social media, distinct from any single place but whose products were everywhere. Shein has been more successful in some aspects of this pursuit than in others. The company grew into a global online shopping juggernaut, thanks in large part to its extremely low prices. But its efforts to remain anonymous and inoffensive have been undone by allegations of labor abuses, environmental criticisms and, despite moving its headquarters to Singapore, persistent concerns about its Chinese ownership.

Its latest shape shift took place largely behind the scenes in Washington, DC, where the company took a sharp turn over the past few years into the world of MAGA. Many companies have shamelessly courted President Donald Trump, hoping to curry favor with a uniquely transactional American leader, but few appear to have gone as far as Shein. The company counts Kash Patel, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as a shareholder in its parent company, WIRED reported in February. Deputy US attorney general Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking official at the Department of Justice, disclosed that Shein was previously one of his legal clients.

Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative (USTR) who serves as the president's top adviser on matters related to international trade, also advised the company before joining the Trump administration, according to a former Shein employee as well as internal documents reviewed by WIRED. And a host of lobbyists drawn from the orbit of Trumpworld continue to push the company's talking points across DC. Shein, which did not register hiring a single lobbyist until 2022, spent $3.9 million on federal lobbying last year, according to public records. In the first quarter of 2025, it has doled out $1.49 million.

“As is standard practice for global businesses, Shein routinely seeks counsel from a range of advisers on priority policy areas for the business,” a company spokesperson told WIRED. “We welcome the opportunity to work with policymakers and industry peers wherever we operate to make sure our unique, on-demand business model, and strict supply chain policies are well understood.” The USTR office did not respond to requests for comment.

But despite the company's overtures, Trump has dealt Shein a series of devastating blows since returning to office. His administration imposed punishing tariffs on Chinese imports that threaten to erode the company's price advantage and simultaneously moved to close a crucial trade loophole called the de minimis provision that allowed the ecommerce giant to flood the US with low-cost packages shipped into the country duty-free.

These unwelcome developments come as Shein has struggled in its bid to go public. It is now reportedly seeking a place on London's rapidly shrinking stock exchange after being shut out of the US market. The company is under pressure from investors to slash its valuation to around $30 billion, a steep decline from a valuation of $100 billion in 2022, according to Bloomberg.

Ahead of the November US presidential election, Donald Tang, an East-West dealmaker who previously failed to strike it big in Hollywood and now serves as Shein's executive chairman, was making the rounds in Washington, dropping in to chat with China hawks skeptical of the company. “He was totally, chapter and verse, singing the MAGA hymn of ‘I love Trump. I love America,'” says Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute think tank who has been critical of Shein and other Chinese companies' lobbying efforts and met with Tang in June.

By then, Shein—once naive about how things work in Washington—had learned to play the uniquely American game of naked influence peddling. An eight-page Shein internal document from June 2023 reviewed by WIRED titled “U.S. Public Affairs Campaign Working Group List,” outlined what the company's vast team of public and government relations professionals and some lobbyists was tasked with working on, including focus areas like US-China relations and media outreach.

Greer was then working as a partner at the law firm King & Spalding, and his focus area was described as “legal advice around international trade policy.” Two other King & Spalding partners are also listed on the document as providing guidance to Shein on related issues, such as crafting potential congressional testimony and handling investigations launched by lawmakers. King & Spalding continues to work with Shein, according to a person familiar with the situation. The law firm did not respond to requests for comment.

During Trump's first administration, Greer served as chief of staff to the trade representative, and then went on to join King & Spalding in 2020, according to an announcement from the firm. It is unclear when his work for Shein began or how it was structured. A mandated financial disclosure that Greer filed in December 2024 before he was confirmed does not mention Shein or any of its related companies.

It does note, however, that Greer provided services to 51 additional clients that remained confidential because “disclosure of the client identity and the fact of representation would reveal a client confidence or secret.” In a separate ethics agreement about potential conflicts of interest, Greer promised to “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter” involving parties represented by King & Spalding for one year after his resignation without prior authorization.

A former Shein employee, who asked not to be identified because of fear of retaliation, says that Greer previously advised Leonard Lin, Shein's president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and global head of public affairs. One project Greer worked on, the former employee says, was assisting Lin with drafting a response to questions about Shein's business practices raised by a bipartisan group of senators.

The senators wrote in February 2023 to Xu Yangtian, Shein's founder, seeking more information on the company's alleged possible ties to supply chains in China's Xinjiang region, where the Chinese government has been accused of widespread human rights abuses against a local Muslim minority population. The letter followed a report by Bloomberg the previous year that found cotton in some Shein products it commissioned for testing matched materials that had been produced with cotton from Xinjiang.

The response from Shein did not directly dispute the reporting. It outlined the company's regulatory compliance policies and third-party auditing procedures, at times relying on nearly indecipherable jargon. It stated, for example, that Shein developed a “proprietary material traceability information management system,” to monitor its supply chains. (The letter was signed by Lin, not Xu, who maintains an exceedingly low profile. The Wall Street Journal has referred to him as “the world's most anonymous CEO.”)

Greer's work for a Chinese company appears at odds with the dark vision he has articulated of Beijing's intentions to remake the global order and how it uses international trade to accomplish those ends. A month after Shein sent the letter to lawmakers, Greer testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on the US-China trade relationship, telling lawmakers that China presented an “existential” threat to the US. Beijing seeks to “dominate global manufacturing and technology to secure CCP leverage and control over the global economy and foreign governments,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. Last year, he called for a raft of changes to the US trade relationship with China, including ending the de minimis provision.

De minimis, which allows for packages valued under $800 to enter the US duty-free and with limited oversight, exploded in popularity during the Covid pandemic. Customs and Border Protection processed approximately 4 million de minimis shipments a day in 2024, up from 2.8 million the previous year, the vast majority of which originated in China. Overall, the agency says de minimis shipments account for 92 percent of all cargo entering the country. Shein said in the 2023 letter to lawmakers that most of its packages enter the US under the provision.

Adam Savit, director of the China Policy Initiative at the America First Policy Institute think tank, likens Shein's liberal use of de minimis to broader issues he sees with Beijing's approach to trade. “The problem is China's abuse of a global trade system that was built on the assumption that all players would abide by certain rules,” Savit says. For example, China does not extend the same de minimis benefits to the US. Trump “abhors lack of reciprocity, and the loophole is one of the most extreme examples,” Savit says.

Shein has already begun raising its prices in response to Trump's trade policies. It is likely that shipping times will increase too, not just for Shein customers but for anyone purchasing low-cost goods from China. “Because the administration wants to discourage imports from China, you are going to pay duty, and it might take longer to get cleared,” says John Leonard, former deputy executive assistant commissioner at Customs and Border Protection. “It is the execution of a trade barrier.”

In January 2024, Shein brought on longtime retail lobbyist Kent Knutson, previously the head of Home Depot's Washington operation, a hire that marked the start of the company's more dramatic rightward turn. Three months later, financial disclosures show, Patel, now the FBI director, began working as a consultant for an entity in the Cayman Islands called Elite Depot—the parent organization of Shein. Patel's deal with the ecommerce giant was structured in an unusual way: He was compensated for nine months of work with stock valued at between $1 million and $5 million.

Patel retained his stake in Elite Depot despite being confirmed as FBI director, giving him a direct financial interest in a Chinese company. If Shein goes public, Patel's shares would be his to trade on the open market. (Patel was named a senior fellow at the America First Policy Institute during the period he was consulting for Shein. Savit, who authored a highly critical report on the ecommerce company, declined to comment on Patel's work for Shein and other lobbying done by current Trump administration officials.) A Shein spokesperson also declined to comment on Patel's stake in its parent organization.

A group of Democratic lawmakers wrote to Patel in February asking for more details about his role at Shein. They have not gotten a response, says a spokeswoman for Senator Adam Schiff, who organized the letter. The number of people willing to work for Shein shows “the low price that DC swamp creatures will sell their souls for,” Sobolik says. He cautions that, despite the company's setbacks, Shein will be angling for a reprieve when trade talks begin again and is hoping its Trump-friendly connections eventually pay off. “They are going to have to hope and pray that whenever America and China start talking about some sort of an off ramp, that they are one of those bargain chips,” he says.

Less than a year before Patel began working as a consultant for Shein, his Trump administration colleague, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was warning his then senate colleagues about the company, arguing it “steals intellectual property, infringes copyrights, exploits US trade law, and uses fabric linked to Uyghur slave labor.” Rubio was particularly critical about Shein's efforts to influence lawmaking. “Shein is hiring DC lobbyists to protect the trade loopholes that allow it to avoid accountability,” he wrote in a letter to his Senate colleagues. “No one should be fooled by Shein's efforts to cover its tracks.”

I've been eagerly awaiting the advent of spatial computing. My home office desk setup, with multiple screens and browser windows, helps me be very productive. But on the go, I'm relegated to a laptop's 13-inch screen (or packing a portable monitor), and I'm not as efficient.

Spatial computing—usually driven by a mixed reality headset or smart glasses—lets you craft a multi-monitor virtual workspace, where you can place apps and browser windows around your periphery to replicate the experience you have set up at home or the office. Or you can take it a step further, because you're only limited by your imagination. Over the years, I've tested various versions of the technology, from the Nimo Planet smart glasses I used at CES to Apple's Vision Pro on a flight to Barcelona, as companies compete to sit at the forefront of the next era in computing. No one has been able to offer a reasonable experience—until now.

I first saw Sightful's Spacetop spatial computing software in a hotel suite at CES 2023, before the company came out of stealth mode. The initial experience worked with a pair of smart glasses connected to the bottom half of a laptop, just the keyboard and trackpad with no display, which also housed the computer's guts. In 2024, the company debuted the G1, a polished version ready for market, but Sightful CEO Tamir Berliner says the sudden advent of “AI PCs,"" which now offered enough power to drive a spatial computing experience, forced it to revisit its hardware.

That leads us to today's Spacetop for Windows. Instead of a custom laptop hardware sans display and software powered by Chromium, Sightful's new approach is to provide the smart glasses and let you download its Spacetop software onto a compatible Windows laptop. It costs $899 for the glasses and the software, and after the first year, you'll be charged $200 annually for access to the Spacetop software. Despite working at a few coffee shops this past week, I've been just as efficient virtually as in my work-from-home setup. I already don't want to be without it.

Spacetop for Windows is a piece of downloadable software, and it's designed to work with Xreal's Air 2 Ultra augmented reality glasses, which are included in your purchase. You can get prescription lens inserts for the glasses, as I did, meaning I could remove my eyeglasses to use the Xreal. If you have smart glasses from another company with similar features (namely, six degrees of freedom), you can reach out to Sightful to see if there's a solution to get Spacetop running on them. The company hopes to support a wider range of smart glasses over time.

The caveat is that Spacetop has specific laptop requirements. It only supports Intel CPUs, Core Ultra 7 or 9 Series 1 or Series 2 chipsets (155H or above), and needs at least 16 gigabytes of RAM. Sightful has a few recommended laptops on its website, like the Dell XPS, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i, the Asus Zenbook S 14, and the Acer Swift Go 14. The company says that as adoption grows, it may add support for other CPUs, like those from Qualcomm, and it hopes to have a working version for MacBooks in 2026.

I tested Spacetop on an HP OmniBook Ultra Flip with the Core Ultra 7 Series 2 chip. To get going, plug the Xreal glasses into the laptop via the USB-C cable, then launch the Spacetop app. Your open apps and browser windows will show up in a virtual space, and you can move them around and resize the windows however you see fit. (You use the laptop's keyboard and trackpad to interface with Spacetop.) If you unplug the glasses and then plug them back in some time later, Spacetop still remembers your preferred layout, unless you close specific apps.

There's a simple dock at the bottom where you can see open apps as well as the Windows button to search through the operating system for apps or files. Tap the “i” icon to reveal shortcut keys to move the virtual space via keyboard commands. For example, pressing the left and right shift keys will center the canvas in the direction you're looking. You can push the virtual screens away from your eyes or closer, move them up or down, and even tilt them if you want to recline in a chair. Plus, I like that you can click on an empty space and drag the virtual screen to a specific app instead of turning your neck.

Most apps should work fine, but intensive apps like video and photo editing services may struggle. I primarily used multiple Chrome browser windows and tabs, had the Telegram messaging client on top, and Slack over to the left. I even launched Zoom and had it on the right during video calls. I gave Adobe Lightroom Classic a shot, but the app began behaving strangely in Spacetop, so I didn't use it. Sightful says as much on its website: “We are still working to make advanced applications like video editors or 3D graphics software run smoothly.” Gaming also falls into that camp.

No one can view your work, which is nice for handling sensitive information, and the only way around that on a traditional laptop is to use a privacy screen. At the moment, the laptop screen stays on when you're in Spacetop, but people will only be able to see a blank desktop. Sightful says it's planning an update that will turn it off to conserve battery life.

Speaking of which, I haven't used the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip as a normal laptop, so I can't confirm its regular battery stats, but HP claims “all-day battery life,” and various reviews of this laptop around the web seem to confirm this. With the AR glasses plugged in and Spacetop running, though, you're more likely to get roughly three to four hours of use, depending on what you're doing. Within an hour and a half of use, the laptop's battery life was cut in half.

I don't see this being a huge issue because most of the time you'd be using Spacetop will likely be in those short periods at a coffee shop or airport lounge, or heck, even on a plane. (There's a travel mode that lets you use Spacetop on fast-moving transportation.) And usually, if that's the case, there's probably a spot you can plug in your PC.

So much of what makes Spacetop a joy to use is the glasses. The text is fairly sharp through the dual OLED display panels, though I wish the glasses had a wider field of view than 50 degrees. More importantly, this isn't a bulky Apple Vision Pro—I wore Xreal's glasses for more than three hours in one sitting, and I can't imagine doing that with Apple's VR headset. Mind you, my eyes did feel a little tired after that time, but I love that taking it off isn't a chore; it's just like removing a normal pair of glasses. I also don't feel closed off to the rest of the world—the speakers built into the arms of the glasses make it so you don't need to wear earbuds—and the whole system is far easier to travel with, complete with a glasses case.

The rocker button on the glasses frame lets you adjust the screen brightness, but there's another button that cycles through three dimming modes for the lenses: normal, dim, and dark. In the first mode, you can see the world ahead of you as the virtual screens are layered on top. This is especially handy if you're sitting in front of someone and working, but are occasionally chit-chatting. They can see your eyes, too. Outside, you'll want to dim the screen, providing a nice black backdrop for the virtual environment, and the Xreal glasses will look like sunglasses.

You won't look like a douchebag with these on, unlike if you wore Apple's Vision Pro in public, but it only takes a little more than a passing glance for someone to realize Xreal's Air 2 Ultra aren't sunglasses. Or so I thought. I sat outside a busy coffee shop, and no one gave me weird looks, and I also felt far more comfortable wearing them in public. Funnily enough, I got more confused stares when I wore it to a Zoom meeting.

“You look like Dr. Strangelove,"" a coworker commented on the Zoom chat. Someone else mentioned Ray Charles. Then a colleague joked that it was hard for him to take me seriously while I was wearing the glasses. The meeting notes capped it off: “The meeting was fine, but Julian may or may not look like an idiot.”

I think one reason for the vitriol is that to all of my virtual companions, I'm looking upward. This is one of the other secret benefits of Spacetop. I don't need to crane my neck and stare at a fixed laptop screen. However, because the webcam is down there on the laptop, my colleagues are getting an unflattering angle of my face, one that highlights the awkward design of the Xreal glasses even more than if they were looking at it straight on. The easiest solution is to just turn your video off (if you really care).

I haven't run into many bugs or issues with Spacetop—it feels remarkably slick. But here are a few: Sometimes, when I boot it up for the first time, I need to unplug the glasses and plug them back in for Spacetop to load, but Sightful says this is an HP-specific bug it's addressing soon. On another occasion, a few Chrome tabs struggled to load, but I haven't encountered that problem since. Sightful says Spacetop can accommodate any number of tabs and apps, but it all depends on the power of the processor in your laptop. The more powerful your laptop, the better your Spacetop experience.

You also can't ungroup or group browser tabs easily by dragging them; instead, I right-click the tab and tap “Move tab to another window.” It's not as user-friendly but at least there's a solution; Sightful says it's working on a fix. One annoying thing I dealt with was more of a Windows problem, where the trackpad would think my two-finger swipe up was a three-finger swipe up and would try to show the desktop. This looked jarring in Spacetop and disrupted my flow. Thankfully, I was able to turn it off in the Windows settings.

Spacetop isn't for most people. It's for power users who have too many browser tabs open to count and have multi-monitor setups they miss when traveling. It's for the person who wants to do some work on the flight and pays for the in-flight Wi-Fi (that inevitably doesn't work). There are things that are still not supported, like screen sharing in apps like Zoom, but Sightful says it's on the road map, with more to come.

The software hinges on the smart-glasses experience, which I imagine will continue to get smaller, thinner, lighter—maybe even wireless—until you can't tell them apart from regular eyeglasses. But for now, Sightful has crafted a practical and genuinely useful spatial computing experience that I haven't experienced before. There's almost no learning curve since it still very much feels like you're using a laptop, just with an expansive virtual screen that's yours to fill.

Hello WIRED subscribers! Thank you to everyone who attended our most recent AI Unlocked webinar. I really enjoyed our lively discussion about ChatGPT's software features and wish I could have answered even more of your questions about using generative AI tools.

I really enjoyed the questions about what ChatGPT can do beyond just chatting. Image search is a feature I use often, and here are my first impressions of the tool that I recorded back in September 2023 when it first dropped. I use ChatGPT's image search tool nowadays by snapping a picture with my phone when I don't recognize something. I'll upload the screenshot and ask the chatbot what it is. For example, I was recently at an Irish bar and learned what a hurley was when I saw one hanging on the wall and was perplexed. (Although, I also could have just asked the friendly bartenders when I got another coffee drink.)

What are some ChatGPT features that I wasn't able to go deep on during the 45-minute session? Two come to mind: temporary chats and memory.

Temporary chats keep things slightly more private. For example, the log of the conversation will not appear on the left side of your screen when it's over like it normally does. Temporary chats are not protected enough that you should feel comfortable sharing private information—definitely still don't do that—but this is a nice option for chats you don't necessarily need or want saved for your own use later.

ChatGPT's memory function has gotten better over time. While some information about you will be stored passively as you use the tool (unless you turn it off in the settings), I think actively engaging with ChatGPT's memory by telling it your preferences does lead to a better software experience overall.

What are the drawbacks of ChatGPT? There are three I want to highlight here. These are all issues I keep in mind as I'm using any AI tool, and think you should as well.

First, hallucinations are still a problem, so you should never put full trust in an AI's output. Always doublecheck your answers against trusted sources of information. Second, generative AI amplifies biases. Some biases are very evident, while others are more subtle. Check out my interview with Margaret Mitchell, an AI ethics researcher at Hugging Face, to learn more about how a top researcher is thinking about stereotypes within AI tools. Third, generative AI tools are resource intensive when compared to other software programs, and the overall environmental impact of your usage may be much more than you'd expect.

If you want to know more about data privacy when it comes to ChatGPT, then this recent article from WIRED's security team about what happens to your data if you follow the “AI action figure” trend on social media is worth reading. As I mentioned in the webinar, our article about how to opt out from AI training is also worth checking out for more context and to learn what your options are across many different websites.

Haven't already signed up for season two of the AI Unlocked newsletter? I would definitely recommend doing so. The 10 editions in season two include many hands-on tasks for you to try out multiple AI tools and think critically about the strengths and weaknesses. It includes many prompting tips for those hoping to better understand how to craft these kinds of software interactions. I also spent plenty of time answering more reader questions—one of the most fun and engaging parts of my job.

I really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to support WIRED and watch this webinar. Talk to you soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Scientists Have Just Discovered a New Type of Electricity-Conducting Bacteria","https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-have-just-discovered-a-new-type-of-electricity-conducting-bacteria/","Mon, 05 May 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

A new species of bacteria that functions like electrical wiring has recently been discovered on a brackish beach in Oregon. The species was named Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis in honor of the Yaquina tribe of Native Americans that once lived in and around Yaquina Bay, where the bacteria were found.

This species is a type of cable bacteria: rod-shaped microbes that are connected at both ends to one another to create a chain and which share an outer membrane, forming filaments several centimeters long. Cable bacteria are found in marine and freshwater sediments and, unusually among bacteria, are electrically conductive. This is due to their special metabolism, in which electrons generated by oxidizing sulfides in their deeper layers are sent to their surface layer, where they are received by oxygen and nitric acid.

The 25 species of cable bacteria known so far have been organized into two genera, Candidatus Electrothrix, which live in saltwater, and Candidatus Electronema, which live in fresh and brackish water. The new species discovered in this study has the genes and metabolic pathways of both the genera but is believed to be a bridge to an earlier branch of the Candidatus Electrothrix lineage, and so was classified as part of that genus.

The recently discovered species may provide new insights into how cable bacteria evolved and how they can function in diverse environments, Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University and coauthor of the research, explained in a statement.

Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis is distinct from existing cable bacteria in its appearance. Cable bacteria have outer shells that feature ridges, which spread out like mountains. The ridges of the new species are much thicker than those of previously known species, reaching an average thickness of about 228 nanometers, up to three times thicker than what has been seen before. The new species' ridges are arranged in a spiral-like pattern on the surface of the filament, and their overall shape is more angular than that of other species.

But the most striking difference is that the new species' filament is surrounded by a thick, transparent sheath. According to the authors of the paper outlining the discovery, this is a structure not previously seen. This sheath does not conduct electricity and is thought to protect the filament from the environment and foreign enemies.

A filament of Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis, the newly discovered species of cable bacteria.

Inside the new bacteria's ridge is a fiber containing a nickel-centered metal complex, which functions as a “biological wire” that efficiently transports electrons along the filament. It is as if the structure itself was designed with an engineering intent.

The physical performance of the bacteria as a conductor is impressive. When the researchers placed microscopically isolated filaments on a gold electrode and applied a voltage, a graph showing the change in current and voltage produced a linear, symmetrical I-V curve—implying high electrical conductivity. The new species' electrical resistance was approximately 370 kilo-ohms, which is equal to or better than that of known cable bacteria.

Genomic analysis revealed that the new species has genetic features of both the Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema genera. This phenomenon, where genetically distinct material is intermingled within a single individual, is known as “mosaicism.” For example, this can be seen in the novel bacteria's cytochrome, a type of protein involved in electron transport. Typically in the genus Candidatus Electrothrix, bacteria have a single heme (a complex composed of a divalent iron atom and a porphyrin). But the new species, like some other types of cable bacteria, is equipped with a cytochrome with two hemes.

This new species is also unique in the way it adapts to saline environments. Candidatus Electrothrix species, which live in saltwater, typically use an electron-transfer enzyme called “sodium-transporting NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NQR)” to regulate osmotic pressure. But this enzyme is absent in Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis, which instead has several proteins— “sodium and proton exchange transporters (NHE)”—that exchange sodium ions and protons across the cell membrane. This is thought to be the result of adaptation to the unique environment of brackish water, where salinity fluctuates.

Further studies will reveal the mechanism of the unique sheath formation of Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis as well as the self-assembling process of its conductive fibers. According to the research team, this new species, because it combines high-electrical conductivity and environmental adaptability, has the potential to be used as a new material in the field of bioelectronics. Potentially it could help with the creation of biodegradable electronic devices and biosensors in the future. Its characteristics may also be useful for remediation of heavy metals and organic pollutants in sedimentary environments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Rejoice! Carmakers Are Embracing Physical Buttons Again","https://www.wired.com/story/why-car-brands-are-finally-switching-back-to-buttons/","Mon, 05 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Automakers that nest key controls deep in touchscreen menus—forcing motorists to drive eyes-down rather than concentrate on the road ahead—may have their non-US safety ratings clipped next year.

From January, Europe's crash-testing organization EuroNCAP, or New Car Assessment Program, will incentivize automakers to fit physical, easy-to-use, and tactile controls to achieve the highest safety ratings. “Manufacturers are on notice,” EuroNCAP's director of strategic development Matthew Avery tells WIRED, “they've got to bring back buttons.”

Motorists, urges EuroNCAP's new guidance, should not have to swipe, jab, or toggle while in motion. Instead, basic controls—such as wipers, indicators, and hazard lights—ought to be activated through analog means rather than digital.

Driving is one of the most cerebrally challenging things humans manage regularly—yet in recent years manufacturers seem almost addicted to switch-free, touchscreen-laden cockpits that, while pleasing to those keen on minimalistic design, are devoid of physical feedback and thus demand visual interaction, sometimes at the precise moment when eyes should be fixed on the road.

A smattering of automakers are slowly admitting that some smart screens are dumb. Last month, Volkswagen design chief Andreas Mindt said that next-gen models from the German automaker would get physical buttons for volume, seat heating, fan controls, and hazard lights. This shift will apply “in every car that we make from now on,” Mindt told British car magazine Autocar.

Acknowledging the touchscreen snafus by his predecessors—in 2019, VW described the “digitalized” Golf Mk8 as “intuitive to operate” and “progressive” when it was neither—Mindt said, “we will never, ever make this mistake anymore … It's not a phone, it's a car.”

Still, “the lack of physical switchgear is a shame” is now a common refrain in automotive reviews, including on WIRED. However, a limited but growing number of other automakers are dialing back the digital to greater or lesser degrees. The latest version of Mazda's CX-60 crossover SUV features a 12.3-inch infotainment screen, but there's still physical switchgear for operating the heater, air-con, and heated/cooled seats. While it's still touch-sensitive, Mazda's screen limits what you can prod depending on the app you're using and whether you're in motion. There's also a real click wheel.

But many other automakers keep their touchscreen/slider/haptic/LLM doohickeys. Ninety-seven percent of new cars released after 2023 contain at least one screen, reckons S&P Global Mobility. Yet research last year by Britain's What Car? magazine found that the vast majority of motorists prefer dials and switches to touchscreens. A survey of 1,428 drivers found that 89 percent preferred physical buttons.

Motorists, it seems, would much prefer to place their driving gloves in a glove compartment that opens with a satisfying IRL prod on a gloriously yielding and clicking clasp, rather than diving into a digital submenu. Indeed, there are several YouTube tutorials on how to open a Tesla's glove box. “First thing,” starts one, “is you're going to click on that car icon to access the menu settings, and from there on, you're going to go to controls, and right here is the option to open your glove box.” As Ronald Reagan wrote, “If you're explaining, you're losing.”

The mass psychosis to fit digital cockpits is partly explained by economics—updatable touchscreens are cheaper to fit than buttons and their switchgear—but “there's also a natural tendency [among designers] to make things more complex than they need to be,” argues Steven Kyffin, a former dean of design and pro vice-chancellor at Northumbria University in the UK (the alma mater of button-obsessed Sir Jonny Ive).

“Creating and then controlling complexity is a sign of human power,” Kyffin says. “Some people are absolutely desperate to have the flashiest, most minimalist, most post-modern-looking car, even if it is unsafe to drive because of all the distractions.”

Automakers shouldn't encourage such consumers. “It is really important that steering, acceleration, braking, gear shifting, lights, wipers, all that stuff which enables you to actually drive the car, should be tactile,” says Kyffin, who once worked on smart controls for Dutch electronics company Philips. “From an interaction design perspective, the shift to touchscreens strips away the natural affordances that made driving intuitive,” he says.

“Traditional buttons, dials, and levers had perceptible and actionable qualities—you could feel for them, adjust them without looking, and rely on muscle memory. A touchscreen obliterates this,"" says Kyffin. ""Now, you must look, think, and aim to adjust the temperature or volume. That's a huge cognitive load, and completely at odds with how we evolved to interact with driving machines while keeping our attention on the road.”

To protect themselves from driver distraction accusations, most automakers are experimenting with artificial intelligence and large language models to improve voice-activation technologies, encouraging drivers to interact with their vehicles via natural speech, negating the need to scroll through menus. Mercedes-Benz, for example, has integrated ChatGPT into its vehicles' voice-control, but it's far too early to say whether such moves will finally make good on the now old and frequently broken promise of voice-controlled car systems from multiple manufacturers.

In fact, sticking with Mercedes, the tyranny of touchscreens looks set to be with us for some time yet. The largest glass dashboard outside of China is the 56-inch, door-to-door “Hyperscreen” in the latest S-Class Mercedes comprising, in one curvaceous black slab, a 12.3-inch driver's display, a 12.3-inch passenger touchscreen, and a 17.7-inch central touchscreen that, within submenus, houses climate control and other key functions.

To turn on the heated steering wheel on a Nissan Leaf, there's an easy-to-reach-without-looking square button on the dashboard. To be similarly toasty on the latest Mercedes, you will have to pick through a menu on the MBUX Hyperscreen by navigating to “Comfort Settings.” (You can also use voice control, by saying “Hey Mercedes,” but even if this worked 100 percent of the time, it is not always ideal to speak aloud to your auto, as passengers may well attest.)

Tesla might have popularized the big-screen digital cockpit, but Buick started the trend with its Riviera of 1986, the first car to be fitted with an in-dash touchscreen, a 9-inch, 91-function green-on-black capacitive display known as the Graphic Control Center that featured such delights as a trip computer, climate control, vehicle diagnostics, and a maintenance reminder feature. By General Motors' own admission, drivers hated it, and it was this seemingly trailblazing feature, along with a reduction in the car's size, that supposedly led to the model's year-on-year sales plummeting by 63 percent.

Buick soon ditched the Riviera's screen, but not before a TV science program reviewing the car asked the obvious question: “Is there a built-in danger of looking away from the road while you're trying to use it?”

Screens or not, “motorists shouldn't forget they are driving [potentially] deadly weapons,” says Kyffin. An average of 112 Americans were killed every day on US roads in 2023, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's most recent full-year statistics. That's equivalent to a plane crash every day.

Despite the proliferation of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), motor crash fatalities in the United States have increased 21 percent in the past 15 years. Forty thousand people have died on the roads in each of the past three years for which complete federal records are available.

In-vehicle infotainment systems impair reaction times behind the wheel more than alcohol and narcotics use, according to researchers at independent British consultancy TRL. The five-year-old study, commissioned by road-safety charity IAM RoadSmart, discovered that the biggest negative impact on drivers' reactions to hazards came when using Apple CarPlay by touch. Reaction times were nearly five times worse than when a driver was at the drink-drive limit, and nearly three times worse than when high on cannabis.

A study carried out by Swedish car magazine Vi Bilägare in 2022 showed that physical buttons are much less time-consuming to use than touchscreens. Using a mix of old and new cars, the magazine found that the most straightforward vehicle to change controls on was the 2005 Volvo V70 festooned with buttons and no screens. A range of activities such as increasing cabin temperature, tuning the radio, and turning down instrument lighting could be handled within 10 seconds in the old Volvo, and with only a minimum of eyes-down. However, the same tasks on an electric MG Marvel R compact SUV took 45 seconds, requiring precious travel time to look through the nested menus. (The tests were done on an abandoned airfield.)

Distraction plays a role in up to 25 percent of crashes in Europe, according to a report from the European Commission published last year. “Distraction or inattention while driving leads drivers to have difficulty in lateral control of the vehicle, have longer reaction times, and miss information from the traffic environment,” warned the report.

Seemingly learning little from Buick's Riviera, BMW reintroduced touchscreens in 2001. The brand's iDrive system combined an LCD touchscreen with a rotary control knob for scrolling through menus. Other carmakers also soon introduced screens, although with limitations. Jaguar and Land Rover would only show certain screen functions to drivers, with passengers tasked with the fiddly bits. Toyota and Lexus cars had screens that worked only when the handbrake was applied.

With curved pillar-to-pillar displays, holographic transparent displays, displays instead of rear-view mirrors, and head-up displays (HUD), it's clear many in-car devices are fighting for driver attention. HUDs might not be touch-sensitive, but projecting a plethora of vehicle data, as well as maps, driver aids, and multimedia information, onto the windscreen could prove as distracting as toggling through menus.

“Almost every vehicle-maker has moved key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of distraction crashes,” EuroNCAP's Avery tells WIRED. “Manufacturers are realizing that they've probably gone too far with [fitting touchscreens].”

“A new part of our 2026 ratings is going to relate to vehicle controls,” says Avery. “We want manufacturers to preserve the operation of five principal controls to physical buttons, so that's wipers, lights, indicators, horn, and hazard warning lights.” This however does not address the frequent needs for drivers to adjust temperature, volume, or change driver warning systems settings (an endeavor all too commonly requiring navigating down through multiple submenus).

Perhaps unfortunately, it looks like continuing with touchscreens won't lose manufacturers any of the coveted stars in EuroNCAP's five-star safety ratings. “It's not the case that [automakers] can't get five stars unless they've got buttons, but we're going to make entry to the five-star club harder over time. We will wind up the pressure, with even stricter tests in the next three-year cycle starting in 2029.”

Regardless, Avery believes auto manufacturers around the world will bring back buttons. “I will be very surprised if there are markets where manufacturers have a different strategy,” he says.

“From a safety standpoint, reducing the complexity of performing in-vehicle tasks is a good thing,” says Joe Young, the media director for the insurance industry-backed Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). “The research is clear that time spent with your eyes off the road increases your risk of crashing, so reducing or eliminating that time by making it easier to find and manipulate buttons, dials, and knobs is an improvement.”

Neither Young nor Jake Nelson, director of traffic safety research for AAA, would be drawn on whether US automakers—via the US version of NCAP—would adopt EuroNCAP's button nudges. “Industry design changes in the US market are more likely to occur based on strong consumer demand,” Nelson says. “It would be ideal to see better coordination between NCAP and EuroNCAP, however, we have not observed much influence in either direction.”

Nevertheless, Nelson agrees that “basic functions, such as climate control, audio, and others, should be accessible via buttons.” He adds that the “design of vehicle technologies should be as intuitive as possible for users” but that the “need for tutorials suggests otherwise.”

For Edmund King, president of the AA (the UK equivalent to AAA), driver distraction is personal. “When cycling, I often see drivers concentrating on their touchscreens rather than the road ahead,"" he says. ""Technology should be there to help drivers and passengers stay safe on the roads, and that should not be to the detriment of other road users.”

The deeper introduction of AI into cars as part of software-defined vehicles could result in fewer touchscreens in the future, believes Dale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at London's Royal College of Art.

Eye scanners in cars are already watching how we're driving and will prod us—with haptic seat buzzing and other alerts—when inattention is detected. In effect, today's cars nag drivers not to use the touchscreens provided. “[Automakers] have added [touchscreen] technologies without thinking about how drivers use vehicles in motion,” says Harrow. “Touchscreens have been successful in static environments, but [that] doesn't transfer into dynamic environments. There's sitting in a mock-up of a car and thinking it's easy to navigate through 15 layers, but it's far different when the car is in motion.”

Crucially, touchscreens are ubiquitous partly because of cost—it's cheaper to write lines of computer code than to add wires behind buttons on a physical dash. And there are further economies of scale for multi-brand car companies such as Volkswagen Group, which can put the same hardware and software in a Skoda as they do a Seat, changing just the logo pop-ups.

Additionally, over-the-air updates almost require in-car computer screens. A car's infotainment system, the operation of ambient lighting, and other design factors are an increasingly important part of car design, and they need a screen for manufacturers to incrementally improve software-defined vehicles after rolling off production lines. Adding functionality isn't nearly as simple when everything is buttons.

Not all screens cause distractions, of course—reversing cameras are now essential equipment, and larger navigation screens mean less time looking down for directions—but to demonstrate how touchscreens and voice control aren't as clever as many think they are, consider the cockpit of an advanced passenger jet.

The Boeing 777X has touchscreens, but they are used by pilots only for data input—never for manipulation of controls. Similarly, the cockpit of an Airbus A350 also has screens, but they're not touch-sensitive, and there are no voice-activated controls either. Instead, like in the 777X, there are hundreds of knobs, switches, gauges, and controls.

Of course, considering the precious human cargo and the fact that an A350 starts at $308 million, you can't fault Airbus for wanting pilots' eyes on the skies rather than screens. There are slightly fewer tactile controls in the $429,000 Rolls-Royce Spectre, the luxury car company's first electric vehicle. There's a screen for navigation, yes, but also lots of physical switchgear. Reviewing the new Black Badge edition of the high-end EV, Autocar said the vehicle's digital technology was “integrated with restraint.”

Along with Volkswagen reintroducing physical buttons for functions like volume and climate control, Subaru is also bringing back physical knobs and buttons in the 2026 Outback. Hyundai has added more buttons back into the new Santa Fe, with design director Ha Hak-soo confessing to Korean JoongAng Daily towards the end of last year that the company found customers didn't like touchscreen–focused systems. And, if EuroNCAP gets its way, that's likely the direction of travel for all cars. Buttons are back, baby.

It has been two hours since the divers left the coast behind. As they reach their designated GPS points in the Gulf of Mexico, their boats' engines go from roaring to whispering. In pairs, they enter the Celestún Fishing Refuge Zone, one of the largest in Mexico. Their ritual is absolute: put on fins, adjust vests and hoses, clean visors, and load oxygen tanks and weights. For the next few minutes, their lives depend on having carefully prepared their dives to this place of hope.

They are here seeking to restore fisheries in decline or on the verge of collapse. This refuge, a no-catch zone established in 2019, covers 324 square kilometers and is monitored by the Yucatán Coast Submarine Monitoring Community Group, a group of community divers and fishers, who are supported by personnel from the Mexican Institute for Research in Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (IMIPAS) and the civil association the Community and Biodiversity (COBI). Their methodology mixes local knowledge with scientific rigor.

The problem they face is a global one: Overfishing and environmental degradation are destroying the biodiversity of the oceans, with many countries lacking the will or resources to combat the problem. In 2024, as sea-surface temperatures broke all-time records, the Worldwide Fund for Nature's Living Planet report showed that, over the past 50 years, marine populations worldwide have declined in size by 56 percent. Over a third of current marine populations are overfished.

In Mexico, more than 700 marine species are fished in 83 fisheries, which support 200,000 Mexican families. Analysis of Mexico's National Fishing Charter by IMIPAS indicates that 17 percent of the country's fisheries are deteriorated, 62 percent are being exploited at their maximum sustainable level, and 15 percent have no information on their state. When the conservation nonprofit Oceana analyzed the same data, it found that 34 percent of Mexico's fisheries are in ""poor condition,” says to Esteban García Peña, Oceana's coordinator of research and public policy.

Part of the problem is that, under Mexican law, no one is obligated to look after the health of the country's fisheries; Mexico's General Fisheries Law doesn't obligate the government to take on this responsibility. Oceana has petitioned to change this, and in the face of legislative disinterest, even filed an injunction in 2021 against the Congress of the Union, alleging violations of human rights, such as access to a healthy environment and food. This inspired a proposal to revive Mexico's deteriorated fishing zones, only for it not to be analyzed or approved by Congress, and the project was frozen.

In 50 years, the world has lost 56 percent of its marine populations.

Faced with this uncertainty, communities have taken things into their own hands. Although the government isn't obliged to protect and revive the country's fisheries, people can request for it set up refuge zones to conserve and repopulate marine ecosystems. And so today, there are refuges in Baja California Sur, Quintana Roo, and Campeche, totaling more than 2 million hectares and benefiting, directly or indirectly, 130 species.

“When the first proposal was put forward, it seemed crazy,” says Alicia Poot, an IMIPAS researcher and head of the Regional Center for Aquaculture and Fisheries Research in Yucalpetén. “Some people think it's closing the sea, but it's not. It is working an area in a sustainable way, with community oversight.”

The day before the monitoring begins, the Celestún team gathers under a large palapa. Jacobo Caamal, COBI's scientific diving expert, reviews the plan for the next few days. He jokingly gives practical advice, using coconuts to show how to measure sea cucumbers and sea snails.

They talk about sea cucumbers because, although it is not part of Mexican gastronomy, its fishing has brought a lot of profit to this coast. In the Chinese market these creatures can fetch more than $150 per plate. The hype over the echinoderm has driven practices that are harmful to the ecosystem and to the fishermen's health, such as diving using a hookah, a makeshift diving machine that runs on gasoline and pumps oxygen down a tube to divers below the surface. Sanitary towels sometimes stand in as an oil filter, while mint tablets are taken to mitigate the taste of gas. In Celestún, nobody denies the risk of diving with this machine. Many know someone who has had an accident or died from decompression.

Until 2012, this area had cucumbers in abundance, but violation of its closed seasons brought the species to the brink of extinction. Divers started going deeper and deeper to hunt them. The situation became untenable. Then, a group of fishermen asked IMIPAS researchers for help to establish an area where the sea could have a chance to recover.

Overfishing has depleted other species here too. Leonardo Pech, founder of the refuge and captain of one of the boats during the monitoring trip, has been accompanying IMIPAS researchers for years to evaluate the state of marine species. A couple of decades ago, he says, scallops were fished until they were spent. It was intense and unregulated, Pech recalls. The fishermen knew they had to let the species recover, he says, but not everyone respected this need.

Some time later, the same thing happened with the Moorish crab. “They would cut off both claws. Everywhere you walked by, you'd see dead crab breasts. It was spent.” Then fishing of grouper began. “There were plenty, big. Now it's gone down and the juvenile is this size,” Pech says, showing its small length with his hands.

Predation then reached the octopuses. New fishermen opted to use illegal compressors to dive instead of relying on artisanal fishing, which is done with wooden sticks, string, and bait. With this traditional method, females with young do not take the bait, and that protects the species from overfishing. But diving sweeps up octopuses evenly. In 2023, over 20,000 tons of octopus were caught in Yucatán.

The collapse of fisheries doesn't just result in fewer animals and smaller sizes. It also pushes fishermen to go further and further out into the ocean sea and spend more days at sea. They even make unregulated adjustments to their fleet. “They raise their boats in search of more stability in deeper places, they add huts,” says Poot. Keeping profits higher than their operating costs is a necessity, even if this puts fishermen's lives at risk—for instance when getting caught in storms in in homemade boats.

Nancy Gocher, coordinator of Oceana's campaign team, explains that the depletion of marine resources—while partially being driven by overfishing—at the same time violates the fishermen's right to work, their food sovereignty (more than 3 billion people obtain their nutrients from the sea), their identity, and their right to a healthy environment. They are also victims of forces outside of their control. ""Fishing communities receive the first impact of the inclemencies aggravated by climate change,” she says.

Before applying for the refuge in Celestún, local fishermen and researchers had many conversations. When they saw the fisheries information compiled by the Regional Center for Aquaculture and Fisheries Research, they realized that it was not only the cucumber that needed protection. Species such as red grouper (Epinephelus morio) and red octopus (Octopus maya) were also listed as overexploited or in decline. So the community agreed to try replenish populations of red grouper, Caribbean lobster (Panulirus argus), Mayan octopus, and sea cucumber. Within the delimited area of the refuge, artisanal octopus fishing and the capture of king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), Atlantic Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), and great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda) is allowed between October and February using “trolling”—pulling a baited hook behind a boat; diving, sport fishing, and domestic consumption of other species is prohibited.

Josué Canul is one of the people under the palapa. “I was one of the first divers, known for being a poacher fisherman. I have been one of the biggest predators,” he says. For 30 years, Canul dived with hookahs. “I was their hater,” he says of conservationists—now he the refuge's president. Three years ago, he didn't believe in the project, but he went to one of its meetings. “I was going to fight,” he admits. But first, he sat down to listen. That day he understood his mistake: it was not a forbidden site, but a workspace. The area was new, and much remained to be done, but the idea captivated him for two reasons: the loss of marine abundance, which he was witnessing, and the promise of a better future. “I had always wanted, in unison, for the community to say: we don't fish in this area so that it will reproduce and leave some here for us.”

In the past, it was said “that in Celestún they burned your boats, that the most terrible and furtive fishermen lived there,” says Mariana Suasnávar, a climate change specialist at COBI. To think that this community would be the first in the state to take such measures to recover the fisheries was far-fetched. Today, the idea is backed by 66 leaders, men and women.

On the left, Josué Canul; on the right, Captain Ángel Novelo.

Dismantling illegal fishing is difficult. Canul says that fishermen justify being poachers because it feeds their families. “Since we were kids, we have the culture that the more you catch, the more you have. We were never taught to take care,” he says. Andrea Saénz, a marine biologist and environmental economist at the Colegio de la Frontera Sur, calls this phenomenon “the race for fish,” in which “whoever gets there fastest gets the treasure.” In her view, this extractivist approach to the sea occurs because there is open access, which leads to thinking: “If I don't take it out, someone else is going to do it.”

Poot points out that fishing refuge zones are a management tool, so that the communities return little by little to good practices. “That piece motivates them to take care, to teach the new generations how fishing should be, because today it has been distorted,” she says.

Early on the dock, the fishermen watch the monitoring group leave.

It's expected that a well-kept fishing refuge will result in larger organisms, greater abundance of fish, and more diversity of species. A desired effect is overflow—that is, for these benefits to be seen beyond the borders of the protection site. Poot explains that, to measure this, it is crucial to establish a baseline of how the site is at the beginning and implement a constant monitoring program. “If five years go by and you don't notice results, it is possible to extend it longer. Not all areas are equally resilient.”

Saénz says there is evidence of recovery with this strategy, but evaluating benefit takes time. “Experiments to evaluate that the cost of not fishing is offset by larval dispersal are scarce,” she says. She collaborated with COBI on a study on Isla Natividad, off the coast of Baja California Sur, where they collected data over ten years and found that lobster fishing was good at the boundaries of the reserve set up there.

On the day of the monitoring, the divers are dropped on their backs into the sea and descend. For 30 minutes, a buoy tracks their location. Some pairs practice wandering dives, others follow a transect, a sampling line, to systematically collect data. Some describe the type of seabed and its contents every 50 centimeters for 50 meters; others identify, count, and indicate the size of fish. The invertebrate biometry team collects snails and cucumbers to measure them on the boat and, underwater, they record lobsters, octopus, and other organisms. Everyone notes whether the sampling site is inside or outside the refuge, key information for future comparisons. “It's like taking a picture of the sea,” says Suasnávar.

Esther Yerves, a lawyer and part of a fishing family, returns soaking wet to the boat with a smile: “It's like entering another world,” she says. She joined the project after seeing the decline of the octopus and today is treasurer of the refuge and a member of the Yucatán Coast Submarine Monitoring Community Group, where 14 women and 12 men from different Yucatecan communities participate. She learned to dive to see with her own eyes if the effort was worth it, and to make her voice heard in the decision-making process.

The monitoring group is made up of people involved in the fishing chain with the support of organizations such as COBI, agencies such as IMIPAS, the Secretariat of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture of Yucatán, and the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas. Members have received certifications in open water scuba diving, first aid, and species identification methodologies designed by IMIPAS and COBI. Their work helps to expose the results of sustainable management and to recognize if there is anything to adjust in the management of the area.

When the team returns to land, they eat, bathe, and rest for a while. They get gas for the next trips, prepare food, and digitize their log sheets. Data capture takes place in a small room with air conditioning, cake, and coffee. From the log sheets jump the marine characters: mackerel scad (Decapterus macarellus), yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), canané. If someone mispronounces the Latin, they gently correct each other, rehearsing the name out loud with laughter. A copy of Paul Humann's Reef Creature Identification, considered a must-have for divers, biologists, and marine life lovers, is passed from hand to hand, with team members pointing out the species they have already found and those they would like to see soon.

In the evenings, Caamal, the scientific diving expert from COBI, sits among the mosquitoes and the noise of filling tanks. There he explains to me that the success of the refuge goes beyond the biological aspects. “Monitoring biomass and fish is useful, but if the community doesn't participate or know about the project, it loses meaning,” he says. A research article he coauthored emphasizes that protected conservation areas are most effective when combining technical expertise, Western science, and participatory science with local fishermen.

On land, they seek to empower fishermen, reduce the gender gap in the local economy, diversify voices in decision making (in Celestún there is a committee of women and another of young people), and strengthen community pride and the defense of the territory. Some groups are organizing against predatory tourism or the care of other coastal ecosystems, such as dunes or mangroves.

Alesxia, an experienced diver from Punta Allen in neighboring Quintana Roo, helps with monitoring.

When Canul joined the project, there were pending issues that could not be put off: surveillance and monitoring. But there was no money. Canul is a restless person—his colleagues say that even underwater he keeps talking. It was only a few months after joining the refuge team that he assumed the presidency.

To raise funds, the Celestún group organizes festivals, but now they have won a grant from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). As a result, they are about to integrate electric motors into their work. Alondra Ramírez, UNDP Mexico Small Grants Programme associate in charge of the energy projects portfolio, explains that, using electric mobility will help reduce the environmental impact of surveillance, monitoring, and fishing.

In addition to the effort to obtain scientific data, fishermen monitor the area against poaching and look for ways to finance this. Since 2019, there has been no federal budget allocated to fisheries management in Mexico, including the operation of these zones. “Your budget speaks of your priorities. In the last six-year term, fishing was priority zero. Many of the things that have happened are thanks to the management and organization of civil society,” stresses Saénz.

Gocher of Oceana points out that many of the obstacles faced in marine conservation are due to the lack of social fabric. It's known locally who is fishing illegally. “That they have to ask them not to do it implies a community conflict, but it also opens the opportunity to restore the social fabric. When the community sees results—that there are more resources, that forms of economy are created, such as tourism, that are more sustainable and at their pace—they begin to take care,” Gocher says.

“There are many fishing refuge zones and protected marine areas in which fishermen and fisherwomen make vigilance committees to make sure that fishing is done legally; they take care of everyone's resources,” says Gocher. “In Mexico, 75 percent of the fisheries are exploited without management plans, which puts the sustainable development and wellbeing of the communities at risk.”

Many vigilance groups begin by financing activities out of their own pockets and, as they organize, they look for ways to be reimbursed.

For three days, COBI members supported the monitoring.

Against poaching, the refuge team knows that they are swimming against the current, that they must deal with the frustration of taking care of a resource that others steal at night. They know they are at risk for pointing out those who break the rules, even if they are their neighbors. “Many times we look like clowns when we do surveillance, catch people who do something illegal and the law does nothing to them,” says Canul. During the monitoring, one of the captains notices a boat on the horizon and deduces that they are coming from illegal fishing. He picks up the radio and asks the others what to do; they decide not to interrupt the monitoring.

“We have little data to know how to fight illegal fishing. Inspection and surveillance in Mexico are not robust,” Gocher says. Analysis from Oceana has revealed a reduction in surveillance patrols by the National Commission of Aquaculture and Fisheries. In 2023, 332 maritime patrols and 99 land patrols were recorded, the lowest figures in 15 years. “There is no information on what happens when someone is caught or a vessel or product is seized. After the complaint, almost no one knows what happens. There is opacity in the data and a high level of impunity,” Gocher says.

Mexico is in the process of establishing 14 fishing refuge zones, which would total more than 100,000 hectares of conservation in seven states—mainly in Sonora and Yucatán. This year the peninsular state added two more refuges, one in El Cuyo and another in Chabihau; months ago, the Actam Chuleb refuge was made official, which had been operating as a community marine reserve for years. Due to the growing interest in the refuges, the creation of a National System of Fishing Refuge Zones has been proposed. A consultancy, financed by the World Bank and the French Development Agency, in coordination with the Mexican government, reviewed the idea. Suggestions include incorporating fishing goals as part of the National Development Plan, strengthening community management, creating a national fund, and providing legal security for coastal communities to manage their territory.

The vision for recovering the productivity of the sea, says Saénz, is an example of “coupled scales.” First, work with those who access a maritime territory, then see how they connect with their neighbors, then with currents, and with land-based activities. “You need a complete understanding of these phenomena.” What is impossible, she assures, is to try to recover a species without listening to the fishermen.

Juan Pech has seen marine beauty and also a damaged sea. The diver explains his commitment with an anecdote. Years ago, the man who taught him commercial diving told him where to go to find fish. Juan followed his instructions, but came to a dead site; nothing his teacher described was still there. If he ever has children, he says he doesn't want to tell them about a sea they can't see.

Datadog is on an acquisition spree. Just a few weeks after snatching up Metaplane, an AI-powered observability startup, the cloud monitoring and security company has acquired Eppo, a feature flagging and experimentation platform.

Eppo will continue supporting existing customers and bringing on new ones under the brand “Eppo by Datadog.” Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but a report last week from Upstarts Media suggested Datadog was planning to pay $220 million.

Despite the demand for tools that let developers experiment with different versions of apps, the infrastructure required for product analytics remains relatively complex to build. Beyond data pipelines and statistical methods, experimentation infrastructure relies on analytics workflows often sourced from difficult-to-configure cloud environments.

In an interview two years ago, Eppo co-founder and CEO Che Sharma told TechCrunch that Eppo was inspired by his experiences building experimentation software as a data scientist at Airbnb and Webflow, a website builder.

Eppo offers what Sharma calls “confidence intervals” to make it easier to understand and interpret the results of a randomized app experiment. The platform supports experimentation with AI and machine learning models, leveraging techniques to perform live experiments that show whether one model is outperforming another.

While plenty of startups have emerged in recent years to abstract away the app experimentation infrastructure, including Split, Statsig, and Optimizely, Eppo has managed to stand out in the crowded field. The San Francisco, California-based company raised $47.5 million from VC firms, including Innovation Endeavors, Menlo Ventures, and Amplify Partners prior to its exit, according to Crunchbase.

Eppo had around 15 employees as of June 2022, when the startup was valued at $80 million. Back then, Eppo's customer base included Goldbelly, Netlify, and Kumu, among others.

“Eppo wants to bring a high velocity, experiment-first culture to companies of every size, stage, and industry,”  Sharma said in a press release. “With Datadog, we are uniting product analytics, feature management, AI, and experimentation capabilities for businesses to reduce risk, learn quickly, and ship high-quality products.”

For Datadog, which recently reported a better-than-expected net profit but a revenue forecast that fell below what analysts expected, the Eppo buy could bolster the company's current product analytics solutions. The sector is a large and healthy one. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global market for product analytics was worth $9.09 billion last year and could reach $27.01 billion by 2032.

“The use of multiple AI models increases the complexity of deploying applications in production,” Michael Whetten, VP of Product at Datadog, said in a statement. “Experimentation solves this correlation and measurement problem, enabling teams to compare multiple models side-by-side, determine user engagement against cost tradeoffs, and ultimately build AI products that deliver measurable value.”

Pinterest is upgrading its visual search feature with a handful of new capabilities. 

On Monday, the company announced it's rolling out new functionality to improve its feature that allows users to search using an image instead of text. This includes new tools to more precisely narrow and refine searches, as well as those that make visual search more accessible across Pinterest's website.

The company believes the new additions will help Pinterest stand out as a search engine for things users may otherwise have trouble describing with words — like a vibe, style, or aesthetic.

One new enhancement will help users to better understand what it is they like about a certain Pin, initially in the women's fashion category in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. 

Here, when users tap on a Pin, they'll see an animated glow, and Pinterest will then generate words that help people determine why they like the Pin in the first place. This feature is powered by visual language models (VLMs), a form of generative AI, the company says.

The addition is similar to Google's multimodal search, which combines text and images into a single query. In this case, however, Pinterest is helping users by generating the words that could be used to augment and narrow their search query. (The company notes it's using “industry-leading” multimode embedding models but didn't specify which ones.)

Another update will allow users to refine their fashion searches by seeking out alternatives to the item shown in a different color, style, or fabric. For instance, Pinterest suggests you could use this to find a similar style that had more of a “Y2K” aesthetic, or find something similar to a blazer you liked but that works better for a formal occasion.

Pinterest also says it will expand its visual search across more areas in its app, including by allowing users to long-press on any Pin on their Home Feed to kick off a visual search.

The update comes on the heels of an announcement that Pinterest will begin to label AI-generated images and soon allow users to limit the number of AI images they're shown, after numerous user complaints. People had begun to worry that AI would ruin Pinterest, as it would be even harder to find genuine images that could inspire their future shopping. 

Combined with the AI-focused update and the improved visual search, Pinterest hopes to re-establish its use as a visual shopping tool that leverages AI, as opposed to one that's being destroyed by it.

Anysphere, the maker of AI-powered coding tool Cursor, has attracted $900 million in a fresh round of funding led by Thrive Capital, The Financial Times reported, citing anonymous sources familiar with the deal.

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Accel are also participating in the round, which values Anysphere at about $9 billion, the report said.

Cursor raised $105 million from Thrive and a16z at a $2.5 billion valuation, TechCrunch reported in December. Thrive Capital also led that round, and a16z participated as well. The startup has raised over $173 million in funding to date, according to Crunchbase data.

Investors, including Index Ventures and Benchmark, are said to be scrambling to back the company, but it looks like Anysphere's existing investors don't want to miss out on a chance to back it either.

Other AI-powered coding startups are also attracting investor interest. TechCrunch reported in February that Windsurf, a rival to Anysphere, was in discussions to raise funding at a $3 billion valuation. OpenAI, an investor in Anysphere, was reportedly trying to acquire Windsurf for about the same value.

IMO the easier derivation — may just be personal tastes as someone more on the engineering side — is just another integration by parts.So with f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x, define y = g(x) for U-substitution with x = f(y):    ∫ g(x) dx = ∫ g(f(y)) f'(y) dy
              = ∫ y f'(y) dy
              = y f(y) – ∫ f(y) dy
              = g(x) x – F(g(x)) + C

The more interesting thing is that this is a really basic integration by parts which means that this diagram of yours that I like, is more universal than it appears at first? I'd have to think about that a bit more, how you can maybe graphically teach integration by parts that way, is there always a u substitution so that you can get u f(u) or so and get this nice pretty rectangle in a rectangle... hmm.

What's the virtue in offending people when you could instead be kind?I know one woman who is having a baby shower, and I know another woman who recently dealt with the loss of her child. It's not “secrecy” to celebrate the baby shower and avoid bringing it up with the recently bereaved, it's respect and good taste.I feel like we used to call it discretion…

If you want to go out with friend A but don't want friend B to see it for whatever reason (maybe B has a feud with A), then that is a thing between B and A, but not you.I think the whole point of the OP comment is to just go with it. If you don't flauntingly advertise it, it is not your fault.But in a very social media centric world, even if you are just a participant in a picture can feel like ""flaunting it"" to 3rd parties.

I might agree that 'celebrities' and leaders of larger organizations are 'public figures' and thus if there's a reasonable public interest it should be allowed to tag them, probably with a publishing delay for security.However individuals?  Random citizens who aren't part of a platform and cannot manage their data?  IMO the default should be deny data collection and do not profile.

I think it's important to release SDKs that are secure by default, so not providing this in the reference MCP would be a big issue.In my view, MCP should be maintained by the vendors themselves. It's too complicated to use in the enterprise if everything comes from the community with questionable security. So I applaud initiatives that try to solve this. I think smithery.ai provides something similar while also being a repository of servers (I'm not associated with them), but again the problem is needing to trust an extra middleman vendor.Does anyone else share this view? For example, will AWS (or insert any other hyperscaler) end up providing the “Bedrock” of MCP where security is native to the platform? Or will individual companies (Box, Google, MS, etc.) start rolling them out as part of their standard developer APIs?

- Is there a way to run it locally/self-host?- Are there discovery endpoints to list the available servers?- The 'Test & Eval' page is interesting to me, as I think unpredictability of results with multiple MCP prompts/sources interacting is generally a pretty big issue with MCP, so a good integrated eval system could be valuable. I see it's not launched yet, but it would be great to know more about how this will work.

How do you know what variations of a prompt trigger a given tool to be called or how many tools is too many before you start seeing degradation issues because of the context window. If you are building a client and not a server the issue becomes even more pronounced.I even extracted the Claude electron source to see if I could figure out how they were doing it, but it's abstracted behind a network request. I'm guessing the system prompt handles tool call selection.PS: I released an open source evals package if you're curious. Still a WIP, but does the basics https://github.com/mclenhard/mcp-evals

I'm working on a coding agent, and MCP has been a frequently requested feature, but yeah this issue has been my main hesitation.Getting even basic prompts that are designed to do one or two things to work reliably requires so much testing and iteration that I'm inherently pretty skeptical that ""here are 10 community-contributed MCPs—choose the right one for the task"" will have any hope of working reliably. Of course the benefits if it would work are very clear, so I'm keeping a close watch on it. Evals seem like a key piece of the puzzle, though you still might end up in combinatorial explosion territory by trying to test all the potential interactions with multiple MCPs. I could also see it getting very expensive to test this way.

It's a bit of a stretch but MCP is to LLM enabled applications what REST is to web applications.What was happening before was if you built tools using langchain, you'd have to rewrite them for crewai, cursor, etc. Now, we have a way to share tools, resources, and prompts with applications built using different frameworks.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. 

Bryan Johnson is on a mission to not die. The 47-year-old multimillionaire has already applied his slogan “Don't Die” to events, merchandise, and a Netflix documentary. Now he's founding a Don't Die religion.

Johnson, who famously spends millions of dollars on scans, tests, supplements, and a lifestyle routine designed to slow or reverse the aging process, has enjoyed extensive media coverage, and a huge social media following. For many people, he has become the face of the longevity field.

Longevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there's a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.

I sat down with Johnson at an event for people interested in longevity in Berkeley, California, in late April. We spoke on the sidelines after lunch (conference plastic-lidded container meal for me; what seemed to be a plastic-free, compostable box of chicken and vegetables for him), and he sat with an impeccable posture, his expression neutral. 

Earlier that morning, Johnson, in worn trainers and the kind of hoodie that is almost certainly deceptively expensive, had told the audience about what he saw as the end of humanity. Specifically, he was worried about AI—that we face an “event horizon,” a point at which superintelligent AI escapes human understanding and control. He had come to Berkeley to persuade people who are interested in longevity to focus their efforts on AI. 

It is this particular concern that ultimately underpins his Don't Die mission. First, humans must embrace the Don't Die ideology. Then we must ensure AI is aligned with preserving human existence. Were it not for AI, he says, he wouldn't be doing any of his anti-death activities and regimens. “I am convinced that we are at an existential moment as a species,” says Johnson, who was raised Mormon but has since left the church. Solving aging will take decades, he says—we'll survive that long only if we make sure that AI is aligned with human survival. 

The following Q&A has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Why are you creating a new religion?

We're in this new phase where [because of advances in AI] we're trying to reimagine what it means to be human. It requires imagination and creativity and open-mindedness, and that's a big ask. Approaching that conversation as a community, or a lifestyle, doesn't carry enough weight or power. Religions have proven, over the past several thousand years, to be the most efficacious form to organize human efforts. It's just a tried-and-true methodology. 

How do you go about founding a new religion?

It's a good question. If you look at historical [examples], Buddha went through his own self-exploratory process and came up with a framework. And Muhammad had a story. Jesus had an origin story … You might even say Satoshi [Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin] is like [the founder of] a modern-day religion, [launched] with the white paper. Adam Smith launched capitalism with his book. The question is: What is a modern-day religion, and how does it convince? It's an open question for me. I don't know yet.

Your goal is to align AI with Don't Die—or, in other words, ensure that AI models prioritize and protect human life. How will you do that?

I'm talking to a lot of AI researchers about this. Communities of AIs could be instilled with values of conflict resolution that do not end in the death of a human. Or an AI. Or the planet.

""Ghost stories are contagious.""

Would you say that Don't Die is “your” religion?

No, I think it's humanity's religion. It's different from other religions, which are very founder-centric. I think this is going to be decentralized, and it will be something that everybody can make their own.

So there's no God?

We're playing with the idea that the body is God. We've been experimenting with this format of a Don't Die fam, where eight to 12 people get together on a weekly basis. It's patterned off of other groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. We structure an opening ritual. We have a mantra. And then there's a part where people apologize to their body for something they've done that has inflicted harm upon themselves. 

It's reframing our relationship to body and to mind. It is also a way for people to have deep friendships, to explore emotionally vulnerable topics, and to support each other in health practices.

What we're really trying to say is: Existence is the virtue. Existence is the objective. If someone believes in God, that's fine. People can be Christian and do this; they can be Muslim and do this. Don't Die is a “yes, and” to all groups.

So it's a different way of thinking about religion?

Yeah. Right now, religion doesn't hold the highest status in society. A lot of people look down on it in some way. I think as AI progresses, it's going to create additional questions on who we are: What is our identity? What do we believe about our existence in the future? People are going to want some kind of framework that helps them make sense of the moment. So I think there's going to be a shift toward religion in the coming years. People might say that [founding a religion now] is kind of a weird move, and that [religion] turns people off. But I think that's fine. I think we're ahead.

Does the religion incorporate, or make reference to, AI in any way?

Yeah. AI is going to be omnipresent. And this is why we've been contemplating “the body is God.” Over the past couple of years … I've been testing the hypothesis that if I get a whole bunch of data about my body, and I give it to an algorithm, and feed that algorithm updates with scientific evidence, then it would eventually do a better job than a doctor. So I gave myself over to an algorithm. 

It really is in my best interest to let it tell me what to eat, tell me when to sleep and exercise, because it would do a better job of making me happy. Instead of my mind haphazardly deciding what it wants to eat based on how it feels in the moment, the body is elevated to a position of authority. AI is going to be omnipresent and built into our everyday activities. Just like it autocompletes our texts, it will be able to autocomplete our thoughts.

Might some people interpret that as AI being God?

Potentially. I would be hesitant to try to define [someone else's] God. The thing we want to align upon is that none of us want to die right now. We're attempting to make Don't Die the world's most influential ideology in the next 18 months.

Sometimes, having a power bank makes you the coolest person around. Your friends' phones are dying, but you're cool as a cucumber as you whip your portable charger out and start juicing your phone back up. You don't have to live your life constrained to making sure you're always around an outlet. And if you're looking to pick one up, you can do so right now for less than the price of a McDonald's Big Mac meal. Seriously.

The INIU Portable Charger is just $16 at Amazon right now, down from its usual price of $22. That's $6 off and a 27% discount. That makes it even more affordable than it already is and well worth picking up even if you just leave it in your bag and never take it out. Because you never know when you might need it, after all.

See at Amazon

It's hardly large enough to take up most space, so you don't have to worry about being bogged down. At about the size of a smartphone, it's one of the lightest 10,000mAh chargers you can buy. It's just over 7 ounces, and it's not a huge, chunky brick that you have to tote around, which makes it a much more palatable option than much of the competition.

Whether you've got a new phone, wireless earbuds, or an older tablet, it can handle all of them. Plus, it automatically adjusts its power output based on what each device you use. So you don't have to worry about picking and choosing what you use with it.

And of course, there are a few niceties it has to make it even more of a good buy. It has a built-in flashlight, for instance, and a digital readout that tells you exactly how much battery is left. No, it won't charge your laptop or power your devices for a weekend off-grid, but that's not the point. This is a daily-use, toss-it-in-your-bag kind of power bank. And the point is for you to probably forget it, then pick it up later when you find yourself needing some juice at some point.

For just $16, it's really a no-brainer, especially if you buy coffee every day or something similar anyway. Might as well grab one of these. Or three or four. Keep one in your car, your bag, at home, and wherever you may need power. Just don't forget to top it up occasionally.

While Nintendo tried to contain leaks of its Switch 2 before launch, rumormongers ruled the scene with a variety of mostly accurate descriptions and dummy units. Now Nintendo is suing the accessory maker that gave everyone some of the best early insights into its new handheld. As much as the lawsuit is an attempt to quash a leaker, it also reveals how Nintendo's desperate efforts to control its own narrative largely failed.

In a lawsuit filed on May 2, Nintendo sued Human Things, Inc. aka Genki, for trademark infringement. It's a shotgun blast of a lawsuit that claims the accessory maker engaged in unfair competition and false advertising thanks to its use of Nintendo Switch 2 logos and hardware designs. If Nintendo gets its way, Genki would need to stop selling any accessories related to the Switch 2 and pay up an undisclosed amount in damages.

Genki hinted that it was working on Switch 2 accessories even before Nintendo first revealed its second handheld console in January. During CES 2025, the company was notorious for its booth where it showed customers a Switch 2 mockup, substantially revealing key details of the console. The 3D-printed Switch 2 dummy unit was surprisingly accurate, down to the 8-inch screen size and the Joy-Con 2 controllers that attached with a magnetic lock system. Genki even posted an animation of a Switch 2 render to its website, which you can still find on Reddit. The accessory maker offered some inconsistent messaging about where its designs for the Switch 2 mockup came from, though they've since proved to be spot-on.

Nintendo claims Genki couldn't have had any ability to create early mockups of its Switch 2 without “access to a Nintendo Switch 2 console or to proprietary technical specifications, neither of which Nintendo provided and/or authorized.” Nintendo also noted Genki included Nintendo's official logos on its rendering of a Switch 2 dock it displayed at CES 2025, which resulted “in confusion among consumers as to the validity of Genki's statements and association with Nintendo.”

Genki held its own “Genki Indirect” on April 2, just two hours after Nintendo's official Direct for the Switch 2 announcement, where it showed off its upcoming accessories and peripherals. In a statement published to X, Genki wrote, “while we can't comment in detail” about the lawsuit “we're continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week.”

A Note from the Genki Team

You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We're taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.

What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative…

— GENKI (@GenkiThings) May 4, 2025



It's not a good idea to cross Nintendo. The company is one of the most litigious in the video game industry. Nintendo regularly goes after people who mod Switch units for sale, such as Canadian programmer Gary Bowser who served prison time over his role at a site that sold modded consoles. Last year, Nintendo sued Pocketpair, the makers of Palworld—otherwise known as “Pokémon with guns”—claiming copyright infringement.

Genki should have had every reason to expect Nintendo would knock on its door. The company reportedly received a visit from Nintendo's lawyers during CES 2025. However, it wasn't the only accessory maker to share Switch 2 details early. On Dec. 13, before the Switch 2 reveal, Dbrand revealed early renders of its upcoming Switch 2 cases that showcased the handheld's “U”-shaped kickstand. Dbrand has experience with lawsuits from major console makers, so it could have held back on offering as much insight as Genki did.

The lead-up to the Switch 2 was long, and companies should expect leaks will happen. Nintendo began work on the Switch 2 shortly after releasing its original Switch, according to the lawsuit. That's more than eight years where Nintendo specifically tried to keep the news quiet until the very last minute on January 16 this year. It's also not like leakers were entirely to blame for spoiling the Switch 2. Nintendo's own patents spelled out the Switch 2's mouse controls before the feature was officially shown off. No company enjoys having its products leaked, but it was Nintendo's own closed-mouth approach to the launch that created this media fervor, as much as it would like to point the finger elsewhere.

A good pair of wireless earbuds has become every bit as much a must-have outdoor accessory as sweat-wicking clothes, running shoes, and sunscreen. (OK, not sunscreen — nothing's more important than that.) As the temperatures climb and we return to the great outdoors for our runs, hikes, rides, or just to lie out and enjoy the sunshine, having our favorite music or podcast with us is essential. Which is why Amazon's 32% off deal on the Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds is so well-timed.

See at Amazon

Now that they're back to just $169, the AirPods 2 are the best upgrade you can make to bring your favorite content with you anywhere, along with crystal-clear calls and outstanding noise cancellation for when you just want to be alone with your thoughts or your tunes. Apple's H2 processor chip, their latest and most powerful, is at the heart of the AirPods Pro 2 and gives them better sound quality and features than any of the previous iterations of the AirPods.

Apple loaded the latest version of the AirPods Pro with significant upgrades across the board, starting of course with the sound. The H2 chip powers an improved low-distortion driver that covers the entire range of sound from sharp highs to booming bass. When you encounter music that's optimized for spatial audio, the AirPods Pro 2 are ready and waiting with a personalized delivery that suits your unique ear shape and moves with your head. All in all, it's the most immersive and true-to-life sound yet from any Apple earbuds.

When you're switching from your music or podcast to a call on your iPhone, the Voice Isolation technology of the AirPods Pro 2 kicks in, letting your voice come through clear and crisp even when you're in a noisy environment. That music-to-phone toggling and all of the other controls you need are also upgraded in the AirPods Pro 2, with simple swipe, press, and hold motions to manage playback. Most impressively, Siri can detect when you nod yes or shake your head no when it asks if you want to hear a message, answer a call, or manage a notification from your iPhone or iPad.

See at Amazon

The biggest technological leap taken by the AirPods Pro 2 is the Active Noise Cancellation, which now eliminates up to 2 times more background noise than the first AirPods Pro, and even more than the AirPods 4. Transparency mode lets in just enough of the outside world to keep you safe, and Conversation Awareness automatically lowers your volume when you're speaking with someone nearby.

Throw in the next-generation active hearing protection and the world's first scientifically validated hearing test from any earbuds, and your wireless earbud upgrade choice becomes obvious. The 32% off Amazon deal that brings you the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169 is running right now, so get the last piece of your outdoor gear squared away for $80 off the regular price.

We are witnessing the most powerful Taiwan Dollar appreciation in over 30 years.

The strengthening of various East Asian currencies vs the U.S. Dollar (USD) has been one of the talking points in financial markets over the holiday weekend. The case of the Taiwan Dollar (TWD) is particularly alarming, as the currency of the 'silicon island' has appreciated over 10% vs the USD in the space of just a few days. This is the strongest Taiwan dollar appreciation in over 30 years, according to DigiTimes.

Crucially, when a trading partner's currency gets stronger, it typically becomes more expensive to buy their goods. Taiwan's chips and manufacturing play a big part in the most coveted PCs and components. So, are we looking at even more upwards pressure on electronics heading to U.S. retail?

DigiTimes shared statements and reports from some of Taiwan's major electronics players like Acer, Asus, Pegatron, Wistron, Foxxconn. It noted that most of these companies hold broad currency portfolios to lessen impacts / shocks when there is turbulence in exchange rates. However, if we are seeing the biggest currency valuation moves in over three decades, it is difficult to be prepared enough. One might hope this 10% dive in USD valuation is a temporary blip on the radar, or else there will be significant pressure on profit margins witnessed.

The source publication, and others, indicate that semiconductor companies have larger profit margins, to afford some flexibility on their part. For example, Focus Taiwan says that ASE Technology Holding Co., the world's largest IC packaging and testing services provider, expects a 1.5 percentage point impact on its gross margin ""whenever the Taiwan dollar rises NT$1 against the greenback."" It says TSMC and UMC would be hurt similarly by this valuation shift.

In a rare move, Taiwan's Central Bank held a press conference today, issuing a seven-point statement to the market (machine translation). In summary, the Central Bank believes that the TWD has surged due to speculation about recent trade discussions between Taiwanese and American officials. People seem to be expecting that the U.S. will ask Taiwan to manipulate its currency to make American imports cheaper. However, the governor of the bank denies there is any such influence.

Taiwan's Central Bank confirmed the country's economy remains strong. However, global financial markets are in a volatile era. Last but not least, individuals and organizations with an eye on currencies should be wary of speculators seeking to move valuations, helped by ""overly exaggerated or untrue market analysis, generating irrational expectations."" Looking at live data, the Central Bank's statement seems to have stemmed TWD's appreciation vs USD, for now.

Many Windows 11 users will soon get Windows 11 24H2 automatically, according to a Microsoft bulletin published Friday. Microsoft specifically says ""Devices running Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, versions 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2 that are not managed by IT departments will receive the update to version 24H2 automatically."" Windows Latest spotted this bulletin and points out that, for many folks, Windows 11 24H2 is going to be downloaded whether you intend to install it or not.

Microsoft says it's in the last phase of a gradual rollout for Windows 11 24H2. This phase began on Friday and will offer the newest version of Windows to anyone on version 10 or 11, which isn't affected by a compatibility hold. All you have to do is head to 'Settings > Windows Update' and select 'Check for updates.' As mentioned in the intro, though, many folks will receive the update automatically. These users will only get to choose when to apply the update or to postpone the update. If you are on a storage-limited device, Microsoft's pushy behavior might therefore cause some issues.

There are ways to cancel Windows 11 24H2's forced installation if a delay of up to four weeks offered by the system UI isn't enough for you. The linked Windows Latest post includes a few command prompt strings you can input, even if it has already started downloading. The commands should stop the download and delete any update files and folders. Moreover, there are instructions on how to block Windows simply trying to download the update again.

The most recent figures shared by StatCounter show that, in April, Windows 11 user market share moved to within single digit percentage points behind Windows 10. The figures are currently said to be 43.72% Windows 11, and 52.94% Windows 10.

With just a few months left before Windows 10 reaches the end of support (October 14, 2025), Microsoft likely hopes that the Windows 11 user base will command a much larger proportion of user hearts and minds. Ironing out the well-publicized Windows 11 24H2 wrinkles will be one way the company can entice users over. But, it has also reportedly been resorting to full-screen ads and popups to push Windows 10 users to update. Still, keeping the update path open and free for Windows 10 holdouts is a more than welcome measure. Many will likely want to take that path when October comes around.

Over three-times the cost of a price-inflated RTX 5090, but it has more CUDA cores and a massive 96GB of GDDR7 memory.

Nvidia's upcoming RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell workstation GPU has started appearing in more online listings, particularly in Japan and Europe. According to Twitter/X user @jisakuhibi, a Japanese retailer has listed the GPU for ¥1,630,600, which is approximately $11,326.

We also spotted the GPU at UK-based online retailer Scan, which is accepting pre-orders for a PNY-branded RTX Pro 6000 graphics card at £7,859.99 (around $10,433). Notably, the Scan listing currently displays an image of an RTX 5000 Founders Edition card, likely serving as a placeholder.​

Last month the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell was spotted on a US-based IT retailer for enterprise customers, just days after the official announcement at GTC. The retailer had listed the GPU at $8,565, which is about a 26% increase over the previous-generation RTX 6000 Ada.

The RTX Pro 6000 GPU primarily targets professionals working in high-performance computing, AI development, data science, content creation, and engineering visualization. It's designed for workstation users who need extreme levels of GPU acceleration for tasks such as complex simulations, large-scale AI model training, real-time ray tracing, and advanced 3D rendering.

Based on the GB202 chip, the RTX Pro 6000 workstation-class GPU features 24,064 CUDA cores spread across 188 streaming multiprocessors with 128 CUDA cores each. With a boost clock speed of 2,617MHz, the GPU comes with a massive 96GB of GDDR7 memory. For comparison, the RTX 5090, which is currently the most powerful consumer-grade GPU from Nvidia, also uses the GB202 chip but with a reduced core count of 21,760 CUDA cores, a peak clock of 2,410MHz, and 32GB of GDDR7 memory.

Just last week, the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell was spotted in a leaked benchmark listing where the GPU scored 368,219 points in Geekbench's OpenCL benchmark, trailing the RTX 5090's 376,858. While the performance gap is quite narrow, it's surprising given the Pro GPU's superior hardware including the massive 96GB memory. However, as a pre-release product with early drivers, its full potential likely hasn't been realized yet. Power limitations and restricted memory access due to unfinished software further explain the current performance shortfall.

While raw specifications of the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell are impressive, buying one, especially at these sky-high prices, seems impractical for typical enthusiasts. The GPU is clearly going to end up being a niche solution for enterprise and specialized professional workloads. Potential buyers will likely need to weigh whether the incremental performance gains and expansive memory can justify the steep premium over previous-gen models and consumer-grade alternatives like the RTX 5090.

Patients with food allergy who discontinued oral immunotherapy were those who were more likely to experience a reaction to the treatment than those who reached maintenance of allergen foods, according to research at the Pediatric Academic Societies 2025 Meeting. 

They were also more likely to experience moderate and severe reactions, particularly mild abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and pruritus, reported Eirene Fithian, of the MD program at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, and colleagues in a poster. 

“Oral immunotherapy discontinuation was low overall but varied by allergen, with higher discontinuation rates observed for allergens with a high incidence of severe reactions compared to the mean,” they reported.

Food allergy affects an estimated 8% of children and 10% of adults in the United States, but advances in oral immunotherapy have opened up treatment options for these individuals, the researchers noted.

“The fear of adverse reactions remains a barrier to treatment, yet little data exists on the role of adverse reactions in treatment discontinuation,” they wrote. “Identifying factors associated with oral immunotherapy discontinuation is critical to addressing concerns and improving the safety and efficacy of oral immunotherapy.” 

The researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study with data from 1003 patients, aged less than 1 year to 47 years, who underwent oral immunotherapy for peanut, tree nut, milk, egg, and/or sesame allergy at Latitude Food Allergy Care between 2018 and 2024. They assessed all treatment-related reactions in terms of frequency, type, and severity. They excluded patients lost to follow-up or updosing and stratified the remaining patients by those who discontinued treatment vs those who reached maintenance for all foods.

Those who discontinued treatment included 8.2% receiving oral immunotherapy for milk, 7.3% for sesame, 6.1% for egg, 5.2% for tree nut, and 5.1% for peanut. The overall discontinuation rate was 5%. (Some patients were receiving oral immunotherapy for multiple allergens, so there is overlap by allergen discontinuation rates.) 

After adjusting for gender, age, and comorbidities, results revealed that patients undergoing oral immunotherapy for milk had more than twice the odds of discontinuing treatment (OR, 2.68; P < .05). The average incidence of severe reactions was 13%, but incidence was higher for milk (22%), sesame (20%), and egg (25%).

About 1 in 5 patients (20%) who discontinued therapy had any reaction compared with 5.2% overall and 4.0% of those who reached maintenance.

“Patients who discontinued oral immunotherapy had similar frequencies of experiencing mild reactions compared to those who reached maintenance but a higher incidence of moderate and severe reactions,” the researchers reported. Those who discontinued treatment also “had a higher frequency of reactions to oral immunotherapy doses, including higher frequency of the top three reported symptoms of reaction: Mild abdominal pain, emesis or diarrhea, and pruritus compared to the overall mean of those who reached maintenance.”

Mild abdominal pain was reported in 5.5% of those who discontinued compared with 1.3% overall and 0.9% of those who reached maintenance. Vomiting or diarrhea occurred in 4.5% of those who discontinued treatment compared with 0.4% overall and 0.3% who reached maintenance. Pruritus occurred in 4.9% of those who discontinued compared with 2.1% overall and 1.9% of those who reached maintenance. 

“The number of patients is very impressive and adds to the strengths of this retrospective study,” Jonathan Tam, MD, medical director of the Gores Family Allergy Center at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News. He also noted that the rate of patients who discontinued oral immunotherapy overall was lower than published rates in clinical trials, but the rate of severe reactions was conversely higher.

“Even given this rate of severe reactions, the discontinuation rate was generally low,” Tam said. “Overall, the findings make sense and are a practical guide to helping patients make decisions oral immunotherapy.” 

The authors did not report receiving external funding or having any disclosures. Tam was not involved with the study but is working with Latitude in a Children's Hospital of Los Angeles clinic.

Nationally representative survey data revealed that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) use for obesity treatment more than tripled among US adults without diabetes between 2018 and 2022, with annual expenditures reaching $5.8 billion in 2022.

“Despite [increased use], adoption remained limited as only 1 in 250 US adults without diabetes used a GLP-1 RA in 2022,” the authors of the study wrote. “Average prices for these medications consistently exceeded $1500 per prescription, although average out-of-pocket costs were well contained, potentially due to people without private insurance being disproportionately less likely to access these medications,” the authors concluded.

The study was led by Cade Shadbolt, MA, and Jasmin Elkin, The University of Melbourne, St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, Fitzroy, Australia. It was published online in Annals of Internal Medicine.

Multiple prescriptions filled by the same individuals may have influenced mean cost estimates. COVID-19 restrictions also posed challenges for survey collection, though data quality assessments during the pandemic yielded encouraging results. Disclosure restrictions limited detailed reporting on spending for less commonly prescribed GLP-1 RAs.

Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) were linked to collateral ligament lesions (CLLs) in the interphalangeal joints of patients with hand osteoarthritis (OA), with BMLs being less common than CLLs. CLLs showed persistence after their initial appearance and became more common over 4 years, whereas BMLs fluctuated in their occurrence over time.

""BMLs at baseline are associated with collateral ligament lesions at follow-up, and collateral ligament lesions at baseline were associated with BMLs at follow-up,"" the authors wrote.

""These results could provide prognostic value and more targeted treatment for hand OA patients,"" they added.

This study was led by Sietse E.S. Terpstra, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands. It was published online on April 24, 2025, in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage.

BMLs scored on MRI scans served only as a proxy for bone activity, with no histologic studies found to clarify their exact implications. The study experienced a significant non-random loss to follow-up, which may have influenced longitudinal associations. Smaller BMLs and collateral ligaments might not have been detected using the MRI scanner.

The original prospective study was financially supported by the Dutch Arthritis Society. Two authors reported receiving grants, royalties, consultancy fees, and/or honoraria from several sources, including the funding agency. One of them also reported being a member or president of certain boards, councils, and societies.

Lingering fatigue and depression are more common among women than men cancer survivors and often lead to a decrease in recreational physical activities in all patients, new data showed.

However, moderate physical activity was linked to an almost 50% lower risk for cancer-related fatigue, and both moderate and vigorous physical activity were associated with a two- to fivefold reduced risk for depression among cancer survivors, according to the analysis presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2025.

The findings “highlight the importance of providing special attention and tailored interventions such as exercise programs, support groups, and mind-body behavioral techniques for vulnerable groups to help effectively manage fatigue and improve participation in recreational activities as they are an essential aspect of quality of life,” Simo Du, MD, a resident at NYC Health + Hospitals and Jacobi Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City, said in a news release.

Du noted that, during her residency, cancer-related fatigue was a common complaint among patients, affecting “not just their daily activities but also their overall quality of life and mental health, making tasks like climbing stairs, doing groceries, or laundry overwhelming.”

Cancer-related fatigue affects more than 80% of patients who receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy, while depression affects around 25% of patients. Unlike typical fatigue, cancer-related fatigue can linger for weeks, months, or even years after treatment, Du explained.

Despite its high prevalence, cancer-related fatigue remains “overlooked and undertreated,” she noted during a conference press briefing. In addition, cancer-related fatigue can affect men and women differently.

To investigate further, Du and her colleagues analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1552 cancer survivors (736 men and 816 women).

After adjusting for age, race, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities, women cancer survivors were more likely to experience fatigue (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; P < .017) and depression (OR, 1.32; P = .341) related to their cancer compared with men cancer survivors.

Du said there are likely multiple reasons behind the sex differences observed.

Women may, for instance, be more likely to experience side effects from chemotherapy, radiation, and long-term use of endocrine treatments because of slower drug clearance, which can lead to higher concentrations and a stronger immune response that may heighten inflammatory side effects.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, cancer-related fatigue (OR, 1.93; P = .002) and depression (OR, 2.28; P = .011) were both strongly associated with reduced moderate recreational activities, such as brisk walking, biking, golfing, and light yard work.

The data also showed a protective role for physical activity. For patients who engaged in moderate physical activity, their risk for cancer-related fatigue (OR, 0.52; P = .002) and depression (OR, 0.41; P = .006) was significantly reduced, Du reported.

For depression (but not cancer-related fatigue), “the higher the intensity of physical activity, the higher the protective effects, with almost 4-5 times the reduction of the depression,” Du noted.

Although the NHANES uses standardized protocols designed to minimize biases, Du said a limitation of the current study is the use of self-reported data and the fact that women could potentially overreport fatigue symptoms and men could potentially underreport symptoms of depression.

Looking ahead, Du and her colleagues are planning studies to assess the effectiveness of tailored interventions on cancer-related fatigue and explore the connection between cancer-related fatigue and different mechanisms, such as inflammatory markers, to see if gender modifies the association.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Jennifer Ligibel, MD, a senior physician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that, because the dataset is cross-sectional, it is unclear whether people who were more tired weren't exercising or if people who weren't exercising were more tired.

However, Ligibel explained, a huge body of literature has demonstrated that exercise is “the most efficient remedy for fatigue,” and it likely helps with depression too.

In fact, in a recent survey of patients with cancer conducted by the American Society for Clinical Oncology, slightly more than half of patients reported that their oncologist talked about exercise and diet during clinic visits, Ligibel said. Provider recommendations for exercise and diet were associated with positive changes in these behaviors.

“Roughly half of oncologists now give exercise advice; that figure is a lot more than it was a few years ago, but it's still not universal,” Ligibel said.

The study had no specific funding. Du and Ligibel had no disclosures.

Racial and ethnic disparities in the use of targeted therapy among patients with ERBB2-positive breast cancer decreased among older Medicare beneficiaries between 2010 and 2019. Black and Hispanic women had significantly lower treatment rates early on, but gaps narrowed by the end of the study period.

“These findings suggest that identifying barriers associated with receipt of ERBB2-targeted therapies, even as guidelines broadly recommend using these drugs, is crucial for improving the quality and equity of breast cancer care,” the authors wrote. “Future research is needed to understand the practices that contributed to the narrowing of racial and ethnic disparities.”

This study was led by Sudarshan Krishnamurthy, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It was published online on May 1 in JAMA Network Open.

Findings might not be generalized to patients with private insurance, the uninsured, or those younger than 65 years. Data on patient preferences or provider decision-making were not available. Smaller racial and ethnic groups were excluded due to limited sample size.

This study was funded by the California Department of Public Health; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries; National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; and grants to individual authors from various sources. Some authors reported receiving grants and personal fees from various sources and holding membership or editorial roles. Details are provided in the original article.

 May 05, 2025  

The latest surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show a steep rise in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), extending a years-long trend of increasing diagnoses.

While greater awareness and improved diagnostic criteria have likely played a role, other potential contributing factors remain unclear and questions persist about what's truly driving this phenomenon.

These new surveillance data came on the heels of an April 10 announcement by US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who set a September deadline to determine the cause of what he called an “autism epidemic.” 

“By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,” Kennedy said.

However, many scientists who have spent their careers studying ASD are deeply skeptical that a definitive answer could be found in just a few months — if at all.

The CDC regularly compiles data on ASD prevalence through the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. The findings are considered to be among the most reliable snapshots of autism rates in children. The CDC's most recent data from the 2022 ADDM surveillance cycle are based on 393,353 8-year-olds across 16 US sites.

The CDC report shows that ASD affects 1 in 31 children (32.2 per 1000), up from 1 in 36 in 2020 and 1 in 150 in 2000. ASD continues to be more common in boys than girls (ratio 3.4:1).

ASD prevalence was higher among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic children than White children, continuing a pattern first observed in 2020.

Children born in 2018 were more likely to be diagnosed by age 48 months compared with those born in 2014, suggesting increased early identification consistent with historical patterns.

The CDC's latest findings have prompted renewed scrutiny over why ASD prevalence continues to rise.

CDC investigators noted several factors that may be driving the increase, including broader diagnostic criteria, greater awareness among parents and pediatricians, and improved access to specialized services.

Together, these shifts mean children who may have been overlooked in previous decades are now being identified.

Kennedy has long expressed concern about environmental toxins and their potential role in ASD. At an April 16 press conference, he claimed that such toxins disrupt neurodevelopment and are behind the rising caseload. He described autism as “a preventable disease” and pledged to identify the environmental culprit by September.

“We're going to follow the science no matter what it says,” Kennedy said. “And we will have some of the answers by September.”

In a statement, the International Society for Autism Research said referring to the condition as a “preventable disease” is “out of touch with contemporary, evidence-based understanding of autism.”

“Based on current autism research, we know that there are many causes of autism, and virtually all of these occur prenatally,” the statement continued. “In other words, you are born with autism.” 

A robust body of evidence points to a substantial genetic component in ASD etiology. Studies of twins dating back to the 1970s have consistently shown that the vast majority of ASD is due to genetics, said Alexander Kolevzon, MD, clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.

“With advances in genetic technology and analytic methods, hundreds of specific genetic changes have now been identified and are commonly accepted to cause autism. Yet the same twin studies show that if one identical twin has ASD, the other may not about 10% of the time, leaving room for some environmental influence,” Kolevzon told Medscape Medical News.

“Environmental effects may be acting through epigenetic mechanisms where certain factors, as of yet unidentified, influence the expression of genes. However, despite being an active area of study, no widespread environmental effects have been reliably established to date,” he added.

When it comes to environmental contributors, a substantial amount of research has focused on exposures during the prenatal period — a critical window for neurodevelopment.

For example, a 2019 JAMA Pediatrics population-based cohort study of 132,256 births showed that maternal exposure to nitric oxide during pregnancy was associated with increased risk for ASD in offspring.

Investigators leading a 2022 study of 294,937 mother-child pairs found that exposure to particulate matter 2.5 in the first two gestational trimesters were associated with increased ASD risk in children. In addition, a 2022 study from France showed prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides was linked to an increase in autistic traits among 11-year-old children.

Maternal metabolic conditions may also play a role. In April 2025, a meta-analysis of 202 studies including more than 56 million mother-child pairs showed that children born to mothers with gestational diabetes were 25% more likely to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers have also linked ASD risk to preterm birth and advanced parental age.

It's thought that these exposures likely act as modifiers — influencing gene expression, immune activation, or neuronal development — rather than standalone causes.

An emerging area of autism research involves the gut microbiome and whether gut dysbiosis contributes to ASD risk.

“There have been several studies showing that there is gut dysbiosis in autism, and that it correlates with autism symptoms,” Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, PhD, professor, Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News.

“However, we know that any behavioral differences must be via gut microbiome/metabolite interactions with the human nervous system,” she said.

In an April 2025 study published in Nature Communications, Aziz-Zadeh's team was the first to identify links between gut microbial tryptophan metabolites, ASD symptoms, and brain activity in individuals with autism, particularly in brain regions associated with interoceptive processing. This points to a “mechanistic model by which gut metabolites may impact autism,” she said.

“It's possible that addressing gut imbalances (via diet, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal transplants) may be helpful. However, we still don't know if there is a critical age where this may need to happen (prenatal, early life). There is still a lot of work to be done to answer this question,” she said.

In another recent study, microbiota transfer therapy led to significant improvements in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, autism-related symptoms, and gut microbiota in children with ASD.

The effects of the initial treatment on both gut microbiota and GI symptoms were maintained at the 2-year follow-up, with continued improvement in autism-like behaviors, the researchers reported.

When Kennedy declared a September deadline for identifying the cause of autism, reaction was swift. Advocacy organizations, professional societies, and many research scientists expressed skepticism regarding the feasibility of such a deadline, noting that complexity argues against finding a single cause.

“The odds of identifying a single factor that causes autism, whether genetic or environmental, is zero,” said Kolevzon.

The 5-month timeline Kennedy set “gives people a false sense of hope” and risks politicizing science, the Autism Society of America said in a statement. “The Autism Society of America finds the administration's claim that ‘we will know what has caused the Autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures' — to be harmful, misleading, and unrealistic.” 

Aziz-Zadeh said that 60%-90% of the causes of autism are likely due to genetic factors. “However, since that number isn't 100%, there are also contributing environmental factors — what those might be, we still don't know — and likely there isn't a single one,” he said.

In a letter signed by more than 130 scientists, the newly formed Coalition of Autism Scientists rejected Kennedy's “false narrative” about the incidence and causes of ASD.

“We are unified in our commitment to conduct the highest quality research and build mutual respect and trust with the public. This trust is seriously threatened by the Secretary's interpretation of the rising prevalence rates and his plans to carry out a study that will deliver findings within a few months on an environmental toxin that causes autism,” the statement said.

Equally concerning to many in the autism community was a recent announcement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) about plans to establish a “new disease registry” focused on ASD that would collect federal and private health data for upcoming autism studies. NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, MD, PhD, made the announcement during a presentation to the Council of Councils on April 21.

However, HHS walked back that plan 3 days later, following an outcry from the autism community. HHS spokeswoman Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano told Medscape Medical News that the agency is not creating an autism registry but is developing a “real-world data platform” linking existing datasets “that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.”

NIH is also investing $50 million to launch a comprehensive research effort aimed at understanding the causes of ASD and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration, Feliciano added.

Feliciano did not respond to follow-up questions from Medscape Medical News to clarify whether the data platform would include patient identifying information or such data sources as pharmacies, private insurers, and personal wearable sensors, as noted by Bhattacharya during his presentation.

Autism Speaks, an advocacy group, said that research should not focus solely on the causes of autism. “We also need to invest in studies that lead to real improvements in people's lives — like better healthcare, education, job opportunities, and support at every stage of life for autistic people and their families,” the group said in a statement.

A trial testing the combination of the anti-TIGIT antibody tiragolumab and atezolizumab vs atezolizumab in previously untreated programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–high locally advanced unresectable or metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) failed to meet its primary endpoints.

Although the SKYSCRAPER-01 trial did not meet its primary endpoints, numerical advantages observed with the tiragolumab/atezolizumab combination suggest that TIGIT remains a potentially valid target in NSCLC, said Solange Peters, MD, PhD, during her presentation of the new results at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2025.

“More data are needed to identify the patient population who potentially could benefit from combining an anti–PD-L1 strategy with the inhibition of the TIGIT pathway,” she said during her talk.

Peters, of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Switzerland, described the importance of checkpoint inhibitors in the management of advanced NSCLC without actionable genomic alterations, particularly in patients with high PD-L1 expression. However, she noted that most patients, “probably more than 85%,” eventually experience disease progression. According to Peters, this high rate of progression despite treatment indicates an unmet need for new treatment options for this patient population.

Peters explained that TIGIT, a T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine–based activation motifs domains, has emerged as a promising immune checkpoint target. TIGIT binds to poliovirus receptor (PVR), also called CD155, on cancer cells and antigen-presenting cells, inhibiting the immune activity of T cells and natural killer cells.

“In lung cancer cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, particularly exhausted CD8+ T cells, may express high levels of TIGIT and PD-1,” Peters noted during her presentation. “Therefore, a human anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody that blocks TIGIT binding to PVR could restore the interaction between CD226 and PVR, allowing activation of T cells and NK cells.”

SKYSCRAPER-01 was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial that recruited patients between March 2020 and August 2021 at 122 sites across 20 countries. The study enrolled patients with previously untreated, locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression, good performance status (ECOG 0-1), and without EGFR/ALK alterations.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either tiragolumab 600 mg intravenously (IV) plus atezolizumab 1200 mg IV or placebo plus atezolizumab 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit. The final analysis included 534 randomized patients.

The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the primary analysis set, which included patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥ 50%, as determined with the 22C3 assay.

Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) and investigator-assessed duration of response (DOR) in the primary analysis set, as well as OS in the secondary analysis set (patients with PD-L1 tumor cell ≥ 50%, as determined using the SP263 assay).

At the data cutoff in March 2022, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 7.0 months with tiragolumab plus atezolizumab vs 5.6 months with placebo plus atezolizumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI = 0.63-0.97; P = .02). Although there was a slight numerical difference in the median PFS between the groups, this difference did not meet the prespecified significance threshold of P < .01.

At the final OS analysis (data cutoff September 2024), the median OS was 23.1 months with tiragolumab plus atezolizumab vs 16.9 months with placebo plus atezolizumab (HR, 0.87; 95% CI = 0.71-1.08; P = .22). Patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm showed a higher ORR (45.8% vs 35.1%) and longer median DOR (18.0 months vs 14.6 months).

Peters said that although the primary endpoints of investigator-assessed PFS and OS were not met, “numerical improvements in both PFS and OS with tiragolumab plus atezolizumab versus placebo plus atezolizumab suggest potential antitumor activity of combination PD-L1/TIGIT targeting in NSCLC.”

Safety analysis revealed increased toxicity with combination therapy. The median treatment duration was 7.5 months in the experimental arm vs 5.5 months in the control arm. The rates of any-grade toxicity, adverse events related to any treatment, adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal, and immune-related adverse events were all higher in the experimental arm than in the control arm.

The most frequent adverse events in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm were pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, cough, and anemia. Immune-mediated adverse events observed in more than 5% of patients included rash, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, infusion-related reactions, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and pneumonitis.

In his discussion session, Ramaswamy Govindan, MD, of Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, provided context for the SKYSCRAPER-01 results, which he described as “disappointing.”

Govindan compared SKYSCRAPER-01 with the earlier phase 2 CITYSCAPE study, which yielded positive results and provided the rationale for the phase 3 trial.

“If you look at the combination arm, the response rates in SKYSCRAPER-01 are a little lower, the PFS is half of what was seen in the CITYSCAPE study, and OS is much less impressive,” he said. On the contrary, the atezolizumab arm in the two trials was “roughly the same.”

Govindan pointed out several differences between the populations in the two studies, including a higher proportion of participants with liver and brain metastases and a greater proportion of men in the SKYSCRAPER-01 study. He also highlighted the sample size issue, noting, “Although the CITYSCAPE results were promising, findings were based on a small number of patients.” He further explained that the study had a population of 67, and only about half had PD-L1 ≥ 50%.

Govindan stated that variations in cohort sizes and characteristics, as well as differences in tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment, also could have contributed to the discrepancies in the findings of the two studies.

Despite these setbacks, both Peters and Govindan emphasized that the TIGIT pathway remains an interesting target, with other TIGIT inhibitors still under development, including domvanalimab, rilvegostomig, and belrestotug.

Govindan also said that not all TIGIT inhibitors are the same and that there is a controversy in the TIGIT field about “whether we should keep” the fragment crystallizable region of the monoclonal antibody (Fc) “active,” meaning able to engage Fc receptors and potentially trigger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or “inactive,” meaning engineered to minimize Fc receptor engagement.

Govindan also discussed the importance of biomarker development, noting, “We should look at biomarkers before we say that TIGIT-targeted therapies do not work.”

He explained that in the CITYSCAPE study, an agnostic approach was used, and transcriptomic studies showed tumor-associated macrophages, Tregs, and monocytes as potential biomarkers of response. He added that “tumors that were enriched in macrophages, monocytes, and Tregs did well with the TIGIT combination,” suggesting that these could serve as markers for better patient selection.

Opioid medications can play an essential role in managing pain, yet their use may pose significant risks, especially when interacting with other drugs. A particularly dangerous combination is the concurrent use of benzodiazepines, opioids, and muscle relaxants, a triad that significantly increases the risk for respiratory depression and overdose. Although healthcare providers are generally aware of this risk, it is important to recognize that the landscape of opioid drug interactions extends beyond these well-known concerns. Exploring additional mechanisms of opioid interactions reveals the potential dangers posed by serotonergic drugs, the implications of interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibitors and inducers, and the critical issue of QT prolongation–related drug interactions.

Serotonin syndrome or serotonin toxicity occurs when serotonin receptors are overstimulated by serotonergic drugs. The presentation may vary from mild adverse effects including anxiety, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperreflexia, and diarrhea to severe, life-threatening toxicity. Serotonin syndrome may be precipitated by use of a single serotonergic drug or as a drug interaction between two or more serotonergic agents.

The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and another serotonergic drug, typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has resulted in the most severe cases of serotonin syndrome reported in the literature, whereas concomitant use of an SSRI and tramadol is the most frequent cause of serotonin syndrome. Opioids contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome through several mechanisms. Oxycodone and tramadol enhance serotonin release, methadone and tramadol inhibit serotonin reuptake, and fentanyl activates serotonin receptors.

Although the risk for serotonin syndrome is not a contraindication to use of opioids with other serotonergic drugs, prescribers should frequently monitor patients for the development of symptoms, particularly during treatment initiation and dose titration. Discontinue all serotonergic agents if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

CYP450 enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including opioids. The two CYP450 enzymes primarily responsible for the metabolism of most drugs are CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. These enzymes also play a significant role in the biotransformation of several opioids. CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of a wide range of opioids, such as oxycodone and fentanyl, whereas CYP2D6 is involved in the conversion of codeine to its active metabolite, morphine.

The addition of CYP450 inhibitors can lead to increased plasma concentrations of opioids, enhancing their effects and increasing the risk of adverse reactions, including respiratory depression. CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors commonly include macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungal agents, antiretroviral protease inhibitors, certain SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine), and bupropion, among many others. When prescribing a CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with opioids dependent on these enzymes for metabolism, consider a reduced opioid dose until stable effects are achieved. If the CYP450 inhibitor is discontinued, monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider an increased dose of the opioid while the effects of the inhibitor decline.

Although CYP450 inhibitors typically increase the concentration of drugs, codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6 into its active form, morphine, which is responsible for its analgesic effects. When codeine sulfate tablets are used concurrently with CYP2D6 inhibitors, the plasma concentration of codeine may increase; however, the formation of morphine is inhibited, leading to a decrease in its plasma concentration. This can result in reduced analgesic efficacy and may even precipitate symptoms of opioid withdrawal, particularly if a CYP2D6 inhibitor is introduced after a stable dose of codeine has been established. Therefore, careful monitoring and dose adjustments are essential when managing patients on codeine who are also prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors.

Conversely, CYP450 inducers can accelerate the metabolism of opioids, resulting in decreased efficacy and potential withdrawal symptoms in patients. Common examples of CYP3A4 inducers include rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, among others; there are currently no known inducers of CYP2D6. Consider increasing the opioid dosage when combined with a CYP3A4 inducer and monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider decreasing the opioid dose and frequently monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.

Drug-induced QT prolongation increases the risk for torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Class IA and class III antiarrhythmics are the most potent QT prolonging agents. However, many other drugs have the ability to prolong the QT interval, including certain opioids, such as methadone, buprenorphine, and tramadol. The risk for QT prolongation can be exacerbated by concomitant use of other medications that also prolong the QT interval, such as certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiarrhythmics. These drug interactions can lead to additive effects, heightening the risk for cardiovascular complications. Clinicians must be vigilant in monitoring patients who are prescribed opioids, especially those with preexisting cardiac conditions or those taking multiple medications that affect the QT interval.

Although opioid medications are invaluable tools in pain management, their potential for harmful drug interactions necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks. The interplay between opioids and other medications, particularly benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, serotonergic agents, and drugs affecting the cytochrome P450 system, can lead to severe adverse effects, including respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome, and QT prolongation. It is imperative for healthcare providers to remain vigilant in recognizing these interactions and to implement appropriate monitoring strategies to safeguard patient health. By fostering awareness of the complexities surrounding opioid use and its interactions, clinicians can enhance patient safety, optimize therapeutic outcomes, and mitigate the risks associated with these powerful medications. Ultimately, a proactive approach to managing opioid therapy will contribute to more effective pain management while minimizing the potential for serious complications.

The number of visits to the emergency department (ED) for nonfatal opioid overdoses remained stable from 2010 to 2022 among adolescents, with more than a quarter of cases resulting in revisits within a year and mental health conditions reported as the primary reason for return visits.

“The largest frequency of revisits with a measured condition were related to a mental health complaint, highlighting the need to ensure that appropriate services for both substance misuse and other mental health conditions are consistently provided at these visits,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Michael S. Toce, MD, MS, of the Boston Children's Hospital in Boston. It was published online on April 24, 2025, in Journal of Adolescent Health.

This study focused on urban and highly populated areas. The use of diagnostic codes limited the examination of underlying factors associated with overdoses, such as self-harm or recreational use.

SAN DIEGO — Patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors show significant reductions in a range of portal hypertension complications and all-cause mortality compared with those not receiving the drugs, new research shows.

“Our study found that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with fewer portal hypertension complications and lower mortality, suggesting they may be a valuable addition to cirrhosis management,” first author Abhinav K. Rao, MD, of the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

Portal hypertension, a potentially life-threatening complication of cirrhosis, can be a key driver of additional complications including ascites and gastro-esophageal varices in cirrhosis.

Current treatments such as beta-blockers can prevent some complications, however, more effective therapies are needed.

SGLT2 inhibitors are often used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease as well as metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH)–mediated liver disease; research is lacking regarding their effects in portal hypertension in the broader population of people with cirrhosis.

“The therapeutic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors might be related to their ability to improve vascular function, making them attractive in portal hypertension,” Rao explained.

To investigate, Rao and colleagues evaluated data on 637,079 patients with cirrhosis in the TriNetX database, which includes patients in the United States from 66 healthcare organizations.

Patients were divided into three subgroups, including those with MASH, alcohol-associated, and other etiologies of cirrhosis.

Using robust 1:1 propensity score matching, patients in each subgroup were stratified as either having or not having been treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, limited to those who initiated the drugs within 1 year of their cirrhosis diagnosis to prevent immortal time bias. Patients were matched on other characteristics.

For the primary outcome of all-cause mortality, with an overall median follow-up of 2 years, patients prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors in the MASH cirrhosis (n = 47,385), alcohol-associated cirrhosis (n = 107,844), and other etiologies of cirrhosis (n = 59,499) groups all had a significantly lower risk for all-cause mortality than those not prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors (P < .05 for all).

Specifically looking at the MASH cirrhosis group, Rao described outcomes of the two groups of 3026 patients each who were and were not treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.

The patients had similar rates of esophageal varices (25% in the SGLT2 group and 22% in the no SGLT2 group), ascites (19% in each group), and a similar rate of 19% had hepatic encephalopathy (HE).

About 57% of patients in each treatment group used beta-blockers and 33% used glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Those with a history of liver transplantation, hemodialysis, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement were excluded.

The secondary outcome results in those patients showed that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with significantly reduced risks of developing portal hypertension complications including ascites, HE, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and hepatorenal syndrome (P < .05 for all).

Esophageal variceal bleeding was also reduced with SGLT-2 inhibitors; however the difference was not statistically significant.

In a secondary analysis of patients in the MASH cirrhosis group treated with one type of a nonselective beta-blockers (n = 509) and another nonselective beta-blockers (n = 2561), the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on portal hypertension, with the exception of HE and SBP, were found to be somewhat diminished, likely because patients were already benefitting from the beta-blockers, Rao noted.

In outcomes of the non–MASH-related cirrhosis groups, patients prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors also had a reduced risk for specific, as well as any portal hypertension complications (P < .05), Rao noted.

Overall, the findings add to previous studies on SGLT2 inhibitors in MASH and expand on the possible benefits, he said.

“Our findings validate these [previous] results and suggest potential benefits across for patients with other types of liver disease and raise the possibility of a beneficial effect in portal hypertension,” he said.

“Given the marked reduction in portal hypertension complications after SGLT2 inhibitor initiation, the associated survival benefit may not be surprising,” he noted.

“However, we were intrigued by the consistent reduction in portal hypertension complications across all cirrhosis types, especially since SGLT-2 inhibitors are most commonly used in patients with diabetes who have MASH-mediated liver disease.”

Commenting on the study, Rotonya M. Carr, MD, Division Head of Gastroenterology at the University of Washington, Seattle, said the study sheds important light on an issue previously addressed only in smaller cohorts.

“To date, there have only been a few small prospective, retrospective, and case series studies investigating SGTL2 inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis,” she told Medscape Medical News.

“This retrospective study is a real-world glimpse at how patients with cirrhosis may fare on these drugs — very exciting data.”

Carr cautioned, however, that, in addition to the retrospective study design, limitations included that the study doesn't provide details on the duration of therapy, preventing an understanding of whether the results represent chronic, sustained use of SGLT2 inhibitors.

“[Therefore], we cannot interpret these results to mean that chronic, sustained use of SGTL2 inh is beneficial, or does not cause harm, in patients with cirrhosis.”

“While these data are provocative, more work needs to be done before we understand the full safety and efficacy of SGTL2 inhibitors for patients with cirrhosis,” Carr added.

“However, these data are very encouraging, and I am optimistic that we will indeed see both SGTL2 inhibitors and GLP-1s among the group of medications we use in the future for the primary management of patients with liver disease.”

The authors had no disclosures to report. Carr's disclosures included relationships with Intercept and Novo Nordisk and research funding from Merck.

Predicting a person's glycemic response to a meal or snack is a key part of the successful management of both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D); yet, due to the complexity of the factors involved, it can require expensive and invasive testing such as blood draws and stool samples.

In research published in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Samantha Kleinberg, PhD, Farber Chair Professor of Computer Science at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, and colleagues showed that they could predict how the body would react to a meal “without the need for either personalized training data or invasive physiological data.” 

They leverage data from two datasets — one from the United States with 397 individuals with T1D, and one from China including 100 people with T2D — to gather standard demographic, physiological, food consumption, and long-term glucose data using continuous glucose monitoring and detailed food diaries.

The researchers' prediction model, developed using a machine learning algorithm designed for categorial data, achieved accuracy comparable to previous work that relied on invasive test results. Switching from macronutrient to food categories when assessing food consumption further improved accuracy.

“Our findings suggest that personalized nutrition could be used widely in diabetes management and may not require expensive or invasive data to obtain sufficient accuracy,” the team reported.

To find out more about why it's so important to assess glycemic responses, the role of menstrual cycles on the variability of individual responses, and the findings' implications for diabetes management, Medscape Medical News spoke with Kleinberg.

 

Why is it so important to predict glycemic responses to meals in people with diabetes?

For people with diabetes, predicting glycemic response is crucial. First, it can help to support daily glucose management by helping people choose foods that minimize increases in glucose. Second, it can help guide manual insulin dosing more accurately than, say, carb counting. The predictions could also be integrated into automated insulin delivery systems to make their predictions more accurate.

 

Do we know why there is such a large degree of variation in glycemic responses between individuals? What is driving it?

This is a key question, and we cannot yet fully answer it. In all models so far, there seems to be a ceiling on how accurately glycemic response can be predicted. However, we found two sources of variation: Menstrual cycle phase and time of day. This helps explain why someone might have different responses to a meal on different days. We suspect that there may be other factors such as stress or sleep that play a role, but we did not have the data to look at those yet.

 

How does menstrual cycle affect glycemic responses?

Hormones play a role in insulin sensitivity. We saw this reflected in the data with higher average glucose during the perimenstrual phase and in higher glycemic responses to meals repeated during this phase. More work is needed to understand potential individual differences in this area, but this suggests it should play a role in diabetes management.

 

What do the invasive microbiome data offer that made these appear necessary for predicting glycemic responses?

Microbiome has been a focus of prior works as it is linked to digestion and metabolism. However, it is expensive and requires stool samples, so it is not always practical to collect. We wanted to see how well we could predict meal responses without it and were surprised to find we could do pretty well. In ongoing work, we are now testing whether microbiome remains informative once food type is included. 

Why do you think food categories led to improved accuracy vs macronutrients?

Food categories provide more information than macronutrients alone. They can tell us something about other nutrients like fiber and characteristics like processing level that also make a big difference on glycemic impact.

 

What are the implications of your results for diabetes management?

We are hopeful that our work will enable personalized nutrition to be a bit more accessible and scalable. It could be used to tailor dietary plans, guide insulin dosing, and potentially reduce overall insulin needs.

The main limitation is that currently an individual would need to track their meals to get a prediction of their response. We are working on ways to make that less cumbersome.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to briefly discuss a small study, not a large, randomized, controlled clinical trial. One may ask, how do you draw major conclusions on a small trial, which I'll identify in a moment. 

I want to make a point that sometimes small trials can have a major impact, particularly when the results are impressively favorable for a subset of the population, that we might want to consider using sooner rather than later in terms of our ultimate paradigms. The study I'm referring to was titled, “Olaparib Without Androgen Deprivation for High-Risk Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer Following Prostatectomy: A Nonrandomized Controlled Study.” 

There are many debates about the optimal therapy in prostate cancer with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in people who might not be symptomatic but just have a biomarker. What is the impact on quality of life? What is the cost of the therapy? What is the ultimate impact on survival? 

This was a nonrandomized, controlled trial, looking at individuals who had biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. These were genetically unselected patients at four sites, treated from May 2017 to November 2022. Again, this analysis included people who might not have had a BRCA mutation. 

Eligible patients had biochemically recurrent disease following radical prostatectomy, a PSA doubling time of 6 months or shorter, an absolute PSA value of 1.0 ng/mL or higher, and a testosterone level of 150 ng/dL or higher.

There were 51 individuals, obviously all male, who participated in this effort, and 13 individuals had what they described as a PSA50 response — so at least a 50% reduction lasting at least a month with the use of olaparib. That was a 26% response rate. 

The point to be made here is that we saw responses in individuals who had documented homologous recombination deficiency, as one would believe would be the case for a PARP inhibitor. But also, very importantly, 11 patients in this analysis had documented BRCA2 alterations, and 100% — all 11 patients — experienced an objective response. 

As one might speculate based on what we know about PARP inhibitors, certainly in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, we see that not only do the data support the restriction of the use of this class of drugs — this drug in particular — in individuals who have documented homologous recombination efficiency, but also there was a very high response rate in individuals with a BRCA mutation. 

Yes, we need to see more data confirming this observation, and I would argue we don't need randomized phase 3 trials at this point. We need more data demonstrating this [response], and assuming that occurs, then this is potentially a very rational strategy and a reasonably well-tolerated therapy to employ in a subset of patients following recurrence after radical prostatectomy in this clinical setting.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved dihydroergotamine (DHE) nasal powder (Atzumi, Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Inc) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults

Atzumi (previously STS101) is the “first and only” product utilizing the Simple MucoAdhesive Release Technology (SMART) platform, which combines a proprietary advanced powder and device technology to simplify delivery of DHE, the company said in a news release announcing approval. 

""DHE plays a unique clinical role in the acute treatment of migraine, providing patients long lasting effects and the unique ability to provide benefit even when taken late in a migraine attack,” Stewart J. Tepper, MD, vice president, New England Institute for Neurology and Headache, Stamford, Connecticut, said in the release. 

“The convenience of Atzumi, the only DHE nasal powder, will offer patients ease of use combined with the important known DHE clinical advantages,"" Tepper added. 

The FDA approved Atzumi based on two clinical studies — the phase 1 pharmacokinetics trial and the phase 3 ASCEND open-label, long-term safety trial, which Tepper led. 

The ASCEND study enrolled adults with a ≥ 1 year history of migraine with or without aura and 4-12 migraine attacks per month and < 15 headache days per month in each of the 3 months prior to screening.

The study demonstrated fast absorption, rapid achievement of high DHE plasma concentrations, and sustained DHE plasma levels over time as well as safety and tolerability in subjects with migraine. 

Treatment with DHE nasal powder was associated with rapid onset of freedom from pain (37%, 67%, and 86% of treated attacks 2, 4, and 24 hours after dosing, respectively), freedom from most bothersome symptoms (54%, 80%, and 91%), and headache relief (67%, 89%, and 94%). 

Atzumi is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine or for the management of hemiplegic migraine, or migraine with brainstem aura. Complete prescribing information is available online.

A total of 20.8% of European adolescents showed reluctance toward vaccination. This finding comes from a recent study published in BMC Public Health, led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) and Sant Joan de Déu Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.

The research surveyed 1877 young people 12-17 years of age from Italy, Portugal, Poland, and Spain, along with 1135 parents. The main factors behind this reluctance include fear of vaccine adverse effects and distrust in government recommendations.

This study is part of Science4Pandemics, a European project that provides a citizen engagement digital platform for collective intelligence in pandemics. The study showed significant differences between the countries. Poland reported a prevalence of 31.6% among adolescents, whereas the number in Spain was 12.5%. This significant difference aligns with “the historically lower vaccine hesitancy and higher coverage in our country compared to other European nations,” stated Pere Millat-Martínez, MD, physician and scientific researcher at ISGlobal and the study's lead author. He suggested that better results in the Spanish population may be due to “prevention campaigns conducted by primary care nursing and parental awareness, which greatly influences at home.”

The primary cause of vaccine hesitancy was fear of vaccine side effects, cited by 56.1% of adolescents and 51.9% of parents. “This data surprised us. We expected the primary factor of hesitancy among adolescents and their parents to be the belief that the diseases are not serious enough,” explained Millat-Martínez.

“It has long been demonstrated that vaccines are safe. An article published in the 1990s linked them to the development of autism, which the anti-vaccine movement relied on. However, it has been shown to be based on false data. In recent years, there has been less talk about myths surrounding side effects, so it is striking to see such a high percentage in our study,” he explained.

Surveys conducted by his team found that up to 22% of adolescents and 22.8% of parents expressed distrust in government recommendations. Among young people, notable reasons included the belief that vaccine-preventable infections are not severe (8.4%) and the perception of a low likelihood of falling ill (8.4%). For parents, reasons for vaccine hesitancy included the belief that preventable infections are not severe (10.4%) and economic barriers (10.9%).

Another surprising conclusion was the response to economic barriers. “We included this option thinking that few people would select it. In the countries where we conducted the surveys, basic vaccines were covered by the government and were free of charge. Therefore, we thought these data might be influenced by social media,” noted Millat-Martínez, who believes these platforms are a key factor in vaccination coverage.

“It is evident that adolescents rely on social media to form opinions, so any misinformation on these platforms affects young people and the public. A study from another research group in Spain showed that news about vaccines on social media can have both positive and negative influences,” warned Millat-Martínez. Considering this influence, he believes that Europe must improve public health strategies to address vaccine hesitancy and ensure optimal vaccination coverage.

The study showed that adolescents should be the key focus of awareness campaigns. Mass media and school-based initiatives should be used to foster trust in vaccines among this age group. “If the main causes of vaccine hesitancy are misinformation about their safety and distrust in government-recommended vaccination schedules, to reduce this misconception about immunizations, our recommendation is to direct preventive measures and education about vaccines primarily towards the population group in our study,” concluded Millat-Martínez.

Millat-Martínez declared no conflicts of interest.

A 26-year-old woman, who was 14 weeks pregnant, presented to the hospital complaining of chest pain while in the left lateral decubitus position. No relevant pre-existing conditions were observed. Her examinations were mostly unremarkable. MRI suggested pericardial agenesis.

The patient was advised to avoid positions that triggered her symptoms. At 34 weeks of pregnancy, she returned with chest pain. Repeat MRI revealed a rare cause of her symptoms.

A case report by cardiologist Ken Miura, MD, PhD, and colleagues from Akita University Graduate School of Medicine in Akita, Japan, documented a rare combination of cardiac conditions.

The patient presented at 14 weeks of pregnancy with acute chest pain in the left lateral position at a hospital in Akita, Japan. She denied any cardiac risk factors or relevant pre-existing conditions. Her mother had a known case of asymptomatic and untreated pericardial agenesis. Her medication, social, drug, and travel histories were unremarkable.

At the time of admission, blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, body temperature, and oxygen saturation were normal. Inspection, auscultation, palpation, and percussion did not reveal any significant findings in the patient. Laboratory tests showed unremarkable results.

Troponin levels were not elevated. A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, with a cardiothoracic ratio of 65%. The cardiac silhouette was shifted to the left, and the pulmonary artery was enlarged.

ECG showed sinus rhythm and incomplete right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a “teardrop-shaped” left ventricle and paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum on the parasternal view. The apical four-chamber view revealed compression of the middle of the ventricles.

Cardiac MRI revealed bulging of the apex, which was markedly accentuated when the patient was in the left lateral position. Although imaging did not directly confirm the presence of the pericardium, the change in cardiac shadows during postural changes suggested a diagnosis of pericardial agenesis.

On the basis of these findings, the patient was advised to avoid the left lateral position. In the 31st week of pregnancy, she was admitted for careful monitoring of her condition. Interdisciplinary meetings involving obstetricians, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and anaesthetists were held to discuss the treatment plan. The pelvic position of the foetus made treatment decisions difficult. Two options were considered: Caesarean section and external rotation followed by vaginal delivery. However, the pressure of external rotation increases the risk for cardiac herniation. Thus, after further discussion, a caesarean section was scheduled at 37 weeks of pregnancy, as foetal lung development would be completed around 34-35 weeks.

However, at 34 weeks of pregnancy, the patient developed sudden intermittent chest pain in the supine position. The ECG revealed negative T waves in leads II and V3-V6. An hour later, the T waves normalised. The working diagnosis was non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome based on worsening chest symptoms, ST segment depression, and the absence of an elevated troponin level. Emergency cardiac MRI was performed; however, it did not provide direct evidence of myocardial ischaemia. Rather, the enlarged uterus had lifted the diaphragm and pushed the heart upward. It was assumed that the heart was strangulated by the pericardial defect.

An emergency caesarean section was performed successfully. However, 6 months after delivery, she experienced brief chest pain while carrying her baby. Because she wanted a second child, she decided to undergo cardiac surgery before her next pregnancy. A year after delivery, cardiac surgery was performed to address pericardial agenesis. Intraoperative findings revealed the absence of the left pericardium. Additionally, an edge of the right pericardium was sclerotic and located on the inferior surface of the heart.

Myocardial ischaemia was suspected to have been caused by compression of the right coronary artery by this sclerotic edge. Based on these findings, the final diagnosis was hemipericardial agenesis with a sclerotic edge of the right pericardium due to anatomic changes during pregnancy.

“Our patient with previously asymptomatic hemipericardial agenesis was at risk of developing fatal myocardial ischaemia due to pregnancy,” the authors wrote. The report demonstrated that “women with a completely absent or only partially pericardium require special attention during pregnancy.”

A large Korean study shows that drinking black coffee, especially among women, is linked to better glucose control and reduced insulin resistance, highlighting coffee's potential role in metabolic health.

 Study: Association Between Coffee Consumption and Glucose Metabolism Markers in Korean Adults. Image Credit: Shutterstock AI Generator / Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in Nutrients explores the association between coffee consumption and glucose metabolism in Korean adults.

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide; however, existing studies have reported mixed results on its health impact.

Although each additional cup of coffee has been suggested to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by 6%, irrespective of the presence of caffeine, the mechanisms involved in this association remain unclear. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that coffee's abundant polyphenols can improve insulin sensitivity, which is crucial for diabetes management to reduce insulin resistance (IR).

In 2019, Koreans drank 315 grams of total beverages per capita, 108 grams of which were coffee. Various types of coffee are consumed in South Korea, with instant coffee mix, which is high in sugar and saturated fatty acids, constituting a significant portion of the Korean coffee market.

To date, few studies have considered coffee type while assessing the association between coffee intake and glucose metabolism.

Data were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) between 2019 and 2021. A total of 7,453 adults between 19 and 64 years of age were asked about their coffee intake and the type of coffee they consumed over a 24-hour period.

The type of coffee reported was either black coffee or coffee with sugar and/or cream. Study participants were categorized as non-drinkers and those who drank one, two, and three or more cups/day.

In large-scale epidemiological studies, IR is typically measured using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). High HOMA values have historically been correlated to an increased risk of metabolic diseases like hypertension and T2DM.

For the current analysis, researchers investigated the impact of coffee consumption on various glucose metabolism markers, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin levels.

Overall, consuming two cups of coffee daily was associated with a 23% reduced risk of elevated fasting insulin or HOMA-IR. For black coffee, HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels were reduced by 26% and 21%, respectively, among those who consumed one cup or less of black coffee every day.

No significant reduction in HOMA-IR or fasting insulin levels was observed among individuals who consumed two or more cups of coffee daily. Adding sugar and/or cream to coffee did not affect this association.

Women who drank two or more cups of coffee exhibited more pronounced improvements in HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels by 27% and 30%, respectively. These benefits were further amplified in women who consumed three or more cups daily, with a 34% and 36% reduction in HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels, respectively. No significant difference in HOMA-IR or fasting insulin levels was observed when the addition of sugar and/or cream was considered.

However, women who drank black coffee exhibited better insulin resistance and glucose metabolism than those who included sugar and/or cream in their coffee. Two cups of black coffee every day were associated with a 36% reduction in both HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels.

These benefits were no longer significant when three or more cups of black coffee were consumed every day. This lack of significance may be due to a smaller number of individuals drinking three or more cups of coffee daily.

The observed sex differences could be due to different sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, which are low in many patients with T2DM but higher in women due to the presence of estrogen. Women are also less likely to smoke or drink, which may amplify the role of diet in maintaining glucose metabolism.

No significant difference in HbA1c or HOMA-β was associated with coffee consumption, corroborating previous studies' results.

Coffee reduces glucose metabolism markers by improving insulin sensitivity rather than enhancing beta cell function. Previously, researchers have hypothesized that several different mechanisms may be involved in coffee's anti-diabetes effects, some of which are attributed to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of caffeine and other coffee compounds, reduced glucose absorption, and reduced glucose release from the liver.

Consuming two or more cups of black coffee per day is inversely associated with insulin resistance in Korean women.”

The current study is the first to use nationally representative KNHANES data to examine the associations of coffee drinking with glucose metabolism by type of coffee consumed. Future studies are needed to validate these findings.

Men often face higher disease and death rates, but women show better outcomes in care. This global review uncovers where health systems succeed and fail across the gender divide.

Study: Sex-disaggregated data along the gendered health pathways: A review and analysis of global data on hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and AIDS. Image Credit: Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal PLOS Medicine, researchers found that sex differences in burden, access, and outcomes are complex and vary by country, condition, and stage of the health pathway. In many contexts, males face an excess burden of increased prevalence of diseases and risk factors, and lower access to diagnosis and treatment.

Gender and sex shape health outcomes through various factors, including patterns of health service use, bodily responses to risk exposure, and rates of exposure to environments and risk factors. Understanding differences in health outcomes, risk exposure, and health service use by gender identity and sex could help identify effective interventions to reduce health inequities. However, gender identity and sex are often conflated and confused in health surveys.

Consequently, analyzing survey data becomes challenging. Moreover, only a few surveys report on gender identity beyond the simple binary (male/female). Disaggregating data along a health pathway (from risk exposure to death, including disease prevalence and care cascade) could provide a systematic and holistic view of gender- and sex-based health inequities and identify opportunities for tailored interventions.

The researchers analyzed sex-disaggregated data from global surveys and datasets, interpreting observed differences through a gender-informed lens. While the datasets themselves were disaggregated by sex (male/female), the authors acknowledged that the data could not fully distinguish between biological and gendered social influences. The study examined eight health conditions but had sufficient care cascade data for only three: HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and diabetes. Disease prevalence, risk factors, and mortality data came from the Global Burden of Disease dataset.

Risk factors for HIV/AIDS and diabetes were selected based on their global mortality burden, with age- and sex-disaggregated data. For hypertension, the leading cardiovascular risk factors were used. The care cascade included diagnosis, treatment, and disease control. Data sources included the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (hypertension), STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (diabetes), and UNAIDS (HIV/AIDS). Some data were collected as ""country-years,"" where countries contributed multiple years of observations.

Sex-disaggregated data on risk factors, disease prevalence, and mortality were available for all three conditions across 204 countries. However, care cascade data varied: hypertension (200 country-years), diabetes (39), and HIV/AIDS (76).

Hypertension risk factors included high sodium intake, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, obesity, and overweight. Males had significantly higher smoking rates in 176 countries (except Bhutan), while obesity rates were higher in females in 130 countries. Overweight prevalence was largely similar across sexes.

Illustration of the health pathway.

Global hypertension prevalence was comparable, with exceptions in eight countries where males had higher prevalence. India showed higher hypertension in females aged 70–79. No significant global sex differences were found in the hypertension care cascade, though some countries had higher diagnosis or treatment rates among females in specific age groups.

In Uzbekistan, Iran, and Peru, women aged 30–39 had higher hypertension control rates. Male hypertension mortality rates were higher in 107 countries, especially in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Regional differences emerged across diseases—for example, male HIV/AIDS and diabetes deaths were more common in Europe, Central Asia, and Latin America, while higher female deaths occurred in the Middle East and North Africa.

Diabetes risk factors included FPG, insulin/drug use, overweight, obesity, smoking, and low physical activity. Physical inactivity was similar across sexes, though some countries showed differences. Diabetes prevalence varied: higher in males in 61 countries and females in 10. Care cascade differences were limited, except in Cape Verde, where females had better outcomes in some age groups. Mortality from diabetes was higher in males in 100 countries and in females in 9, with 95 countries showing no difference.

For HIV/AIDS, risk factors included drug use, unsafe sex, and intimate partner violence. Drug use was higher in males in 139 countries and in females in a few (e.g., Syria, China, Iceland). Unsafe sex was more common among females in 113 countries. HIV prevalence was higher in males in 114 countries and in females in 28. HIV care cascade data (not age-disaggregated) showed better outcomes for females in 9, 20, and 21 countries (diagnosis, treatment, and control, respectively). Lebanon was an exception, with males performing better in treatment and control. HIV/AIDS deaths were higher in males in 131 countries and in females in 25.

The findings reveal significant sex differences along the health pathway. In many countries, males have higher disease prevalence and mortality and lower rates of care-seeking and treatment adherence. However, differences in care cascade performance were less consistent and more limited than those in disease burden and risk factors.

The study cautions that biological sex is not the sole driver of these differences—social norms, health system structures, geography, and policies also play a substantial role. Limitations include incomplete datasets for many conditions and countries, underrepresentation of non-binary individuals and marginalized populations, and inconsistent definitions across surveys.

Researchers call for more comprehensive and standardized global data, disaggregated by age, sex, and other intersectional factors such as income, location, ethnicity, and disability. Without such data, the ability to design gender-responsive interventions is limited.

Ultimately, the study underscores the need for inclusive, intersectional data to develop more equitable health policies and interventions worldwide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study shows the connection between language disorders and handedness","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Study-shows-the-connection-between-language-disorders-and-handedness.aspx","Mon, 05 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Linguistic symptoms and an onset early in life: Disorders to which this applies are frequently associated with left-handedness resp. mixed-handedness.

The fact that left-handedness resp. mixed-handedness are strikingly common in patients with certain neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders is a frequently reported observation in medical practice. The reason why handedness is associated with these disorders is probably because both are affected by processes in early brain development. Various studies have explored this link for individual disorders and have sometimes been able to show it, and sometimes not. A meta-analysis carried out by an international research team from Bochum, Hamburg, Nijmegen and Athens shows that left and mixed-handedness is particularly common in people who suffer from a disorder that manifests itself early in life and is associated with linguistic symptoms. These include dyslexia, schizophrenia and autism. They published their findings in the journal Psychological Bulletin on May, 2, 2025.

The research team re-evaluated existing meta-analyses from a new perspective.

We suspected that left- and mixed- handedness could be associated with disorders whose symptoms are related to language. Language, like handedness, has a very one-sided location in the brain, so it stands to reason that the development of both and their disorders could be linked.""

Dr. Julian Packheiser, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Ruhr University Bochum

The researchers also suspected that left-handedness and mixed-handedness could be associated with diseases that occur very early in life. This is because handedness is also determined at a very early developmental stage.

""Both hypotheses have been confirmed,"" says Professor Sebastian Ocklenburg from the Medical School Hamburg. For example, left-handedness and mixed-handedness are statistically significantly more common in people with dyslexia - a reading disorder - than in healthy individuals. Autism, which in severe cases is accompanied by communication disorders, and schizophrenia, in which patients sometimes hear voices, are also associated with both linguistic symptoms and a higher incidence of left-handedness and mixed-handedness.

Consistent with the hypothesis, the earlier the symptoms manifest, the more frequent the accumulation of left and mixed- handedness was found to be. ""In people with depression, which on average occurs around the age of 30, we couldn't show any connection,"" points out Julian Packheiser.

The researchers believe this is evidence that handedness and various neuronal developmental disorders are influenced by partially overlapping processes in early brain development.

Announcing a new article publication for Cardiovascular Innovations and Applications journal. This article aimed to identify molecular candidates to serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Integrative bioinformatics analysis was conducted and machine learning was used for key genetic screening. Gene expression profiles at the single-cell level were validated through in vitro experiments.
Betacellulin (BTC) and Kruppel-like transcription factor 15 (KLF15) were identified as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for AAA. Notably, BTC is expressed predominantly in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in AAA, whereas KLF15 is expressed in VSMCs, fibroblasts, and other cell types. RT-qPCR validated a significant decrease in mRNA levels of BTC and KLF15 in VSMCs after angiotensin II administration. All-trans retinal, which interacts with BTC, was identified as a potential drug for AAA treatment. RAD21 might be a common TF driving both BTC and KLF15 expression.
Two biomarkers and a potential therapeutic agent for AAA were identified, thus enhancing understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and offering novel strategies for its clinical management.

Anal cancer has been steadily increasing in the United States, with the biggest jumps among older women, especially white and Hispanic women - a shift that challenges assumptions about high-risk groups and who should be screened, according to a study to be presented today at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2025.

Rates of anal cancer are rising fastest among white and Hispanic women over 65 - groups not traditionally considered high risk. While the exact reasons behind this trend remain unclear, most older women were beyond the recommended age for human papillomavirus vaccination when it first became widely available.""

Ashley Robinson, MD, lead author, second-year internal medicine resident at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital

Human papillomavirus, known as HPV, causes 90% of anal cancers.

Researchers analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, known as SEER, from 2017 to 2021. They found anal cancer increased by 2.9% for women and 1.6% for men. Anal cancers increased fastest among white women over 65, who saw a 4.3% increase during the five-year study period, reaching 11.4 cases per 100,000 in 2021. If the trend continues, the incidence of anal cancer in women over age 65 would double in less than 17 years. 

Hispanic women over age 65 had the second-highest rate of anal cancer, with 7.5 cases per 100,000 people in 2021 and a slower annual increase of 1.7%.

""It's crucial that we promote HPV vaccination as a key tool for preventing anal cancer, while also keeping health care providers informed as screening guidelines evolve,"" Dr. Robinson said. ""These findings highlight specific patient groups who may benefit from targeted screening for anal HPV and anal cancer.""

Still considered rare, anal cancer makes up approximately 1% of all gastrointestinal cancers, with more than 90% of cases linked to chronic HPV infection. While screening for anal HPV, dysplasia and cancer is recommended for high-risk groups - identified as individuals with HIV, bone marrow transplant recipients and other immunocompromised populations - older women addressed in this study are not included.

Robinson will present data from the study, ""Analysis of temporal trends in anal cancer incidence by sex, age, and ethnicity,"" abstract 76, at 8:48 a.m. PDT, Saturday, May 3.

In this interview, Sir Professor Cato T. Laurencin, M.D., Ph.D., K.C.S.L, the 2025 Coulter Lecturer, discusses how he is addressing today's medical challenges using future technology.

My career in science began when I attended Princeton University for college. I had enrolled as a chemical engineering student, though I initially knew little about the field. A mentor, Dr. Ernest Johnson, took me under his wing at an early stage and guided me. While I pursued chemical engineering, I always intended to become a physician. 

While at Princeton, I applied to medical school and began my medical education at Harvard Medical School. However, I soon realized I missed my engineering work, leading me to MIT. There, I met Dr. Robert Langer, a young and brilliant assistant professor. I was deeply inspired by his work and decided to follow in his footsteps. I began working in engineering with Dr. Langer while continuing my medical studies. 

At that point, I navigated between Harvard Medical School and my PhD program at MIT, ultimately completing both around the same time, bridging the two fields.

When I completed my time at Harvard and MIT, I was offered an opportunity to join the faculty at MIT.

I was given a unique opportunity to join the MIT faculty and open my laboratory while simultaneously staying at Harvard for my orthopedic surgery training. I became an orthopedic surgery resident trainee and eventually served as chief resident in orthopedic surgery at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, all while running my laboratory at MIT.

Tissue engineering, as a field, began around 38 years ago. YC Fung is credited with first using the term, while Bob Langer is recognized for significantly expanding the field.

As a clinician, engineer, and scientist, I observed progress being made, but the major breakthroughs in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine had yet to materialize or were happening too slowly.

In analyzing this, I believed we needed to expand our toolkit into areas that might not have seemed directly related but had the potential to contribute. This included developmental biology—studying how organisms like newts or salamanders regenerate limbs—advanced materials, and nanotechnology, which was just beginning to be recognized for its role in regeneration. We also explored new directions in stem cell science, including creating a new class of stem cells. 

Combining all these areas required a convergence approach, integrating insights from different disciplines to generate new knowledge and innovative solutions. Ultimately, my focus as a physician and surgeon has always been on patient impact. At the Cato T. Laurencin Institute at UConn, everything we do is aimed at developing solutions that will directly improve patients' lives.

The traditional, or what I call ""old school,"" approach to collaboration involves individuals from different fields working together while maintaining distinct areas of expertise. We collaborate by bridging our knowledge but not necessarily integrating it deeply. 

In the convergence model, however, scientists actively learn from one another to the point that their expertise overlaps. Your understanding of my field advances to my own level, and I do the same with yours. This mutual growth allows us to integrate knowledge in a way that leads to entirely new discoveries and innovations. 

At my institute, all my graduate students and fellows work across multiple disciplines, becoming experts in several areas and then combining these fields to drive the emerging discipline of regenerative engineering.

Over time, we have made several significant discoveries, and much of the progress in this field has come from maintaining an open mind.

One key example is our work with nanofiber technology. I was introduced to this area when I visited Dr. Frank Ko at Drexel University, who was working at a textile center.

As we explored the field further, I noticed that the architecture of nanofibers resembled collagen, leading me to hypothesize that they could be used for tissue engineering. This led to our publication of the first paper on using polymeric nanofibers for tissue regeneration.

That paper has since been highly cited, with thousands of citations demonstrating its impact on the field.

Nanofiber technology is a prime example of convergence—combining material science, nanotechnology, polymeric materials, and stem cell science to develop new regenerative solutions. Today, thousands of papers focus on polymeric nanofibers, particularly in tissue regeneration.

Another key discovery involves the concept of inductive materials. I was among the first to explore the idea that a material placed in the body could regenerate tissue independently without any additional biological components.

This principle, known as material inductivity, leverages the body's natural ability to heal and regenerate. Initially, many were skeptical, but 20 years later, it has become widely accepted. Our work demonstrated how material inductivity functions both in vitro and in vivo, helping to establish it as a critical tool in regenerative engineering. 

One fascinating finding is that the power of material inductivity appears to increase as we move from smaller to larger animals.

For example, a material implanted for bone regeneration may not be effective in a mouse but could regenerate tissue in a rabbit. As we scale up, the material's ability to induce regeneration strengthens, revealing new clinical application possibilities.

Some of our work suggests the opposite of what might be expected. Rather than growth hormones being more effective in smaller animals, we have found that the material exhibits more powerful inductivity as we move up the biological scale. However, higher amounts are required for some biological factors to achieve regeneration. 

For example, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), which is currently on the market, is naturally present in the body only at picogram levels for regeneration. In contrast, commercial products contain microgram levels—millions of times higher than what is naturally present.

This demonstrates a reverse effect: materials gain inductivity as we move up the biological scale, becoming increasingly powerful in larger organisms compared to biological molecules.

My work as an orthopedic surgeon and chemical engineer focuses on musculoskeletal problems. I am also a sports medicine doctor, so one of the key areas we wanted to address was the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), a crucial stabilizer of the knee. An athlete is sidelined for a year due to a knee injury often because of a torn ACL. 

I started working on this project with my graduate student, James Cooper, who later became a professor and has done outstanding work in this area. Together, we developed a new engineered ligament for ACL regeneration. This was likely the first time a polymer-based ligament system was used to fully regenerate knee tissue. 

I remember receiving a text from my high school chemistry teacher, Mr. Brooks. He told me he saw our work listed in National Geographic's 100 Discoveries That Have Changed the World, where we were ranked number 30.

Our team at the University of Virginia successfully created the Laurencin-Cooper Ligament, which completely regenerated the ACL. This landmark moment demonstrated the power of materials science—showing that we could develop a material system capable of full tissue regeneration. This breakthrough has since inspired a range of technologies and products, some of which are now on the market, leveraging material science to potentiate cell phenotypes for regeneration.

The HEAL Project aims to be completed by 2030. We launched it in 2015 and were fortunate to receive a significant NIH Pioneer Award for limb regeneration. The Pioneer Award supports high-risk, high-reward research. The selection process is rigorous, with thousands applying and only a handful selected after intense evaluation. 

I set the goal for 2030 based on past breakthroughs. When we worked on engineering bone, people doubted us, saying we had only just learned how to grow bone cells, yet we successfully engineered bone in about 12 years. Similarly, we engineered the rotator cuff from scratch in about 10 years. Since engineering a whole limb is more complex, we estimated 15 years as a realistic target. 

This project is like a moonshot. In the early '60s, when President Kennedy announced the goal of landing on the moon, many fundamental questions remained unanswered, yet the challenge inspired innovation that ultimately made it possible. When I was inducted into the Chinese Academy of Engineering, an article in *China News Daily* referred to this as ""Dr. Laurencin's regenerative moonshot,"" which I think is fitting. But as I often remind people—the last time I checked, we did go to the moon. This project offers tremendous hope for the future of regenerative medicine.

We have been working in multiple areas, focusing on joint regeneration. You cannot regenerate a limb without regenerating a joint, so we have spent significant time studying novel approaches to joint tissue regeneration. One promising area involves amnion, a placental product that we have found plays a key role in regeneration, and we have developed systems utilizing it. 

Another breakthrough is developing a new class of stem cells called synthetic artificial stem cells (SASC). Unlike pluripotent stem cells, adult stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells, SASCs are designed to harness the most valuable aspect of stem cells: their secretome, the collection of bioactive factors they release.

We have essentially packaged this regenerative power into a cell-like structure that can be injected into the body. In our animal models, injecting SASCs into joints has successfully stimulated joint regeneration. 

We are also exploring the role of mechanical forces in regeneration. Our latest research—soon to be published—shows that altering the mechanics around a joint can influence its regenerative capacity. This is an exciting finding because it adds another tool to the regenerative engineering toolbox, combining biomechanics, stem cell science, and materials science to push the boundaries of what is possible in limb regeneration.

Mentorship is incredibly important in regenerative engineering. One of the things I always tell students is to actively seek out mentors. Mentorship does not have to come from just one person; it can come from a group of people.  

Looking back on my life, there were key moments when I met the right people and latched onto them. In retrospect, I think one of the most positive things I did was recognizing the power of mentorship. If someone extends a helping hand, take it—do not overthink it, just move forward. I have been fortunate to do that throughout my life, and I always stress its importance to students.

I am truly honored on multiple levels. First, it is the Coulter-endowed lectureship, and I have always respected the Coulter Foundation. They were among the first to recognize that while great science and engineering are important, they are not enough—discoveries need to be translated into real-world impact. 

The Coulter Foundation started funding grants in biomedical engineering that encouraged researchers to patent their work, start companies, and bring their innovations to market. Some universities were not quite ready for this at the time, but they adapted as the funding came in.

Fast-forward to today and most universities recognize that patents, startups, and product development count as valuable academic contributions. The Coulter Foundation and its leadership played a key role in making that shift happen. 

I am also honored to be here at Pittcon, one of the largest gatherings of scientists in the world, with around 25,000 attendees. Being invited as the keynote speaker is a privilege, and I look forward to staying engaged with Pittcon in the future. I am very impressed with the work that is being done here.

First and foremost, the Hartford Engineering A Limb project is significant to me. One of my life's most significant missions is to develop next-generation technology to help people. I am susceptible to the needs of wounded warriors who have lost limbs.

As conflicts evolve, we have seen that while many people tragically lose their lives in war, an increasing number survive but are left with severe disabilities due to IEDs and other explosive devices. We need to create advanced solutions for these individuals. Worldwide, conditions such as diabetic ulcers often lead to amputation, so we are also focused on developing solutions in that area. 

Beyond that, while our work has a clear destination, the journey itself is just as important. For example, our research on tissue regeneration in the knee joint may lead to new treatments for osteoarthritis. We are hopeful that these advancements will significantly impact patient care.

To further translate our discoveries into real-world applications, we have launched Healing Orthopedic Technologies Bone, a company dedicated to developing and commercializing our innovations. We continuously seek new investors to help bring these important technologies to a broader market. Moving forward, our primary focus is to continue advancing this work.

A major study quantifies the global toll of plastic-derived phthalates on cardiovascular health, revealing that chemical exposure from everyday plastics may be silently fueling heart disease across developing regions.

 Study: Phthalate exposure from plastics and cardiovascular disease: global estimates of attributable mortality and years of life lost. Image Credit: Shutterstock AI Generator / Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in the journal eBioMedicine investigates phthalate-attributable cardiovascular mortality throughout the world.

Since 1960, deaths from CVD have declined by 60% following widespread efforts to address various risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, elevated cholesterol, air pollution, smoking, second-hand smoke exposure, and heavy metal exposure. Despite this decline, CVD remains a global health threat that leads to premature and preventable deaths.

In 2019, over 17 million deaths were caused by CVD, which could be attributed to an aging population, emerging environmental risks, and metabolic dysfunction. For example, increased exposure to plastic polymers and their chemical additives increases the risk of developing CVD.

Di-2-ethylhexyphthalate (DEHP) is a class of phthalates commonly used to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. Epidemiological and mechanism-based studies have established the role of phthalates, which have been characterized as antiandrogens and oxidative stressors, in adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Exposure to phthalates and their chemical derivatives leads to increased expression of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptors, which are crucial for lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Previous studies have reported that exposure to these chemicals increases the risk of diabetes, atherosclerosis, weight gain, and CVD mortality.

Humans are exposed to micro- and nano-plastics (MNP) through several different routes. Moreover, one recent study revealed that MNPs can also accumulate phthalates and other chemicals, which may increase the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.

In February 2022, considering the adverse effects of plastic pollution, the United Nations Environment Assembly announced its plans to negotiate an internationally legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.

To support these negotiations, the current study's researchers used existing data on phthalate exposure to develop a global disease burden model that estimates the country-specific burden of CVD mortality linked to DEHP. All countries recognized by the World Bank were considered for the analysis.

This study utilized the World Bank 2018 population data for individuals between 55 and 64 years of age. Cardiovascular mortality rates for each country were obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

Four DEHP metabolites including mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were analyzed. A mixed-effects regression model evaluated phthalate metabolite concentrations over time.

A total of 356,238 deaths due to DEHP exposure were recorded, 98% of which were attributed to plastics. Approximately 13.4% of all CVD deaths worldwide in 2018 were attributed to MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP, and MECPP exposure.

Sensitivity analyses highlighted the range of DEHP-attributable mortality to be between 356,238 and 356,602 deaths. Comparatively, between 349,113 and 349,469 deaths were attributed to plastic production, consumption, and waste in 2008.

Data from 2018 indicated a high variance in DEHP exposure throughout different world regions. Therefore, the effects of DEHP metabolite exposures on CVD outcomes were disproportionately experienced by countries in the Pacific, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East.

Compared to other countries, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries reported higher exposure to DEHP metabolites, particularly MEHP and MEHHP, at a mean concentration of 19.460 μmol/L and 46.107 μmol/L, respectively. Comparatively, Europe experienced the lowest DEHP exposure, with MEHP and MEHHP concentrations of 3.243 μmol/L and 18.413 μmol/L, respectively.

The highest disparity in exposure among different percentiles of the population was observed in Africa and the United States. For example, the highest MECPP concentration of 65.452 μmol/L was reported in African regions.

Approximately 73.1% of all global deaths from DEHP in 2018 occurred in Asia. South Asia and the Middle East experienced the highest mortality due to CVD attributed to DEHP exposure, followed by Latin America, East Asia, the Pacific, Canada, Australia, and Africa.

Phthalate exposure varied significantly between world regions; however, this plastic contaminant was found ubiquitously and contributed to CVD mortality in every region.

Overall, the highest exposure burden of all four DEHP metabolites was reported in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, whereas Europe had the lowest exposure levels. Compared to high-income countries, low—and middle-income countries experience higher DEHP-attributed CV deaths.  

These findings underscore the critical need for enhanced regulatory measures and international cooperation to mitigate the health impacts of phthalates, particularly in regions characterized by high levels of industrialization and plastic consumption.”

New research finds that the fertility rate needed to sustain a population is much higher than once thought, especially when sex ratios or mortality rates shift. This raises important questions for human societies and endangered species.

Study: Threshold fertility for the avoidance of extinction under critical conditions. Image Credit: sogane / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal PLoS ONE, researchers investigated the minimum fertility rate required to prevent the extinction of a sexually reproducing population, accounting for the concept of demographic stochasticity, which is defined as random fluctuations in survival and reproduction.

Their findings indicate that the extinction threshold fertility is significantly higher than the commonly accepted replacement level, usually estimated as 2.1. Under model conditions assuming no mortality and a balanced sex ratio, women may need to have an average of 2.7 children each to avoid extinction. However, this threshold is reduced where the population shows a sex ratio biased towards female children, a factor that may help explain observed increases in female births under stressful conditions.

With many developed countries experiencing fertility crises, total fertility rates (TFRs) are dropping well below the conventional replacement level fertility (RLF) of 2.1 children per woman.

Currently, about two-thirds of the global population lives in regions with sub-replacement fertility, with countries like Japan and South Korea showing extreme declines. In Japan, for example, the population may shrink by 31% per generation if current fertility rates persist.

The RLF is based on low death rates, a balanced sex ratio at birth, and large population sizes, where chance variations in individual births and deaths (demographic stochasticity) are negligible.

However, in small or declining populations, such stochasticity becomes critical. Events such as skewed sex ratios or childhood mortality can significantly affect population sustainability, potentially increasing the true RLF beyond 2.1.

Earlier ecological and demographic studies suggest that random fluctuations can raise the threshold for population survival. Furthermore, a mismatch in sex ratios can lead to fewer mating pairs, exacerbating the decline.

For populations with low survival rates or unbalanced sex ratios, an RLF much higher than 2.1 – sometimes above 3.0 – may be necessary to avoid extinction. Thus, traditional RLF estimates may underestimate the actual fertility required to maintain population stability in modern, low-fertility societies.

The researchers modeled a sexually reproducing population with non-overlapping generations, focusing on the extinction probability of a lineage originating from a single female.

Four key components were incorporated into the model. The first was the fertility rate; the number of children per female was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, representing a random but biologically plausible variation in births. This allowed for a realistic spread in offspring numbers, including a non-trivial chance of having no children.

To model the sex ratio, offspring sex was assigned through a binomial distribution, where each offspring had a probability r of being male and (1–r) of being female. This reflected the natural variation in sex at birth and allowed the study to explore the impact of skewed sex ratios.

To model mortality rates, researchers assumed that male and female children have separate probabilities of dying before reaching reproductive age, accounting for differing mortality rates.

Lineage tracking and extinction evaluation were also included in the model. A branching process was used to simulate reproduction across generations. If any generation fails to produce both sexes, the lineage is considered extinct. This process was iterated many times using simulations, and extinction probabilities were also derived analytically through recurrence relations.

No real-life biological samples were used; the study was purely theoretical and computational, relying on established probability distributions and stochastic processes to model population dynamics under demographic uncertainty.

The study analyzed how the risk of population extinction changes with fertility rates, mortality rates, and sex ratios. It found that a female-biased sex ratio significantly reduces the probability of extinction.

The critical fertility rate (RLF)—the threshold below which extinction is certain—was greater than the usual RLF of 2.1. For example, with an equal sex ratio and no mortality, the critical fertility was about 2.7.

Simulations showed that populations with subcritical fertility (below the critical value) almost always went extinct within 20 generations, though a few rare populations survived and continued growing.

As generations progressed, the proportion of extinct populations approached 100%, especially for lower fertility rates. The risk of extinction was slightly lower for female-biased populations.

Histograms of survival duration confirmed that most populations died out quickly, typically within five generations, although some rare cases lasted longer, especially when fertility was near the critical value. These findings highlight the high extinction risk for small populations, even if average fertility is above the RLF, due to random fluctuations in birth numbers.

This study examined how demographic randomness affects the survival of small populations. It simplified assumptions like non-overlapping generations and a constant fertility rate using a Poisson distribution.

Despite these, the key insight remains robust: populations can go extinct even if they meet the standard RLF of 2.1, especially when small in size. The results show that extinction is almost certain for subcritical fertility levels, with only rare exceptions surviving. This highlights a risk for small or endangered populations and suggests that many family lineages may be statistically likely to go extinct over time.

A female-biased sex ratio can help mitigate this risk, suggesting that such biases seen under stress may serve an adaptive role in enhancing survival. This has been observed in both humans and other mammals

Too much of a good thing? A new study reveals that while healthier gut-friendly diets lower infertility risk, going beyond a certain dietary threshold may reverse the benefit, underscoring the need for balance in nutritional planning.

Study: Association between the dietary index for gut microbiota and female infertility: a cross-sectional study of NHANES 2013–2018. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent study in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers investigated the association between the novel Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota (DI-GM) and female infertility. The study aims to inform future dietary interventions against the condition. It used questionnaire-based approaches to evaluate 3,053 adult women (age = 18–45), 12.12% of whom were revealed to be infertile.

Study findings demonstrated a complex non-linear association between DI-GM scores and infertility. While lower scores generally correlated with higher infertility risk, the analysis revealed an inflection point: above a certain DI-GM score (specifically, a score of 8), the risk of infertility paradoxically increased. These findings suggest that future gut microbiota research and dietary interventions may help address infertility's silent pandemic, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach rather than simply maximizing DI-GM.

Infertility, the medical condition characterized by an individual's inability to achieve a clinical pregnancy even following 12 months of frequent unprotected sex, is a growing global public health concern. Current estimates report that 12.5% of all couples of childbearing age suffer from the condition, with genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors implicated in its incidence. Alarmingly, several health agencies classify infertility as the third most important threat to public health, following cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancers.

“Common etiologies include ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), fallopian tube abnormalities, and immunological disorders.”

Recent research on female infertility has highlighted diet as a potentially modifiable healthy behavior with modulatory impacts. Parallel studies on the gut microbiome suggest a link between gut health and female reproductive diseases. The strong influence of dietary patterns over gut microbiota composition and performance suggests dietary interventions as a non-pharmaceutical weapon in clinicians' arsenals against infertility.

While studies have explored links between general diet/gut microbiota and female reproductive health, the specific relationship between the DI-GM index and female infertility remained unexplored prior to this study.

The present cross-sectional study investigates the association between DI-GM, a newly introduced gut microbiota index developed by Kase et al., and female infertility. Study data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2013–2018) and focused on non-pregnant adult American females (age = 18–45).

Kase et al.'s scoring system was used to compute GI-GM scores using all 14 of the index's food and nutritional components. Participant data were obtained via 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires with DI-GM scores ranging from 0 to 13.

“The DI-GM includes 10 beneficial components (avocado, broccoli, chickpeas, coffee, cranberries, fermented dairy, fiber, green tea, soy, and whole grains) and four unfavorable components (red meat, processed meat, refined grains, and high-fat diets). We averaged the results from two 24-h dietary recall interviews for each participant to calculate the DI-GM scores.”

Female infertility was assessed using questions (n = 2) from the Reproductive Health Questionnaire (RHQ074 and RHQ076). Additional participant data included demographic, lifestyle, health, and reproductive health details alongside records on infections and inflammatory disease. Statistical analyses leveraged weighted linear regression models, chi-square tests, and weighted multivariate logistic regression models.

Of the 29,400 NHANES participants, 14,452 were excluded for being male, 10,625 were excluded for being outside the inclusion age, and 614 were excluded for incomplete information, leaving a final study dataset of 3,053 eligible individuals. Of these, 370 (12.12%) were revealed to be infertile, with infertile participants found to be, on average, older, having a higher body mass index (BMI), married, current smokers, and were more likely to suffer from (or be under treatment for) pelvic diseases or metabolic conditions.

Restricted cubic spline plots for the association between DI-GM and infertility in women. Adjusted for age, ethnicity, education level, PIR, marital status, smoking, drinking, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, menstrual status, PID, birth control pill use, and female hormone use.

DI-GM investigations revealed that infertile participants demonstrated significantly lower DI-GM scores than their fertile counterparts on average. Logistic regression analyses initially suggested a negative association between DI-GM scores and infertility outcomes when treated as a continuous variable or in quartiles. However, RCS analysis further revealed this association to be non-linear. Crucially, a threshold effect analysis identified an inflection point at a DI-GM score of 8. Below this threshold, higher DI-GM scores were associated with a reduced risk of infertility. Conversely, for scores above 8, higher DI-GM scores were unexpectedly associated with an increased risk of infertility.

“Participants with lower DI-GM scores also exhibited higher triglyceride levels and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.05). Additionally, the prevalence of infertility among participants significantly decreased from Q1 to Q4 (p = 0.041), with notably lower rates observed in Q3 and Q4 (11.18 and 11.17%, respectively) than in Q1 and Q2 (16.32 and 16.16%, respectively). These observed variations suggest that the potential association between DI-GM and infertility requires further investigation.”

Subgroup analysis did not alter these findings, with observed relationships remaining robust demonstrated across a spectrum of subgroups.

The present study demonstrates a complex, non-linear relationship between gut microbiota indices (herein DI-GM) and female infertility. While higher DI-GM scores up to a certain point appear protective, very high scores (above 8) were linked to increased risk. This highlights the potential for dietary interventions and future gut microbiota interventions against the rising global concern, emphasizing that achieving a balanced dietary pattern reflected by an optimal DI-GM range, rather than simply maximizing the score, may be key.

“As a new dietary quality index that reflects gut microbiota diversity, further research and interventions using DI-GM could help develop strategies to prevent and reduce the risk of female infertility.”

Supported by CEPI funding of up to $ 1.5 million over three years, researchers at Norway's University of Bergen will maintain an up-to-date overview of every vaccine candidate being developed around the globe for CEPI's priority pathogens as well as other emerging viral threats identified by CEPI. This comprehensive mapping of the infectious disease vaccine pipeline will help CEPI to monitor and evaluate global R&D progress, and to spot gaps and opportunities to enhance its own portfolio of vaccines.

Access to comprehensive data about the global vaccine development landscape is vital to the success of CEPI's mission. This new partnership with the University of Bergen will provide CEPI with greater visibility of the vaccine R&D pipeline around the world and help us to make well-informed choices when selecting and investing in new vaccine candidates and technologies.""

Stig Tollefsen, CEPI's Technical Office Lead 

Prof. Rebecca Cox at the University of Bergen says that ""the recent COVID-19 and influenza pandemics have shown us that our ability to rapidly develop, and deploy vaccines is critical for global health security. As new epidemic threats emerge, understanding where and how to invest in vaccine research and development is vital and we are delighted to partner with CEPI to conduct this important work for future pandemic preparedness.""

The University of Bergen has been spearheading research into influenza and coronavirus vaccines for many years, generating data that inform the global health community. The CEPI-funded research will build upon the existing expertise of the Bergen scientists to expand the mapping of vaccine landscapes for the most relevant pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. The results will be published in open access journals for the benefit of the global scientific community.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide. This study aimed to explore the role of TM6SF2 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD through the gut-liver axis.

The TM6SF2 gut-specific knockout (TM6SF2 GKO) mouse was constructed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. TM6SF2 GKO and wild-type (CON) mice were fed either a HFD or a control diet for 16 weeks to induce MASLD. Blood, liver, and intestinal lipid content, as well as gut microbiota and serum metabolites, were then analyzed.

TM6SF2 GKO mice fed an HFD showed elevated liver and intestinal lipid deposition compared to CON mice. The gut microbiota of HFD-fed TM6SF2 GKO mice exhibited a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio compared to HFD-fed CON mice. The HFD also reduced the diversity and abundance of the microbiota and altered its composition.Aspartate aminotransferase, alanineaminotransferase, and total cholesterol levels were higher in HFD-fed TM6SF2 GKO mice compared to CON mice, while triglyceride levels were lower. Serum metabolite analysis revealed that HFD-fed TM6SF2 GKO mice had an increase in the expression of 17 metabolites (e.g., LPC [18:0/0-0]) and a decrease in 22 metabolites (e.g., benzene sulfate). The differential metabolites of LPC (18:0/0-0) may serve as HFD-fed TM6SF2 serum biomarkers, leading to MASLD exacerbation in GKO mice.

TM6SF2 GKO aggravates liver lipid accumulation and liver injury in MASLD mice. TM6SF2 may play an important role in regulating intestinal flora and the progression of MASLD through the gut-liver axis.

In an interim analysis of an ongoing global trial, semaglutide resolved steatohepatitis in 63% of patients and reduced liver fibrosis, while also promoting weight loss and improving metabolic health in people with advanced fatty liver disease.

In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, a group of researchers assessed the efficacy of semaglutide in resolving steatohepatitis and reducing fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).

Globally, over one billion people are estimated to have some form of fatty liver disease. MASH, a progressive form of fatty liver disease, is marked by liver inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and fibrotic changes. Left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. MASH is also closely tied to conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity.

Despite its rising burden, treatment options remain limited, with only resmetirom having received accelerated FDA approval specifically for MASH with significant fibrosis. While lifestyle modification remains first-line, pharmacological interventions have shown mixed results.

Given the systemic nature of MASH and its links to cardiometabolic disease, new therapies must target both hepatic and metabolic pathways. Further research is essential to evaluate promising interventions.

The present phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted across 253 sites in 37 countries. Adults aged 18 years and older with biopsy-confirmed MASH and liver fibrosis of stage 2 or 3 were enrolled. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at 2.4 milligrams or placebo for an initial 72 weeks as part of a longer 240-week trial designed to assess clinical outcomes.

Stratification was based on the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, fibrosis stage, and geographical region. After an initial dose-escalation period, participants maintained the 2.4-milligram dose unless adverse effects required adjustment.

Liver biopsies were performed at baseline and at week 72 to assess histological changes. Resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis and reduction in fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis were defined as the two co-primary endpoints.

Secondary outcomes included body weight change, composite histological improvement, and change in bodily pain score from the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Noninvasive markers such as liver stiffness, the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score, FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PRO-C3) level, and liver enzyme levels were also monitored.

Efficacy analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle and used reference-based multiple imputation for missing data, with adjustments for multiple comparisons. Safety was evaluated through adverse event reporting and laboratory assessments. An external adjudication committee assessed serious clinical events in a blinded fashion.

This interim analysis included 800 patients, 534 of whom received semaglutide and 266 of whom were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were well balanced, with a mean age of 56 and a mean body mass index of 34.6 kg/m². Approximately 56% of participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and most (68.8%) had stage 3 fibrosis.

The resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 62.9% of participants in the semaglutide group compared to 34.3% in the placebo group (difference: 28.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21.1 to 36.2; P<0.001). Reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis occurred in 36.8% in the semaglutide group versus 22.4% in the placebo group (difference: 14.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 21.3; P<0.001). Both resolution and fibrosis reduction were observed in 32.7% of the semaglutide group and 16.1% of the placebo group.

Weight loss was significantly greater in the semaglutide group, with a mean reduction of 10.5% compared to 2.0% with placebo. Improvement in bodily pain scores did not reach the trial's prespecified threshold for statistical significance. Noninvasive measures also favored semaglutide, with greater reductions in ELF scores and liver stiffness. Specifically, 55.8% of patients in the semaglutide group had a decrease of at least 0.5 in ELF score compared to 25.5% in the placebo group. A 30% or greater reduction in liver stiffness occurred in 52.0% of semaglutide-treated patients versus 30.3% of those on placebo.

Semaglutide also improved markers of metabolic health. Glycated hemoglobin levels, insulin resistance as measured by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipid parameters all showed favorable changes. These histological and metabolic effects were generally consistent across subgroups, including those with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus and regardless of baseline fibrosis stage, age, or sex.

Regarding safety, 86.3% of participants on semaglutide experienced an adverse event compared to 79.7% in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting were more frequent in the semaglutide group but were generally manageable. Serious adverse events occurred at similar rates (13.4%) in both groups, and trial discontinuation due to side effects was low (2.6% vs. 3.3%). No new or unexpected safety signals emerged.

While acknowledging limitations such as the small number of Black participants and lack of data on alcohol consumption biomarkers, this interim analysis demonstrates that once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 milligrams significantly improves liver histology in patients with MASH and moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. In addition to resolving steatohepatitis and reducing fibrosis, semaglutide supports weight loss and improves cardiometabolic markers such as insulin resistance and lipid profiles.

These findings are relevant to a broad population affected by fatty liver disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The safety profile was consistent with known effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide presents a promising, multi-targeted therapeutic option for addressing the hepatic and systemic consequences of MASH, though final conclusions on long-term clinical outcomes await the completion of the full trial.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Understanding the particle drifting effect with Dr. Na Li","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250505/Understanding-the-particle-drifting-effect-with-Dr-Na-Li.aspx","Mon, 05 May 2025 15:01:00 GMT","

In this interview, Prof Na Li explores the mysteries of the particle drifting effect and its practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Only solubilized drugs can be absorbed by the body. However, the poor solubility of many drugs—both currently on the market and those in development—has been a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry.

As formulation scientists, we aim to develop strategies that enhance drug solubility to ensure effective absorption. Without these strategies, taking life-saving drugs would be no different from consuming a piece of brick—there would be no absorption and, consequently, no health benefit.

Yes. While solubility enhancement strategies are powerful, they do not allow for infinite dissolution. Poorly soluble drugs have an upper concentration limit, which we call amorphous solubility. This is essentially the miscibility gap between the drug and water. Even if we dissolve more drugs into the solution, any amount beyond this amorphous solubility will precipitate out as a second phase, usually in the form of amorphous drug nanoparticles. 

Based on Dr. Sugano's work, we already know that particle forms do contribute to absorption.  The key reason is that the unstirred water layer represents a major barrier to the absorption of poorly soluble drugs.

Think of drug absorption like a hiking journey—to reach our destination (absorption), we must cross the unstirred water layer. Even if there is a large population of drug molecules in bulk solution, only a few can naturally diffuse through this barrier.

When small drug nanoparticles or bile micelles are present, they can act as vehicles, carrying large amounts of free drug across the unstirred water layer. These particles effectively drop off the drug molecules right at the intestinal wall, allowing faster and more efficient absorption. This was termed as the particle drifting effect.

We used a biphasic diffusion setup to measure the flux and calculated effective unstirred water layer thickness (inversely proportional to flux). In this setup, we have an aqueous phase where we introduce the drug and the particles, and we measure the appearance of the drug in the organic phase over time. To quantify the particle drifting effect, we used differential equations to derive an expression for the thickness of the unstirred water layer.

We evaluated flux provided by amorphous drug nanoparticles and normalized the data against the flux of the free drug. We analyzed our data by plotting the effective permeability coefficient (which represents drug absorption in the organic phase) against the solubility of the drug composing the nanoparticles. This revealed a strong linear correlation. According to the Whitney-Noyes equation, the dissolution rate of a particle is proportional to the solubility of the drug that makes up the particle.

This suggests that the ""particle drifting effect"" is closely related to dissolution rate. Particles must dissolve first, release the drug at the membrane surface, and then the free drug can be absorbed. For highly soluble drugs like telaprevir, dissolution happens quickly, leading to a higher particle drifting effect. Conversely, for extremely insoluble drugs like anacetrapib, dissolution is much slower, resulting in only a modest permeability enhancement, even when particle size and concentration remain constant.

We created particles of different sizes to examine the impact of particle size on two drugs, atazanavir and anacetrapib. For atazanavir, we saw no noticeable difference in permeation, regardless of particle size.

However, for anacetrapib, smaller particles led to significantly faster permeation compared to larger ones. This is expected, as smaller particles dissolve faster, while larger particles dissolve more slowly.

The difference we observed in these two drugs comes down to the mechanism of the particle drifting effect, which involves two sequential steps: dissolution and permeation. In the case of anacetrapib, which is highly insoluble, dissolution is very slow and becomes the rate-determining step of the overall process. By modifying the particle size, we effectively tune the dissolution rate, which in turn influences the overall reaction rate.

Atazanavir, which has higher solubility, dissolves more readily. In this case, the second step—permeation—becomes the rate-limiting factor. Even if we manipulate particle size, the overall permeation rate remains unchanged because dissolution is no longer the bottleneck. Therefore, particle size has a significant effect on anacetrapib but not on atazanavir.

We observed that the unstirred water layer thickness increases as particle concentration increases. This means that although a higher particle concentration leads to greater permeability enhancement overall, the normalized enhancement per unit concentration decreases. In other words, the permeation process slows down at higher particle concentrations.

To understand this, we revisited the Whitney-Noyes equation. In addition to solubility, the bulk concentration within the unstirred water layer plays a crucial role. The dissolution rate is maximized when the bulk concentration is minimal, allowing for efficient drug release.

When more particles are introduced, the bulk concentration within the unstirred water layer increases, leading to ""non-sink dissolution"". This gradual slowdown in dissolution at higher particle concentrations results in reduced permeation efficiency, which explains the trend we observed in our data.

Bile micelles, endogenous surfactants in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, play a key role in drug absorption and the food effect observed in poorly soluble drugs. We used sodium taurocholate as a model bile system and examined its impact on drug diffusion.

When we measured the unstirred water layer thickness in the presence of bile micelles, we found that for most drugs—danazol, efavirenz, estradiol, and felodipine—the micelle-bound drug either had a similar or thinner unstirred water layer compared to the free drug. This suggests that bile micelles can enhance drug diffusion, sometimes even more effectively than the free drug. 

The effect of bile micelle concentration we observed is the opposite of drug nanoparticles. While increasing particle concentration led to a thicker unstirred water layer and slower permeation, increasing bile micelle concentration reduced the unstirred water layer thickness.

This is likely due to the unique mechanism of bile micelles—they move within the unstirred water layer, dissociate to release free drug molecules, and both the free drug and the micelle can permeate through the membrane. Since the free micelle itself is rapidly absorbed, it shifts the equilibrium toward more drug release into the unstirred water layer, enhancing the particle drifting effect. This explains why bile micelles improve drug absorption at higher concentrations and why the food effect is significant for poorly soluble drugs.

The Trump administration's unprecedented $500 million grant for a broadly protective flu shot has confounded vaccine and pandemic preparedness experts, who said the project was in early stages, relied on old technology, and was just one of more than 200 such efforts.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shifted the money from a pandemic preparedness fund to a vaccine development program led by two scientists whom the administration recently named to senior positions at the National Institutes of Health.

While some experts were pleased that Kennedy had supported any vaccine project, they said the May 1 announcement contravened sound scientific policy, appeared arbitrary, and raised the kinds of questions about conflicts of interest that have dogged many of President Donald Trump's actions.

Focusing vast resources on a single vaccine candidate ""is a little like going to the Kentucky Derby and putting all your money on one horse,"" said William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. ""In science we normally put money on a number of different horses because we can't be entirely sure who's going to win.""

Others were mystified by the decision, since the candidate vaccine uses technology that was largely abandoned in the 1970s and eschews techniques developed in recent decades through funding from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Defense Department.

""This is not a next-generation vaccine,"" said Rick Bright, who led HHS' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, in the first Trump administration. ""It's so last-generation, or first-generation, it's mind-blowing.""

The vaccine is being developed at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases by Jeffery Taubenberger, whom Trump named as acting chief of the institute in late April, and his colleague Matthew Memoli, a critic of U.S. covid-19 policy whom Trump picked to lead the NIH until April 1, when Jay Bhattacharya took office. Bhattacharya named Memoli his principal deputy.

Taubenberger gained fame as an Armed Forces Institute of Pathology scientist in 1997 when his lab sequenced the genome of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, using tissue samples from U.S. troops who died in that plague. He joined the NIH in 2006.

In a May 1 news release, HHS called the Taubenberger-Memoli vaccine initiative ""Generation Gold Standard,"" saying it represented ""a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness."" Bhattacharya said it represented a ""paradigm shift.""

But the NIH vaccine-makers' goal of creating a shot that protects against multiple or all strains of influenza — currently vaccines must be given each year to account for shifts in the virus — is not new.

Then-NIAID Director Anthony Fauci launched a network of academic researchers in pursuit of a broadly protective flu vaccine in 2019. In addition to that NIH-led consortium, more than 200 flu vaccines are under development in the U.S. and other countries.

Many use newer technologies, and some are at more advanced stages of human testing than the Taubenberger vaccine, whose approach appears basically the same as the one used in flu vaccines starting in 1944, Bright said.

In the news release, HHS described the vaccine as ""in advanced trials"" and said it would induce ""robust"" responses and ""long-lasting protection."" But Taubenberger and his colleagues haven't published a complete human study of the vaccine yet. A study showing the vaccine protected mice from the flu appeared in 2022.

For Operation Warp Speed, which led to the creation of the covid vaccine during Trump's first term, government scientists reviewed detailed plans and data from academic and commercial laboratories vying for federal money, said Greg Poland, a flu expert and president of the Atria Health Academy of Science and Medicine. ""If that's happening here, it's opaque to me,"" he said.

When asked what data beyond its press release supported the decision, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon pointed to the agency's one-page statement. Asked whether the decision would curtail funding for the Fauci-created consortium or other universal vaccine approaches, Nixon did not specifically respond. ""Generation Gold Standard is the most promising,"" he said in an email.

Taubenberger did not respond to a request for comment. Nixon and NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine did not respond to requests for an interview with Taubenberger or Memoli.

The HHS statement stressed that by developing the vaccine in-house, the government ""ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest."" While any vaccine would eventually have to be made commercially, NIH involvement through more stages of development could give the government greater influence on any vaccine's eventual price, Schaffner said.

If the mRNA-based covid shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech represented the cutting edge of vaccine technology, applying ultra-sophisticated approaches never before seen in an inoculation, the approach by Taubenberger and Memoli represents a blast from the past.

Their vaccine is made by inactivating influenza viruses with a carcinogenic chemical called beta-propiolactone. Scientists have used the chemical to neutralize viruses since at least the 1950s. This whole-virus inactivation method, mostly using other chemicals, was the standard way to make flu vaccines into the 1970s, when it was modified, partly because whole-virus vaccines caused high fevers or even seizures in children.

The limited published data from the Taubenberger vaccine, from an initial safety trial involving 45 patients, showed no major side effects. The scientists are testing the vaccine as a regular shot and as an intranasal spray with the idea of stopping the virus in the respiratory tract before it causes a broad infection.

""The notion of a universal influenza A pandemic vaccine is a good one,"" said Poland, who called Taubenberger an excellent scientist. But he added: ""I'm not so sure about the platform, and the dollar amount is a puzzler. This vaccine's in very early development.""

Paul Friedrichs, a retired Air Force general who led the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy in President Joe Biden's White House, said that ""giving $500 million upfront with very little data to support it is unlike anything I've ever seen.""

""The technology for developing vaccines has tremendously evolved over many decades,"" Friedrichs said. ""Why would we go back to an approach historically associated with greater or more frequent adverse events?""

The government appeared to be transferring the money for the Taubenberger vaccine development from an existing $1.3 billion vaccine fund at Project NextGen, a mostly covid-focused program at BARDA, Friedrichs said. Most of that money was earmarked to support advanced research on covid and other viral vaccines, including those protecting against emerging diseases.

It is ""very concerning that we're de-emphasizing covid, which we may live to regret,"" Poland said. ""It assumes we won't have a covid variant that escapes the current moderately high levels of covid immunity.""

Nixon said Project NextGen, for which some funds were earmarked for mRNA research, is under review. Kennedy is critical of mRNA vaccines, once claiming, falsely, that they are the deadliest vaccines in history.

Ted Ross, director of global vaccine development at the Cleveland Clinic, said he was ""happy to see them investing in respiratory vaccines, including a universal flu vaccine, with all the programs they've been cutting.""

""But I don't think this is the only approach,"" Ross said. ""Other universal flu vaccines are in progress, and their success and failure are not known yet.""

His team, part of the NIAID-funded flu vaccine consortium, is using artificial intelligence and computer modeling to design vaccines that produce the broadest immunity to influenza, including seasonal and pandemic strains.

As interim director, Memoli oversaw the start of the administration's massive cuts at the NIH, with the elimination of some 800 agency grants worth over $2 billion. More than 1,200 NIH employees have been fired, and many researchers, including Ross, are in limbo.

His lab is close to testing a candidate vaccine on people, Ross said, while waiting to find out about its NIH funding. ""I'm not sure whether my contract is on the chopping block,"" he said.

FRISCO, Texas — The National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted the five members of its 2025 class — Mark Abbott, Chris Armas, Mary Harvey, Carli Lloyd and Nick Rimando — at a ceremony at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.

“We're proud to recognize this year's inductees as true champions of the game whose passion and dedication have helped soccer flourish in the U.S.,” said Djorn Buchholz, executive director of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. “They've made their mark at every level, from the world and national stages to the building blocks of our professional leagues, and their contributions perfectly capture the spirit of the Hall of Fame.”

Lloyd won two Olympic gold medals and two World Cup titles with the U.S. Women's National Team. She was twice named the FIFA Women's World Player of the Year and won the Golden Ball as the best player at the 2015 Women's World Cup.

“There was no greater honor than wearing the red, white and blue,” Lloyd said. “Yes, it was extremely hard. There were countless sacrifices along the way, but every bit of it was worth it, because I loved the game, the lessons I learned, the relationships that I forged and the experiences I gained were more than I ever could imagine.”

Rimando won MLS titles with two different teams. He played 553 games in 20 MLS seasons, from 2000 to 2019, and made 22 appearances for the U.S. between 2002 and 2015.

“I stand here today, not because of the games or the records, but because I never stopped believing through the setbacks, the noise and the rejection,” Rimando said. “If my story says anything, that would be this: You're always more than what they say you are.”

Armas played the first 12 MLS seasons and was named to the MLS postseason Best XI five times. He played in MLS Cup four times, winning once, and he played 66 full internationals for the USMNT between 1998 and 2005.

“People say, ‘Do you love to win or hate to lose?'” Armas said. “I'm not so sure. All I know is that the fire is burning bright, and I learned at a young age that I had to empty my tank in pursuit of that victory.”

Harvey was the goalkeeper on the U.S. team that won the first FIFA Women's World Cup in 1991 and also won a gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games, the first in which women's soccer was included.

“I learned that the National Team is about excellence,” Harvey said. “It's about being the best you can be, the best teammate you can be, and about doing incredible things together. Today, I challenge people on the teams that I manage to develop an awareness about how what they say and what they do impacts everyone around them and their ability to perform.”

Abbott was president and deputy commissioner of Major League Soccer for 10 seasons, from 2013 through 2022, after having been the league's vice president for business affairs. He was an MLS employee throughout the league's first 30 years.

“I had a cool job, and I got to do a lot of cool things, but the thing I always appreciated the most was being a part of a community,” Abbott said. “That community had a common objective of trying to make our league as accessible as it could be.”

Bob Ley, the recipient of the 2025 Colin Jose Media Award, was not able to attend the ceremony because of a knee injury; his presentation is postponed until 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Sentnor reacts after USWNT legend Heath compares her to Messi","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/uswnt/2025/05/05/sentnor-reacts-uswnt-legend-heath-compares-her-to-messi/83456698007/","Mon, 05 May 2025 16:41:31 GMT","

Ally Sentnor said she was ""starstruck"" after hearing one of her idols, Tobin Heath, compare her to none other than Lionel Messi.

Heath made the comparison during ""The Re-CAP Show,"" which she hosts with her partner and Angel City FC forward Christen Press.

""I think she's phenomenal,"" Heath said of the U.S. women's national team and Utah Royals attacker.

""Ally Sentnor is a must-watch. Her rookie season, she was doing things that I haven't seen anyone do in this league, period. We've seen glimpses of it with the U.S. women's national team as well.

""I'm going to say something very strong right now. I have not seen a woman's player that has demonstrated Messi-like qualities. The way that I will describe it is the way that she moves, and especially in the pocket, and her ability to have equal amounts of goals and assists, to me, is a trait that I haven't seen in the women's game.""

Sentnor burst onto the scene in 2024, a year that saw her named a NWSL Rookie of the Year finalist, U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year, and also featured her first senior cap with the USWNT.

The 21-year-old has carried that momentum into 2025, earning several more USWNT caps and scoring a screamer against Colombia on her first start.

Sentnor was asked about Heath's comments following the Royals' 2-0 loss to the North Carolina Courage on Saturday.

""I was a little bit starstruck all day yesterday, I'm not gonna lie,"" Sentnor said, adding that Heath attending the University of North Carolina influenced her own decision to play for the Tar Heels.

""Tobin is a player that I've looked up to for a very, very long time. [She's] one of the reasons I committed to go to North Carolina in the first place, so to have her say those words about me not only gives me confidence in a time where our team isn't doing as well, but just really makes me continue to fight for my dreams and my goals.""

Though she admitted that being compared to Messi may be slight overkill, Sentnor said she wants to impact games in a similar manner to the Argentine legend.

""I will never be Messi,"" Sentnor said. ""I have so much respect for him and I watch him all the time, so I do try to emulate some of my game off of him.

""But I love players like him. Watching some of those Champions League games this week, those players that when they get on the ball, you just kind of hold your breath. You know something really great is going to happen.

""So I want to try to be that player for both my team and for the fans. They deserve to have fun watching. So I want to bring that to the women's game, while also contributing to goals and and wins for this team.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Club World Cup: England manager Thomas Tuchel faces dilemma over releasing players for new Fifa tournament","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg2kqvqpe1o","Mon, 05 May 2025 13:03:44 GMT","

Thomas Tuchel began an 18-month contract with England in January

England head coach Thomas Tuchel faces a dilemma over releasing his players early next month before the Club World Cup.

His side are scheduled to play two games in June - a World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona on 7 June before a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest three days later.

The game at the City Ground on 10 June takes place just four days before the club tournament starts in the USA.

Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header.

Clubs involved in the Fifa event are eager for the Football Association to release players after the Andorra game but, as things stand, it is understood Tuchel is minded to keep his squad together for the Senegal friendly.

The FA is to hold further meetings when its stance regarding Club World Cup players will be confirmed. 

Although in its annual report released last week,, external the FA cited the tournament as a ""significant challenge"" for ""protecting player welfare"" which could also have ""financial implications"".

""These changes have the potential to significantly reduce the downtime available to elite players, affecting their recovery and overall wellbeing,"" the FA report said.

""The introduction of more global competitions risks devaluing traditional domestic tournaments, such as the FA Cup. and may affect the performance of our national teams due to increased player fatigue and reduced time for international squad training.""

In his first meeting with his players since being appointed Gareth Southgate's successor, Tuchel told his players they only have a minimal period working together before next summer's World Cup.

Tuchel and the FA's decision over releasing players could impact as many as 12 players.

Chelsea contingent Cole Palmer, Reece James, Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke could be selected by Tuchel.

Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header.

Captain Harry Kane is at Bayern Munich while Jude Bellingham plays for Real Madrid and fellow midfielder Conor Gallagher for Atletico Madrid.

Should all players remain with the England squad, Chelsea could be the worst hit.

Teams competing at the Club World Cup are required to arrive in the USA no later than three days before their opening tie.

With that in mind, Enzo Maresca's side face a potential Europa Conference League final in Poland on 28 May - three days after the final day of the Premier League season - before joining up for international duty.

Their first game of the Club World Cup is against Leon on 16 June - six days after the clash versus Senegal.

Manchester City's first game of the tournament is on 18 June versus Wydad AC.

Bayern play Auckland City and Atletico face Paris St-Germain on on 15 June while Real are up against Al Hilal on 18 June.

Speaking in March, Tuchel hinted towards his reluctance to do favours for club managers saying: ""I take care of the players. We take care about the schedule. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players now 'hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'.

""We do what's good for us. We monitor them, we are in contact with the clubs, we are in high-level monitoring where the statuses are known and we won't take any unprofessional risks. Because first of all I feel responsible for the players. I don't want the player to be injured.

""So this is where it is and in the end we take care of ourselves and the clubs take care of themselves, and the main focus is taking care of the players.

""I experienced it many, many times in clubs that players from South American countries don't even think about dropping one minute because they want to play for their country, they're proud to play for their country. This is also something that we have to understand and accept.

""I always accepted it as a club manager. I never got involved in line-ups. I never pushed any national coach because I was hoping that my players get picked. I was also hoping that they are proud to play.""

According to MARCA.

Real Madrid are preparing to name current director of football Santiago Solari as interim head coach for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, according to a report from MARCA. The move comes as the club anticipates the departure of current manager Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to leave his role in the coming weeks.

Solari previously managed the first team during the 2018–19 season. Though his tenure was brief, lasting less than a year, the Argentine coach earned respect within the organization for his professionalism and commitment. He later returned to the club in a front-office role and has remained a trusted figure behind the scenes.

According to the report, Solari is expected to return to his executive duties after the tournament, once Real Madrid appoint a permanent successor—most likely Xabi Alonso or Jürgen Klopp.

The Club World Cup has become a significant target for Real Madrid, with over €100 million in prize money at stake. Club officials reportedly see the tournament as both a prestigious opportunity and a valuable financial asset as they look to the future following what's been a disappointing 2024-25 season.

Thomas Tuchel is planning to stick to his promise of avoiding special favours for club managers by keeping England's Club World Cup players for the friendly against Senegal.

England play two games in June, a World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona and a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest's City ground – four days before the Club World Cup kicks off in the United States on June 14.

It had been anticipated that players scheduled to participate in the Club World Cup would be released from Tuchel's squad after the Andorra game, but the German is believed to have been leaning towards keeping them for the entire camp.

A final decision has not yet been made and further planning talks are scheduled. The issue is of particular relevance to Tuchel's former club Chelsea, given they are on course to reach the final of the Europa Conference League and start their Club World Cup campaign two days before Manchester City.

Telegraph Sport understands that Chelsea do not plan to make any special requests for the early release of their players. The club will abide by Tuchel's wishes, which could impact as many as 12 England players with City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Atlético Madrid also competing in the Club World Cup.

Chelsea have four players – Cole Palmer, Reece James, Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke – who could play in the Club World Cup and be selected for England. Phil Foden is one of five City players who are of interest to Tuchel, while Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Conor Gallagher are in line to take part in the Club World Cup for Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid respectively.

Trent Alexander-Arnold, who on Monday announced he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season, is expected to join Bellingham at Real on a free transfer midway through the Club World Cup, although the Spanish club could yet pay a transfer fee to Liverpool to sign him in time for the competition.

Should Tuchel stick to his plan, then Chelsea's England contingent will meet up with their team-mates just five days before their opening Club World Cup game against Leon in Atalanta.

Competing teams at the Club World Cup must arrive in the US no later than three days before their opening tie. Bayern kick off on June 15, Chelsea on June 16 and Real Madrid and City on June 18. The international window runs from June 2 to 10 and the national teams have priority during it.

The schedule for Chelsea's players is particularly busy, with the club on course to compete in the final of the Europa Conference League in Poland on May 28, three days after the final Premier League fixtures.

It remains to be seen whether Chelsea's players would be allowed to meet up with the England squad later than the rest of the squad ahead of the Andorra game, or could still be released ahead of the Senegal game.

But Tuchel made it clear that he does not have time to do club managers favours ahead of next summer's World Cup and has consistently referenced the fact he only has a total of 60 available days with the players ahead of the tournament.

Speaking in March, during his first England camp as manager, Tuchel said: “I take care of the players. We take care about the schedule. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players now ‘hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'.

“We do what's good for us. We monitor them, we are in contact with the clubs, we are in high-level monitoring where the statuses are known and we won't take any unprofessional risks. Because first of all I feel responsible for the players. I don't want the player to be injured.

“So this is where it is and in the end we take care of ourselves and the clubs take care of themselves, and the main focus is taking care of the players.

“I always accepted it as a club manager. I never got involved in line-ups. I never pushed any national coach because I was hoping that my players get picked. I was also hoping that they are proud to play.”

Tuchel did, however, concede that the June international window poses difficulties, saying: “Being a club coach or international coach – the Fifa June window is I think debatable… if it makes sense.

“Not everyone plays a Champions League final or a club final, so there is this awkward period for a player. They have 10 or 14 days' break, then they go to international [in early June].

“They get a little bit of holiday but they think ‘Other players are on holiday, I need to come back. I can't enjoy my two weeks because I need to do individual [work] and then I go suddenly to international camp.' So the June window is not ideal for anyone, especially the players. But it's there. It's Fifa who can maybe align the calendar and find a gap where we put this window somewhere else to open the window for the better of the players.”

He added: “I am just worried about the pause of the players. I am not so concerned about the amount of games they play in total. I am more concerned that they never have a real break of three to four weeks. Maybe they have three weeks' holiday but maybe after five days they play another competition. That's the problem. They should have a minimum three or 3½ weeks of preparation and then it would be better for everyone.”

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss the proposed Club World Cup playoff game between LAFC and Club América to decide who will replace León. (1:33)

A verdict is expected Tuesday in Liga MX club León's legal dispute with FIFA over entry to the Club World Cup in the United States next month.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport is hosting León's appeal Monday which aims to overturn expulsion by FIFA because the club is in the same ownership group as Pachuca, another Liga MX club that qualified for the 32-team tournament that starts June 14.

CAS said Monday it aims to give the urgent verdict of its judges on Tuesday in Lausanne.

Soccer's world body is preparing to replace León with a one-off playoff game between MLS club LAFC and another Liga MX club, América, if CAS rules in its favor.

FIFA rules for the Club World Cup to protect tournament integrity prohibit more than one team having the same owners.

León and Pachuca qualified for the Club World Cup by respectively winning the 2023 and 2024 editions of the continental championship for the North American region, known as Concacaf.

Both clubs owned by Grupo Pachuca were placed in different four-team groups at the tournament draw hosted by FIFA in Miami in December despite the multi-club ownership issue being unresolved.

León was drawn to play Chelsea in Atlanta on June 16, then Esperance from Tunisia in Nashville and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando.

FIFA judges then excluded León in a ruling in March, deciding that the clubs' ownership structure ""clearly indicates centralized decision-making under a single authority, which is inconsistent with FIFA's principles of competitive integrity and operational independence.""

The entry being fought over by lawyers is worth an initial $9.55 million payment from FIFA plus a share of the $1 billion in total prize money, depending on results in the group stage and knockout rounds.

The Club World Cup lineup includes teams that won a continental championship over a four season period from 2020-24 or who had a high ranking from consistent results in those competitions. FIFA also invited Lionel Messi's Inter Miami  to represent the host nation.

The 32-team Club World Cup is set to begin on June 14, with the final being held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. on July 13.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

By Francisco Quatrin

Inter Milan and FC Barcelona face off this Tuesday in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at the Giuseppe Meazza, with a spot in the Munich final on their minds. Gianni Infantino, the current president of FIFA, has weighed in on the highly anticipated match. Infantino attended the Miami Grand Prix of Formula 1, with the goal of displaying the trophy for the Club World Cup.

When asked whether he preferred Inter or Barça, the Swiss president responded that “everyone knows that I am a fan of Inter Milan,” making his preference very clear. This is not the first time that Infantino has expressed his passion for the team led by Simone Inzaghi, as he has done so on other occasions in the past.

The FIFA president also spoke about Lautaro Martínez and his impact on the Italian team. “Inter is the team of the Argentinians,” he said, referring to the Nerazzurri striker and other players like Javier Zanetti and Diego Milito.

FIFA is on the verge of inaugurating its first major Club World Cup with the participation of 32 clubs who will compete to win a trophy that is intended to be comparable to the most prestigious competition that national teams contest every four years. However, just weeks before a tournament that will be played in the United States between June 14 and July 13, there is currently a 50% chance that the finalists of the Champions League, arguably the competition with the most global appeal at the club level, will not play in this nascent Club World Cup. 

Of the four semi-finalists vying for the Champions League trophy, FC Barcelona and Arsenal are not part of the list of clubs that will fight to be crowned in the Club World Cup. If Barcelona defeats Inter in Milan this week and Arsenal overturns the 0-1 deficit against PSG in Paris, then it would be a given that the European champion would not be in that great tournament that FIFA has activated. This is a major concern for the organization.

Good news for Barcelona: Inter Milan's star player to miss Champions League return match

There are other latent threats for FIFA. Barça has players in its ranks who are gaining worldwide recognition this season. There is the recent example of Pedri González, who, for a Real Madrid legend like Toni Kroos, is already “the best in the world in his position.” Or Raphinha Dias, whom many see as a Ballon d'Or contender thanks to his goals and assists. And, above all, Lamine Yamal, whose global consecration at just 17 years of age has accelerated at a dizzying pace in recent days for his own colleagues, including Erling Haaland, or among soccer legends such as Thierry Henry or Rio Ferdinand. He appears destined for great heights.

All of this uncertainty hangs over the eve of a Club World Cup to which, applying the most basic logic, a Champions League final in Munich between Inter Milan and PSG would be much more beneficial for its peace of mind than one between Barça and Arsenal. A final between two of the biggest and most lucrative brands.

Inter Miami was one of the last clubs to earn a spot in the upcoming Club World Cup… although it was quite controversial, since it was invited by FIFA as a team from the tournament's host country (United States) without meeting any sporting criteria. Sergio Busquets, one of the team's stars, spoke about it at the F1 Grand Prix held this weekend in Miami… and made some statements that surely surprised Inter Miami fans.






“We're not at the level to compete in the Club World Cup”


Sergio Busquets was completely honest about Inter Miami's real chances of making a good impression at the upcoming Club World Cup, where they've been placed in Group A alongside Al Ahly, Palmeiras, and Porto. A group that fans might have gotten excited about, hoping to reach the knockout rounds… until Sergio Busquets crushed expectations.

In an interview with DAZN, Sergio Busquets acknowledged that Inter Miami is far behind the competitive standard of most teams participating in the Club World Cup. “It's clear that we're not at the level to compete in the Club World Cup. But we'll try to compete in the group, take it game by game, fight, and hopefully move on to the next round, although it's going to be tough,” said one of Inter Miami's stars just over a month before the tournament begins.


Mascherano disagrees with Busquets' opinion


Not even the presence of Javier Mascherano stopped Sergio Busquets from being honest with this kind of statement. Despite their recent win over New York Red Bull in MLS, Inter Miami had a disastrous week that ended with their elimination in the ConcaChampions semifinals against Vancouver Whitecaps. In response, Busquets was highly critical after the match.

Javier Mascherano, however, did not share Sergio Busquets' opinion and made that clear in the post-match press conference. “I don't agree with that criticism because Busquets is having a great season and, in my view, he's one of the best players on the team. I have no doubt about that. Talking with him, he feels really good, very happy, and I'd even go as far as to say he wants to keep playing—something he wasn't sure about last year.”

There are plenty of factors from a World Cup that mark its place in history, but few measure up to the theme songs for each tournament. 

The theme songs for each tournament become defining features, used for player walkouts, ads, and television transitions. Their tunes ingrain themselves in viewers' heads throughout the competition, all of course before they become nostalgic throwbacks to past tournaments. 

While a traditional World Cup has one theme and sounds that encapsulate the entire World Cup journey and highlight the host nation, the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico has 17, one for each city and a general theme to bring them under one umbrella. 

To produce the 16 unique compositions, nicknamed ""SonicIDs,"" FIFA partnered with local DJS and artists to create sounds that would resonate with their communities and make the first-ever 48-team World Cup even more historic. 

Here are all the themes fans will become familiar with during next year's tournament, which kicks off on June 11 in Mexico City at the Estadio Azteca. If you missed our ranking of each city's World Cup poster, check that out too. 

Atlanta's World Cup theme saw FIFA team up with Georgia's own Dallas Austin, who is among the several Grammy Award winning artists to bring their talents into the soccer space. 

Known for their world-class music education and musician development, Berklee College brings a unique Bostonian flavor to the city's World Cup theme song for next summer's tournament. 

An audio engineer who has worked with world-famous artists inlcuding , Ed Sheeran, Blake Shelton, Lady Gaga, and Travis Scott, Tre Nagella put his spin on the Dallas World Cup theme. 

A house music producer, Bautista ensured the Guadalajara anthem included horns and echoes, defining features of the music culture in one of Mexico's most vibrant cities. 

A producer local to the Houston arena, Bombón linked up with FIFA to produce a theme highlighting the cities hip hop and R&B culture, while also throwing in a little bit of Latino flare, albeit less than other cities. 

Having sold over two million albums, Kansas City's own Tech N9ne brought a bit more of a vocal vibe to this theme song. 

DJ FLICT brought his techno flair to the theme for Los Angeles, further elevating himself as one of the prominent soccer music producers in the city, having worked closely with LAFC in the past. 

Miami

As much as Pitbull might be Mr. Worldwide, it was Puerto Rico's Mr. Naisgai leading the theme for Miami, a big challenge given their city's status of having Lionel Messi on their local MLS team. 

The Mexican Institute of Sound brought a uniquely Mexican touch to the theme for the city that will host the tournament's opening game, blending the base theme with touches of mariachi in a project led by Camilo Lara, who has worked on several films including Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. 

How do you create a single theme to unify a city that has split soccer allegiances between Tigres UANL and CF Monterrey? It wasn't an easy task for Toy Selectah, but he delivered with a funky mashup for Monterrey. 

Hosting the World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, New York/New Jersey had a defining and critical theme design, and enlisted production company Take A Daytrip with the pressure. While a little closer to the central theme, they certainly added a New York touch.

Once half of the DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince duo with Will Smith, one of the top American DJs stepped in to offer his talents on Philadelphia's World Cup SonicID. 

Dan The Automator made sure San Francisco locals could resonate with the SonicID, bringing in the city's transit chime and adding the fog horn for the Bay Area. 

A native of nearby Brenton, Washington, Sango stepped in to produce Seattle's theme, building on the central beat with Indigenous heritage. However, there was no call-out to Seattle's history with the grunge music genre. 

The only SonicID created by a female music producer, Hill Kourkoutis, Toronto's theme featured the sounds of Toronto's local transit company, while adding in flares of different cultures, representing the city's multicultural residents. 

Grayson Repp was a DJ at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar and brought his experience of the global tournament into his remix. He also added an Indigenous flavor, showcasing the Pacific Northwest identity. 

""Being from Vancouver, my entire DJ history was from Granville Street essentially, so it was nice to come home and make a track for our city, our stadium and our team,"" Repp told CBC Radio. ""I want people to get up and dance and want people to move when they listen to this, because I feel like that's what's been lacking in other tournaments.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Club World Cup: England manager Thomas Tuchel faces dilemma over releasing players for new Fifa tournament","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg2kqvqpe1o","Mon, 05 May 2025 13:03:44 GMT","

Thomas Tuchel began an 18-month contract with England in January

England head coach Thomas Tuchel faces a dilemma over releasing his players early next month before the Club World Cup.

His side are scheduled to play two games in June - a World Cup qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona on 7 June before a friendly against Senegal at Nottingham Forest three days later.

The game at the City Ground on 10 June takes place just four days before the club tournament starts in the USA.

Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header.

Clubs involved in the Fifa event are eager for the Football Association to release players after the Andorra game but, as things stand, it is understood Tuchel is minded to keep his squad together for the Senegal friendly.

The FA is to hold further meetings when its stance regarding Club World Cup players will be confirmed. 

Although in its annual report released last week,, external the FA cited the tournament as a ""significant challenge"" for ""protecting player welfare"" which could also have ""financial implications"".

""These changes have the potential to significantly reduce the downtime available to elite players, affecting their recovery and overall wellbeing,"" the FA report said.

""The introduction of more global competitions risks devaluing traditional domestic tournaments, such as the FA Cup. and may affect the performance of our national teams due to increased player fatigue and reduced time for international squad training.""

In his first meeting with his players since being appointed Gareth Southgate's successor, Tuchel told his players they only have a minimal period working together before next summer's World Cup.

Tuchel and the FA's decision over releasing players could impact as many as 12 players.

Chelsea contingent Cole Palmer, Reece James, Levi Colwill and Noni Madueke could be selected by Tuchel.

Players from Manchester City, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid - who are all involved in the inaugural Club World Cup - could all be selected in Tuchel's squad for the international double-header.

Captain Harry Kane is at Bayern Munich while Jude Bellingham plays for Real Madrid and fellow midfielder Conor Gallagher for Atletico Madrid.

Should all players remain with the England squad, Chelsea could be the worst hit.

Teams competing at the Club World Cup are required to arrive in the USA no later than three days before their opening tie.

With that in mind, Enzo Maresca's side face a potential Europa Conference League final in Poland on 28 May - three days after the final day of the Premier League season - before joining up for international duty.

Their first game of the Club World Cup is against Leon on 16 June - six days after the clash versus Senegal.

Manchester City's first game of the tournament is on 18 June versus Wydad AC.

Bayern play Auckland City and Atletico face Paris St-Germain on on 15 June while Real are up against Al Hilal on 18 June.

Speaking in March, Tuchel hinted towards his reluctance to do favours for club managers saying: ""I take care of the players. We take care about the schedule. But it would be the wrong signal to tell players now 'hey, you have tough [club] matches coming up so I rest you now'.

""We do what's good for us. We monitor them, we are in contact with the clubs, we are in high-level monitoring where the statuses are known and we won't take any unprofessional risks. Because first of all I feel responsible for the players. I don't want the player to be injured.

""So this is where it is and in the end we take care of ourselves and the clubs take care of themselves, and the main focus is taking care of the players.

""I experienced it many, many times in clubs that players from South American countries don't even think about dropping one minute because they want to play for their country, they're proud to play for their country. This is also something that we have to understand and accept.

""I always accepted it as a club manager. I never got involved in line-ups. I never pushed any national coach because I was hoping that my players get picked. I was also hoping that they are proud to play.""

...

Mehdi Taremi will start for Inter Milan against Barcelona if Nerazzurri captain Lautaro Martinez proves unable to.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews.

The big fitness doubt for Inter Milan ahead of tomorrow's Champions League semifinal second leg against Barcelona has concerned Lautaro Martinez.

The Nerazzurri captain had started in the first leg last week.

However, Martinez had to come off at halftime. He was in evident discomfort with his left thigh, and was unable to continue.

Subsequent medical tests confirmed that Martinez had not suffered a serious muscle injury, though. Rather, he had sustained an “elongation” to the flexor muscles in his left thigh.

Therefore, Martinez should be able to return for the second leg. He is already back in training today.

The hope now is that Martinez is able to start tomorrow's semifinal second leg.

The Inter captain is doing absolutely everything to make himself available.

And reports today have been optimistic regarding Martinez's ability to start.

However, the fact that the 27-year-old is still only just coming back from a physical problem means that there is inevitably some doubt.

Therefore, Nerazzurri coach Simone Inzaghi also has an alternative plan in mind.

Iranian international striker Mehdi Taremi was the player who replaced Martinez for the second half of the first leg against Barcelona.

And according to the Corriere, if Martinez is unable to start tomorrow, it will fall to Taremi. The former Porto striker will then lead the line alongside Marcus Thuram.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

There isn't a lot left to play for in the Premier League after Liverpool strolled to the title last week and with three teams already relegated straight back to the Championship. The quest for the top five is bubbling away deliciously and the FA Cup final is appearing over the horizon, but the most life-changing of races have already been run.

The same can't be said for many of the competitions in mainland Europe and beyond, however. While those at home on this side of the English Channel are scrounging for continental qualification, there have been some major storylines unfolding elsewhere. Championships are still to be won in Spain and Italy, while one particular person will have been more pleased than anyone else in the knowledge that Germany's Bundesliga has been wrapped up.

Over in France, the top-four battle is as close as can realistically be at this stage of the season, and across the border in Belgium, a relatively low-key Englishman is making waves for a side chasing their first title in generations. This week's review of Britons abroad also takes us to Asia to check in with a continental champion.

The Reds' academy product has announced his intention leave Merseyside this summer, provoking understandable anger at Anfield

It's finally official, then: Trent Alexander-Arnold is leaving Liverpool, most likely for Real Madrid. Some fans are frustrated, others are fuming; none are surprised, though. It's been coming.

Alexander-Arnold has long been Liverpool's 'Scouser in the team', the local lad whose dream came true. He was both desperate and destined to captain the club he joined at six years of age. However, at some point during the past year or so, something changed. Maybe it was Jurgen Klopp's exit - the impact of which hit Alexander-Arnold even harder than he expected - or maybe he just wanted a fresh challenge.

Bayern Munich were crowned Bundesliga winners on Sunday, ensuring the England captain ended his 'trophy curse' with his first piece of silverware

At last, Harry Kane has got the monkey off his back. No longer is he football's greatest player to never win a trophy. Bayern Munich have wrestled back the Bundesliga title, and their £85 millon English striker led the charge.

Kane's entire career has been about redemption, about proving doubters wrong and making critics eat their words. As detailed in his very emotional piece for The Players' Tribune in 2018, he has been fuelled by rejection from an early age, starting from his release by Arsenal aged eight. ""Looking back on it now, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, because it gave me a drive that wasn't there before,"" he proclaimed of this setback.

The many, many goals Kane has scored down the years have silenced a lot of those naysayers, though without the team silverware to show for his efforts, there would always be more of them. Now, he is free from the shackles of those jibes. His most staunch haters will claim the Bundesliga is a one-team league, but against a Bayer Leverkusen side who went last season unbeaten domestically and having appointed the manager of relegated Burnley, this was far from a cakewalk for Bayern. It doesn't matter either way. These are nuances for the fickle.

Kane's career has a new chapter, and it won't stop at one title. He can now chase down far, far greater accolades. The painful journey to this point at long last led to vindication. This is how the real-life Roy of the Rovers became an all-time great:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The ATP Challenger Tour delivered world-class tennis last week, highlighted by the Open Aix Provence Crédit Agricole. The tournament is one of just six prestigious Challenger 175 events held during the second week of the longer ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, such as Indian Wells, Madrid and Rome.Despite early defeats for Top 50 players Alexei Popyrin from Australia and Italy's Lucian Darderi, the clay-court action in southern France remained of the highest caliber. In the end, there were two big names who faced off in the final: Borna Coric and Stan Wawrinka.After more than three hours of battle, Coric triumphed 6-7 (5), 6-3, 7-6 (4).>>> ATP Challenger Tour coverage on TENNIS.com: **Click here for everything you need to know**“I'm happy to start to play better tennis in the past couple months,” said Coric, who has climbed to No. 84 in the ATP Rankings. “I've been working hard, that's the most important thing for me—and to stay healthy.”The 28-year-old Croatian now holds a 22-3 season record at Challenger level. Between February and March, Coric captured three consecutive ATP Challenger titles and compiled a 16-match winning streak—which was ended by Wawrinka in Naples, Italy. Five weeks later, Coric turned the tables with a hard-fought victory, for just his second win over the 40-year-old Swiss in six encounters across all levels.

The Italian Open men's singles draw has been revealed – with home favourite Jannik Sinner back in action for the first time since his Australian Open triumph.

World No 1 Sinner's three-month suspension for a doping violation ended on Sunday, allowing the Italian to return to competitive tennis on home soil at the Foro Italico this week.

After receiving a round-one bye, the 23-year-old will face either world No 99 Mariano Navone or Italian 17-year-old Federico Cina in his first match back.

However, he could then be in line for tougher tests, with Sinner projected to face 25th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in round three, and 15th seed Frances Tiafoe in round four.

Sinner is then expected to face a quarter-final against sixth seed and newly-crowned Madrid Open champion Casper Ruud, before a semi-final versus fourth seed Taylor Fritz.

Three-time Rome semi-finalist Ruud could face a blockbuster third-round clash against 29th seed Matteo Berrettini, who will hope to be at full fitness on home turf after retiring injured in Madrid.

The Norwegian is also projected to face 12th seed Ben Shelton in the round of 16 before a hypothetical quarter-final against Sinner.

Fourth seed Fritz was a Rome quarter-finalist back in 2024 and could face a tricky opening-match test against Madrid surprise package Gabriel Diallo, who opens against Marcos Giron.

The American is then projected to face 30th seed Hubert Hurkacz in the third round, before a potential fourth-round encounter versus 16th seed Andrey Rublev or 20th seed Jakub Mensik.

Fritz is in the same quarter of the draw as seventh seed Alex de Minaur, who faces a tricky opener against one of two Italians: Luca Nardi or Flavio Cobolli.

The bottom half of the draw is headlined by second seed Alexander Zverev and third seed Carlos Alcaraz, who are projected to meet in the semi-final.

Defending champion Zverev is searching for his third Italian Open title and, after a round-one bye, will start his campaign against a qualifier or Camilo Ugo Carabelli.

The German is projected to face 27th seed Denis Shapovalov in round three, and could face one of 13th seed Arthur Fils or 18th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth round.

Zverev was drawn in the same quarter as eighth seed and home favourite Lorenzo Musetti, who is projected to face 10th seed and 2023 champion Daniil Medvedev in the fourth round.

Alcaraz will be making just his second main-draw appearance in Rome, having withdrawn from the event due to injury in 2024.

The Spaniard will face Jan-Lennard Struff or Yoshihito Nishioka in the second round, and is projected to face 31st seed Alex Michelsen in round three.

World No 3 Alcaraz is then projected to take on 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round, before a projected quarter-final versus fifth seed Jack Draper and semi-final versus third seed Zverev.

New world No 5 and Madrid runner-up Draper could face 32nd seed Sebastian Baez in the third round and ninth seed Holger Rune in the round of 16.

Fresh from claiming his maiden Masters 1000 title, Ruud will start against Roman Safiullin or Alexander Bublik in Rome.

After withdrawing from the Masters 1000 in Madrid, Alcaraz will return to action against Jan-Lennard Struff or Yoshihito Nishioka. The Spaniard sustained an adductor injury during his championship-match run in Barcelona, but will hope to bounce back in Rome, where he is competing for just the second time. Alcaraz is seeded to meet World No. 5 and Madrid runner-up, Jack Draper, in the quarter-finals.



Defending champion Alexander Zverev will begin his campaign against a qualifier or Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli. The second-seeded Zverev saw his seven-match winning streak come to an end in the fourth round in Madrid, where he suffered his third consecutive defeat to Francisco Cerundolo.

Zverev could face Alcaraz in an intriguing semi-final, but the German must first navigate a testing quarter, which includes Lorenzo Musetti, Daniil Medvedev, Arthur Fils and Stefanos Tsitsipas.

Medvedev, who claimed his most recent tour-level title in Rome in 2023, opens against a qualifier or Christopher O'Connell. The 29-year-old could set a meeting with Musetti in the fourth round, who on Monday made his Top 10 debut. Musetti starts against Hamad Medjedovic or a qualifier.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Lorenzo Musetti makes Top 10 debut","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/musetti-top-10-2025-feature","Mon, 05 May 2025 00:54:53 GMT","

Blend a picturesque, classic playing style with modern firepower and you get a tennis superstar who would make even the greatest Italian artists proud. It is that mix that has fuelled Lorenzo Musetti's rise to the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings.


The Italian boasts a textbook one-handed backhand, capable of producing winners from difficult spots, including deep beyond the baseline, outside the doubles alley or off-balance positions. His forehand is just as lethal if not more. Driven by an extreme grip that results in a ball loaded with RPMs, Musetti's forehand kicks up high and forces opponents to hit above their strike zone.


For a player who has consistently been inside the Top 25, Musetti's recent run of form on European clay has featured some of his career-best results, lifting him to No. 9 in Monday's PIF ATP Rankings. He is the third-youngest Italian to break inside the Top 10 — behind Jannik Sinner and former No. 4 Adriano Panatta — and just the sixth overall.




Flashback to the Monte-Carlo semi-finals, when Musetti was overcome with emotion after booking a spot in his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title match and in a memorable moment of raw celebration, the 23-year-old embraced his girlfriend Veronica Confalonieri courtside.


Musetti had just capped back-to-back Top 10 wins to reach the final and it became clear, it was just a short matter of time before he too would join that elite group.


“After Monte-Carlo, something changed in myself, a positive click forward,” Musetti said in Madrid. “That's something I have been waiting for for a long time. I feel more secure on what I have to do on the court.”

Italians in the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings





Musetti has proven to be a threat on all three surfaces. Last year, he was a finalist at The Queen's Club, a grass ATP 500 event. He followed that up with a semi-final showing at Wimbledon, his best result at any Slam. In the past 52 weeks, he has reached at least the semi-finals at nine tour-level events, including the Paris Olympics, where he earned the bronze medal.




A native of Carrara in the Tuscany region, Musetti will receive a hero's welcome this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the ATP Masters 1000 event in his home country. With just 30 points to defend in Rome, Musetti has a prime opportunity to climb even further from his newly earned career high.


Though the spotlight is frequently on Sinner and Musetti, who is just six months younger than the World No. 1, they are just at the forefront of an Italian charge on the ATP Tour.


Nine Italians are featured in the Top 100 and seven of them are 24 years or younger, meaning the country's golden era in men's tennis is just getting started. Last year, Sinner became the first Italian to join the ATP No. 1 Club.


Musetti, a former junior No. 1 who is now a two-time tour-level titlist, is proving he is made for the sport's biggest stages — with a one-hander that would not look out of place in an art museum.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Sinner: 'Very curious to see where I am at'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-rome-2025-preview","Mon, 05 May 2025 15:54:27 GMT","

Jannik Sinner returns to action at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome not with bold predictions, but with quiet curiosity and a sense of purpose.

The 23-year-old Italian is set to compete in his first event since winning the Australian Open in January, after completing a three-month period of ineligibility in a case resolution agreement with WADA. While the anticipation surrounding his return to the capital builds, Sinner, who has never progressed past the quarter-finals at the Italian ATP Masters 1000, is keeping his expectations at a minimum.

“It's a very, very low expectation tournament in general, talking results wise,” said Sinner, who faces Mariano Navone or wild card Federico Cina in his opening match. “For me, what's missing is the complete feedback of where my level is. That's going to come slowly with time. After the first round match, I'm going to have a better picture of myself, where I am at.

“It's very strange feeling again in the beginning to be around so many people and attention. But it's nice to be back, me and my team are very happy.”

Despite his absence from the ATP Tour, Sinner has maintained his spot as the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian, who remains unbeaten in his previous 21 tour-level matches, claims not to have been casting a watchful eye on Tour proceedings as his peers continue to build momentum.
Sinner has, however, been keeping tabs on the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, in which he currently sits at fourth after claiming his third major title at the Australian Open.
“To be honest, I was barely looking at any match, especially in the beginning,” Sinner said of his absence. “Of course I saw the results because it's normal, but the tennis itself, I was not watching as much. I started again from Madrid, trying to study and then trying to understand some of the players which are very interesting to see.
“For me, what's most important is the Race To Turin, which gives you a better picture of how players [are] in that moment. Now I'm happy in the position I am, but I would be happy even if I'm No. 3 or No. 4 in the world, to be honest, I'm just happy to be back here. I'm happy to play again in front of the fans.”

Fans in Rome have been forced to wait 24 months for Sinner's return to the capital after he withdrew from last year's tournament with a hip injury. The 23-year-old was unsurprisingly greeted with raucous cheers as he passed over the bridge at the Foro Italico on his way to Monday's press conference.
Sinner owns a 9-5 record in Rome, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his best result coming in his quarter-final run in 2022, when he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Following the draw ceremony, the Italian is seeded to set a quarter-final clash with Casper Ruud, who is fresh from claiming his maiden Masters 1000 trophy in Madrid.

The 19-time tour-level champion, Sinner will look to quickly build some rhythm as he heads into the remainder of the European clay-court swing.
“[They have been] very long months, but I was glad to share some great moments with my family, with my friends,” said Sinner. “We were practising very hard, especially in the gym in the beginning, coming back to court again.
“It was good, but I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time. The body still has to adjust, the blisters in hands… They didn't come again because you're not used to it anymore, but all good, I'm just very happy, very curious to see where I am at.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","""Sloane Stephens & Venus Williams quietly retiring""","https://www.sportskeeda.com/tennis/news-sloane-stephens-venus-williams-quietly-retiring-fans-left-speculating-duo-s-surprise-french-open-decision-amid-mystery-absence-tour","Mon, 05 May 2025 12:51:00 GMT","

Venus Williams and Sloane Stephens made a surprising entry into the star-studded lineup of broadcasters for TNT Sports' coverage of the French Open. They will join familiar faces Andre Agassi, John McEnroe, Jim Courier, Lindsay Davenport, Chris Evert and Caroline Wozniacki for the network's newly signed 10-year U.S. broadcasting deal with Roland Garros.

The duo has not been active in competitive tennis for a significant amount of time, which has raised speculations among fans of their retirement. Earlier, American tennis icon Serena Williams had made no announcement of a formal retirement but had gradually distanced herself from professional tennis, which is what fans are assuming happened this time around as well with Stephens and her older sister Venus.

A user fueled the discussion on X (formerly Twitter):

Another user came out in support of Sloane Stephens as they assumed the tennis star was possibly taking some time off.

A user joked if Venus Williams was aloof about this arrangement as well, drawing from her previous comment on being unaware of her Indian Wells wildcard entry earlier this year.

Here are some more reactions:

Even though Venus Williams has not clinched a title on the Roland Garros stage throughout her career, the seven-time Grand Slam champion still holds valuable knowledge of the surface that is set to enhance TNT Network's broadcast of the tournament this summer. Having appeared in the tournament 24 times and winning two doubles titles on the surface and being the runner-up in 2002, she is expected to offer insightful assessments.

Along with Andre Agassi, John McEnroe, and now Sloane Stephens, among others, tennis fans are looking forward to this edition of the tournament as they hope the panel's expertise leads to a better viewing experience.

              From Rafael Nadal's masterclasses to Novak Djokovic's rise, the French Open has seen a number of landmark moments in men's tennis. Looking at the top 5 biggest tennis moments in Roland Garros history
            

French Open 2025 is set to start on 25 May, and it will mark the beginning of one of the biggest tennis extravaganzas of the year. Legends like Novak Djokovic will go face-to-face against the top players of the game like Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. (More Tennis News)

With every tennis fan waiting for the event, let's have a look at the top five moments – upsets, dominance, and landmark events – in men's tennis matches at Roland Garros.

Swedish legend Bjorn Borg, widely considered one of the greatest players ever, had a tournament to remember in the 1978 French Open, going on to win the title without dropping a single set and conceding a mere 32 games – a record that still stands to date.

In the final match against clay-court specialist Guillermo Vilas, Borg turned in a masterclass, winning 6-1, 6-1, 6-3, making it one of the best individual tournaments in Roland Garros history.

Rafael Nadal versus Roger Federer is a fixture that has come to define tennis in the last 20 years or so, and the pinnacle of this rivalry came in the 2008 French Open final.

Facing his arch-rival in the final match, Nadal turned in a performance for the ages, dismantling the world No. 1 with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 victory – the most lopsided French Open men's final since 1977.

Federer, appearing in his third consecutive Roland Garros final, looked helpless against Nadal's topspin and court coverage, and the Spaniard went on to win the tournament without dropping a single set and losing only 41 games across seven matches.

The 1991 French Open final match between Andre Agassi and Jim Courier is an event that shaped the future of Roland Garros as well as tennis itself. Courier, a 20-year-old up-and-comer ranked No. 26 in the world, faced No. 4 Agassi in a routine fixture.

It was anything but routine, as Courier, who lost 6-3 in the first set, roared back with a 6-4 win against Agassi, but the former world No. 1 regained supremacy with a 6-2 win.

 What happened next is one of the best comebacks in tennis history, with Courier dominating Agassi with a 6-1 win and going on to win the final set 6-4.

Robin Soderling's 2009 French Open fourth-round win against Rafael Nadal is still considered one of the biggest upsets in tennis history.

On 31 May 2009, Nadal, a four-time defending champion with a 31-match unbeaten streak at Roland Garros, was outplayed by the 23rd-seeded Swede, who won 6-2, 6-7(2), 6-4, 7-6(2).

24-year-old Soderling completely disrupted Nadal's play with his fearless approach and aggressive baseline play, ending the Spaniard's French Open dominance and inadvertently paving the way for Roger Federer to win his first and only Roland Garros title, completing his career Grand Slam.

In the 2021 French Open semi-finals, Novak Djokovic accomplished a feat few thought possible – defeating Rafael Nadal on his beloved Court Philippe Chatrier. In a match that lasted for over four hours, Djokovic prevailed 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-2, handing Nadal only his third loss in 108 matches at Roland Garros.

With this landmark win, the Serbian star not only clinched his second French Open title but also, as per many tennis fans, inherited the “greatest of all time” title from his Spanish opponent.

Coco Gauff's former coach, Brad Gilbert, voices strong disapproval of Iga Swiatek's potential decision to skip Wimbledon this year. The tennis world was taken by storm when reports surfaced suggesting that Swiatek, currently ranked world No. 2, might opt to sit out the remainder of the clay season and potentially miss Wimbledon, only to return around the time of the US Open if her performances in Rome and the French Open don't meet expectations.

The revelation comes hot on the heels of Swiatek's staggering defeat against Gauff in the Madrid semifinals, where the American tennis prodigy dominated with a resounding 6-1, 6-1 victory. Despite their history of encounters favoring Swiatek on clay, Gauff's recent triumph marked her first win over the Polish powerhouse on clay courts in their sixth face-off on the surface.

Gilbert, taking to social media, expressed his dismay at the prospect of Swiatek skipping Wimbledon, asserting, “Not a fan of skipping Wimbledon if healthy.” The tennis community remains divided on whether Swiatek's reported decision is a strategic move or a misstep in her career trajectory.

Following her defeat in Madrid, Swiatek openly admitted her struggles on the court, acknowledging her subpar performance and lackluster movement during the match against Gauff. The 23-year-old player expressed her disappointment, stating, “For sure I feel like I haven't been moving well and, you know, the tennis also was like on and off, you know, for most of the tournament. So I wasn't really sure what I have in my tool box… For sure, like I didn't even have a plan B because nothing was working today.”

As the tennis world eagerly anticipates Swiatek's next moves and Gauff's continued rise in the sport, the looming question of Swiatek's potential absence from Wimbledon lingers, stirring controversy and speculation within the tennis community. Stay tuned for more updates on this gripping saga unfolding in the world of professional tennis.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner is officially back on the ATP Tour seeking further history. The Italian was suspended for three months due to a doping scandal. However, his ban has officially ended on May 4 2025. Now, as he is eligible to play professional tennis again, he is set to make his return at the Rome Masters.

Sinner will be in action in multiple tournaments before Roland Garros, as he also has the Hamburg event on his calendar. The 23-year-old wants to remove all the rust from his game to prepare for the French Open. However, there are many more things that he can achieve in the 2025 season. We boil down three things he can achieve this year after his return.

Initially in his career, Sinner had developed a reputation for being a grass-court specialist. His quick ground strokes proved fundamental on that surface. The signs were there when he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to love in the Wimbledon 2022 quarterfinals. Then, he made his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon in 2023, again losing to the Serb.

However, the dominance he has displayed on the hard court since 2024 has made all of us forget how good he can be on the lawns. In Wimbledon last year, Sinner lost in the quarterfinals to Daniil Medvedev. However, he was battling physical problems and potentially having nightmare situations in his head regarding the doping scandal that was set to surface in a couple of months.

With the doping scandal now behind him, he can look forward to bringing his dominance on the grass courts and winning his first Wimbledon title. He has the Halle Open to defend this season, which can tune him up for SW19.

No one has defended the US Open title since 2008, when Roger Federer defeated Andy Murray to win his fifth consecutive title at Flushing Meadows. Despite Djokovic's dominance on hard courts, the Serb has never been able to defend the title once. He is a four-time champion at the event, winning titles in 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2023. Last year, he lost in the third round to Alexei Popyrin as the defending champion.

Now, the spotlight falls on Sinner. The Italian has not lost a hard-court Grand Slam match since the 2023 US Open. Despite coming from a three-month break, he is still the man to beat on hard courts. Considering how fragile the field is around him, the Italian has the perfect chance to end this streak and join Federer in a historic club.

In this century, only two players have finished successive seasons with the World No. 1 ranking: Federer and Djokovic. Rafael Nadal managed to finish the season as the World No. 1 on five occasions, but never once did it happen in successive seasons. The Spaniard finished at the top of the ATP rankings in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2019.

Sinner has a great chance of joining Federer and Djokovic. The big issue here is that the Italian has a bunch of points to defend, especially after Wimbledon. The 23-year-old is the defending US Open champion and ATP Finals champion. Moreover, he has Masters 1000 titles at Cincinnati and Shanghai to defend as well. Hence, Sinner has his work cut out for him if he wants to accomplish this milestone.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","What Rafael Nadal said was ‘stupid' about his rivalry with Roger Federer after he completed the career Grand Slam","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/features/what-rafael-nadal-said-was-stupid-about-his-rivalry-with-roger-federer-after-he-completed-the-career-grand-slam/","Mon, 05 May 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer played out a thrilling rivalry once upon a time, with the two legends having sadly both retired from tennis.

Nadal has backed Carlos Alcaraz for big success, but the latter has a long way to go if he wants to emulate the former.

The King of Clay retired last year with 22 Grand Slam titles to his name, second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic.

Federer meanwhile sits third in the last with 20, with Pete Sampras the nearest competitor of the Big Three with 14.

Incidentally, the legendary trio of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer have all impressively completed the career Grand Slam.

And Nadal managed to clinch the feat against Djokovic, when the Spaniard beat the Serbian in the 2010 US Open final.

He was asked after the match what he thought he needed to accomplish to put himself ahead of Federer as the greatest ever, with Nadal replying: “Remain a lot of titles, so that's no doubt about that, no?

“I think I am more than happy that with my titles, for sure… I think is talk about if I am better or worse than Roger is stupid, because the titles say he's much better than me, so that's the truth at that moment. I think will be the truth all my life.

“But, sure, for me, always, always Roger was an example, especially because he improved his tennis I think during all his career, and that's a good thing that you can copy, no?

“So I try to copy this, and I know Roger and me are different, much different styles. Being better than Roger, I don't think so is the right moment to talk about that, because I am… I don't think that.”

Nadal bowed out on a high, having proven his worth on all three surfaces at the US Open, with his 2010 title arriving at the age of just 24.

He defeated Djokovic 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 in a final that was interrupted by rain in New York's Flushing Meadows.

It also represented a ninth Grand Slam title, and saw him become the seventh man to win all four major championships, thus completing the career Grand Slam.

But Nadal was pressed further on his clearly exciting rivalry with Federer as the post-match questions continued, having been asked for his thoughts on it and how long he though it would last.

“I don't know,” he replied. “Well, now Novak is, too, but he has to defend a lot of points now in the end of the season now, Novak, too. He is going to have his chance to be the year No. 2, Novak, too. But Roger is there, too, to finish No. 2.

“You know, we start every year, and a lot of new players and good players are there like… well, not new, Novak and Andy are not new, Andy Murray, but always come new players, very good players.

“But for the last six years, Roger and me was… we were No. 1 and No. 2, no? So that's probably a great rivalry since that six years. We will see what happens in the future. I am not a genius.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis World no.1 Jannik Sinner is set for a comeback at the Italian Open on May 5 after serving three-month ban for doping.

In a press conference, ahead of the tournament, Sinner spoke about his complicated relationship with other tennis players during this phase.

“Tennis is an individual sport, everyone has their own team. In Monte Carlo I met Draper and Sonego, we had a great time. At the beginning I had surprising messages from tennis players that I would not have expected to receive. And nothing from those who instead I expected to receive something. Names? I don't want to name them. Everything will be fine, it will pass slowly”.

He also talked about how he has set himself low expectations from his comeback tournament. 

“I have low expectations for this tournament. I've been out for so long and I have no feedback on how I'm going to play.

“The goal will be Paris, I'm not here to beat anyone but to try to get through the first round and then we'll see what can happen. It's difficult for me to start a new tournament and get back to the rhythm. But we're very calm, we're physically and mentally well, we're rested, which will pay off at the end of the season too”.

He also detailed how tough it was for him to handle the ban, especially at its start.

“The hardest moment of the suspension was at the beginning. I couldn't attend any sporting event. I couldn't go to the stadium to watch a football match or follow a cycling race of my friends. But I was happy to spend time with my family”.

Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Sinner is to be honoured alongside his Davis Cup teammates and the Billie Jean King Cup players after Italy swept both of tennis' biggest team titles last year. 

He was scheduled to hold an open practice session later on Campo Centrale that is expected to attract a sold-out crowd of 10,500 spectators. It will be broadcast live on Italian TV. Before the practice session, Sinner is to be honored for the Davis Cup success.

Naomi Osaka has just made career history, with the former WTA Tour number one winning her first-ever title on clay.

Osaka shocked tennis fans by entering the WTA 125 in Saint-Malo, having accepted a wildcard after losing at the Madrid Open.

Former WTA Tour number one Osaka lost her opening match in the Spanish capital, falling to Lucia Bronzetti.

But the four-time Grand Slam champion has bounced back immediately, with Osaka winning the tournament in Saint-Malo.

She was the second seed at the event, and beat Kaja Juvan 6-1, 7-5 in the final for the first WTA 125 title of her career.

It represents her first trophy since 2021 and first since having a child, with Osaka taking to social media shortly after to share her delight.

She wrote on Instagram: “Kinda ironic to win my first trophy back on the surface that I thought was my worst.

“That's one of my favorite things about life though, there's always room to grow and evolve. Thanks to everyone accompanying me on this journey, I know it's turbulent but it's also really fun and I'm grateful.”

A post shared by 大坂なおみ🇭🇹🇯🇵 (@naomiosaka)

Osaka has proven herself to be a real threat on every surface over the years, but she has undoubtedly shone brightest on hard courts.

The 27-year-old icon has four Grand Slam titles to her name so far, with all four having arrived on that surface.

The triumph comes shortly before the clay season rapidly moves on to the likes of the Italian Open and French Open, with Osaka praised by Rennae Stubbs for having played at the lower-level event.

 There has been significant movement in the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings following the Mutua Madrid Open, where Casper Ruud claimed his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown. 

 Ruud, finalist Jack Draper and semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti have all climbed upwards following their performances in the Spanish capital. ATPTour.com looks at the movers in the PIF ATP Rankings as of Monday, 5 May. 



 No. 7 Casper Ruud, +8 
Ruud's title run at the Caja Magica earned the Norwegian a double prize. As well as claiming his maiden Masters 1000 trophy, the 26-year-old also secured his return to the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings after just two weeks away. Ruud, who overcame Jack Draper in a hard-fought final in Madrid, has risen eight spots to No. 7. He will next aim to build on his points tally at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, where he lost his opening match a year ago. 

 

 No. 5 Jack Draper, +1 (Career High) 
Draper charged to his maiden tour-level championship match on clay without dropping a set in Madrid. Although Ruud proved too strong in the title match, the 23-year-old Briton can reflect on another breakthrough moment in his young career. Draper downed Italian trio Matteo Berrettini, Matteo Arnaldi and Musetti in Spain, as well as World No. 12 Tommy Paul, and he has now leapfrogged Novak Djokovic to a career-high World No. 5. 

 No. 9 Lorenzo Musetti, +2 (Career High) 
Musetti's semi-final showing was enough to secure a career high of his own. The Italian backed up his run to the final in Monte-Carlo by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur en route to the last four in Madrid. Now 16-6 for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Musetti has jumped two spots to become a Top 10 player for the first time.

 No. 18 Francisco Cerundolo, +3 (Career High) 
Cerundolo made it back-to-back semi-finals on European clay courts in Madrid.

The 26-year-old Cerundolo has risen three spots to a career-high No. 18. 
 No. 54 Gabriel Diallo, +24 (Career High) 
Big-serving Canadian Diallo enjoyed a breakout run in Madrid, where he reached his maiden Masters 1000 quarter-final as a lucky loser. The 23-year-old defeated Zizou Bergs, Kamil Majchrzak, Cameron Norrie and Grigor Dimitrov in the main draw before falling to Musetti. Diallo has propelled himself 24 spots in the PIF ATP Rankings with his exploits at the Caja Magica.

Borna Coric continued his resurgence on the ATP Challenger Tour Sunday, when he captured a season-leading fourth title at that level.

The Croatian overcame former World No. 3 Stan Wawrinka 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-6(4) and a series of rain delays to win the Open Aix Provence Crédit Agricole after a thrilling three-hour, 11-minute final. 

""I'm happy to start to play better tennis in the past couple months,"" said Coric, who is up to No. 84 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ""I've been working hard, that's the most important thing for me and to stay healthy.""

BORN-A CHAMPION 💪@borna_coric reigns supreme at @OpenduPaysdAix, clinching a tour-leading 4th Challenger title of the season! #ATPChallenger pic.twitter.com/GpDPt7dws4

Coric, 28, holds a 22-3 season record at ATP Challenger level. He won three consecutive titles spanning from February to March and held a 16-match winning streak, which was ended by Wawrinka at the Naples Challenger. Five weeks on from that defeat, Coric outlasted the 40-year-old for just his second win against the Swiss in their six meetings at all levels. 

Wawrinka was bidding to become the oldest Challenger champion in history.



Michelsen wins first clay-court title with dominant week in Estoril
American Alex Michelsen celebrated a milestone moment at the Millennium Estoril Open. The 20-year-old captured his first clay-court title and third Challenger triumph at the Portuguese event, where he did not drop a set all week. 

Michelsen, now tied at his career-high No. 32 in the PIF ATP Rankings, defeated Italian qualifier Andrea Pellegrino 6-4, 6-4 in the championship match.

""My mindset has gotten better on clay since last year. I was kind of dreading it, but now I'm enjoying it,"" Michelsen said. ""I got here super early because I lost first round in Madrid, so I probably had five, six days of preparation before I played, so I had really good preparation this week.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Sinner returns, Alcaraz seeks glory in Rome","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rome-2025-scouting-report","Mon, 05 May 2025 13:50:16 GMT","

The final clay-court ATP Masters 1000 event of the season, the Internazionali BNL d'Italia is set to begin in Rome. The world's best players continue their buildup to Roland Garros with 1,000 PIF ATP Rankings points at stake in the Italian capital.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner returns to action, while Carlos Alcaraz, Madrid champion Casper Ruud and two-time Rome winner Alexander Zverev will also try to secure glory. ATPTour.com looks at 10 things to watch at the tournament.



1) Sinner's return: The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is set to compete for the first time since the Australian Open after completing a three-month period of ineligibility in a case resolution agreement with WADA. The Italian, who won the season's first major, will try to immediately find his rhythm at a tournament where he has never advanced past the quarter-finals. Only one of the 23-year-old's 19 tour-level titles has come on clay (2022 Umag). He will face Federico Cina or Mariano Navone in the second round.

2) Alcaraz back from injury: The Spaniard had found his top level, claiming his first Monte-Carlo crown and then reaching the final on home soil in Barcelona, before he missed the Madrid Masters 1000 event due to an adductor injury. Alcaraz will try to maintain his game at the Foro Italico, where he has only competed once before, in 2023. In that edition, he lost in the third round to Fabian Marozsan. The third seed will take on Yoshihito Nishioka or Jan-Lennard Struff in his opener.

3) Zverev defending champion: The seven-time ATP Masters 1000 champion Zverev has earned two of his seven titles at the level in Rome. Last year, the German lost just one set en route to the trophy. The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings just won his first title of the season in Munich and will try to add another at the Foro Italico, beginning with his opening match against Camilo Ugo Carabelli or a qualifier.

4) Musetti on the Move: One of the breakthrough stars of the 2025 season has been Lorenzo Musetti. As far as the Italians go, all eyes have been on Sinner in the past couple years. But Musetti this year has shown he too is among the very best players in the world. The 23-year-old today cracked the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time, becoming just the sixth Italian since the inception of the rankings in 1973 to do so. He made his first Masters 1000 final last month in Monte-Carlo and will try to improve on his best performance in Rome, having made the Round of 16 in the Italian capital twice.

5) Ruud on a roll: Casper Ruud will be as confident as ever, entering the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on the back of his first Masters 1000 triumph in Madrid. The Norwegian has long excelled on clay, winning 12 of his 13 tour-level titles on the surface and reaching the Roland Garros final twice. He is a three-time semi-finalist in Rome.

6) Draper dialed in: One of the most improved players of the year has been Jack Draper. The British lefty claimed his maiden Masters 1000 crown at Indian Wells and made another final in Madrid, where he pushed Ruud to three sets in a hard-fought final. With his efforts, Draper is second in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, putting himself in great early position to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. He made his debut in Rome last year, falling to former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev in the second round.

7) Medvedev's Clay Haven: Daniil Medvedev has made it no secret that clay is not his favourite surface. That did not prevent him from claiming glory in Rome two years ago, though. He owns an 8-4 record at the tournament, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and will try to improve it against Christopher O'Connell or a qualifier in the second round. 

8) #NextGenATP stars to watch: #NextGenATP players have made their mark throughout the year, with Jakub Mensik lifting the trophy in Miami, Joao Fonseca earning his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires and plenty more. Both men will be in action in Rome, as will 19-year-old lefty Learner Tien and rising Italian Cina. The 18-year-old home favourite made his tour-level debut in Miami, where he ousted Francisco Comesana before falling to Grigor Dimitrov. Fonseca could face the man he defeated at the Australian Open, Andrey Rublev, in the second round.

9) Italian wild cards: Before qualifying is completed, there are 13 Italians in the main draw, including the tournament's five wild cards: Cina, Fabio Fognini, Matteo Gigante, Luca Nardi and Francesco Passaro. Former World No. 9 Fognini made the Rome quarter-finals in 2019 and has played in the main draw or qualifying in the Italian capital 18 times. His first appearance was in 2006, nearly a year before Cina was born.

10) Bolelli/Vavassori home doubles hopes: The top Italian doubles pair is Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori. Will they find a way to triumph on home soil? Last year, when they competed together in Rome for the first time, the Italians reached the semi-finals. The defending champions are Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos, who are fresh off a victory at the Mutua Madrid Open.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Lorenzo Musetti makes Top 10 debut","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/musetti-top-10-2025-feature","Mon, 05 May 2025 00:54:53 GMT","

Blend a picturesque, classic playing style with modern firepower and you get a tennis superstar who would make even the greatest Italian artists proud. It is that mix that has fuelled Lorenzo Musetti's rise to the Top 10 of the PIF ATP Rankings.


The Italian boasts a textbook one-handed backhand, capable of producing winners from difficult spots, including deep beyond the baseline, outside the doubles alley or off-balance positions. His forehand is just as lethal if not more. Driven by an extreme grip that results in a ball loaded with RPMs, Musetti's forehand kicks up high and forces opponents to hit above their strike zone.


For a player who has consistently been inside the Top 25, Musetti's recent run of form on European clay has featured some of his career-best results, lifting him to No. 9 in Monday's PIF ATP Rankings. He is the third-youngest Italian to break inside the Top 10 — behind Jannik Sinner and former No. 4 Adriano Panatta — and just the sixth overall.




Flashback to the Monte-Carlo semi-finals, when Musetti was overcome with emotion after booking a spot in his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title match and in a memorable moment of raw celebration, the 23-year-old embraced his girlfriend Veronica Confalonieri courtside.


Musetti had just capped back-to-back Top 10 wins to reach the final and it became clear, it was just a short matter of time before he too would join that elite group.


“After Monte-Carlo, something changed in myself, a positive click forward,” Musetti said in Madrid. “That's something I have been waiting for for a long time. I feel more secure on what I have to do on the court.”

Italians in the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings





Musetti has proven to be a threat on all three surfaces. Last year, he was a finalist at The Queen's Club, a grass ATP 500 event. He followed that up with a semi-final showing at Wimbledon, his best result at any Slam. In the past 52 weeks, he has reached at least the semi-finals at nine tour-level events, including the Paris Olympics, where he earned the bronze medal.




A native of Carrara in the Tuscany region, Musetti will receive a hero's welcome this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the ATP Masters 1000 event in his home country. With just 30 points to defend in Rome, Musetti has a prime opportunity to climb even further from his newly earned career high.


Though the spotlight is frequently on Sinner and Musetti, who is just six months younger than the World No. 1, they are just at the forefront of an Italian charge on the ATP Tour.


Nine Italians are featured in the Top 100 and seven of them are 24 years or younger, meaning the country's golden era in men's tennis is just getting started. Last year, Sinner became the first Italian to join the ATP No. 1 Club.


Musetti, a former junior No. 1 who is now a two-time tour-level titlist, is proving he is made for the sport's biggest stages — with a one-hander that would not look out of place in an art museum.

ROME, Italy—Jannik Sinner arrived to a smattering of applause ahead of a standing room only pre-tournament press conference at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.The world No. 1 is playing at home for his first tournament since serving a three-month anti-doping ban for two positive tests in 2024, and opened with an apparent eagerness to address a media interest that has only amplified since he was last on court at the Australian Open.Read more: A complete timeline of Jannik Sinner's anti-doping case“There's a lot of attention,” said Sinner, who is competing in Rome for the first time since 2023.“Also, off the court, I was surprised to see some pictures, which, nothing serious,” he added with a laugh, referencing paparazzi photos of him and model Laura Leito last month. “I'm not in a relationship!”Sinner addressed more serious questions about his time away from the game, having served a ban that wouldn't prevent him from competing at any major tournaments in 2025.

Sinner addressed more serious questions about his time away from the game, having served a ban that wouldn't prevent him from competing at any major tournaments in 2025.

“The body still has to adjust,” said the top seed who, following a first-round bye will play his opening-round match against either Mariano Navone or Italian wild card Federico Cinà. “The blisters on the hands, they'll come again when you're not used to it anymore.“But all good. I'm just very happy and very curious to see where I'm at.”Sinner was initially found to bear No Fault or Negligence by the International Tennis Integrity Association (ITIA) for tests, both in and out of competition dating back to the 2024 BNP Paribas Open, that revealed the presence of banned substance Clostebol.At the time, Sinner and his team successfully argued that the substance came into his system from a massage given by physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.

This kind of agreement, I didn't want to do it in the beginning. It was not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened, but sometimes we have to choose the best in a very bad moment. Jannik Sinner

“This kind of agreement, I didn't want to do it in the beginning,” Sinner admitted on Monday. “It was not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened, but sometimes we have to choose the best in a very bad moment.”Sinner's suspension not only kept him from competing at the last four Masters 1000 tournaments, he was further prevented from attending any professional sporting events.“I don't know how many knows this, but for example, to watch a simple match in a football stadium, I couldn't go watch it,” said Sinner. “I wanted to support my friends in cycling or motorsport; I couldn't go there. That, for me, was the toughest part.“But all things considered, I tried to make the best out of it, being ready mentally for the point when I started to play tennis again. It's all fine. I'm very glad to have spent that time with my family.”Sinner went on to speak of the emotional toll of the last 12 months that culminated in his ban, and his low expectations as he officially begins preparations for Roland Garros, the year's second major tournament in Paris.

“For me, look, last year was very difficult. I had a lot of personal pressure, holding everything. I couldn't talk with many people about what happened. I was in a tough situation at the beginning of the Australian Open. I struggled a lot, so it was nice to take a small break. Three months…but it is what it is. A small break was good. I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time.“What's missing for me is the complete feedback of where my level is. That's going to come slowly with time of playing. After the first-round match, I'm going to have a good picture of myself and where I'm at. “Having only just arrived at the Foro Italico about an hour prior, he had yet to meaningfully interact with his fellow players.

Sinner was in good spirits in front of a jam-packed press room at the Foro Italico on Monday.

“Jannik is Jannik,” Rune told Tennis Channel. “He's an amazing player and it was good to share the court with him. He's the best player we have in the world right now. It's nice to be able to test your level, for him also, being away for a while, to test his level against me.“Whatever happened is in the past now. We're over it. I wish him the best for the future.”Despite the time away from court, Sinner managed to retain his No. 1 ranking. He did drop to No. 4 in the Race to Turin, which will determine who competes at the Nitto ATP Finals, a title he won for the first time last year.

“To be honest, I was barely looking at any match, especially at the beginning,” said Sinner. “I wasn't following Indian Wells and Miami. Of course, I saw the results because it's normal, but the tennis itself, I was not watching as much. I started again from Madrid, trying to study and trying to understand some of the players which are very interesting to see.“I couldn't control anything. The new players, new generation is coming stronger and stronger. For me, what's most important is the race to Turin, which gives you a bigger picture of how players play in that moment.

The Mutua Madrid Open is one of the biggest tournaments on the calendar, and every year, once it's over, there are some major storylines on the new rankings—and this year is no different.Let's start at the very top with the world No. 1, Aryna Sabalenka, who won her third title of the year in the Spanish capital.She went into Madrid with 10,768 ranking points, and went from being a runner-up last year (650 points) to the champion this year (1,000 points), meaning she adds 350 points to her ranking—that bumps her up to 11,118 ranking points, which isn't just the first time she's surpassed 11,000 ranking points in her career, but she's only the third woman in the last decade to achieve the feat.WOMEN WITH 11,000+ RANKING POINTS IN THE LAST DECADE (since May 2015):Serena Williams: 20 weeks [2015]Iga Swiatek: 24 weeks [2022, 2023, 2024]Aryna Sabalenka: 1 week so far [2025]Serena's highest points total was 13,161 for three weeks in 2015, while Swiatek's highest was 11,695 for six weeks in 2024.And there's more.With No. 2-ranked Swiatek going from Madrid champion last year (1,000 points) to semifinalist this year (390 points), her ranking points drop from 7,383 to 6,773. That means Sabalenka's lead at No. 1 now grows by almost a thousand points, from 3,385 to 4,345.That's the biggest lead for a woman at No. 1 since the weeks of March 6th and 13th, 2023—during Indian Wells—when Swiatek led then-No. 2 Sabalenka by 4,485 points, 10,585 to 6,100.

Meanwhile, there are some major shake-ups in the Top 10 of the ATP rankings, starting with Jack Draper, who rises from No. 6 to No. 5—his Top 5 debut—after reaching the final in Madrid.Not only is he just the second left-handed man to be ranked in the Top 5 this century, after Rafael Nadal, he's the fourth man born in 2001 or later to reach the Top 5, after Carlos Alcaraz, Holger Rune and Jannik Sinner. He's also the fourth British man to crack the elite after Greg Rusedski, Tim Henman and Andy Murray.A few spots down, Lorenzo Musetti also makes a big breakthrough, rising from No. 11 to No. 9—his Top 10 debut—after reaching the semifinals in Madrid, where he fell to Draper.He's the third man born in 2002 or later to reach the Top 10, after Alcaraz and Rune, and just the sixth Italian man to break into the elite since ATP rankings began in 1973, after Adriano Panatta, Corrado Barazzutti, Fabio Fognini, Matteo Berrettini and Sinner.And finally, a re-breakthrough—just two weeks after dropping out for the first time in over a year, Casper Ruud soars back into the Top 10, cutting his ranking in more than half—from No. 15 to No. 7—after capturing the biggest title of his career in Madrid.

‘We took the tough decision' – Vasseur defends Ferrari team orders situation in Miami as he acknowledges Hamilton's frustration

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was left smiling at the end of a dominant performance by his team, with Oscar Piastri winning the Miami Grand Prix from Lando Norris.

With the team having already bagged a 1-2 in Saturday's Sprint, with Norris the one to come out on top, the pace the papaya squad displayed in the Grand Prix itself had the paddock talking.

Piastri and Norris finished relatively close together with 4.6 seconds between the two team mates, but third-placed George Russell was over 33 seconds behind Norris, while Max Verstappen's Red Bull – that had started on pole – was nearly 40 seconds adrift at the flag.

That gap was by far the most dominant performance of the season from any team, and was gained after both Piastri and Norris had to climb back through the field in the early stages.

2025 Miami Grand Prix: Piastri powers past Verstappen to take the lead

“I'm a little surprised that the gap we had today is as big as we saw,” Stella said after Sunday's Grand Prix. “I thought that we could have had an advantage from a tyre management point of view but I didn't think that the tyre management would lead to this level of gap throughout the race.

“One of the matters that still in Formula 1 looks like it's a little bit of a black art, which is dealing with tyres. I would say especially when it's hot there's another characteristic which I think works very well with our car, which is the cooling system.

“I think when it's hot our car, you can see that is relatively closed from a bodywork point of view because there's been also great engineering going into the cooling system. So, I think in these conditions we see the excellence of the engineering at McLaren has reached a point where it can make a difference to this kind of extent.”

During the early stages of the Miami Grand Prix eventual winner Piastri had to overtake Kimi Antonelli – which he did with relative ease – and Max Verstappen to climb into the lead. Verstappen made him work for the position, but Piastri did find a way through.

Norris had to pass even more cars to get to second after dropping to sixth on the opening lap, with the Briton's bold attempt to get past polesitter Verstappen at the start failing to give him the reward he was after.

The 25-year-old conceded post race that he ""paid the price"" for the move and, with the benefit of hindsight, McLaren's electric pace could have allowed him to lift at that moment and fight back later from a higher position.

McLaren recorded a 1-2 in both the Sprint and the Grand Prix 

On that moment, Stella explained: “Let's say that considering the situation [on Lap 1], it could have been better for Lando to just lift and make sure that he could keep the second position because the car, again with the benefit of hindsight, we see was very fast and he would certainly have passed Max like Oscar and, later Lando, was in the position to do.

“So, I think like every situation in racing, you have to approach with the mindset of reviewing where the opportunities lie, and I think in this case Lando could have been a little bit more patient.

HIGHLIGHTS: Piastri leads McLaren 1-2 after thrilling race in Miami

""But I quite like to see Lando aggressive, going for overtaking the lead of the race and sometimes it's just the matter of a fraction of a second. In this situation the stewards elected that there was no need to intervene but definitely the manoeuvre was quite at the limit.”

As for the moves later in the race, with Verstappen forcing both Piastri and then Norris to try and go around his outside into Turn 1, Stella did admit that Norris lost time in his fight – while Piastri made it past the Dutchman cleanly, Norris needed several goes and even had to give the place back at one point after overtaking off the track.

This was the crucial period of the race where Piastri in free air was able to disappear up the road – leaving Norris too much to do once he did get into second place.

“Concerning the second overtake, the lap time or race time was lost because he needed to give back the position,” elaborated Stella. ""It was fair to give back the position because when overtaking we exceeded the track limits so there's a few things that we need to improve.

“Certainly there are things to improve even from Oscar's side, like if you look back at qualifying I think Oscar lost a little bit of rhythm from Q2 to Q3 so even in that case we have some opportunities. I think both drivers are very open to this kind of review, adapt, make adaptations and go again.”

Seventh and eighth places for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton respectively represented a very disappointing Miami Grand Prix for Ferrari, both cars finishing around a minute behind Oscar Piastri's winning McLaren.

The frustration at the lack of competitiveness probably played a part in a sometimes-fractious exchange between the pit wall and the drivers as Leclerc and Hamilton, on opposing tyre strategies, got in each others' way as they attempted to chase down the sixth-placed Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli.

Max Verstappen admitted that his Miami Grand Prix was “a bit of a struggle” after slipping backwards from pole position to a final result of P4, with the Red Bull man conceding that he lacked paced in comparison to his rivals on a dominant day for McLaren.

Having initially held the lead off the line, Verstappen faced a challenge from Lando Norris in Lap 1 before the Briton went wide, allowing Kimi Antonelli and Oscar Piastri through in the process.

After Piastri had overtaken Antonelli, the Australian then chased down Verstappen and eventually found a way past into P1, with a resurgent Norris soon following through to drop the World Champion down to third.

A Virtual Safety Car period later in the race saw George Russell leapfrog Verstappen for third via a well-timed pit stop for the Mercedes driver and, while Verstappen tried to close in during the latter stages of the race, the Dutchman had to settle for fourth.

Asked after the race if he could take any solace from doing some damage limitation – given the commanding pace displayed by the McLaren cars – Verstappen responded: “Yeah, I mean I had nothing to lose so I just tried to have a bit of fun out there as well at the same time.

“I said yesterday that I would try to do my very best and I think we did that today, but unfortunately [we] just didn't have the pace.

Verstappen admitted that he did not have the pace to keep up with the McLarens

“We were overheating a lot on the tyres, so it was just quite a bit of a struggle out there, and then of course we got a bit unlucky with the VSC as well, but that's racing as well.”

Pushed on whether he was at all surprised by the significant gap to McLaren – with Piastri being a whopping 39 seconds up the road from Verstappen at the finish line – Verstappen suggested that the advantage can ebb and flow depending on the circuit.

“It has been already their strength for a while, so sometimes on a track where the deg is a bit lower of course you might not see it as much, but on a track like this with thermal degradation it's of course bigger,” the 27-year-old explained.

Red Bull have had their protest of George Russell rejected by the Stewards following the Miami Grand Prix, resulting in the Mercedes driver keeping his podium finish ahead of fourth-placed Max Verstappen.

The Milton Keynes outfit submitted a protest earlier alleging that Russell had failed to slow under yellow flags, which if successful could have led to a penalty that would have promoted the Dutchman to P3 as he crossed the line 2.3s behind the Mercedes.

When Ollie Bearman's Haas suffered a likely engine failure and became stranded on track, Russell elected to pit for fresh tyres under the beneficial conditions brought about by the Virtual Safety Car, and he ultimately returned to the track ahead of Verstappen in third.

Later on, when Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto pulled off the road with power unit problems, another Virtual Safety Car was deployed with Verstappen – still behind Russell – asking his team to ""check if George lifted, it was yellow"".

Russell narrowly finished ahead of Verstappen in Miami

Red Bull subsequently launched a protest into the Briton, claiming he failed to slow under yellow flags, following the race but, after the Stewards met with representatives from both teams, they concluded that the matter should be rejected.

Christian Horner, Team Principal of Red Bull, told media prior to the outcome confirmation: ""We felt that Russell has done something that is in breach of the regs as they are written, so that's why we put a protest in today.

READ MORE: Verstappen labels Miami Grand Prix ‘a struggle' after slipping back to P4 as he reflects on gap to McLaren


""More than anything, you want clarity. The regulations say there should be a reduction in speed. It doesn't talk about a lift, it talks about a reduction in speed.

""We very clearly did that, and that is why Max flagged it immediately from what he saw within the cockpit.""

The document explaining the Stewards' decision outlined that Red Bull accepted Russell did lift the throttle, but believed this did not slow him down enough and therefore went against the regulations.

It added that there is no specific wording around whether reducing speed in a yellow flag zone means the ""absolute speed"" or ""the speed relative to the regular racing speed"" in that specific part of the track.

They concluded that Car 63 was ""considerably slower than the regular racing speed"" when the yellow flag was shown, rejecting the protest and labelling it as ""not founded"".

The outcome means that Verstappen stays in P4 for the Miami Grand Prix and is just six points ahead of Russell in the Drivers' Standings.

Oscar Piastri came away from the Miami Grand Prix weekend with the biggest points haul – as well as adding some interesting data to the history books. But he wasn't the only one – here's our round up of the need-to-know numbers from an enthralling race in the United States…

•	Piastri is the first McLaren driver to win three consecutive Grands Prix since Mika Hakkinen (with his first three career wins at Spain 1997, Australia and Brazil 1998).

•	It is Piastri's sixth career victory, and his fourth Grand Prix win this season.

REPORT: Piastri wins from Norris and Russell as McLaren seal commanding 1-2 in Miami Grand Prix

•	Piastri's victory means McLaren have won back-to-back Miami Grands Prix.

•	The Miami Grand Prix maintains its record of never being won from the front row (Piastri started P4).

•	This is Piastri's 32nd consecutive point-scoring weekend, the fourth-longest streak in F1 history.

•	With Lando Norris finishing second, McLaren become the first team to finish one-two in a Sprint and a Grand Prix on the same weekend.

•	It's only the fourth time McLaren have finished 1-2 in a Grand Prix in the last 15 years.

•	The last time McLaren finished 1-2 with everybody else over 30 seconds behind was Monaco 2007, when Fernando Alonso won ahead of team mate Lewis Hamilton, with Felipe Massa 1m 09s behind the winner in third).

Another Grand Prix, another double-points finish for Williams

•	Mercedes' George Russell's P3 was his fourth Grand Prix podium finish this season and matches his total from the entire 2024 season.

•	It was Mercedes' first-ever podium finish in Miami.

•	With P4 for Red Bull, Max Verstappen finished off the podium in the Miami Grand Prix for the first time.

•	Verstappen has finished off the podium three times in the opening six Grands Prix in 2025.

•	With P5, Alex Albon matched his result from the season-opening Australian Gr, his only previous top-six finish since joining Williams at the start of 2022.

RACE START: Verstappen narrowly holds onto the lead in thrilling start to Miami GP

•	With Carlos Sainz in P9, both Williams cars scored points for the second consecutive race.

•	Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli finished sixth for the fourth time in the last five races.

•	With Charles Leclerc their lead driver in P7, Ferrari missed the top five for the first time in Miami Grand Prix history.

•	It was Leclerc's lowest finish since the opening race in Australia.

•	Team mate Lewis Hamilton finished in P8 and only has one top-five finish this season (Bahrain).

A new experience for Oliver Bearman - failing to finish a Grand Prix

•	Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda was tenth, meaning he scored in both the Sprint and the Grand Prix this weekend.

•	Tsunoda finished just 0.168s ahead of Isack Hadjar after taking a five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane.

•	Only five teams scored points, the minimum possible number (McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, Williams, Ferrari).

DRIVER OF THE DAY: Piastri's imperious Miami showing gets your vote

•	Esteban Ocon finished in P12 for Haas – he has finished eighth, ninth, tenth and 12th in his four Miami Grand Prix starts.

•	With Fernando Alonso in P15 and Lance Stroll P16, the Aston Martins were the last classified finishers, nearly 20 seconds behind the next car.

•	Oliver Bearman's DNF in the Haas was his first-ever failure to finish a Grand Prix (in his ninth F1 start).

•	Jack Doohan's DNF at Alpine was the second time he has retired on the opening lap this season (also Australia).

The president posted that Hollywood and other areas are ""being devastated"" due to ""a concerted effort by other Nations,"" which constitutes a ""National Security threat.""



		By Kimberly Nordyke, Aaron Couch 

	May 4, 2025 8:39pm	




	In a move that could shake up the entertainment industry, President Trump says he's directed his administration to put a “100 percent tariff” on any movies coming into the U.S. that were not produced in this country.


	He posted on his Truth Social platform Sunday that he's authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to institute the tariff.




	“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” he wrote. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!

	“Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”


	For years, Hollywood productions have flocked to countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Spain for their tax incentives.


	Talking with C-SPAN on Sunday, Trump was asked about the tariffs, and he briefly expounded upon his post and put some of the blame on California Gov. Gavin Newsom in addition to other countries.


	“What they've done is other nations have been stealing the movies, the moviemaking capabilities from the united States,” he said, adding: “I've done some very strong research over the past week, and we're making very few movies now. Hollywood is being destroyed. Now, you have a…grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen, so I'm not just blaming other nations, but other nations have stolen our movie industry. If they're not willing to make a movie inside the United States, then we should have a tariff on movies that come in. And not only that, governments are actually giving big money. They're supporting them financially. That's sort of a threat to our country in a sense.”


	Asked for comment, a spokesperson in Newsom's office said: “Looks like it's distraction day again in Washington, D.C.”


	Meanwhile, top entertainment execs say this would be devastating for TV and not just movies. “Vancouver is over,” said one source.

	











	The Motion Picture Association has yet to comment.


	There are a number of expensive tentpoles due out in the coming months that filmed overseas. Would they be grandfathered in via a grace period or hit with a tariff? And what would the tariff even look like? This was all unlear.


	The ultra-pricey Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (May 23) was shot all over the world, which is one of the key selling points of the globetrotting franchise, which films overseas for the exotic locales, not the tax credits.


	Lionsgate's John Wick spinoff Ballerina (June 6) filmed in the Czech Republic.


	Disney and 20th Century's Avatar: Fire and Ash (Dec. 19) was made in New Zealand, which has become a production hub over the past 20 years after The Lord of the Rings filmmaker Peter Jackson put it on the map.


	Disney sister company Marvel Studios could also be hit by the tariffs. It recently began filming Avengers: Doomsday (May 1, 2026) in London and plans to film Sony co-production Spider-Man: Brand New Day (July 31, 2026) there this year as well. The U.K. offers generous tax incentives that helped lure production away from Atlanta, where Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame filmed.


	Disney-owned Lucasfilm is also expected to shoot the Ryan Gosling Star Wars: Starfighter (May 28, 2027) in the United Kingdom this year.


	Warner Bros. Discovery's rival comic book brand DC Studios has been beefing up its London presence, filming Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (June 26, 2026) in London.

	











	There's a cottage industry of low-budget, VOD movies that shoot in Eastern European countries such as Romania and Bulgaria for the low labor costs and tax incentives. (Think: anything low budget starring an aging action star.)


	Trump, of course, last month announced a plan to place at least 10 percent tariffs on goods from every country that trades with the U.S. As a result, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropped amid fears of a recession. A week later, he said he was putting a “90-day PAUSE” on most of the tariffs, except those against China. The stock market has since rebounded.

After Trump promised a 100 percent tariff on ""any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,"" industry figures are frantically trying to come to grips with how the proposal could possibly work. 



		By Patrick Brzeski, Scott Roxborough 

	May 5, 2025 3:09am	




	Of course, it was too good to be true. 


	For the first 100 days of Donald Trump‘s second presidency, it looked like the entertainment industry might just escape the huge costs and relentless chaos unleashed by his radical attempts to remake global trade. 




	Entertainment products like movies were exempt from Trump's original “Liberation Day” tariffs because they are classified as services, rather than physical goods. The industry also took some assurance from the fact that film and series, much like big tech, represent one of the United States' strongest trade surpluses, because of how much more Hollywood blockbusters bring in from abroad compared to foreign content's slim earnings within the United States. But in a Sunday night post to Truth Social, the president revealed — in screaming all-caps — that he's targeting the film business next.

	“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump wrote. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” 


	He continued: “Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”


	Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick replied to Trump's statements on X (formerly Twitter) by writing, “We're on it.”


	Jon Voight, whom Trump named one of his “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, is the instigator of the president's sudden interest in film production, according to several sources contacted by THR. The actor and his manager Steven Paul have been taking meetings with leaders of the Hollywood guilds and studios about a proposal to Trump for how to boost U.S. production with a domestic film incentive. So far, the president appears to have interpreted that advice in the punitive language he prefers — tariffs as stick, rather than incentive as carrot.

	











	From the global film industry, the early reaction is a predictable mix of dread and total confusion. 


	“Hollywood is a flagship industry and it was naive to think it wouldn't be impacted by Trump's broader tariff war,” says Henning Molfenter, the former head of film and TV production at Germany's Studio Babelsberg, who has overseen the international shoots of such big-budget U.S. features as the Russo Brothers' Captain America: Civil War and Lana Wachowski's The Matrix Ressurections, as well as Wes Anderson's upcoming feature, The Phoenician Scheme, which will premiere in Cannes. “But it's not clear what will be impacted. Is it just movies, or also streaming series? Is it visual effects, co-productions, international film financing? There's a huge degree of uncertainty.”


	Molfenter echoes a common refrain: “How could this even work?”


	At the risk of sane-washing a policy that may or may not ever come to pass, here are eight key questions the industry will be pondering and considering as potential ammunition to push back against the president's characteristically blunt opening salvo on the film sector.


What films will be hit by tariffs, and will it be retroactive? 


	The studios have been shooting their biggest films overseas for years, both to take advantage of visually stunning foreign locations and generous rebates and tax incentives to lower their production costs. Paramount's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, also heading to Cannes, tapped tax credits in the U.K. and other territories to offset its hefty production budget. Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures' A Minecraft Movie, the biggest blockbuster of 2025, so far, was mostly shot in New Zealand, with some production in Canada. Likewise, James Cameron's Avatar franchise, backed by Disney, shot entirely in New Zealand. Marvel's Avengers: Doomsday recently began production in London. The list goes on.

	











	Would Trump's tariffs apply retroactively to films that have already shot or that have already begun production? If so, the cost to the studios could be enormous. Roughly 45 percent of A Minecraft Movie‘s $875 million global box office haul — the $400 million it made at the U.S. box office — could theoretically be susceptible to Trump's 100 percent tariff. 


	And how will the Trump administration classify movies “produced in foreign lands”? Does including any scene shot outside the U.S. qualify? Does a certain percentage of a film's budget have to come from international production incentives? So far, none of this is clear. 


What about Netflix? 


	Trump's initial social media missives only mentioned “movies,” but many in the industry assume any entertainment tariff would also apply to series production. That would be a huge blow to Netflix and other streamers — Amazon, Disney+, HBO Max — which have been built on a model of leveraging local production across a global subscriber base.  Would Netflix have to pull Squid Game, Money Heist and The Crown from its U.S. service or face tariffs? And how would tariffs even be calculated for the streamers, which offer countless foreign-made titles to U.S. customers? How much of Netflix's U.S.  subscription revenue can be attributed to non-U.S.-produced shows? 


Would a tariff bring production back to the United States? 


	Trump isn't all wrong when he says film production in America “is DYING.” A report last month from FilmLA, the nonprofit group that handles film permits for the city and county, showed shooting in L.A. decreased more than 22 percent over the three-month period from January to March this year. More than a year after the two strikes that brought the U.S. film and TV business to a standstill, production has not returned in force to L.A. While some production has simply moved across state borders — Marvel has filmed many of its biggest titles in Atlanta, taking advantage of the state's 30 percent tax credit — there is no doubt runaway production, to London, to Vancouver, to Budapest, Hungary, and Christchurch, New Zealand — has led to a sharp drop in America-made movies. FilmLA reports production has dropped nearly 40 percent in the past decade, and the most recent report from movie industry research firm ProdPro shows production spending in the U.S. overall was $14.54 billion last year, down 26 percent since 2022.

	











	But would a movie tariff actually bring back film production? The main reason the studios and independents go abroad to shoot is money. Making a film in the U.S., which lacks federal tax incentives of the sort found in the U.K., Europe or Australia, can be 30 to 40 percent more expensive. Add to that the cost of U.S. crews, which are pricier than their international counterparts — thanks in part to the strength of American film and TV unions — and it's unclear whether a tariff would be enough to bring production back home.


	Without a domestic rebate to offset the lost incentives abroad, the increased costs of filmmaking in the U.S. will likely mean that studio movies get smaller — or become more digital, with more volume stage and greenscreen shooting or more use of artificial intelligence (though that could create new problems with the guilds, which have strict restrictions on the use of AI).


	For small and mid-size independent productions, a tariff could simply mean those films don't get made.


How will other countries respond? 


	With Trump's Liberation Day tariffs, many countries had limited recourse for retaliation because the U.S. trade deficit on physical goods in nearly all nations is so enormous. That's not true for entertainment. The U.S. exports nearly three times as much entertainment as it imports, according to the MPA. Figures from the European Audiovisual Observatory, a media industry think tank, show that U.S. films accounted for 71.1 percent of cinema admissions in Europe in 2023, the latest year for which figures are available, with locally made movies making up just over 25 percent of sales. A tit-for-tat tariff response by international governments would jack up the price of U.S. movies abroad, and, for Hollywood, still struggling to recover from a post-COVID box office dip, it could be devastating.

	











What happens to the foreign-language distribution business?


	Buying foreign-language films for the U.S. has always been a tough business. Trump's tariffs could make it nearly impossible. Will the small number of successful international film buyers in the U.S. — Neon, Mubi, Sony Pictures Classics — still afford to buy and release the finest French, German and Japanese films in North America when they will cost twice as much under Trump's tariff? What would it mean for American intellectual life to be effectively walled off from much of the world's finest cinema? 


What about postproduction? 


	In the same way that they have created production incentives to lure film shooting to their shores, many foreign governments offer similar rebates for postproduction work done within their borders. Would Trump's movie tariff also target postproduction work completed outside the U.S.? If so, what would become of the likes of New Zealand's fabled Weta FX and Weta Workshop, Netflix's Scanline VFX (in Canada and Europe) and the U.K.'s Double Negative and Framestore, among others? More than any other sector of the business, post-production has become truly global. Can Trump put an end to that?


Can international co-productions survive? In its ongoing fight for survival, the indie film community has learned to use every tool at its disposal to get its movies made — and more often than not, that has meant shooting abroad for rebates and leveraging foreign grants through co-production arrangements. Brady Corbet's multi-Oscar nominated indie triumph The Brutalist — made for just $9.6 million — probably wouldn't have been possible in its finished form had it not been set up as a Hungarian/U.K./U.S. co-production, taking advantage of multiple tax incentives and production subsidies, and shot in low-cost Budapest. Mid-budget action movies — pretty much every Gerard Butler, Liam Neeson or Jason Statham shoot-'em-up you can think of — rely on budget crews and tax incentives, mainly in Eastern European countries, to make the numbers work. The bulk of new projects being packaged and pitched for the Cannes film market next week involve some form of international co-production or non-U.S. shoot. Has Trump killed the Marche?

	











Will this actually happen? 


	At this point in the Trump show, the famously unpredictable president seems to be following a script as tired as any other long-running, low-brow procedural. How likely is it that Trump's movie tariff will endure in its initial, blunt and far-reaching form, or will it eventually get watered down like many of his other art-of-the-dumb-deal opening gambits? So far, markets seem to be only mildly concerned. Amid a broader slip in stock futures, Disney's stock was down just over 3 percent in pre-market trading, while Netflix was under by 6 percent and Warner Brothers Discovery down about 4 percent.

The administration says it is still intent on ""Making Hollywood Great Again"" though it suggests it will take time for tariff plan to come to fruition.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Although the entertainment business is still grappling with President Donald Trump‘s post suggesting that a tariff on foreign-made films is in the works, the White House said in a clarifying statement Monday that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made.”


	“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai tells The Hollywood Reporter.

	The comment suggests that any further clarity on the tariffs, what form they would take, how they would be implemented, etc. will likely take some time to be revealed. It also suggests that the White House may be exploring what legal avenues it has to pursue them, given the complexities and uncertainties on implementing a tariff on what amounts to a service rather than a physical good.

	Trump announced the tariff on Sunday night, writing that “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” and that a 100% tariff could help solve that problem, ordering the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative to begin exploring options.


	The news instantly reverberated across the industry, with executives, filmmakers and other stakeholders wondering what it meant for their businesses, and how they would work. The announcement instatly created more questions than it did answers, with uncertainty around whether it would apply to TV shows, streaming films, co-productions, or films with some production done in the U.S. and other pieces done abroad.


	Trump has named three “special ambassadors” to Hollywood in actors and filmmakers Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson, and Voight had developed a plan to try and bring more production to the U.S., though it is unclear if tariffs were part of that plan.


	Gibson, meanwhile, is set to begin production on his followup to The Passion of the Christ later this summer in Italy, a film that could be subject to a tariff, should they come to fruition.


	The White House has been concerned that film and TV productions have increasingly shot overseas to take advantage of a lower-paid workforce as well as extensive local tax credits. While many U.S. states have also offered tax credits, some of the overseas options have become too appealing for U.S. studios to ignore.

The creator-star, signing off from his third HBO series, opens up about ending his megachurch comedy, his lessons from relocating to Charleston and what he thinks the movie studios should really be worried about. (Hint: it's not the movies.)


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


	The May 4 series finale of HBO's The Righteous Gemstones marked the end of a grand experiment for its creator and star. Tired of the whiplash that came with shooting his previous series Eastbound & Down and Vice Principals back east, Danny McBride and his wife formally relocated to Charleston, South Carolina, with their two sons in 2017. That's where he wrote, filmed and finished his end of postproduction on all four seasons of the megachurch comedy. 


	“Nobody would ever let us shoot in town,” McBride says of Los Angeles. “We were always just barely given permission to do stuff. And we had to find the rebates. It got to the point where it was like, ‘Why are we living in L.A. just to work in a writers room?' ”

	As California production tanks, it's hard to not look at McBride's move as ahead of its time. The actor and showrunner, who moonlights as a feature screenwriter, has cultivated a creative community in his port city of just 150,000 that's ready to work on whatever project he sells next. Zooming in from his home, batting away cats Chacho and Dr. Ned Biscuits, McBride talks about why he chose to end Gemstones when he did, his illuminating lessons from working with Jason Blum and why he thinks that theaters, not movies, might be the industry's biggest problem.


Seven years in, what are the pros and cons of being so far from the epicenter of the business?


	I was not coming up with a lot of ideas in L.A. I'd get in the car and just be fucking angry the whole time — people cutting me off, it taking an hour to get somewhere. When I'd go back to the South, I'd take these car rides, and my whole mindset was different. It's allowed for so much creative thinking. My worry was that I wouldn't have anybody to talk to about movies, but a lot of my collaborators moved out here, too.


Don't you find that people everywhere want to talk about the entertainment industry?


	Totally. With Land of the Lost, Will Ferrell and I were doing press as we kind of knew that the opening box office looked bad. Will said, “Just try to enjoy the weekend and not pay attention to the numbers.” I went down to Virginia to hang out with my buddies and tune out. And we're in some backwoods bar in the middle of fucking nowhere and these two dudes come up to me like, “Whew, man, you guys are getting your fucking ass kicked this weekend!” That was an eye-opener.

	











Gemstones was the first project you filmed in Charleston after moving there. How did your relationship with the town change?


	When I was a kid growing up in Spotsylvania, Virginia, the movie industry seemed so far away. I used to go with my parents to pay the cable bill because I felt like maybe that was somehow connected to Hollywood. To bring something like this here, to watch people that never had any ambitions of being involved in film get involved, it's one of the things I've loved the most.


One could say that Gemstones caps a trilogy of you lampooning a certain type of man for HBO. Do you see it that way?


	There is a sense with these guys I've played, that they hold on to these old, traditional ideas of masculinity and believe they're owed something. I like to challenge those concepts.


Adam McKay once described your roles this way: “Danny knows he comes off like a guy who, if you cut him off in the parking lot of a Sam's Club, would key your car while you're in there shopping.”


	I'll take it! If that's how McKay perceives me, then he's fucking right. And I will key his car. (Laughs.) Look, I think that's fun. If I can portray a certain type of person, be the butt of the joke, maybe that is an essential piece of my comedy.


Your wife's uncle is Cheech Marin. Did you get any advice, early on?












	My wife [Gia Ruiz] and I started dating in 2002. I had been to a few family Thanksgivings, Easters, and seen Cheech but was too intimidated to say anything. Then it came to the point where I'm making stoner movies, too. I have the confidence to speak to Cheech! And I remember he told me, “Comedians usually get about seven movies. Once everyone knows your moves, they're ready for the next guy.”


And that resonated?


	I think I was on movie five at that point. So I was like, “I better figure this out.” (Laughs.) It's true and has nothing to do with talent. Audiences can only like something for so long, so the goal shouldn't be to always have their attention. But when you have the moment, give 'em what you're there for. So, I made sure that I wasn't going to just show up as a bit character in 30 movies.


Living outside of the L.A.-New York bubble, what do you think Hollywood is getting wrong about the movies it chooses to make?


	In some regard, it's not about finding what the audience wants to see. It's about reestablishing why it's important to go to movies in the first place. In L.A. or New York, you still have these badass movie theaters that have state-of-the-art sound and screens. I'll buy a ticket to a theater around here, and it feels like you're in a halfway house. There'll be movies where I'll go in, see what screen it's on and walk right out because I know that the speaker hums or there's a smell in there.


I have experienced this.












	In these suburban towns, they built all these big 16-screen mega plexes in the late nineties, and now those places, feel like relics of a bygone era. There's six movies playing in there. It feels like you're in the fall of Rome. Even if what's Hollywood is making is good, it's hard to convince people to not watch it in the comfort of their home and their massive TV set when they might go and spend all this money for 30 minutes of commercials and the projectionist to forget to turn the lights off.


You worked on updates of the Halloween and Exorcist franchises. What did you learn from playing with high-stakes IP?


	Working with Jason Blum was eye-opening. We'd have meetings with Universal and his team would be like, “What would you need to see in a trailer to help sell this movie?” Then we'd see if we could incorporate those moments in an organic way. It had always been so backward for me, where we'd make something and marketing is like, “We don't know how to sell this movie.” Having that conversation beforehand can save you a lot of headache and maybe help you define what the movie is.


In 2018, Kanye West famously visited you in Charleston with an idea for you to portray him in a biopic. Is there a postscript to that story?


	After he left, I sent him a text, just a, “Thanks a lot for coming down. I'll put my head on this, see if I can come up with anything.” He wrote back and said that he had a great time and that he'll remember that day forever. And that was the last time we spoke.

	











OK, now for that finale. The Gemstones characters had a tendency to constantly fall back into bad habits. But you left them all having shown some legitimate growth. Was that important to you?


	Every season these characters have a little bit of growth. You assume that they'll be on the right path and you come back the next season, but then they've fallen into other ego traps. For me, growth is important. There is a formula for some comedy where people don't want something different. They just want the same thing every episode because it's comforting. And I appreciate that kind of comedy, but,for me, this was more story driven. If the characters were at the same exact place that they were when the show started in, it wouldn't feel like we had gone on the journey. There had to be growth. And that's part of the reason why I think it's a good time to wrap it up as well. You don't want to keep teaching lessons and then they instantly forget them. It disables your ability to sort of land a true catharsis.


What actor character are you going to miss writing to the most?


	All of them, but I love writing for Keefe (Tony Cavalero). I love writing for Baby Billy (Walton Goggins). Everybody is so much fun. Eastbound was such a singular show. All of the focus was around Kenny. We got to play around with the buddy dynamic on VPs. It's been so fun have this many characters. I'm a father and I'm a husband — so to explore some of those insecurities and the things that I encounter in my life or have witnessed… it's been a great outlet.

	











How old are your kids and what in your body of work have they seen?


	My son is 13, and my daughter is 10. They've seen Kung Fu Panda, Angry Birds, Land of the Lost, and honestly, all of Gemstones. Really, they have. I'll try to not have them see it, but they always end up watching. They like it! And my daughter is actually a lot like Judy (Edi Patterson), so maybe she appreciates seeing herself in there.


Speaking of Edi, you were developing a TV series based on Grady Hendrix's The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires. What's the latest there?


	We haven't gotten much momentum on it. Even at HBO, it's tough making a 30-minute show ensemble that mixes genres. Really difficult. I love that property and would love to do something with it, but I don't know. We worked on it for a bit and we weren't getting the reaction to it that we were wanting. it's sort of floating out there right now.


It's basically Desperate Housewives meets True Blood in Charleston. Doesn't seem like a tough sell.


	Yeah, it's all here. To me, it's a no-brainer. I feel like HBO should just want to go greenlight that now. We should have moved right into shooting the pilot after we wrapped Gemstones. Maybe it's just not what they're looking for right now.


Ok, before we say goodbye to Gemstones, Walton Goggins got thrown a lot of wild material on this show. Did he ever say no to anything?












	You know what? He didn't. I think at this point I've earned his trust, so he was always [in]. And I think the more that Walton can show digital penis, the better.

Sharzer tells The Hollywood Reporter that 'A Simple Podcast' was ""a big reason"" why they ended up doing this sequel, and if it's successful, then a third film is on ""a more accelerated track.""


							By 

	Lexi Carson



A Simple Favor is back — however, it's anything but simple. 


Another Simple Favor, Paul Feig‘s follow-up to the 2018 film, sees the return of Blake Lively as Emily, Anna Kendrick as Stephanie and Henry Golding as Sean, and follows their lives when Emily is released from prison after murdering her twin sister. The next adventure shows them reuniting in Capri to attend Emily's wedding, where she marries a new man, Dante, who is part of an Italian mob.




	But to no surprise, not everything goes smoothly, as there are even more twists in this sequel. [Major spoilers from Another Simple Favor.] It's revealed that Emily's triplet, Charity, who is believed to have died during childbirth, is on a murder spree, killing Dante — as well as Emily's ex-husband, Sean. She also has an obsession with Emily — which she tries to turn incestual — as she thinks they are one. Jessica Sharzer, who was a co-writer along with Laeta Kalogridis, told The Hollywood Reporter that the decision was made to embrace the “gay following” that the first film had and “to tell really great stories that also have a queer element to them.”

	The film, which hit streaming on May 1, marks Lively's first release since the ongoing legal battle heated up in December with It Ends With Us star-director Justin Baldoni. Sharzer says the drama surrounding Lively hasn't affected her relationship with the film, though she admits: “I feel for what she's going through right now.” Instead, Sharzer hopes people will “focus on what's in the movie and not all of the extra stuff.” Up next, Sharzer is working on She Started It, an adaptation of Sian Gilbert's thriller novel, which she is set to direct for Lyrical Media, Ryder Picture Company.


	Below, Sharzer tells THR about the “twisted” love story between Emily and Stephanie, how her contracting COVID-19 inspired one of the scenes, Lively's influence on the project and reveals that there have already been talks for a third film.


	***


Was it always the plan to do a sequel for this film? Or did you have any idea that the story would expand when you were working on the first one?


	It was actually the opposite. We never expected there to be a sequel. We certainly didn't plan for one, and if we had, we would've ended the first movie differently because we left one of our characters in jail for murder. So, figuring out how to handle undoing was the first challenge. There was no second book in the series, and we thought it was a one-off movie. Then, the success of the movie and its continued success on streaming were what led to the idea of a sequel.

	











When you were writing this film, were you writing it for a theatrical release or streaming — and did that change how you approached the script?


	We always knew it was a streaming movie. We sold it directly to Amazon, and Amazon wanted it for their platform. So that was never a question. And as far as how it impacted the way I wrote, it didn't change my process at all. It's a really visual movie. It's a big-screen movie, whether you're watching it on a TV or not. Paul really wanted that visual panache and that big world-building that you see in the movie.


There are so many great additions to the cast, such as Allison Janney. Did you have anyone in mind for the roles you could envision when writing it?


	For sure. I have to admit, I watched 365 Days, and as soon as I saw Michele Morrone, I thought he has to be our male lead, and I'm so glad it worked out that he wanted to do it. So, I always write with actors in mind. We don't always end up with those actors, and of course, it's the director's decision who's in the movie anyway, but for me as a writer, it really helps me to imagine actors as I'm writing just to get the cadence and the voice and the personality. It really helps my writing.


Emily's lines are so witty, and she's so quick. I'm curious if Blake Lively's real-life sense of humor inspires any of her dialogue?


	Definitely, I mean, she's funny. She's married to a very funny man [Ryan Reynolds], and I think they help each other with all of their projects. And so it's a really collaborative process because Paul Feig is also a writer, in addition to being a great director, and Blake has great ideas for her character, to whom she feels very connected. It really is a collaborative process, and there are a lot of funny lines that I either didn't write or don't remember writing, and it could have come from a number of sources.

	











Could you give me an example?


	My favorite line in the first movie that makes me laugh every time that I did not write is when Blake is at a playground with Anna, and she's talking about working for a tough boss and she says, “Or they will fuck you in the face.” That line always makes me laugh, and I know I didn't write it because I've never heard that expression before, but I just love it. So there's always lines that are news to me and in a good way.


Oh wow. She came up with that?


	I don't know if it was her or Paul. I'm not exactly sure what the source was, but it definitely wasn't me. (Laughs.)


There are so many twists and turns in the first movie, but there was even more in this one. Was there any pressure to make audiences more surprised by this movie?


	I think there was. Whenever you do a sequel to anything, you're trying to not only live up to the first movie but outdo it. And I think there was a real aspiration to make this one bigger in every way. It was a much more expensive movie, but going to Italy was a really exciting addition to the story. And as you mentioned, a lot of new characters were added. So, we definitely wanted more twists and turns in this second movie.


I truly wasn't expecting Emily to have a triplet who is still alive, especially because we're told she died in childbirth in the first film. What sparked that creative decision?


	It was a combination of factors. One of the things Blake loved the most about the first movie was getting to play those twins who are identical but so different in every way. There was a real appetite for how do we do that again when that sister died, and because there had been this plant of triplets in the first movie, we were looking for a way to bring back that third sister we never met and find a way to explain how she is somehow still alive.

	











Charity's obsession with Emily was also really shocking. What were the discussions like about wanting to include that?


	The first movie has a really big gay following, which we wanted to embrace. We wanted to meet those fans and not disappoint them. And so we were looking for opportunities to tell really great stories that also have a queer element to them. There was a wonderful podcast that was completely devoted to the first movie and it was three queer women who were doing A Simple Podcast. They were a big reason why we ended up doing a sequel at all because they interviewed the key cast, Paul and me, and it just revived all of our interest in the project and gave Paul the idea to do a sequel. So the queer element of the franchise is baked in as far as we're concerned to the storytelling and the relationship between Anna and Blake in the movie we see as a love story. It may not be a romantic story, but we see it as primarily a love story between two women. It may be twisted, but it is a love story.


What was Blake's reaction to reading that in the script? What was Paul's?


	I was on strike during a lot of these developments and these conversations, and so I wasn't part of all of them, but I think Blake really was behind this decision. I don't think it was handed to her without her participation. My sense is that she really embraced it and wanted to do it.


I'm sure any director like Paul or even a big star like Blake will give notes on the script. Was there anything else that they brought to the table with this follow-up?












	Yeah, one of the things that was really fun and that I didn't know anything about going into the writing was this cottagecore phenomenon, and Blake is really interested in it. So, she brought that idea, which you can see in the Charity character, that she's dressed in this really old gingham dress and she has this hairstyle that's really retro and that came from Blake directly. She really is interested in cottagecore and I just didn't know what it was when she brought it up.


I wanted to ask about the fashion in this film, because Emily's extravagant style adds a lot to her character. Did you envision any of the looks for her character when writing the script? And did Blake have a say in additional costumes?


	Blake had a massive say in the fashion, and I think she had a great collaboration with our amazing costume designer. I always knew that the character was glamorous in the first movie, but I also tried to stay in my lane. I'm not a costume designer. I'm not a fashionista. I'm not part of that world. And so I will indicate the feel of what somebody looks like without getting too specific about the items of clothing, because I know the costume designer and the actor are going to come in and they're going to come up with something better than what I could imagine. And they did. Off of the first movie, we knew that Blake's fashion would be a major element in the second movie. And I think that was a really exciting opportunity for everyone involved, mostly the costume designer and Blake, to really think, “How can we outdo what we did in the first movie? What new looks can we bring to the character?” Especially being in Europe on this location wedding.

	











There were two looks I loved, and I thought they were so funny. One was the huge hat that Emily wore because it was just so over the top.


	That wasn't part of her costume, and she found it shopping in Capri and bought it, and they put it in the movie. So that hat was a discovery while they were on the set.


Also, the all-black morning outfit, when it's first revealed that it's Charity. 


	Yes, It's over the top. Everything about the movie is over the top, but we embraced the insanity of every element of it and just went for it.


Back to the twists, in the scene where Anna is on the truth serum, how did that idea come about?


	That came from the very first draft of the script. I do have a funny story about this. I wrote that scene when I had a 102 fever with COVID-19 and was isolated from my family. I was in a kind of hallucinatory state, and I had this idea that it would be really fun to see Anna under the influence like that, where she just can't stop telling the truth, but her truth is so much more innocent than anyone else in the story. Her truth is about lying to become PTA president and that kind of thing. So, that idea came from being so sick and having such a high fever that I myself was in that hallucinatory state and put it in the script.


Wow, I'm so sorry to hear that. 


	No, it was actually a gift. I was better a few days later, but actually, it's kind of fun as a writer when things happen to you and you're able to use them, not a bad thing.

	











What happened between Stephanie and Sean in between the films. We see Sean really struggling trying to cope with everything that happened in the first one. Why didn't they get back together and explore their connection more?


	We had a different ending to the first movie, which was they did get together. And when we tested it for audiences, they really did not like that ending. And I think the reason was because they wanted Anna to have a full arc where she is on her own and has moved on with her life on her own, that it wasn't about getting a man. That's not what the movie's about. It was a confusing ending because it made it seem like she won because she got Sean, which wasn't really our intention, but I can understand how audiences saw it that way. So we actually changed the ending of the first movie from what it had been, and we shot the ending where they got together at the end. It's a flash mob scene where he proposes to her and it's on YouTube and it's an extra on the DVD, but we didn't use it. So, we did get them together and that turned out to not be what audiences were wanting.


Why decide to kill him off in this one? 


	The truth is that it did not come from me. That was a decision made after I was involved with the script. So, you would have to ask the other writer.


It was interesting how it's assumed that when Stephanie goes to Capri, Emily will want revenge on her for everything that previously happened. But it seems like that wasn't Emily's intention, especially since she saved her from being killed. Would you say Emily is a real friend to Stephanie, and is their friendship something you wanted to focus more on in this sequel?












	In the first movie, we start them as friends and they end up as arch-enemies. We thought it would be interesting in the second movie to do the reverse arc. So they start out as enemies, and they become unlikely friends by the end. The thing that the audience expects is that Emily has some really dark plan up her sleeve for revenge on Stephanie. And if we did that, it would just play directly into the audience's expectation. So, we wanted to subvert that expectation that Emily actually regards Stephanie as a friend, which may seem odd, but she really does not have very many friends in her life. She doesn't have anyone she can trust, and she knows that at her core, Stephanie is a good person, that she is somebody with integrity and that she's not evil. She really wants to have an ally on this trip where she's venturing into a very dangerous world that she doesn't really know and she needs a sidekick and protection. And ironically, that's Stephanie.


Emily was a really good friend to Dante by helping to keep his relationship a secret. Do you think that she's misunderstood?


	I think she's very complicated, and I think the best villains in cinema are very human and very complicated. And they, of course, have moments of sincerity and moments of vulnerability and moments of kindness because they're human. And so I do think that she has moments of humanity that are just as surprising as all of the other twists and turns.


At the end, we see Emily stay in Italy and Charity go to jail, though everyone thinks it's the real Emily. Why didn't she come forward and say what really happened?












	She's already in so much trouble, and she's at risk of going back to prison for her previous crimes. She wants to be free and ultimately to be with her son. At the end of the second movie, she finds a solution that checks every box. It gets her everything she wants, and Charity deserves to go to prison for what she's done. So it's not like it's unfair to Charity.


Dante's mom hands her a letter asking for another simple favor, but what revenge is she looking for now that Charity will be behind bars?


	I guess we'll have to find out in the third movie. The truth is I don't even know! (Laughs.)


Well, that leads me to, is there more to her story you'd want to explore in a potential third film?


	Definitely. I mean, it's been talked about and I think we'd all love to revisit these characters in this story in success.


Do you think we'd have to wait another seven years?


	No, I don't, because honestly, as Paul pointed out, we didn't even have the idea for the sequel until several years after the first movie had come out. So, I think now it's on a more accelerated track if the second movie is successful.


With Emily staying in Italy, what does her future look like while kind of hiding out there?


	I don't really know. I will have to roll up my sleeves and figure it out if I'm invited back to the party.


Has the noise about It Ends With Us been a distraction surrounding this film, and how has that affected you?


	I haven't experienced it, I feel for what she's going through right now, but last weekend, we had the premiere, and it was just a celebration about the work and the film, and that noise didn't really come into play as far as I could tell. But no, it doesn't really affect me at all. I'm excited about the movie. I'm excited for people to see it. We have so many fans of the first movie who have been looking forward to it, and I hope that they're able to come to it and focus on what's in the movie and not all of the extra stuff that really has nothing to do with the movie.

The new track is the latest tease of the singer's upcoming ""Something Beautiful"" visual album.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Miley Cyrus debuted another new song from her upcoming visual album Something Beautiful (May 30) during a show for an intimate audience at Casa Cipriani in New York on Saturday night (May 3). “Oh I stay when the ecstasy is far away/ And I pray that it's comin' 'round again,” Cyrus croons in a video from the set in which her raw vocals are accompanied by dramatic piano during the first public run through “More to Lose.”


	“And you say it, ‘I wish it wasn't true'/ I knew someday that I would have to choose/ I thought we had more to lose,” she crooned as the crowd went wild. In another video, she leaned into the powerful pre-chorus, growling, “You're looking like a movie star in a worn-out coat/ Yeah, I throw away my mind/ And it happens all the time.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	As stirring as the song was, something Cyrus said while introducing it really caught people's attention. “I have a lot of people that I've known and loved for a very long time in this room,” Cyrus said while setting up the performance. “Even a couple of exes.” At press time it was unknown who attended the gig and which former paramours Cyrus may have been referring to.


	Before the show, Cyrus posted a different preview of the song from a recording studio in which she modeled a classic little black dress. “Sharing this song from the same place it was created… at the piano,” she said before busting into the moving ballad, singing, “The TV's on, but I don't know/ My tears are streaming like our favorite show/ Tonight, tonight/ My memories fade like denim jeans/ I try to chase when you're running through my mind.” 


	She also posted some dramatic black and white pictures from the special performance just days ahead of Monday's (May 5) 2025 Met Gala. 


	Cyrus' ninth album, Something Beautiful, is the follow-up to 2023's Endless Summer Vacation and it has been described as a 13-track visual “pop opera.” So far she's teased the LP with the singles “Something Beautiful” and “End of the World.”

Kelly Clarkson believes in love again. After dropping the new single “Where Have You Been” on Friday (May 2), the singer followed up with a high-gloss video for the song in which she rocks a colorful, glittery jumpsuit with billowing arms that looks straight out of the 1970s Cher Las Vegas collection.

	“I like my freedom but I'd trade some for a kiss/ Little do you know how long I've been waitin' for this/ When it came to my hopes, well, they left skies I won't miss/ I was getting so lonely I didn't count on, count on this,” Clarkson sings in the visual for the power ballad that shifts from glam shots of the singer and daytime talk show host to dramatic silhouette images of her band members in shadow.

	The hip-swaying, emotion-packed weeper about finding your soul mate after years of searching was inspired by the onscreen romance between Meryl Streep and Martin Short's characters in the hit Hulu series Only Murders in the Building. “It's Martin Short's face,” she told listeners on her SiriusXM show last week. “He says to Meryl Streep's character in the show, ‘Where have you been?'”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The song's soaring chorus says it all: “Where have you been?/ What took so long?/ I thought I'd found you/ Found out I was wrong/ I almost gave us/ My light was so dim/ And now, here you are/ Where have you been?”


	“He's like in awe, and I was like, ‘Has anyone written a song?'” Clarkson continued on the episode that aired the day before the song's release. “Because the song is happy, 'cause it's like you found something that you thought was almost basically a unicorn and did not exist.” Streep and Short's characters got married in the fourth season of the murder mystery show and, in a too-sweet parallel, the two actors are rumored to be dating for real as well.


	Clarkson's band shines in the second half of the video, with the stage bathed in golden light as they come into focus and the singer belts out one of her signature clear-as-a-bell high notes.

The Puerto Rican star kicks off his No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí residency in July.

	Griselda Flores


Senior Editor, Latin


	Hawk-eyed fans spotted Bad Bunny‘s signature white plastic chairs from Debí Tirar Más Fotos in different cities across the world over the weekend (May 3-4), leading many to believe that he's set to announce a world tour soon.


	Although the Puerto Rican superstar has not posted on his socials or officially announced a stint, the chairs were spotted outside of venues and stadiums across Latin America and Europe, including in Peru, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, France, England, Spain and Costa Rica.

	











	It's not totally surprising that he'd eventually announce a world tour. In fact, he hinted at it earlier this year when he announced his residency at El Choli.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Thanks to music and the love you give me through my music, I've had the privilege of traveling to sing in different places of the world. I appreciate and love to do it,” Bad Bunny said in January. “There are places I for sure will return to, like Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia. And some I've never been to but would like to visit, like Brazil and Japan. And there are places I haven't been to in a long time, like Italy, London, Spain, I know, and I promise before the year ends, I'll tell you the date and time I will be visiting.”


	The tour would follow other Bad Bunny mega tours, including World's Hottest Tour and, most recently, the Most Wanted Tour. The former set the record in 2022 for the highest grossing Latin tour in Boxscore history, and the latter grossed more than $207.8 million, selling 703,000 tickets across 30 concerts. 


	Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos was released Jan. 5 on Día de Reyes. The set — which scored the artist his fourth Billboard 200 leader — is a celebration of Puerto Rico and the sonic heritage that has soundtracked the island for generations, including plena and jíbara. Bad Bunny's unprecedented 30-day residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico is set to draw an estimated 250,000 visitors to the island over the summer.

	Tyler Jenke



Julien Baker and TORRES have announced the cancellation of their spring tour dates, citing a need for Baker to focus on her health.


	News of the tour's cancellation was shared on Sunday (May 4) via social media, just hours before the pair's scheduled performance at Stable Hall in San Antonio, TX.


	“Due to recent events, Julien Baker is prioritizing her well-being and taking time to focus on her health,” the post read. “Therefore, the Julien Baker & TORRES ‘Send A Prayer My Way' Tour has been canceled. This decision was not made lightly, and we understand the disappointment this may cause for fans. We deeply appreciate your understanding.”

	“Thank you for your continued support and compassion,” the post concluded.

	











	First announced in early February, the pair hit the road in March with a series of shows throughout the U.S. and U.K., with their spring tour officially launching on April 23 in Richmond, VA. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	A pair of appearances at Ohio University and Tennessee's Big Ears Festival were also cancelled, with a social media post explaining that “one of our key members sustained a concussion and will need to take the next few weeks to recover.” An additional performance at Iowa's Mission Creek Festival was also cancelled due to an “unforeseen medical situation.” 


	No further specifics relating to these incidents were announced at the time, and currently, the pair's website lists an appearance at Massachusetts' Green River Festival on June 20 as their next scheduled performance.


	Baker and TORRES released their Send a Prayer My Way album on April 18, debuting at No. 5 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart (dated May 3), and also reached the top 10 on both the Vinyl Albums and Indie Store Album Sales rankings. 


	According to the pair, their collaborative project has been years in the making, with its roots tracing back to 2016 when Baker and TORRES first played a show together. That night, the idea of making a country album was casually thrown out, with the notion coming to fruition almost a full decade later.


	Baker has previously found success as a member of boygenius alongside Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus. The trio's debut full-length album, the record, landed at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 in 2023, while Baker's solo album Little Oblivions peaked at No. 39. TORRES, known for her sharp, introspective songwriting, has built a loyal following with critically acclaimed releases like Thirstier and Three Futures.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


David O. Russell is set to direct pool hustler feature Shutout, starring Robert De Niro and Jenna Ortega, we can reveal. This is a hot one for the Cannes market.


	The pic will follow Jake Kejeune (De Niro), one of the last masters of a vanishing craft — the pool hustler. Having lived and lost by the roll of a ball in smoky backroom halls, Jake encounters Mia (Ortega), a young prodigy whose raw, electrifying talent reignites a fire he thought long extinguished. Sensing a rare opportunity to shape a legend, Jake takes Mia under his wing, honing her instincts and sharpening her natural gift. Together, they plunge into the ruthless world of high-stakes pool, where the line between unimaginable fortune and devastating failure is razor-thin. As Mia's star ascends and her ambition grows, Jake must confront the ultimate question: can he steer her to greatness, or will her hunger for victory eclipse everything he has taught her?

	











	Based on a screenplay by Alejandro Adams, Shutout will be produced by Russell, RK Films' Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum, and Mark Bomback. Black Bear will introduce the project to international buyers at the upcoming Cannes Film Market. CAA Media Finance is handling U.S. rights.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Oscar winner De Niro goes back a long way with The Fighter and American Hustle director Russell. The two probably are best known for their collaboration on Silver Linings Playbook. Ortega is riding high after the successes of Wednesday, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice and the Scream franchise.


	RK Films was founded by producers Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum. The company has produced films including Maleficent, Snow White and the Huntsman, and The Huntsman: Winter's War.

	“We're delighted to be collaborating with the acclaimed director David O. Russell and the legendary Robert De Niro, and especially excited to see Jenna step into the spotlight alongside these two cinematic icons,” said RK Films' Jeff Kirschenbaum. “It's a rare and thrilling opportunity to support such a high-caliber team coming together to tell a compelling story — a lineup so precise, it feels like the perfect break.”


	As we revealed last week, Black Bear will also be on the Croisette with Angelina Jolie pic Anxious People.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	Apple and A24 today unveiled the first trailer for Highest 2 Lowest, their Kurosawa-inspired crime thriller reuniting Spike Lee and Denzel Washington for the first time since Inside Man back in 2006.


	Slated to hit select theaters August 22 before arriving on Apple TV+ on September 5, the film is a modern reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 classic High and Low, which was itself based on the novel King's Ransom by Ed McBain. While the original thriller follows a shoe company exec who becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom, the new film, set in contemporary NYC, sees a music mogul played by Washington contend with a similar plot.

	











	“There's more to life than just making money,” says Washington in the trailer. “There's integrity; there's what you stand for. There's what you actually believe in. Do you believe in yourself? Do you believe you'll be successful?”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The character contends that “the hard times will come from the good times. The hard times will come from success. The hard times will come from the money. And the mayhem follows.” 


	The question is, then, “Can you handle the mayhem? Can you handle the money? Can you handle the success? Can you handle the failure? Can you handle the lovers? Can you handle the memes? Can you handle everything that's in between?”


	Also starring A$AP Rocky, as well as Jeffrey Wright, Ilfenesh Hadera, Dean Winters, John Douglas Thompson, and Ice Spice, Highest 2 Lowest will premiere out of competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, as Lee's classic Do the Right Thing celebrates its 36th anniversary.


	Developed and produced by A24, Escape Artists and Mandalay Pictures, the film is written by Alan Fox and Lee. Todd Black produced for Escape Artists, alongside Jason Michael Berman for Mandalay Pictures. Exec producers included Lee for 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, and Mandalay's Peter Guber, as well as Juniper Productions' Matthew Lindner, Chris Brigham, and Katia Washington. Mandalay's Jordan Moldo served as co-producer.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


	The U.S. and international film sectors are reeling after Donald Trump‘s announcement last night that he is  “authorizing” the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to impose a 100% tariff on “any and all” movies produced in “foreign lands.”


	In a message posted to Truth Social, Trump described foreign productions as a “national security threat” to the U.S. industry, adding that they draw filmmakers overseas but also bring “messaging and propaganda” into the country.


	The threat, while seemingly embryonic and lacking in any detail, has sent shockwaves through the U.S. and international film sectors. The impact, should anything close to this come to pass, would be seismic on the global film sector. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“What a bombshell”, one leading German producer and distributor simply replied this morning.


	“It's insane,” a veteran UK producer told us. “So U.S. companies can only make U.S. films? James Cameron can't make Avatar overseas? Who pays the tariffs? Leading independent distributors would all be out of business if it's them.”


	In what may prove to be the get-out clause for industry, the same producer noted: “You can't impose on creatives what stories they can tell.”


	Studios and streamers would also take a massive hit from any such move. “This also greatly impacts the streamers, whose model is to produce locally and exploit globally, including in the core U.S. market,” added a veteran international seller. “Would a foreign-shot production ever see the light of day in America? Would it be taken off U.S. streaming services?”


	All of the leading studios make movies overseas, including many of the major tentpole franchises such as Avatar, Mission Impossible, James Bond and countless others. The MPA in America has yet to comment on behalf of the studios. In his second term, many of Hollywood's leading players have shied away from publicly criticizing the President. Others have cozied up to him. Will this move prompt some to raise their heads above the parapet?


	Sewing anxiety and confusion are usually first steps from Trump ahead of negotiation. A leading U.S. distribution exec told us: “I can't see his target here other than confusion and distraction. Let's hope this only encourages desperately needed increases in U.S. state tax incentives being implemented asap.”

	











	One US film financier noted: “I actually agree with the goal here, as I think many U.S. film execs would. It's crazy how much production has moved overseas due to the absence of rebates here. But obviously the need is for rebates, not tariffs. Tariffs will just choke the remaining life out of the business. Volume would drop to historic low.”


	A French distribution vet posited: “He will kill the U.S. industry quicker as this will increase the cost of U.S. films that already weren't selling well internationally. Creating an incentive for shooting in the U.S. would have been smarter but I'm not sure he has that much intelligence.”


	One film vet pointed us back to a comment made on Deadline overnight, which pours cold water on the notion that the move would strengthen the U.S. production business (more on that below): “All of you cheering this as bringing jobs to U.S. production need to understand that this is NOT the effect this is going to have. It will make low and mid level productions completely unproducable, hence destroying many jobs from producer assistants to writers to post-production. Further, it will lessen the amount of big budget content created because the studios won't be able to make as much because the cost of production will be more.” 


	The studios' dollars currently go further overseas due to various lucrative tax incentives.


	Screen Producers Australia posted to its website: “At this stage, it is unclear what this announcement means in practice or how it will be applied and implemented”, said SPA CEO Matthew Deaner. “There are many unknowns for our industry, but until we know more, there's no doubt it will send shockwaves worldwide. For the Australian industry, it reinforces the need for the Government to focus immediately and swiftly on building a resilient local industry that can withstand global shocks like this.”


	New Zealand producer John Barnett (The Whale Rider) told NZ outlet The Spinoff: “Not unlike everything else Trump has done, it is totally lacking in logic,” he says. “If there's one thing we've learned in the first 100 days, is that what he says today isn't necessarily what he'll say tomorrow.”


	“There's honestly not much that has shaken our industry in this way,” Evelyne Snow, head of communications for the Quebec Alliance of Image and Sound Technicians (AQTIS), told Canadian outlet La Presse after Trump's announcement. AQTIS reps 8,000 local production professionals and is part of IATSE. According to La Presse, the two groups are scheduled to meet on Monday in the wake of Trump's comments.


	Foreign-language films are more prevalent than ever before at the U.S. box office, on streaming services and in the U.S. awards race. Recent awards seasons have seen major success for foreign language films (both made by U.S. and international producers) including Emila Perez, Anatomy Of A Fall, All Quiet On The Western Front and Parasite.


	This wouldn't be the first saber rattle from Trump that doesn't come to pass as first mooted. But with the Cannes Film Market just around the corner, industry are suddenly on red alert and the impact is already being felt.


	One leading U.S. film company who works on domestic and international productions told us: “Trump's moves are already affecting sales in China but this would reduce the entire global market with buyers not wanting to pay minimum guarantees if there will be a tax on films in the Cannes market or on films they've already acquired. It affects domestic distribution deals but it also impacts equity players who have money in movies because their films will suddenly be worth less money. We won't be able to make movies for the same budgets, actors won't get paid the same fees and the list goes on. Simply, it would destroy the independent sector.”

	











	“This is not great [for Cannes] at all,” said one leading U.S. packaging agent.


	Another Euro seller noted: “What a bombshell on the eve of Cannes. It might not come into effect but just the possibility of such a tariff creates unnecessary uncertainty towards the U.S. market which was just starting to show positive signs of recovery after the strikes.”


	A veteran international distributor echoed a common sentiment this morning: “It's too early to say but this will definitely be the talk of Cannes”. An Italian buyer urged caution: “Let's see the detail. This guy changes his mind every day.”


	Foreign governments are starting to react to the news.


	As quoted in The Guardian, Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said he had spoken to the head of the government body Screen Australia about the proposed tariffs. “Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,” he said in a statement.


	New Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon noted: “We'll have to see the detail of what actually ultimately emerges. But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector in that industry,” he said.


	Caroline Dinenage, chair of UK Parliament's influential Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: “Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.


	“Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently underway.


	“At the same time, the government's forthcoming Creative Industries Sector Plan needs to meet the challenge we set down of incentivising inward investment while also growing our domestic sector so British film and high-end TV can thrive.”


	As we reported, California Governor Gavin Newsom is among those set to resist the move.


	Trump said last night: “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”


	He later claimed to reporters: “Other nations have been stealing the … movie-making capability of the United States. I said to a couple of people, ‘What do you think?' I have done some very strong research over the last week, and we are making very few movies now. Hollywood is being destroyed. Now you have a grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen, so I am not just blaming other nations, but other nations, a lot of them, have stolen our movie industry. If they are not willing to make a movie inside the United States, and we should have a tariff on movies that come in. And not only that, governments are actually giving big money. They are supporting them financially. So that is sort of a threat to our country in a sense.”

	











	Trump has complained about trade deficits as he has imposed tariffs on other countries, but the movie industry has been a bright spot. According to the Motion Picture Association, the industry generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the world, with exports 3.1 times that of imports. The industry produced $22.6 billion in exports, and $15.3 billion in trade surplus. 


	More as we have it…

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


EXCLUSIVE: Typical of Donald Trump, the details of POTUS' just announced bombshell 100% tariffs on movies made outside America are vague. Yet, what is already very clear, as studios and streamers try to figure out next steps, is that the Governor of California won't be playing a supporting role.


	In fact, as Gavin Newsom pushes for his plan to more than doubling of the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually, Trump's newest tariff missive sets up a showdown between the Governor and the President over who truly wants to save the home of Hollywood.


	Contacted by Deadline, Newsom's office had no comment tonight on Trump's social media declaration “authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Even with Newsom slagged as a “grossly incompetent governor” that let Hollywood be “stolen” later Sunday by Trump on the South Lawn of the White House, the Governor's team are taking a wait and see approach until more specifics are made available of the president's desire for “MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

	However, as Trump claimed runaway production “is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Governor Newsom's office were not shy about advocating the rule of the actual law.


	“We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law,” Newsom senior advisor for communications Bob Salladay told Deadline this evening of the president's undefined threat against overseas productions and their incentives. Perhaps setting the stage for another lawsuit from the Golden State against the MAGA administration and its chaos inducing tariffs, the initial reaction from the Governor's team is sure take more solid form as more becomes known about what Trump really is up to and wants to see done.

	











	It is worth noting the movie tariff firestorm from the low polling Trump came the same night he also exclaimed that he wanted to  “rebuild and open” Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary to house “Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets.”

	Accordingly, this new tariff policy seems to be connected somewhat to conversations Jon Voight, one of Trump's trio of special ambassadors” to Hollywood, has been having with guilds and studio/streamer executives in recent weeks. At the same time, industry sources also believe  seems it is also a reaction to a China Film Administration unveiled decision in April to “moderately reduce the number of American films imported” as part of a pushback against the 145% tariffs Trump imposed on the PRC.  


	Regardless, how any tariffs on non-domestic produced film would play out is unknown at this early stage. Would consumers pay the results as a de facto tax with increased ticket prices and streaming subscriptions? Would budgets be the baseline of any evaluation? One theory circulating in DC and LA circles tonight is that any tariffs would be directly on any financial incentives films and possibly shows received from the likes of Canadian provinces and the Hollywood North of Vancouver, the UK, Australia, Viktor Orbán's Hungary, Germany, Mexico and others.


	Tonight, studio in-house counsel and top tier outside firms are said to be scrambling to find out what Trump really wants and what it will cost them,” I'm told. “He always wants a deal, a win, we have to hit the right note Monday,” an exec who has been working the phones, texts and DMs said to me. “The hope is this passes and eventually becomes a non-starter.” 


	With studios and streamers officially pushing any request for comment over to the MPA, the industry lobbying group has said nothing publicly so far. Trump has his first sit-down with Canada's newly elected Prime Minster Mark Carney set for May 6 at the White House with the foreign movie tariffs near certain to be on the agenda now.


	One other certainty is that if Trump's movie tariffs are real, it will prove another blow to an already greatly weakened industry, especially here in the Southern California.


	The home of Hollywood only recently has seen some degree of recovery from the severe downturns of the pandemic and the shift to in-home viewing via streaming, with Netflix, Max, and to some extent Disney, having heavy international inventories. Add to that, even as the big increase in the California Film Commission administered tax credits moves through the state legislature, with 2023's strikes, devastating wildfires and high costs battering LA, there has been a dramatic double digit drop in production in and around the City of Angels over the past six years. A harsh drop in a now belt tightening economy that has left scores of below-the-line workers unemployed month after month, with increasing numbers leaving the state and/or the industry all together.


	As one insider put it Sunday of Trump's new tariffs threats: “I didn't have destroy the entire film industry worldwide on my bingo card this year.”


	To that, Trump has invoked the 1977 created legislation repeatedly over the last three months in his sprawling and erratic tariffs moves since taking office again Still, the IEEPA is actually quite precise in the need for an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to be identified for a national emergency to be called. Additionally, to Newsom's office's point, with all the sanctions power the IEEPA affords a POTUS, the term “tariffs” are not among them. With that, there is little the GOP dominated Congress can or would do to reign Trump in on this abuse of the Act without a veto proof bill shutting down his initiative.

	











	Which, as a fuller sense of what Trump actually means by a 100% tariff on movies produced in other nations takes shape and will it include television, looks like this will be heading for the courts. Before then it will be the stock market that offers the first reaction in the morning – and that could set a very bleak stage.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	Emmy nominee Mandy Moore (This Is Us) has found her next major role in The Breadwinner, a TriStar Pictures comedy in which she'll star opposite top comic Nate Bargatze, Deadline has learned.


	Marking Bargatze's feature film acting debut, the film sees Nate's supermom wife, Katie, land a deal on Shark Tank. Subsequently, the lifelong breadwinner of the family becomes a stay-at-home dad and quickly realizes he's in way over his head.


	Rounding out the cast as the daughters of the on-screen couple are Stella Grace Fitzgerald (Rebel Moon), Birdie Borria (The Fabelmans) and Charlotte Ann Tucker (Thunderbolts*).

	











	Bargatze and Dan Lagana penned the script, with TriStar preemptively acquiring the package back in November, as we were first to report. Eric Appel, the Emmy-winning director of Weird: The Al Yankovic Project, struck a deal to helm the feature in February, as you'll recall from our subsequent reporting.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In addition to Bargatze and Lagana, Jeremy Latcham will produce through Wonder Project, with Shary Shirazi overseeing for the studio.


	Since starring in NBC's lauded ensemble family drama This Is Us from creator Dan Fogelman, which ran for six seasons, Moore has starred in Peacock's Dr. Death and lent her voice to #1 Happy Family USA, Amazon's new adult animated series from Ramy Youssef and Pam Brady, which premiered on Prime Video on April 17. In 2023, she attached to star opposite Kumail Nanjiani in Screen Gems' Thread: An Insidious Tale, though the status of that project is unclear.


The Hollywood Reporter was first to the news of Moore's casting in The Breadwinner.

“Can you handle the success? Can you handle the love? That is the question I have for you…”

Denzel Washington stars in Spike Lee‘s ode to Akira Kurosawa's “High and Low,” titled “Highest 2 Lowest.” The fifth film between Lee and Washington has the actor return to a kind of “American Gangster” character as a NYC-based music mogul who warns of the “money and mayhem” of stardom. A$AP Rocky stars as Yung Felon, the lead character in the reinterpretation of Kurosawa's “High and Low,” about a cobbler who is extorted after his chauffeur's son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom.

 










While much of the plot for Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest” remains under wraps, Lee teased that A$AP Rocky plays Washington's onscreen son. “What's funny is that I was looking at Instagram four or five years ago and people were saying that A$AP looked like he's Denzel's son,” Lee said earlier this year. “I seen those memes and then in the film we used that.”

Jeffrey Wright, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Ice Spice also star in the Cannes-bound “Highest 2 Lowest.”

“A$AP, man, he fire,” Lee added of A$AP's acting. “I mean, there's some scenes where him and D [Washington] head to head – he ain't backing up. Like, ‘I'm here too.' So very, very happy with the way the film turned out and looking forward to sharing it with the world.”

A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, made his acting debut in the 2015 coming-of-age film “Dope.” He now stars in two A24 features out this year: Sundance hit “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You” and Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest.”

Lee reunites with longtime collaborator Washington for their fifth film together. The duo previously collaborated on “Inside Man,” “Mo' Better Blues,” “Malcolm X,” and “He Got Game.” The pair also reunite with producer Todd Black for “Highest 2 Lowest,” as Black produced Washington's “Fences” and “Equalizer” films.

Lee told Deadline that he screened “Highest 2 Lowest” for Martin Scorsese, and wrote that Scorsese “gushed about Denzel's magnificent acting,” and that Scorsese was “so happy” for Lee.

“Highest 2 Lowest” is an Apple Original feature in partnership with A24, which plans to release the film theatrically before it streams on Apple TV+. Alan Fox wrote the screenplay for “Highest 2 Lowest” with director Lee, who will executive produce through his 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks banner. 

 










“Highest 2 Lowest” will be released August 22 from A24 followed by Apple TV+ via Apple Original Films in September. Check out the teaser below. But first, the film premieres out of competition at Cannes in May.

When Young Mazino heard there was a role for him in “The Last of Us” Season 2, the beloved “Beef” actor “ran to a GameStop, bought a used PS4, and played through the game” immediately. Mazino told IndieWire he was already a fan of HBO's TV adaptation thanks to its Emmy-winning first season, but that studying the source material felt essential before meeting with series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann. If only someone had told him, they didn't want their actors playing the game.

“It was important for Craig [Mazin as showrunner] to understand the game fully,” said Druckmann to IndieWire. “With our actors, what we told them — and they often would not listen to us — we asked them, ‘Don't play the game.' Because the games have performances that are brilliant as far as I'm concerned.”

Head of the games studio Naughty Dog, Druckmann co-wrote “The Last of Us: Part II” with Halley Gross. The best-selling sequel arrived on consoles in 2020 and went on to win “Game of the Year” from hundreds of organizations and publications worldwide. It was important to Druckmann that neither of his projects overshadow the other, and that the game's voice and motion-capture cast got their due.

“Ashley Johnson created a perfect Ellie, and I didn't want Bella [Ramsey] to try to copy what Ashley Johnson did,” Druckmann explained. “I wanted to see Bella Ramsey‘s version. That's why you bring in talented artists, so they can reinterpret the material.”

Even having jumped the gun on the games a bit, Mazino got the part. He'll appear as Jesse on “The Last of Us” Season 2 soon, joining a complex ensemble that's opposite Ramsey for Ellie's darkest chapter yet. Ramsey told IndieWire they were successfully steered away from playing the video games when they first signed on for Season 1, and four years later, they haven't made progress.

“I'm not a gamer and haven't played the games because I can't do it, I've tried,” Ramsey said. “I've watched playthroughs. That is my way in. I have such respect for the people who do that. Thank you to the people who filmed themselves playing it and put it on YouTube because you literally saved the day.”

 










Praising the series' wide audience and “accessibility to non-gamers,” Ramsey said they would routinely watch cutscenes from the game as soon as a day after filming new versions for the TV show. At times, the “Game of Thrones” actor said they could feel those two worlds colliding on set.

“Sometimes I'll be directed and I'm like, ‘Oh, I see you're trying to get me to do the thing that was in the game!' — which is cool,” said Ramsey. “Then having that reference point is actually really helpful to be like, ‘Oh yes, I know exactly what you are asking me to do because I've seen this happen already and I'm able to replicate it,' but in a way that still feels like it's not copying but coming from me and fresh and new and exciting.”

Druckmann didn't cite any specific technical benefits from having Ramsey observe the original for the adaptation, but he did applaud the former “Game of Thrones” actor for their commitment and ambition.

“They want to know as much as possible about how to lift [those details] and make it their own, and they have,” said Druckmann. “To me, that is the best way to honor what Ashley Johnson did is to make it your own and not just try to duplicate what Ashley did.”

 










Asked for any last remarks, speaking with IndieWire, Mazino shouted out his counterpart in the game.

“I know there's some pressure involved in playing a character that's already beloved and that is being adapted,” Mazino said. “Stephen Chang did such a great job portraying Jesse, but it's all just reference material. It all amalgamates into what I hope to be an honest performance of a really well-thought-out, well-developed character.” 

“I'm excited for [people] who are fans of the game to feel like they're experiencing the story again for the first time,” echoed Ramsey. “And people who don't know the game, who haven't played the game, I'm so excited for them to experience it without knowing anything.”

“The Last of Us” Season 2 airs new episodes on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

Utilizing the resources of the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative, Donald Trump has announced his intention to seek a 100% tariff on all films brought to America from another country. This includes films made by American companies like Netflix overseas in areas with better tax incentives, such as the U.K. and South Africa. 

Writing on Truth Social, Trump said, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.”

Trump went on to claim that production moving overseas was part of a “concerted effort” by foreign countries to undermine American business, calling it “a national security threat.” 

“It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Trump wrote. “Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

Hollywood has been on the President's hit list from the very start of his second administration. One of his first actions in office was to name Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” to help fix an ailing Hollywood. Though not much has been heard from Gibson or Stallone on this effort, Voight has been making the rounds with different union reps and studio executives (as per Deadline). Many were hopeful this might lead to a possible federal tax incentive for production throughout the U.S., but as it's become Trump's new favorite toy, it seems a tariff is what we'll get.

It's unclear whether this tariff will apply to films alone or also include other media such as television, music videos, or commercials, but if so, it may end up doing more damage than good. The stated goal is to incentivize bringing production back to the States and in particular, Hollywood — but this doesn't actually reduce the cost of production in the way federal U.S. Tax incentives would. This just makes production outside the U.S. more expensive. The net result may be that the studios would just reduce production across the board.

 










As far as tax incentives, in October 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom put forth a proposal to increase the state's tax program to $750 million, over twice as much as it's doling out currently. Others have offered further increases, suggesting no cap be placed on this figure. Voting for this initiative will take place this summer.

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 4. For previous coverage, check out last week's review.]

Episode 4 starts with a simple, if surprising, choice: two men change their minds.

Back in 2018, Isaac (Jeffrey Wright) is riding in an armored truck with a gaggle of FEDRA chucklefucks, sitting in silent judgment as Josh Peck's super-bro-y soldier tells an awful story about some other asshole named Greenberg who beat the shit out of an innocent man because he thought the word “disseminating” meant “jerking off.”

 










After the cackles of laughter subside, the nervous new guy among the the caravan of douchebags dares to ask a question: Burton (played by “The Gilded Age's” Ben Ahlers) wants to know why they keep calling citizens “voters.” Clearly annoyed that this kid isn't appreciating the humor in his horrific story, Peck's “thoughtless” storyteller brushes it off — “Because that's what we fucking call them, who cares?”

But Isaac wants to answer.

“Because we took away their rights,” he says. “We took away their right to vote, and somebody started calling them voters to mock them.”

Before he can say much else, the driver alerts Isaac to a group of people gathering in the road. The crew in the back immediately assumes they're W.L.F. — or wolves, as they were labeled in the previous episode — and starts preparing for a fight. But Isaac tells them to stand down. He knows they're “all Greenbergs,” and rather than let them go attack some random strangers for the fun of it, Isaac gets out on his own to greet the unknown “voters.”

Except, they're not unknown. Isaac greets their leader by name. “You Hanrahan?” he asks, after she identifies him as Isaac. The two nod at each other, and Isaac promptly turns around, walks back to the armored vehicle, and tosses two grenades inside before locking the door. All the Greenbergs are dead — all but the new guy. Isaac pulled Burton out when he went to meet Hanrahan (Alanna Ubach), taking note of his naivete and deeming it a key distinguishing factor. The rest of them were a lost cause, but Burton, maybe, could still think for himself.

So he asks him to: “Now make your choice,” Isaac says. And Burton does. The young scared soldier may not have had much of a choice — clearly, Isaac would kill him if he didn't join up — but he still changes his mind, just like Isaac did, and their motivations are still aligned. Isaac decided to leave FEDRA and join the wolves long before he heard the Greenberg story, but one gets the sense he was influenced by hearing it one too many times from one too many people. He turns on his fellow FEDRA agents because he's disgusted by what they're doing. He sees a better path, and he chooses to walk it. Burton just follows in his footsteps.

 










Eleven years later, as Isaac tortures a Scar prisoner, we see Burton again. Now, the wide-eyed lamb is a hardened wolf. Like his savior — and unlike the other, greener officer guarding the door — Burton has become desensitized to the violence inflicted on the “animal” inside. The naked man chained to a wall getting seared and beaten with a burning saucepan is just getting what he deserves, much like Josh Peck's soldier got what he deserved over a decade prior. Burton learned to think this way from Isaac, and Isaac learned this from his own yet-to-be-shared experience.

Long ago, they made their choice, and look where it's gotten them. Burton isn't who anyone wants to be. His face, much like Abby's (Kaitlyn Dever) dour, unforgiving countenance, is not that of a happy man. His choice kept him alive, physically, but his soul may have died in that armored truck. Isaac isn't any better off. Despite feigning nonchalance during the interrogation, his own funny story betrays his true misery. He tells the Scar prisoner that when he was young, he was shy; he didn't know how to talk to women, so he cooked for them. As he got better at it, he vowed to one day own a Mauviel saucepan — the best of the best. Today, he does, “just not how I planned.” Instead of using Mauviel to make dinner for people he likes, he uses it to scorch the flesh from his enemies' limbs.

 










Isaac took a gesture of love and turned it into a weapon of hate — a recurring theme in “The Last of Us,” whether it's Abby using the love she has for her dead father to fuel her vengeance against Joel (Pedro Pascal), or Joel using the love he has for Ellie to justify his killing spree to save her. Love can be beautiful, but it can also be destructive. Love can change you, and it can change within you. The question (which Catherine O'Hara's Gail posed so pointedly last week) is whether our individual nature leaves us at love's mercy, or if we have more of a choice in the matter.

With Isaac, his murky past makes it hard to tell if he's always had a coldness to him or if he's adapted to the coldness all around him in order to survive, like so many other characters we've met. But Burton's past is clear. The man in the armored truck and the man guarding the door are not the same person. The former learned to behave like the latter, and his prominence in the episode, paired with Isaac's story implying a similar transformation, is instrumental to understanding what's at stake for Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced), as they face their own potential turning point.

In Episode 4, circumstances change dramatically for our two leads. Dina finds out she's pregnant. Ellie finds out Dina is pregnant. Dina tells Ellie she's in love with her, and Ellie doesn't have to tell Dina the same thing because Dina already knows. Still, all of a sudden, these two patrol buddies are committed to each other in a whole new way. They're in love. They're starting a family together. “Holy shit,” Ellie says. “I'm going to be a dad.”

 










But is it enough to change their mind? Ellie is closer than ever to finding Abby, closer than ever to avenging Joel's death, closer than ever to embracing the dark turn her love for him has taken. Dina is, too, and she refuses Ellie's suggestion that she stay behind to protect herself and her baby. “Together,” she says, holding Ellie's hand and staring out at the city where Abby waits. But is that… right? Once again, showrunner and co-creator Craig Mazin is reframing an action typically seen as good and right as, potentially, bad and wrong. As much as we want to see Ellie and Dina stick together — to fight for each other, to protect their love for each other — they're risking everything they've just gained for revenge, and revenge has been repeatedly shown to be as dangerous as it is unrewarding.

We saw as much in Abby's face after she killed Joel, and we see it again in Episode 4. Isaac and Burton are at war with the Scars. The choices they've made, starting in 2018, have led them to a place of heartless unhappiness. But they stand by those choices. Their rigid conviction is their armor; they have to believe that even though they're hunting, hurting, and killing people, there are worse people out there, doing worse things, for worse reasons. If they stop believing that, if they question it even for a second, they may not like the answers. They may look at what they've done and see pain, fear, and ruin. Looking back at them in the mirror, they may see the face they despise the most: Greenberg's.

 










At the end of Episode 4, Ellie and Dina have to decide which path to take. They can press on with the mission they've agreed to; they can keep chasing vengeance, keep chasing Abby, keep following Joel's footsteps until they become his hardened, savage successors.

…or they can change their minds.

“The Last of Us” Season 2 releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

• Aside from the parallel narratives framing Ellie and Dina's story this week, there are additional omens of doom scattered throughout Episode 4 — like when they find those dead bodies inside the armored truck, and Ellie immediately compares them to the deceased Apollo 1 astronauts. While I'm not sure why she's got NASA on the noggin, Ellie evoking three dead explorers near the outskirts of Seattle doesn't bode well for the three explorers (Ellie, Dina, and Dina's baby) heading deeper into the city. That Seattle doesn't prove to be all that hospitable is hardly a warning — very few places in “The Last of Us” are welcoming — but intended for Ellie or not, the disemboweled bodies hung for all to see sure feel like a message. Finally, call me cynical if you must, but I've always found a-ha's “Take On Me” to describe a tragic romance — you better enjoy love while it lasts, because it'll be gone in a day (or twooooooooo). 

 










• That song was very sweet, though. So fun to see Dina absolutely swooning over her dreamy guitarist (soon-to-be) girlfriend.

• “What's up with all the rainbows?”“I don't know. Maybe they're all optimists.”

• Someone start the petition to change Seattle's official motto to “Happy Proud Rainbow Town.”

• Nice to see Ellie's hand-to-hand combat training come in handy. 

• Holy shit, that subway escape was tight! The red flare set such an ominous visual tone, and watching the tendrils crawl around the flame — knowing it would draw a horde of the infected down upon the W.L.F. soldiers — while Dina counted the ones she could hear on her fingers (until she ran out of fingers) really amped up the tension. Once the rabid not-zombies showed up, there were a few less-convincing moments — none of the infected trying to tip the subway car scrambled on top? Only one got close enough to bite Ellie before they pushed through the turnstile? — but the acute claustrophobia combined with the killer location made it a thrilling, memorable sequence overall.

• “It's a little thing, but when you start to hide little things they become big things,” Ellie says, referring to how annoyed she got wearing long sleeves to hide the scar on her arm… but also what's the little thing she's hiding now?

Robert De Niro will collaborate again with director David O. Russell, adding a Gen Z icon to the mix: Jenna Ortega.

IndieWire confirmed that De Niro and Ortega will play a pseudo Paul Newman and Tom Cruise for Russell's version of “The Color of Money,” titled “Shutout.” Ortega is set to star as the ingenue pool hall amateur who learns the ways of lifelong pool hustler De Niro. Deadline first reported the news.

The official synopsis reads: “De Niro plays Jake Kejeune, one of the last masters of a vanishing craft — the pool hustler. Having lived and lost by the roll of a ball in smoky backroom halls, Jake encounters Mia (Ortega), a young prodigy whose raw, electrifying talent reignites a fire he thought long extinguished. Sensing a rare opportunity to shape a legend, Jake takes Mia under his wing, honing her instincts and sharpening her natural gift. Together, they plunge into the ruthless world of high-stakes pool, where the line between unimaginable fortune and devastating failure is razor-thin. As Mia's star ascends and her ambition grows, Jake must confront the ultimate question: can he steer her to greatness, or will her hunger for victory eclipse everything he has taught her?”

Samia Finnerty is unafraid of revealing her innermost thoughts on record. Her debut, 2020's The Baby, was an introspective indie-pop coming-of-age tale from a sharply sardonic point of view, while its follow-up, Honey, zeroed in on the buoyant highs and nihilistic lows of her early 20s. Bloodless, the Minneapolis-based singer-songwriter's flinty third album, finds solace in scattered confrontations and developing self-realizations. Using deceptively bright folk pop and Americana, Samia crafts an album about coming into your own by tearing yourself apart.

Bloodless is inspired in part by the inexplicable phenomena of bovine excision, a favorite subject of conspiracy theorists: Cows, horses, and other livestock have been found mutilated and drained of blood worldwide, with early reports dating back to the 1960s. Using that unsettling image as a metaphor for unsolvable emptiness lends unexpected drama to Samia's indie pop. Once again working with longtime producers Caleb Wright and Jake Luppen, Samia has evolved her music into a steelier version of her soft-focus early work, just as her lyrics have progressed from bare-bones refrains toward more evocative storytelling. Early highlight “Hole in a Frame,” for example, draws its title from a 1978 incident when Sid Vicious punched through the wall at Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa during a chaotic Sex Pistols tour, a hole that has since been framed and turned into a tourist attraction; Samia turns the image inside out against a breezy Rilo Kiley-style country-folk blend, contemplating the celebration of an absence as a form of self-empowerment.

Samia's voice alternates between plainspoken and liltingly melodic, occasionally suggesting doubt and ambivalence. But an edge often enlivens her bittersweet, uneasy lyrics. “I just wanted to be your friend/Cup of tea in your cold hand/And drained, drained bloodless,” she sings in a sprightly tone on “Bovine Excision,” adding depth to the disappointment. Later, her voice is filtered into a stutter on the 2010s pop-rock throwback “Lizard,” where she circles an ex at a party and, seeing herself through his eyes, threatens to set it all on fire. “I didn't come here to make you look/But intentions are for the guilty,” she sings; “I'm worth my weight in your image/Dancing to something sweet.” In the pinwheeling “Carousel,” she sketches out the specifics of an intimate romance: how much she looks like her lover's celebrity crushes; she and her lover pretending to sleep in separate beds, to hoodwink her parents. These small, impactful details quickly add up; by the time the song erupts into a beatific crescendo of power chords to match the intense high she feels, Samia is howling right alongside the torrent.

Nevertheless, Samia still occasionally slips in vague lyrics that don't hold the same power. The wispy “Spine Oil” trades in purple scenes of “a salmon in the silhouette” and “Jesus in my rosettes” that don't connect; couched in a dry, folksy shuffle, it's wallpaper compared to the album's stronger tracks. “Proof,” which recalls her early acoustic outings, also teeters between affecting and awkward. “To be loved like a child's toy or cigarette/Is to die a funny feeling in a chest,” she sings over sleepy fingerpicking, an intriguing idea undercut by the song's blunt, “You don't know me, bitch” chorus. Compared to the earlier “Sacred,” when she sings “You never loved me like you hate me now,” swathed in surfy guitar, the difference in pointed admissions is striking.

Where open sadness often fueled Samia's first two albums, the acceptance of things that can't be changed gives her music a new lightness of touch, even in its most conflicted moments. The six-minute closer “Pants” shapeshifts from hushed indie pop to an arena-sized chorus and back down to a quiet respite, an effective configuration for a song that uses a pair of pants to excavate the weight of men's expectations on her. “Who was I when I bought these pants?” she asks in a gentle singsong, “They're nonrefundable/Now I'm questioning everything I am.” It's an unexpected emotional purge that courses throughout Bloodless, offering cathartic sighs of relief along the way.

In E.M. Forster's gay coming-of-age novel Maurice, the title character walks around his college campus after dark, peering into the lit windows of his fellow students' dorm rooms as they go about their evenings. Holy shit, he thinks (I'm paraphrasing), other people are real. They think and feel. They have insides. “But, O Lord,” he narrates to himself, “not such an inside as mine.” On “Baton,” the closing track to Model/Actriz's second album, Pirouette, Cole Haden has a similar revelation in reverse. While talking to his sister, he realizes that she has memories of him that he does not share. There's a version of him in her head that doesn't overlap perfectly with how he perceives himself. Suddenly there are two Coles. Then, by extension, because Haden is the singer of a band whose first album did quite well for itself, suddenly there are n Coles: one for everyone who's ever perceived him. All these selves multiply and spin away from him, uncontrollable.

As far as follow-ups to raw, brilliant debuts go, Pirouette is strikingly honest about its own self-consciousness. The Brooklyn quartet's 2023 album, Dogsbody, stormed hot out of the gate, sending lyrics about gay abjection flailing over squalls of cathartic noise. Now firmly established, Model/Actriz follows with an album deeply concerned with being seen and calibrating one's image in service of pursuing desire. Rather than raucous and eruptive, the music is now icy, clipped, and clean, a step away from Einstürzende Neubauten and toward Crystal Castles and Circus-era Britney. It still has teeth, but they are oh-so-white.

But Pirouette is more than the sound of a band strutting while the cameras flash. Haden's lyrics root into early memories of self-censure, when he intuited as a very young child that his queerness was too dangerous to be celebrated or even shared. On “Cinderella,” over harmonics that blare like an emergency siren, he sings about the time when, at age five, he almost asked for a Cinderella-themed birthday party. “And when the moment came and I changed my mind/I was quiet, alone, and devastated.” Even now, in adulthood, that internalized rejection stings his drive for intimacy. Being out, generally speaking, is one thing; opening yourself up to another person in your fullness is another.

Throughout the record, Haden chases himself through a mirror maze, startling at his own reflection as he tries to slither his way out into reality. On “Departures,” he prays to a scattered personal pantheon to realize his own embodiment, to become flesh instead of reflected light. “Diva” finds him meeting men out in European clubs and bemoaning that he has no way to take them home—a logistical problem standing in for a spiritual vacancy. It's here that he sneers his way through one of his most perplexing couplets: “You could call me a small business owner/Living in America, while trapped in the body of an operatic diva.” He's nodding, maybe, to the eternal tension between art and commerce, the harrowing compromise of selling one's deepest shames for penny streams, but the wording is so explosive that the point disappears in the muzzle flash.

“All I want is to be beautiful,” Haden sings throughout “Departures,” as if beauty were some objective quality which, once attained, could definitively preclude any rejection or misunderstanding. And wouldn't that be nice, if anyone could perfect their own image and wield it like a sword? But we live in the world of other people, where images never stop mutating regardless of our attempts to control them. Pirouette's most delightful moments come when Model/Actriz savor their own powerlessness: when Haden, in flights of falsetto, hears his mother's voice and begs to be carried on “Poppy,” or when the noise drops out in “Doves” and he sings, in a half-whisper, “I make a rapture out of waiting.” Candles flicker, birds swarm, the trappings of religiosity suggest some urgent ritual, some desperate doing. Then what Haden does is nothing. He waits. The image denatures, and he's left alone with that minuscule spark you might call a self. He breathes on it. It glows.

Although it isn't billed that way, Oh What a Beautiful World belongs to a certain strain of Willie Nelson albums dedicated to the songbook of a particular songwriter. It's a tradition Willie inaugurated in the late 1970s, when he released tributes to his honky tonk hero Lefty Frizzell and his fellow country maverick Kris Kristofferson, and has continued to the present day, saluting Harlan Howard with 2023's I Don't Know a Thing About Love. Nelson extends the homey, understated vibe of the latter with Oh What A Beautiful World, which is devoted to the songs of Rodney Crowell, a fellow Texan who released his 1978 debut, Ain't Living Long Like This, right as Willie rose to superstar status on the wave of the outlaw movement.

Nelson included a Crowell song, “'Till I Gain Control Again,” on the live album Willie and Family Live that year (a studio version would appear on 1983's Take It to the Limit). Around that time, Willie's running partner Waylon Jennings took Crowell's “I Ain't Living Long Like This” to the top of the Billboard Country charts—but Crowell could never quite be called an outlaw. Raised on country-rock and cowboy poets as much as honky tonk, Crowell could play by Nashville rules but quickly grew restless: After spinning out five consecutive Country No. 1 singles from 1988's Diamonds & Dirt, he drifted away from the country mainstream, finding a home on the fringes of Americana.

Oh What a Beautiful World draws heavily from recent Crowell albums, with half of its 12 songs originally released in 2013 and later. That, along with the placement of a pair of Crowell tunes on last year's The Border, suggests Nelson's affection for the songwriter has grown in recent years. Willie doesn't avoid poppier material from Crowell: The album opens with the insistent “What Kind of Love,” a hit from 1992, and also includes “Shame on the Moon,” a relaxed, ruminative ballad Bob Seger brought to the Billboard Top 10 in 1982, along with “Making Memories of Us,” which Keith Urban turned into a Country No. 1 in 2005. These lighter moments punctuate story songs, tunes of twilight heartbreak, Texas vignettes, and bemused character portraits.

Crowell fills his songs with dryly vivid details, setting his lyrics to plainspoken, deceptively catchy melodies. Nelson prizes the same traits in his own songwriting, so it's little wonder that these songs fit Willie as comfortably as an old pair of boots. Comfort is the rule on Oh What a Beautiful World. Working once again with Buddy Cannon—his main producer since 2012, who temporarily stood aside last time around so Nelson's son Micah could helm Last Leaf on the Tree—Willie is surrounded by his usual crew, who are content to pick up the tempo only once: for the wry blues shuffle “She's Back in Town.” Cannon otherwise spends the album accentuating the band's slow stroll by polishing each instrumental element until it gleams, turning this into one of the slickest-sounding Nelson records in recent memory.

All the grit and emotion on Oh What a Beautiful World comes from Willie. Age has done a number on his voice—he's lost his upper octaves and no longer sings with gusto—but Nelson adjusts accordingly, conserving his energy so he can emphasize the tenderness of “The Fly Boy and the Kid,” deliver the verses of “Banks of the Old Bandera” with captivating understatement, and provide a sweet, gravelly counterpoint to Crowell's good cheer as they duet on the title track. “Oh What a Beautiful World” also is graced by Nelson's guitar, Trigger, with which he takes several spidery runs through the verses and chorus. Whenever Nelson seems frail, Trigger is robust, answering every one of the sung jokes on the closing “Stuff That Works.” Nelson never hits the punchline too hard, nor does he clutter his leads with unnecessary notes. He retains his innate sense of taste and showmanship; despite his diminished range he still sounds like himself. That indelible personality keeps Oh What a Beautiful World engaging even when it flirts with sleepiness: Nelson can still make any song sound so personal, so idiosyncratic, it's as if he'd written it.

Donald Trump promised that his tariff regime would bring wealth and prosperity to the nation, but as it becomes abundantly clear that the misguided economic tantrum will result in higher prices for Americans, the president is advising everyone to simply buy less stuff.


	Trump said during a Cabinet meeting last Wednesday that, yes, tariffs will make it more difficult for consumers to afford goods, but it's not a big deal if “the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls.” He was asked about the comments during a Sunday interview with NBC News, and pressed directly if prices would be increasing as a result of his dispute with China.


	Trump reiterated that little girls didn't need “30 dolls,” adding that a person doesn't “need to have 250 pencils, they can have five.” 


	What? 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The golden age of American prosperity will apparently not be marked by lower housing prices, increased wage, and affordability of goods and services, but by arbitrary pencil rationing and fewer dolls? 

	











	He tripled down on the anti-consumerism pitch while speaking with reporters later on Sunday. “A young lady — a 10-year-old girl, nine year-old girl, 15-year-old girl — doesn't need 37 dolls. She could be very happy with 2 or 3 or 4 or 5,” the president said of the imagined example of personal austerity.


	Now, we cannot speculate as to what sort of abundance the Trump children were treated to on their birthdays and Christmas, but the average “young lady” in this nation does not have 37 dolls. It's unlikely that any parent — outside of the frivolously wealthy, fiscally irresponsible, or deeply out of touch — would think that to be a reasonable doll-to-child ratio. 


	As the president attempts to explain away the negative economic impact of his tariff war with China and other major trade partners, it's obvious the man has rarely ever had to pay mind to the day-to-day purchases made by his household — or even what the average American household actually consumes.

	The reality is that the president's unilateral decision to launch the country into one of the biggest trade disputes in its history will cost consumers money. Wealth hoarders like the Trumps may choose to only gift the young women in their lives five dolls instead of 30 — but everyday Americans who save for the Christmas season may struggle to find one reasonably priced gift for the children in their lives, given that retailers are already predicting shortages of toys amid the trade dispute between China and the White House.

	Last week, the Trump administration accused Amazon of engaging in a “hostile and political act,” after rumors emerged that the retail giant would list tariff-based price increases on their website. After Trump reportedly called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in a rage, the company issued a clarification that “the team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered listing import charges on certain products,” but that no such policy would be put into place. 


	Because of course, allowing Amazon to engage transparently with consumers about why things are getting more expensive would be to admit that the president made a mistake, and Trump can't have that.

	President Donald Trump wants to reopen Alcatraz.


	The notorious former “last-resort prison” on Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco shuttered in 1963 due to infrastructure issues and high operation costs. The former penitentiary was turned into a museum and opened to the public in 1973.


	“For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social tonight. “When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.”


	He added: “That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.”

	His announcement to reopen Alcatraz comes on the heels of his clash with courts, including the Supreme Court, as his administration refuses to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was illegally deported from Maryland to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador in March in violation of a “protection from removal” order barring his deportation to the Central American country. Trump has gone so far as to espouse that he would “love” to send American criminals to the El Salvador prison along with alleged gang members and immigration detainees.


	His post tonight went on to chastise the American judicial system for following the principles of due process. “We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally,” he wrote. “The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE. We will, MAKE AMERICA Great Again!”

	Trump told reporters tonight that “radicalized judges” who are holding firm that deportees be given due process prompted his idea to reopen Alcatraz, which he said, via The Associated Press, is a “symbol of law and order. You know, it's got quite a history.”

	











	A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement to AP that the agency “will comply with all Presidential Orders.”

	President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he is authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to start the process for enacting a 100 percent tariff on American films that are produced in “foreign lands,” also known as runaway productions.


	Trump called runaway productions “a national security threat” and claimed it's causing the movie industry to die “a very fast death” in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, adding that Hollywood and other areas of the country “are being devastated” over films produced in “foreign lands.”


	“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.


	“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!,” he continued. “Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

	











	In January, Trump named Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson, and Jon Voight as “special ambassadors” for the purpose of bringing back the film business that he claims is lost to “foreign countries.”

	Last month, Voight's manager Steven Paul confirmed that he and the actor had put a proposal together that they planned to present to Trump with a plan to reinvigorate American film and television production, though it was unclear what ideas were in their plan or if they had a confirmed appointment with Trump. One potential suggestion Voight and Paul might be floating is a federal tax incentive, something the industry — which has suffered economically in recent years from Covid shutdowns, writers strikes, and the wildfires — would likely favor. Overseas tax incentives have helped studios reduce production costs in the wake of economic challenges.


	In his post on Sunday, Trump did not address the television or streaming industry side, which have also relied on productions outside of the U.S. It is unclear how a 100 percent tariff might be implemented and how much of a production needs to take place solely in the U.S. to avoid the proposed tariff.

Sean Penn is not holding back when it comes to his opinion of Donald Trump‘s second term as president. Speaking on Jim Acosta‘s Substack podcast, the actor said he is concerned about whether Trump will attempt to remain in office. 


	“We should consider worst case scenarios,” Penn said, after speaking about El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele. “I do think it's a reasonable theory that Donald Trump is not unlike the spouse of someone who leaves him, perhaps for another, who then murders their former partner because if they can't have her, nobody can. And I think Donald Trump and his solipsism may have that relationship with the world and that this destruction is in part a power play, and also a literal intention of his final out.”


	Acosta then asked if Penn thought Donald would leave at the end of his term. “I think he might try to destroy the world before he ages out of life,” Penn replied. 


	Congressman Eric Swalwell, who also appeared on the podcast and is an executive producer the new film Words of War alongside Penn, added that there's never a “succession plan” with wannabe dictators. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“That's what worries me is if he doesn't believe there's somebody who can protect him, you will see him ratchet up what he's willing to do to the country to protect himself,” Swalwell said. “Our only hope is a Congress that will check it, a press that will report on it, a court that's independent to rule on it and a town square filled with Americans who say ‘hell no.'”


	Penn joined Acosta to promote Words of War, which stars Maxine Peake and Jason Isaacs and centers on Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was assassinated outside her Moscow apartment in 2005.


	“Those who think it can't happen here either have not studied the certain indications that it will, unless people are involved and they're educated,” Penn said. “We are tasting in our country what the Russians have gone through.”

	The actor also took aim at Trump during a recent interview with Forbes about Words of War saying that “we're absolutely there.” 


	“There's no denying it,” Penn said. “Sometimes, people are cautious or have performative sobriety when it is in the media, where they don't want to call it out for all that it is when this is a five-alarm fire. Let's keep in mind that we remember in President Trump's first campaign when he said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and nobody would do anything about it. The Supreme Court has now agreed with him. Joe Biden could have had him assassinated and faced no charges. I would not have been for that, and President Biden would never have done that, of course, but when things go as far as they do when society allows what is happening here now to continue, that's when you get Words of War.”

	











	Penn has been a longtime critic of Trump. In 2018, he wrote a scathing op-ed for TIME calling Trump “an enemy of the state.”


	“The solution to our current divisiveness does not live in the White House,” Penn wrote. “Instead, we will find unity only when we recognize that in our current president we have elected, perhaps for the first time in our history, an enemy of compassion. Indeed, we can be unified not only with each other but with Africa, El Salvador, Haiti, Mexico, the Middle East, and beyond if we recognize President Donald Trump is an enemy of Americans, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and every new child born. An enemy of mankind. He is indeed an enemy of the state.”

A mysterious photo believed to be of a massive 1,000-foot-wide UFO, hovering over the American Southwest, has gone viral on social media. Released by controversial former Department of Defence employee and activist Luis ""Lue"" Elizondo, the image has caught the attention of social media users who are now debating if the picture is real or if it has been digitally altered.

The grainy photo was allegedly snapped by a commercial airline pilot in 2021 flying at 21,000 feet near the Four Corners landmark joining parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado.

""Captured near Four Corners at FL20, estimated 600-1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped,"" the UAP Disclosure Fund captioned the image on X (formerly Twitter).

Several speakers confirmed DoD & IC hold hundreds of… pic.twitter.com/KHxkywz8JR



As soon as the image was posted, the internet detectives got to business and pointed out that the picture was really just two crop circles, commonly spotted in desert climates.



""This is clearly a crop circle, not a UAP. Mislabeling known terrestrial phenomena erodes public trust and undermines legitimate disclosure efforts. Please correct this mistake, your reputation is on the line,"" wrote one user.

Some users also compared the image to a side-by-side Google Maps pic to show that there was nothing ""alien"" about the media shared by the ex-federal officer.

“Are you guys serious? Have you never flown in a plane before? These agricultural circles are extremely common,” said another user.

After the photo and related claims were debunked by the social media users, Mr Elizondo released a statement, admitting he got it wrong but refused to share an apology. Mr Elizondo said he had been provided the photo by a pilot prior to the forum.

""The purpose of me showing the photo was to illustrate the need for civilian and commercial pilots to have a central reporting mechanism to report potential anomalous sightings,"" he wrote.

""In the end, whether a private pilot sees what turns out to be a cloud, a balloon, a tennis shoe, or a UAP, we need a reporting mechanism to ensure it can be analysed and resolved. This was the reason I shared the photo, and I emphasised that several times during the forum.""



As you know, I am always first to admit mistakes, but this is not one of those times. The facts regarding the photo I shared from a private pilot (as I emphasized several times yesterday during the forum) are as follows:1. The specific photo had only just been provided to me…

This is not the first instance when Mr Elizondo has come under scrutiny for his ""extraterrestrial"" claims, with the Pentagon also debunking his statements that alien life was present on Earth.

Do you remember a while back when the government admitted that UFOs exist and they've actually been stumping the government for quite some time?

You might not, because most people were more than a little underwhelmed.

Now, though, the FBI is admitting that they, too, have aliens on the brain.

Their not-so-secret office is tasked with investigating “unidentified anomalous phenomena,” but we only know about it now because it seems some (or all) of their agents are getting caught up in the current purge of government employees.

The FBI made a statement to Politico for the piece that broke the news.

“The FBI investigates Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena when there is potential for a violation of federal law – particularly unlawful acts that could adversely affect our national interests – and to gather, share, and analyze intelligence to combat security threats facing  the US.”

Yes, my fellow 90's kids – a real life X-Files.

Some people who are in the know, like former Naval pilot Ryan Graves, told Politico dissolving the office could be potentially dangerous.

“I am concerned that the FBI's UAP Working Group could be affected by transition changes, and these leaders might not be aware of the incredible work these agents are doing and how their investigation could be empowered as part of a formalized intergovernmental effort.”

Former Army special forces intelligence officer Ciason Best added his two cents, which is that shuttering the office would be “obviously detrimental.”

“The FBI is one component of the government that is starting to realize what other functions in the government have already known for a long time and have been participating in.”

This seems to suggest that the FBI has been working with the Pentagon's UFO office, and maybe that there are similar offices at other government agencies, too.

Only time will tell whether or not this office is lost in the cuts.

But remember, official FBI agents or not, the truth is out there.

A psychic psychiatrist perceives a wraith latching on to people in this neatly-realised, if somewhat familiar, beastie-horror

There are two species of beastie horror: your robust, reality-tethered monster movie starring a hungry shark, rogue crocodile or big snake, and the more supernatural kind in which the malevolent entity is not human, but perhaps more human-ish – your Babadooks, Bughuuls and Nosferati. It Feeds is in the latter category, about a shadowy thing whose MO is attaching to people and, per the title, feeding on them. He'll seem familiar if you're au fait with the likes of The Conjuring and Insidious, but he is at least neatly realised by the FX team.

Heading the human cast is Ashley Greene, known to Twilight fans as peppy clairvoyant vampire Alice Cullen. She is once more tapping into the supernatural here as psychic psychiatrist Cynthia Winstone, who is able to perceive the entity and is terrified of getting involved – although given the demands of the genre, we know that she will have to eventually. Also reporting for duty is former X-Man Shawn Ashmore, playing a twitchy father whose daughter (Shayelin Martin) is seeking deliverance from entity-based longueurs.

In 2015, the breakout horror hit It Follows creeped audiences out via a supernatural game of tag with a shape-shifter whose attentions were sexually transmitted. It Feeds isn't officially related but, in both its title and the idea of an unknown thing targeting people in a particular sequence, there are echoes. One for the jump-scare crowd, It Feeds is light on gore but heavy on the dark spooky wraith guy with thin, sinister fingers. It may not stick around in your memory with the persistence demonstrated by the entity towards its victims, but it passes the time chillingly enough.

 It Feeds is on digital platforms from 12 May.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

TV Comedy

What's the best episode of Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em? Probably not the one where Frank is busted for distributing hardcore porn, which is always a good one to throw at people to see if they really remember the show properly. 

For my money, the show probably never bettered “Have a Break, Take a Husband” from Series 1, first broadcast on the 8th March 1973. There's so much to love about the episode, featuring Frank and Betty's disastrous second honeymoon. Not least a boiling undercurrent of sexual frustration throughout, beautifully played by Michele Dotrice:

FRANK: Now don't do anything while I'm gone.
BETTY: Well I can hardly start without you, can I?

I highly suspect, Baby Jessica or not, Betty eventually figured out that she could actually start without Frank. She probably also figured out that she could finish without Frank as well.

But today's topic isn't Betty's sexual organs. Instead, I want to focus on Kenny, “a nervous and outrageously camp dabbler in spiritualism”1, a brilliant performance by Cyril Shaps.2 And what prop would you give such a character?





A copy of Psychic News, of course. Which was a real newspaper. And God help me, if you know this site, you know what nonsense I'm about to come out with. Exactly which edition of Psychic News is Kenny holding?

Answer: the edition dated 24th February 1973, where the lead story was about a BBC2 series called Leap in the Dark.



Leap in the Dark was an incredibly odd show. It started out in 1973 as a documentary series on the paranormal, and then started doing reconstructions of supposedly real supernatural events. By the time of its fourth and final series in 1980, it was an anthology drama. I can't think of any other TV show which has had that kind of trajectory.

The episode discussed in this edition of Psychic News was “A Question of Survival”, broadcast on the 13th February 1973. Sadly, it no longer exists in its entirety, although the BBC do hold some insert material from this particular show. In fact, the only episode of Series 1 which does still exist in full is the pilot from 9th January 1973. 

This episode is on YouTube, so you can get a sense of what the programme was like in this particular incarnation:

BBC Four really should drag this out on Halloween. Note that around 25 minutes in, the pilot features an interview with Elsie Sheppard… who also appears in a telesnap on the front of Psychic News, along with more information about her. So clearly “A Question of Survival” reused some material from the pilot.

Back to Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em. And at this point, we can accidentally get a bit overexcited. That edition of Psychic News has the cover date of the 24th February 1973… which just happens to be the studio recording date of “”Have a Break, Take a Husband”. However, examination of the front page of that particular issue reveals a University of London date stamp of the 23rd February. And if we take the masthead's claim that it was “On sale every Thursday”, then surely the publication date was actually 22nd February.

Still, the short lead time when it comes to broadcasting these episodes does mean that exactly two weeks on from publication of this edition, the finished episode of Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em featuring it was transmitted to the nation. Which I find oddly thrilling. Well, for a certain definition of thrilling, anyway.

*   *   *

The appearance of Psychic News on Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em reverberated in its pages for many years, perhaps unsurprisingly. After all, it surely wasn't often that the publication got shown full-frame on the BBC.

A week after the first broadcast of “Have a Break, Take a Husband”, in the edition published on the 17th March 1973, a column by Maurice Barbanell published the following short piece:

PN seen on TV
PN was seen large and clear on BBC1 TV last week. The so-called comedy programme, “Some mother do ‘ave 'em,”3 featured a couple's “second-honeymoon” stay in a hotel where everything went wrong.

The “psychic” aspect involved a wardrobe-shifting sequence.

The couple's neighbour, later seen avidly reading PN, accepted this physical “phenomenon” as an indication that his “dead” uncle was trying to communicate.”

Ah, “so-called comedy programme”. The ultimate calling card of a hack.

But at this point, Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em‘s endless repeats start having a rather odd effect. A year later in the edition published on 21st September 1974, again in Maurice Barbanell's column, we get the following:

Mum's not the word
Two excited readers told me that PN was seen in the “Some Mothers Do Have ‘Em”4 BBC TV series last week.

I can report that the star, Michael Crawford, who played a dim-witted husband, is no stranger to psychics.

In the programme a character expecting a message from his “dead” grandfather was seen reading PN in bed. One correspondent said there was “a smashing close-up” of our front page.

Two years later, in the edition published on the 25th September 1976, Barbanell is at it one last time:

PN is TV
PN appeared in the popular BBC1 comedy series, “Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em,” the other night.

I didn't see the programme, but people who did told me one character is depicted reading PN.

Then to his astonishment a rocking chair starts going back and forth, though nobody is in it.

I mean, forget speaking to people from beyond the grave, Maurice Barbanell now can't seem to remember what he's written in his own column.

So let's leave him, and instead give the final word to Elaine Mallaband, who had a letter published in the 15th September 2001 edition:

Psychic News Appeared On Old Comedy Show
Did anyone watch the hilarious episode of the old comedy series Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em in which Frank and Betty booked into a very shabby hotel to celebrate a wedding anniversary? They found several faults in the room which Frank tried to put right and made them worse. In the room opposite, the rather comical guest heard the bangings and thought that his ‘dead' grandfather was communicating to him. He had been sitting up reading a copy of Psychic News. Whilst he had been in the bathroom, his wardrobe had been purloined by Frank as theirs had been broken. When the guest was trying to sleep, his mat with a chair on it was drawn towards the door and waking up, he saw it moving, his paper on the top of the chair.

The programme, although old, was a tonic, as I had been feeling pretty low and dejected all day and I had a good laugh throughout it. I don't know how long they were first shown on TV, but I hadn't noticed the paper the guest was reading in bed.

Which is a lovely little story. I bet she was glad she wasn't watching the other side.

Sorry.

As I understand it, the hotel episode was the first script pitched by Raymond Allen (perhaps for ‘Comedy Playhouse' or maybe even Ronnie Barker's ‘Seven of One').

Which episode are you referring to in the first paragraph?! I've missed or blanked that completely.

@Lewis Cuthbert
It's series three episode five “King Of The Road” in which Frank becomes a motorcycle courier.

Sabotage attacks, assassinations and psychological operations have long been the hallmarks of intelligence agencies to create chaos and sow insecurity among rivals.

Russia's embrace of such covert dealings is the stuff of legend. Its infamous 'illegals' programme - in which Soviet agents led double lives abroad for decades while spying for the Kremlin - was a masterclass in long-term infiltration and espionage.

But in today's age of hybrid warfare and ever-more pervasive technology, the methods for conducting these operations have become faster and cruder - and the people responsible for carrying them out more disposable.

Now, in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine war and Moscow's relations with the West at an all-time low, the Kremlin has turned to a new class of operative: the freelancer.

Russian intelligence officers or trusted private intermediaries now operate like gig economy recruiters, trawling Telegram channels, web forums and job boards for individuals willing to smuggle, surveil or sabotage, with no questions asked.

Typically, the freelancers in question are by no means the highly trained spies of Cold War lore. More often than not, they are pawns drawn unwittingly into a grand, sinister game to do the bidding of Russia's intelligence services.

Many of them are petty criminals, drifters or financially desperate citizens approached under the guise of legitimate jobs as couriers, security contractors or other seemingly innocuous occupations.

Some recruits are unaware they are working for the Russian state, with plausible deniability baked into the system. Others know more, but are paid well enough to turn a blind eye.

In either case, the result is a growing campaign of sabotage, misinformation, and terror stretching from the Baltics to Britain.

Most recently, a bomb plot which saw explosives and incendiary devices hidden in sex toys and cosmetics was foiled before it could threaten a passenger jet or cargo plane.

Meanwhile, in Germany, would-be arsonists targeted US military facilities. In France, a macabre stunt at the Eiffel Tower claimed to mourn 'French soldiers killed in Ukraine' to provoke unrest and fear, and opposition journalists across Europe have been marked out for kidnap or assassination.

In July of last year, packages sitting in depots managed by courier company DHL in Birmingham and the German city of Leipzig suddenly erupted into flames.

At first glance the boxes, originating from Lithuania, contained a host of items that included sex toys, massage pillows and cosmetics. 

Investigators soon uncovered a more troubling layer to the saga when another package, shipped from the same Lithuanian origin point, failed to detonate and was intercepted at a Polish depot.

Inside, forensic specialists discovered a crude yet effective ignition mechanism concealed within the casing of yet another erotic gadget, along with traces of an incendiary gel designed to ignite on contact with air.

Polish security services arrested four people in connection with the blazes and charged them with participating in sabotage or terrorist operations on behalf of a foreign intelligence agency.

Before long it emerged that they were suspected of involvement in a Russian-backed plot to distribute the explosive packages throughout Europe. It is suspected the incidents were test runs for a plot to target US-bound flights. 

One of the alleged couriers was revealed in a recent investigation by the Guardian as Alexander Bezrukavyi, a Russian national with a criminal record and murky ties to Eastern European smuggling networks. 

Bezrukavyi had vanished soon after the parcels were mailed but was eventually captured in Bosnia, where he was on the run and attempting to reach Russia using forged documents.

Massage pillows and other erotic gadgets were reportedly found in a shipment that concealed incendiary devices that later detonated in British and German DHL depots

Bezrukavyi and his associates are believed to have been recruited via the Telegram messaging app by an account known only as 'VWarrior' that was offering hundreds of dollars for seemingly simple courier assignments.

The proposition was simple: purchase a list of items, package them and either deliver them or send them via a courier to another destination in Poland or Lithuania.

One associate of Bezrukavyi said: 'It could be true that the purpose of the parcels was sinister... We just wanted easy money, work that wouldn't involve drugs or weapons.

'It turned out to be some packages to test some f***ed up ****,' the man, who is still on the run, told the Guardian.

Had the incendiary packages reached their destinations, or worse, been loaded onto aircraft, the consequences could have been catastrophic.

Dr Samuel Ramani, an expert at leading defence and security think tank RUSI, told MailOnline that, had a package caught fire or exploded on a passenger jet to the States, an 'all-out confrontation' between Washington and Moscow may have followed.

When asked if people should be fearful of the threat posed by such operations, Dr Ramani said: 'Yes, people should be very vigilant - they should not take such a threat less seriously than ISIS or any other terror group.

'They are terrorists in the same way, very serious intent, strategic action, not just a rogue action, criminal for hire, this is a state-sponsored operation.'

In March, three Bulgarian nationals - beautician Vanya Gaberova, 30, decorator Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, and lab technician Katrin Ivanova, 33 - were found guilty of espionage charges by an Old Bailey jury.

None of them underwent extensive training programmes conducted by Russia's intelligence services, nor did they have any discernible background in the military, politics or technology.

Yet for three years, these individuals passed secrets to Moscow, travelling across Europe to spy on enemies of the state, journalists and a US air base.

The hungry-for-money Bulgarians were contracted by a man named Orlin Roussev, who, along with his right-hand men Biser Dzhambazov and Ivan Stoyanov, planned and oversaw covert operations from a warehouse in Great Yarmouth stacked with all manner of surveillance technology, fake passports and burner phones.

Their activities spanned London, Vienna, Valencia, Montenegro and Stuttgart, their Old Bailey trial heard.

At least £200,000 was sent by the group's Moscow-based handler, fugitive businessman turned Russian intelligence associate Jan Marsalek, to finance the operations, which were planned over 80,000 messages exchanged with Roussev over Telegram.

It was also revealed that Dzhambazov was sleeping with beautician Gaberova while instructing her to carry out daring operations.

Lab technician Ivanova, who was in a long-term relationship with Dzhambazov, only learnt of their affair after she was arrested.

The ring, which fell apart in February 2023 when British police raided several properties and took the Bulgarians into custody, is one of the most damning examples of the Kremlin's approach to outsourcing espionage work.





The two women in the group were referred to as the 'brunette twins' and were tasked with setting honeytraps for targets including journalist Christo Grozev, whose work uncovering the men behind the Salisbury nerve agent attack made him a target for the Kremlin.

Gaberova was intended to seduce the journalist in a honeytrap plot and sent Grozev a Facebook message, which he accepted.

'We can definitely record something for Pornhub too, that girl is real hot,' Roussev wrote to Marsalek in uncovered Telegram messages. 'She's a swinger too.'

One member of the group got so close to Grozev that she was able to capture the pin code of his phone while recording with a hidden camera.

Over several months, the crew wrote extensive reports charting Grozev's movements and recording detailed information about his accommodation, his vehicles and his contacts.

The spymasters plotted to kidnap Grozev to either kill him or excommunicate him to Russia. Thankfully for him, the plan was not followed through.

Dissident journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, editor-in-chief of independent Russian publication 'The Insider', was targeted alongside Grozev.

The spies also targeted a UK-based Kremlin critic whom they discussed killing with a poison dart fired from a drone, a Kazakhstani former politician, and a Russian lawyer whom they planned to bring to Moscow 'dead or alive' for a fee of £30,000.

Meanwhile, the spies were tasked with information gathering and infiltrating restricted areas.

For several months, the group surveilled a US military base in Stuttgart, believing that the base was being used to train Ukrainian forces in the use of surface-to-air weapons to down Russian fighter jets and drones.

Surveillance images and videos of the base were recovered from the spies' devices along with descriptions of the security measures in place. A car that was recovered had also been adapted to house and deploy technical surveillance devices outside the base.

Scotland Yard's Head of Counterterrorism Commander Dominic Murphy said the investigation into the group was the largest he had seen in his two decades in the field.

'This was spying on an almost industrial scale on behalf of Russia,' he said at the sentencing of the Bulgarian spy ring.

'It felt like something you would expect to read in a spy novel. This is not something we see very often.'

Sophisticated technology including rocks containing hidden cameras and a £120,000 device for intercepting mobile phone numbers was found at an address in Great Yarmouth

There have been numerous operations conducted on European soil since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine whose main intention was not to glean information or to eliminate threats, but merely to sow fear and discomfort.

One of the most high-profile examples of such psychological operations, known as 'psy-ops', came last summer as Paris prepared to host the Olympic Games.

A shocking stunt saw coffins draped in the French flag and bearing the inscription 'French soldiers in the Ukraine' deposited by the Eiffel Tower days before the games began.

Security footage captured the moment a white van bearing Bulgarian licence plates pulled up near the landmark before two men, dressed head to toe in black, unloaded five full-sized coffins and dumped them on the pavement.

All three individuals involved were quickly arrested, with Parisian investigators reportedly discovering material on the phone of one detainee connecting him to another group that defaced a Holocaust memorial in the French capital a month prior, according to Le Monde.

Both acts are thought to have been organised by Russia's security services, according to France's Foreign Ministry, but carried out by non-Russian nationals who were freelancers for hire.

One source close to the investigation told Le Parisien the stunt 'was to denounce France for getting involved in the war in Ukraine', adding: 'Russia wants to voluntarily disrupt France through various actions.'

The unsettling stunt came weeks after the French and Ukrainian defence ministries discussed the possibility of Parisian soldiers being sent to train Kyiv's fighters on Ukrainian soil.

BRATISLAVA - As Moscow prepares for Victory Day on 9 May, the only two European politicians expected to attend – Slovak PM Robert Fico and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić – have both unexpectedly cancelled their recent programmes, fuelling speculation which Fico has since denied.



Over the weekend, posts began circulating on X and in some media suggesting that Vučić and Fico might not be travelling to Russia for the 9 May celebrations, as reported by the Slovak daily SME.



The Russian outlet 360 speculated, without offering any evidence, whether the two politicians might have been poisoned to prevent them from attending.



Another Russian portal news cited a political analyst who also suggested the leaders could be faking their health issues for strategic reasons.



Vučić was briefly admitted to the hospital in Belgrade on Saturday after he reportedly fell ill during a visit to the United States, which he had to cut short.



Fico, meanwhile, made several last-minute changes to his official schedule last week, including cancelling a planned trip to the United Kingdom. No reasons were provided for the changes.



On Sunday, however, Fico held a press conference and confirmed that nothing has changed about his plans to travel to Moscow.



When asked about his health by journalists, Fico responded irritably, saying, “My health is none of your business,” though he did admit to ongoing issues stemming from an assassination attempt he survived in May last year.



“There are things related to the attack that sometimes prevent me from sitting in a car for four hours. That's all I'll say,” the prime minister stated at the press conference. He denied suggestions that he is unable to carry out his duties.



He also criticised recent remarks by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling them a threat.



Over the weekend, Zelensky stated that Ukraine could not guarantee the safety of any politicians attending the celebrations in Moscow, as that responsibility lies with Russia.



“It's extremely disrespectful for someone to tell the country that made the greatest contribution to defeating fascism and suffered the greatest losses: Go ahead and celebrate – maybe we'll throw a drone your way,” Fico said, ignoring the fact that it is Russia that launched the war against Ukraine and is bombarding it on a daily basis.

Extreme Weather:

As last week's power blackout in Iberia shows, weather can attract disinformation as simplistic explanations and conspiracy theories are spread on social media.

When a massive blackout plunged Iberia into darkness last week, one theory pinned it on a “rare atmospheric phenomenon,” fueled by extreme temperature variations in Spain that triggered oscillations in high-voltage transmission lines.

The explanation — attributed to Portugal's grid operatorBloomberg Terminal Redes Energéticas Nacionais — caught fire and spread in news reports and across social media. Meteorologists scrambled to look at computer models, maps and weather data to see if something in the atmosphere had caused power lines to “gallop” uncontrollably, a phenomenon known to occur under the right conditions.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo+site:livescience.com","Do other planets have seasons?","https://www.livescience.com/space/do-other-planets-have-seasons","Mon, 05 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Earth has four seasons, but do other planets in our solar system also have hot summer days and cold winter nights?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Every year, Earth follows a familiar pattern of seasonal changes: As summer rolls around in the Northern Hemisphere, winter creeps in in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.

But do other planets have seasonal patterns, too?

Indeed, other planets, dwarf planets and moons in our solar system do have seasonal cycles — and they can look wildly different from the ones we experience on Earth, experts told Live Science.

To understand how other planets have seasons, we can look at what drives seasonal changes on our planet. ""The Earth has its four seasons because of the spin axis tilt,"" Gongjie Li, an astrophysicist at Georgia Tech, told Live Science. This means that our planet rotates at a slight angle of around 23.5 degrees.

So, when Earth is on one side of the sun, the Northern Hemisphere is pointed toward the sun and the Southern Hemisphere is facing away, explained Shane Byrne, a planetary science professor at the University of Arizona. When our planet moves to the other side of the sun six months later, the Northern Hemisphere faces away.

Related: Is Earth the only planet in the solar system with plate tectonics?

Mars has an axial tilt of around 25 degrees. Because this value is so close to Earth's tilt of 23.5 degrees, the amount of seasonal variation on Mars is similar to our planet's.

""Just like on the Earth, you have permanent darkness and permanent daylight at the polar areas, depending on whether you're in the winter or the summer; then you can flip between those two states every half a year,"" Byrne told Live Science. But interestingly, instead of water-based ice, winters on Mars are dominated by carbon dioxide ice (or dry ice), which can form spidery cracks on the surface on the planet.

In contrast, some planets in our solar system have massively different tilts, leading to more extreme changes throughout the year. For instance, Mercury has no tilt, so ""there's almost no seasonal change at all,"" Byrne said. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Uranus has a 90-degree tilt, so the poles are either completely facing the sun, or not at all, meaning its seasons are intense: Summers are filled with long stretches of constant blazing sun, while winters plunge into perpetual chilling darkness.

But tilt isn't the only factor that drives seasonal changes. The shape of a planet's orbit can also influence seasonal variations in weather. This is because planets' orbits tend to be ellipses, rather than perfect circles. As a result, some planets are sometimes very far from the sun and very close to it at other times. For example, Mercury has an ""eccentric"" orbit, which contributes to its seasonal variations, Li said. Pluto, too, has a very elliptical orbit that pushes its variations to an extreme, Byrne said.

These two factors — a planet's tilt and the shape of its orbit — can also change over time. Byrne, who studies climate records on Mars, explained that the tilt on the Red Planet wasn't always 25 degrees. In fact, models, published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters in 2018, have shown that Mars's tilt has varied from 10 to more than 40 degrees over the course of billions of years. This has led to extreme fluctuations in the planet's yearly cycle.

—What color is the sunset on other planets?

—Do extraterrestrial auroras occur on other planets?

—Which way does Earth spin? What about the other planets?

""So it's almost just random chance that it happens to be similar to the Earth today,"" Byrne said.

""On Earth, we're very lucky, this spin axis is quite stable,"" Li said. Due to this, we've had relatively stable seasonal cycles that have persisted for millennia, although the broader climate sometimes shifts as the entire orbit of Earth drifts further or closer from the sun.

Such stability has likely helped life as we know it develop here, Li said. Scientists like her are now studying planetary conditions and seasonal changes on exoplanets to see whether life could exist in faroff worlds. For now, it seems as though the mild seasonal changes and stable spin tilts on Earth are unique.

The Trump administration is offering undocumented migrants $1,000 and paid travel if they agree to leave the US voluntarily, the latest effort to ramp up mass deportations and slash enforcement costs.

The Department of Homeland Security said migrants who self-deport using the CBP Home app will receive the stipend once it's verified that they've returned to their home country. Officials called the program a more efficient alternative to costly arrests and removals.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Blood testing startup Function Health on Monday announced the acquisition of full-body MRI scanning company Ezra and launched a new, 22-minute scan for $499. 

Function offers a $499 annual subscription where members complete more than 160 blood tests and track their results over time. The company said adding Ezra's scanning technology to its platform will allow its users to screen for more conditions and access a more complete picture of their health.

""It makes so much sense,"" Jonathan Swerdlin, the co-founder and CEO of Function, said in an interview. ""What labs aren't covering, scans can see, and what scans couldn't touch on, labs cover.""

Function and Ezra declined to disclose the financial details of the acquisition. 

Before Monday's announcement, Ezra's cheapest offering was a 30-minute scan that cost participants $1,495. 

Ezra, founded in 2018, offers a range of full-body MRI scans that can help patients detect cancer and other conditions. The company partners with existing imaging facilities across more than 70 locations in the U.S., according to its website. 

Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media. Medical experts have mixed feelings about the screenings, in part because they're expensive, can result in unnecessary care and can cause patients to worry.

Ezra's primary competitor is Prenuvo, another full-body MRI scanning startup. In February, Prenuvo announced that it closed a $120 million funding round, and it also launched a new blood test to provide insights into patients' hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and immune health. 

Ezra has raised a total of $44 million from investors, while Function has raised a total of $53 million as of June 2024. Function is reportedly seeking more than $200 million in fresh capital at a valuation of around $2 billion, according to a February report from Bloomberg.

Emi Gal, the founder and CEO of Ezra, said he has known Function's Swerdlin for years, and that the two began chatting last year about potentially collaborating through a commercial partnership. Over time, though, he said it became clear that an acquisition ultimately made more sense.   

""I'm pinching myself,"" Gal said in an interview. ""This is just a phenomenal outcome.""

The company was able to shorten its new scan time to 22 minutes by leveraging artificial intelligence that was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January, Gal said. The AI, as well as Function's ""financial prowess,"" helped reduce the price of the scan to $499, he added.

The new 22-minute scan will be available to Function members starting on Monday. Function does not publicly disclose how many patients subscribe to its platform, but Swerdlin said it's in the ""hundreds of thousands."" 

Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and the chief medical officer of Function, said acquiring Ezra was a natural part of Function's evolution.  

""What used to be the domain of the wealthy is now accessible to everybody, including comprehensive imaging,"" Hyman said in an interview. ""It truly makes a difference for people and saves lives.""

Netflix, Amazon, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount shares fall as studios reel from announcement

Shares in US streamers and production companies fell on Monday, after Donald Trump said he would introduce 100% tariffs on films made abroad, a move that couldsharply raise costs for Hollywood studios.

Trump's announcement on his Truth Social platform, revived worries about the US president's trade policy and its impact on the world economy.

Netflix shares were down 1.7% by early afternoon on Wall Street, Amazon fell 1.5%, while Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount dropped by 1.1% and 1% respectively. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost 0.6%.

The president said he had already ordered the commerce department and the US trade representative to begin instituting such a tariff, but his post did not say whether the levies would apply to films on streaming platforms as well as theatrical releases, nor did it detail whether tariffs would be based on production costs or box office revenue.

after newsletter promotion

Paolo Pescatore, a media analyst at PP Foresight, said: “It doesn't feel like something that will happen in the short term as everyone will be grappling to understand the whole process. Inevitably costs will be passed on to consumers.”

The tariffs could hit Netflix in particular because the US streaming company relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. The cinema operators Cinemark and Imax were down 2% and 3%, respectively.
 Despite their historic base in Los Angeles, Hollywood studios have over the years shifted production overseas to locations such as the UK, Canada and Australia to take advantage of generous tax credits and lower labour costs. The Hollywood strikes in 2023 secured higher pay and broader benefits for writers and actors.

Most of this year's Oscar best picture nominees were filmed outside the US, and a survey by ProdPro of studio executives, asking them about their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026, showed that the top five choices were overseas.

Forcing a return to US soil would push up production budgets and disrupt a global production supply chain that includes shooting in Europe, post-production in Canada and visual effects work in south-east Asia.

“The problem is that pretty much all the studios are moving tons of production overseas to reduce production costs,” said the Rosenblatt Securities analyst Barton Crockett. “Raising the cost to produce movies could lead studios to make less content.”

The UK media union Bectu urged the government to protect the country's “vital” film sector, warning tens of thousands of freelance jobs were on the line.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Follow:


            Eurosceptic George Simion won the first round of Romania's presidential election rerun on Sunday, partial results showed, after a ballot seen as a test of the rise of Donald Trump-style nationalism in the European Union.
    


            Ballots from nearly 98% of voting stations showed Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, 55, was in second place at around 21%, behind Simion's 40%. They will meet in a runoff on May 18, if final results confirm the reading after diaspora votes are counted.
    


            A Simion victory could isolate the country, erode private investment and destabilize NATO's eastern flank, where Ukraine is fighting a three-year-old Russian invasion, political observers say.
    


            It would also expand a cohort of eurosceptic leaders in the EU that already includes the Hungarian and Slovak prime ministers at a time when Europe is struggling to formulate its response to Trump.
    


            “This is not just an electoral victory, it is a victory of Romanian dignity. It is the victory of those who have not lost hope, of those who still believe in Romania, a free, respected, sovereign country,” Simion said.
    


            Benefiting from a wave of popular anger against mainstream leaders, Simion, 38, opposes military aid to neighboring Ukraine, is critical of the EU leadership and says he is aligned with the US president's Make America Great Again movement.
    


            An independent running on an anti-corruption platform, Dan, 55, overtook former senator Crin Antonescu, 65, a centrist candidate backed by the three parties in the pro-western coalition government for his spot in the runoff.
    


            He won substantial support among Romanians abroad - who have favored anti-establishment candidates such him and Simion in recent years - votes from 80% of ballot boxes showed, winning 26%, to Simion's 59% and Antonescu's 7%.
    


            Observers said he would struggle to beat Simion in the runoff more than Antonescu due to rivalries between him and mainstream parties that make it harder for voters to switch.
    


            “Eyes on the West, I believe that this is what the campaign should be about, about keeping the Western direction in Romania,” Dan told reporters on Sunday evening.
    


            “… (and) understandably explaining to the people at home the shortcomings we had in our relations with these institutions. They came rather from our own fault in not being active and prepared.”
    


            Sunday's vote came five months after a first attempt to hold the election was cancelled because of alleged Russian interference in favor of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu, since banned from standing again.
    


            Simion who only scored 14% then appears to have ridden an upswell of support for the far-right drummed by Georgescu.
    


            On Sunday, he voted alongside Georgescu, who called the election a “fraud” and urged people to take their country back. As dozens of people thronged outside the voting station chanting “Calin for president,” Simion said his vote was “to restore democracy”.
    


            “It's possible the diaspora vote will be enough to push Dan into the run-off,” said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University. “But Dan may have a harder time against Simion.”
    


            Simion is not the only MAGA-style politician seeking election in central Europe. Karol Nawrocki, the presidential candidate backed by Poland's main nationalist opposition party in a presidential election on May 18, met the US president this week.
    


            “Romania and Poland are two important countries for the United States,” Simion told Reuters on Friday.
    


            “We represent partners and we represent allies, both military and politically, to the current (US) administration. This is why it is important for MAGA presidents to be in charge in Bucharest and Warsaw.”
    


            Romania's president has a semi-executive role that includes commanding the armed forces and chairing the security council that decides on military aid. But Simion has said that, if elected, he could seek to elevate Georgescu to some kind of a leadership role.
    


            Observers say the country's leftist-led governing coalition might buckle if Simion becomes president.
    


            To date, Romania has donated a Patriot air defense battery to Kyiv, is training Ukrainian fighter pilots and has enabled the export of 30 million metric tons of Ukrainian grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta since Russia's invasion.
    


            The country's president can also veto important EU votes and appoints the prime minister, chief judges, prosecutors and secret service heads.
    


            The Trump administration has accused Romania of suppressing political opposition and lacking democratic values after November's election was canceled on what Vice President JD Vance called “flimsy evidence.”

			Huntington Beach haven has become known as California's Maga Capital

Along an idyllic stretch of the California coastline, a gaggle of bronzed surfers tackle magnificent waves whipped up in the Pacific Ocean by gale-force winds.

Most of the time, Huntington Beach is a surfing haven – but even when it isn't, nothing stops the long-haired, wetsuit-clad crowd who turn up with their boards in all weathers.

This is America's “surf city”, a title it fought a 15-month court battle to keep.

But in recent years, Huntington Beach has found itself another claim to fame as California's “Maga Capital”.

If the classic image of the west coast is of ultra-liberal, pot-smoking surfers, then “surf city” is a sign of the political revolution that is quietly under way in the Golden State.

Much of Huntington Beach's Republican resurgence has been driven by its surfing community, which locals attribute to Governor Gavin Newsom's short-lived and fiercely-resisted attempts to close beaches during the Covid pandemic.

The surfers here see it as a bastion of the “chill” surfing lifestyle that stands against the cultural mainstream and resists the big government instincts of state Democrats.

Today, all of the city council's members are Republicans – nicknamed the “Maga-nificent Seven”, who earlier this year posed in red caps emblazoned with the words: “Make Huntington Beach Great Again.”

Many of them are surfers or ex-surfers, including its mayor, Pat Burns.

Others involved in city politics, like campaign manager Richard Brown or local surfing legend Don Ramsey, sit on the board of the Surfers' Hall of Fame.

Huntington Beach's nine miles of palm tree-lined coastline is slanted south-west, where it can catch the swells thrown up further out in the Pacific for perfect surfing conditions.

“We have the most consistent surf... You can surf more days out of the year here than any other place in the world,” Mr Ramsey claimed.

The city is drenched in surfing culture. While the Walk of Fame in nearby Los Angeles honours film and TV stars, here it pays tribute to surfing champions.

When The Telegraph visited in April, the bleached-blonde wannabes hoping to get their name on a starry paving slab were struggling to make headway against the wind – one of them coming face-to-face with a sea lion as he toppled off his board.

A few bars of a Bruce Springsteen song being played on the pier could be heard before being snatched away by the gale.

Mr Burns and some of his political allies had ducked into Duke's, a bar on the beachfront where large, old-fashioned surfboards loom perilously above patrons.

“A cornerstone of surfing culture is you're relaxing, you're out there, it's just a chilled life, you know?” said Mr Burns, an ex-cop with a grizzled beard wearing a pink Hawaiian shirt. (Each of the council members were given one by the Surfers' Hall of Fame, which is based in the city).

“You're at one, just doing your own thing. That's kind of what Maga is – just let us live.”

Don Kennedy, a member of the council who was elected last year, agreed.

“If you look back in the 50s and the 60s, surfers were the outcasts – like, oh, there's just a surf bum,” he said.

“Now all that guy wants to do is surf. You know, surf, relax, listen to music. That culture is probably indicative of not wanting a bunch of government oversight or anybody on your back.”

In recent years, Huntington Beach's council has fought court battles against what they see as overreach by Mr Newsom's administration, declaring themselves an “anti-sanctuary city”, banning inappropriate library books and Pride flags, and are installing a Maga plaque at the local library.

Michael Gates, the city attorney who spearheaded the legal fights, recently left to join Donald Trump's justice department and quickly installed a surfboard in his Washington office.

Huntington Beach has long had a conservative streak, but it seems to have been galvanised by the Covid pandemic, when Mr Newsom attempted to lock down its famous beaches in April 2020.

The move drew a furious response – not just from local surfers but others who had flocked there as other surfing spots had been closed along the coast.

“Oh, hell, these people were p---ed,” said Mr Ramsey. “We said: ‘No f---ing way that you're shutting our beach.'”

Mr Newsom backed off following a legal challenge and negotiations between city and state officials, and from then on “surf city” became a centre of resistance to the California governor, later voting to outlaw mask and vaccine mandates.

Republicans took a majority on the local council in 2022 – a group of forerunners known as the “Fab Four” – and took a clean sweep later with three more members. All of them grew up locally and are keen surfers.

Mr Kennedy was one of them, recalling loading surfboards into a car and driving along the coast with his school friends to various surfing spots.

“Covid and closing our beaches and closing our restaurants really started to wake people up – like, ‘Hey, the government is really overstepping their bounds,” he said.

Now the city's leadership believes it is not just a Republican fortress in a blue state, but the symbol of a changing California – which hasn't elected a GOP governor since the days of Arnold Schwarzenegger – which has grown weary of Democrat overreach and edicts issued from Sacramento.

Earlier this month, Steve Hilton, the British political adviser turned Fox News host and now a Republican political candidate, launched his bid to become California governor in Huntington Beach.

Mr Burns claimed he is getting calls “all the time” from other cities who want to join its resistance against the Newsom administration, while Mr Brown, who masterminded the Republicans' clean sweep of council seats, believes Huntington Beach is at the centre of an unlikely political revolution.

“Sacramento has a target on Huntington Beach – they're used to threatening lawsuits and then getting people to capitulate. Our guys don't do that… we call our own shots and they don't like that,” he said.

He added, as the surfers nearby fought through the wind and angled their surfboards through the waves: “We're like the tip of the spear.”

			Kristi Noem says self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way for people to return back to their home country

The Trump administration is offering illegal immigrants $1,000 to leave the United States.

The Department of Homeland Security will provide financial and travel assistance to people who choose to travel back to their home country voluntarily, Kristi Noem announced on Monday.

Any “illegal alien” who uses the CBP Home app, which encourages people to “self-deport”, will receive a stipend of $1,000, paid after their return home.

“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,” said Ms Noem, the Homeland Security secretary.

“DHS is now offering illegal aliens financial travel assistance and a stipend to return to their home country through the CBP Home App.

“This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens, and is a 70 per cent savings for US taxpayers.”

Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement and the mass deportation of those in the US illegally a centrepiece of his campaign, but it is a costly affair.

Currently, the average cost to arrest, detain, and remove an illegal immigrant from the United States stands at $17,121.

While the administration is pushing Congress for a massive increase in resources for immigration officials, it is also pushing people in the country illegally to “self-deport”.

“Self-deportation is a dignified way to leave the US and will allow illegal aliens to avoid being encountered by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” the department said.

“The first use of travel assistance has already proven successful. An illegal alien that the Biden administration allowed into our country recently utilised the program to receive a ticket for a flight from Chicago to Honduras.

“Additional tickets have already been booked for this week and the following week.”

Just over 100 days since taking office, Mr Trump's administration has faced a series of legal battles by critics who claim he is overstepping his constitutional bounds on his deportation programme.

No case has sparked more attention than that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 gang member deported from the country earlier this year.

The US Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Mr Abrego Garcia's return after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March.

The White House initially has refused, insisting Mr Abrego Garcia is a member of the notorious South American gang, allegations his wife and lawyer have denied.

Elsewhere, the admiration is also thought to be considering paying “baby bonuses” to drive up birth rates.

Aides are mulling a series of incentives to encourage women to have more children and push conservative family values, according to the New York Times.

Proposals include a “National Medal of Motherhood” to mothers with six or more children, and giving every American mother $5,000 after delivery.

Also discussed was funding for programmes to educate women on their menstrual cycles so they can better understand when they are ovulating.

The announcement comes as Trump is fighting to suppress the news media on numerous fronts.

President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that his administration is implementing a 100 percent tariff on all films produced in foreign countries, denouncing them as “propaganda” as he aims to wrest further control over information and the media in the U.S.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that the tariff would help revive the “DYING” U.S. film industry. He dubiously declared it a “National Security threat” that foreign studios are “offering all sorts of incentives” to draw U.S. filmmakers to other countries.

“It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” the president wrote. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

It's unclear how the policy would be implemented, since movies are distributed in numerous ways and may involve foreign labor or locations for filming and other aspects of the filmmaking process. Several recent and upcoming blockbuster films like A Minecraft Movie, Wicked, and Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning were largely shot outside of the U.S. by American production companies. 

Meanwhile, American's access to fully foreign-made films, like the recent Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, could also be restricted under the tariff.

Analysts warn that the tariffs could not only devastate foreign film industries, but also the U.S. film industry, which is the largest in the world. Any potential reciprocal tariffs would also deal a major blow to American filmmaking, experts have said; last month, China already said that it would restrict imports of Hollywood films in retaliation for Trump's sweeping tariffs on the country. Sunday's announcement has already caused U.S. media companies' stocks to fall. 

Like Trump's other tariffs, any raised costs for things like physical media or movie tickets would inevitably be passed on to the consumer.

The tariff announcement comes as Trump and the right have carried out numerous acts of censorship. The right has spent years targeting thousands of books with bans, while the Trump administration has uplifted right-wing influencers, podcasters and news outlets as it attacks legacy news outlets it perceives to be biased against the right.

Experts say that the Trump administration's attacks on journalism are an attempt to erode press freedom and control the media, restricting information available to Americans in order to suppress viewpoints and demand fealty.

This has come through vague threats and outright attacks to cause capitulation, as with Trump's attacks on CBS and “60 Minutes”; credential revocations, as with the White House's attempts to bar the Associated Press from the press pool; and, on Thursday, an executive order Trump signed to defund NPR and PBS, which the outlets are challenging in court. In the order, Trump denounced the outlets as “woke propaganda.”

A recent report by Reporters Sans Frontières found that press freedom has hit a historic low, due in large part to Trump's attacks.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","DHS Offer for “Voluntary Self-Deportation” Could Harm Undocumented Immigrants","https://truthout.org/articles/dhs-offer-for-voluntary-self-deportation-could-harm-undocumented-immigrants/","Mon, 05 May 2025 19:59:50 GMT","

Accepting the offer could sabotage pending or future cases people might have in US immigration court, an expert warns.

The Trump administration on Monday announced what it called “historic travel assistance and stipend for voluntary self-deportation,” prompting one expert to issue a warning to undocumented immigrants who may consider the offer.

“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, a key leader of President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda. “This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens, and is a 70% savings for U.S. taxpayers.”

According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), immigrants who use the CBP Home smartphone application to self-deport will receive “financial and travel assistance” as well as “a stipend of $1,000 dollars, paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app.”

DHS framed the offer as “a dignified way to leave” the United States without encountering Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and claimed people who submit their intent to self-deport in the app “will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.”

Responding to the announcement on social media, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, stressed that “it is incredibly important for all reporting on this to emphasize that DHS's claim that people who do this will be able to return is, in many cases, an outright LIE that will trap people into WORSE outcomes for them than if they stayed and fought a case in immigration court.”

Reichlin-Melnick explained that “when a person is in immigration court proceedings, if they don't appear for a hearing, they get ordered deported — even if they're provably outside the country already. And having a deportation order makes it VERY hard to ever come back legally. DHS's offer would sabotage cases!”

“This move also raises VERY serious questions about statutory authority and funding sources. No law directly authorizes DHS to pay plane tickets and offer reimbursements to people leaving the country,” he added. “The closest legal authority which might apply here is 8 USC § 1260, which authorizes using funding to deport ‘aliens falling into distress' who are ‘desirous of being so removed.' But that law also imposes a near-total ban on reentry, so if DHS is using that it's even worse!”

Prism immigration reporter Tina Vasquez shared a message from the app on social media Monday.

“I previously reported on how the Biden administration's attempt to modernize the immigration system through tech actually made things for immigrants more difficult,” Vasquez noted. “I'm anxious to see how this app plays out in the deeply unfortunate cases where $1,000 is an incentive to self-deport.”

“I also know that if the Biden [administration] offered $1,000 to undocumented immigrants — even for self-deportation — right-wing media would have screamed that Democrats were paying ‘illegal aliens' with taxpayer dollars,” she added.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Europe is facing a transformative moment. Both Russian aggression and the Trump administration's political and economic antiliberalism are threatening the continent's cohesion and stability. In response, Europe is considering quick fixes, such as gathering more money for defense—through spending by individual countries and loans from the European Union—and forming smaller coalitions of states to bring together like-minded governments. These patches will help Europe muddle through immediate turmoil but will not solve the continent's most fundamental political and security challenges. Instead, European governments must design a new regional order through which they can achieve a more secure Europe.

The two main alliances of European states, the European Union and NATO, are too often paralyzed. The EU has struggled to implement much-needed reforms and is hobbled by growing differences among its member states. NATO, for its part, has relied on the United States to organize European security as the alliance's first among equals. An effective security and defense policy depends on a shared sense of political community, which a successive string of crises—including the eurozone financial crisis, Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine—has depleted. Without the disciplining power of U.S. leadership, Europeans must agree among themselves on exactly what they are defending and why.

Solutions thus far do not reflect the depth and complexity of the adjustments required to safeguard the European order. On one hand, there are state leaders, policymakers, and analysts who continue to insist that the continent can achieve greater unity only through deeper integration within the EU. On the other hand, European governments are trying to advance their defense and security interests quickly through ad hoc coalitions of the willing, in which small groups of states convene to address specific policy challenges—most recently, to discuss solutions for the conflict in Ukraine. Although these coalitions may get around the bloc's lack of political cohesion and offer speed and flexibility to meet urgent challenges, they lack accountability, oversight, and access to institutional budgets and integrated planning, all of which limit their impact.

European governments must instead embrace a different regional order. Without a systemic shift, the continent will not be able to weather the geopolitical storms that have unsettled many of its long-standing strategic assumptions, including the notion that it will always enjoy the military backing of the United States. To ensure Europe's long-term security and to address other pressing political challenges, European governments need to craft more fluid and flexible alliances. Instituting a new system parallel to the EU in which different clusters of European states can cooperate on select areas of policy would cut through many of the bloc's current bureaucratic and ideological roadblocks and allow Europeans to form a new, more self-sufficient, more democratically accountable alliance that better protects Europe's liberal order.

Through many crises over the past two decades, EU member states have repeatedly promised to reform the bloc's elaborate institutional structures and procedures, including those related to decision-making, budgeting, and citizen participation. Yet such changes have not materialized. Although all European governments believe the EU needs reform, they can't agree on the nature of it. Some member states benefit from the current setup more than others and thus resist a redistribution of power and resources, and most national governments are reluctant to fully cede their sovereignty. EU institutions, furthermore, favor technocratic management over disruptive change; bureaucratic inertia and legal complexity block ambitious efforts. As a result, the much-criticized status quo endures.

To get around the fact that the EU and NATO both struggle to respond to the kind of political disorder emanating from U.S. President Donald Trump's second administration, European governments have been drawn to building coalitions of the willing. This strategy has its appeals: leaders get to pick and choose whom they want to consult on any specific issue and can bypass slow and bureaucratic institutional processes. A prominent recent example is the coalition focused on Ukraine, which began with small meetings of European leaders hosted by France and the United Kingdom in March 2025 to coordinate military aid, training, and postwar planning for Ukraine outside EU or NATO frameworks. This model is now often discussed as a silver bullet to circumvent Europe's strategic paralysis. But in reality, coalitions of the willing are best suited for politics, not policy. Narrow caucuses composed of countries that can mobilize significant political and economic resources often end up excluding small and medium-sized states, leaving them alienated and marginalized. This is precisely what happened with the Ukraine grouping: after pushback from excluded states, the coalition was rapidly expanded to include 31 countries. As a result, it now includes several members that are either unwilling or unable to contribute significantly, which dilutes its effectiveness and illustrates how a mechanism designed for speed and cohesion can become just as unwieldy as the institutions it seeks to bypass.

What is more, ad hoc coalitions are too flimsy to organize long-term policy discussions and are not able to manage the overlaps between different areas of policy—for example, between climate change and security—because they tend to address single issues in isolation. Coalitions also do not benefit from the kind of blocwide intelligence sharing or command-and-control structures that are necessary to coordinate multilateral military deployments. Nor do they have access to the institutional EU funding critical to financing core objectives, including stronger security. What on paper may look like a breakthrough—European governments setting up meetings quickly—is in reality another instance of muddling through problems arising from systemic deficiencies.



For the past 75 years, Washington has not only supplied the bulk of the continent's conventional and nuclear deterrent but also designed, through NATO, the strategic security consensus around which European states have coalesced. Now, Europe is faced with a U.S. government that is at best apathetic and at worst antagonistic and that appears set on unilaterally shifting the burden of the continent's security onto its European allies, who must reorganize to fill the gaps. They have agreed to spend more money to build up European capabilities and ammunition stores. But a truly European defense requires strategic coherence on how to organize this effort: where, how, and to what ends this money should be spent. Recent objections from some member states to the EU's ReArm proposals to boost defense spending—in particular to the initiative's aggressive branding and focus on conventional military buildup over other priorities, such as border defense or cybersecurity—illustrate how a failure to find such common ground can undermine important progress.

The way forward must have some roots in current institutions. For instance, NATO's command-and-control structures and defense planning processes currently make up the backbone of Europe's defense, and the EU's defense-industrial policy levers, such as loans and grants, are essential to effectively organize European and Ukrainian rearmament. But these processes can take Europe only so far. NATO doesn't function without the United States, and EU member states do not fully trust their institutions in Brussels or one another. Ultimately, neither organization is set up to satisfy the myriad needs of European security.

A common defense, furthermore, must be based on shared political values and objectives. Neither EU nor NATO membership today suggests a state's commitment to the basic notions of liberal order. The EU has debated the issue of its members not sharing the same foundational values for many years, and the cost of its nonresolution has now become damagingly high. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's actions, such as supporting Russian positions and styming cooperation with Ukraine, are becoming more disruptive, not only to democracy in Hungary but to core norms of Europe's liberal order. The EU has in vain sought to persuade the Hungarian government to mend its ways. The emerging practice of EU leaders issuing statements on behalf of 26 states—the whole bloc excluding Hungary—is not a durable solution, either. The Slovakian government is moving in a direction similar to Hungary's, and other states may do so in the future. More radical ways are needed to move such countries away from vitally important areas of cooperation.

Conversely, some non-EU and non-NATO members should be closer to the heart of the European order. The EU and the United Kingdom, for instance, would benefit from brokering a new political and security alliance to urgently bridge the rifts caused by Brexit. There have been moments of cooperation, including around mobilizing military, humanitarian, and economic support for Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia. A relatively modest EU-British security pact is currently in the works. A better way is also needed to formally include Ukraine within the European order. NATO membership is out of reach and EU accession is too slow, uncertain, and bureaucratically burdensome to be of tangible help to Ukraine's immediate security imperatives. Brussels has pledged to reform the accession process to make it quicker and more immediately beneficial but has yet to fulfill this promise.



To ensure both strategic autonomy and inclusivity, Europe needs a reformed order centered on treaty-based cooperation among the continent's liberal democracies, including both EU members and nonmembers. It should be built around an innovative institutional structure in which different clusters of states participate to varying degrees across all areas of policy. Unlike ad hoc coalitions of the willing, this model would be anchored by an institutional core. Each cluster would establish its own governance arrangements led by the governments of participating states and would be subject to oversight—by an appointed intergovernmental secretariat, perhaps, or a parliamentary body composed of representatives from the cluster's member states. Countries would join these clusters voluntarily—likely through agreements on certain areas of policy—allowing for some overlap in memberships to different clusters. Nordic and Mediterranean states with complementary energy profiles could unite in a climate cluster, for example. Ukraine could cooperate fully with European states on foreign and security policies without having to wait for the result of formal EU accession talks.

There is no need to abandon EU institutions, laws, and processes that function well for certain policy areas. The body should continue to govern the continent's tech, digital, and trade policies, for instance. But the cluster model offers a way to break persistent deadlocks on other, more controversial areas of policy, such as defense or climate action, by allowing groups of like-minded European states to cooperate more deeply without the constraint of needing EU-wide unanimity. Although the core clusters—especially the one focused on security—would require a firm commitment to liberal democratic values, the memberships of others could be broader. Crucially, membership would not be static: governments could be suspended or expelled by the cluster if they violate foundational norms. And decisions made within a cluster would be binding only to the members of that cluster.

The flexibility of this model can help the continent establish clear obligations and joint decision-making mechanisms. European security experts have been calling for this kind of integration for many years. Yet in practice, policymakers have doubled down on protecting their own institutions rather than fashioning a much-needed new template for European order. The shock of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine led Europeans to launch a broad rearmament effort to defend the continent against military invasion. The shock of the Trump administration's ideological attack against European values—expressed most vividly by Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference, in February—invites European governments to rethink the basic parameters of their regional order. It is a highly welcome development that European leaders seem to be stepping up to take over more responsibility, but this is not the same thing as comprehensively preparing Europe for a new, more challenging era. Without big and tangible steps, the “new European beginning” that these leaders have so confidently announced will likely prove to be another false dawn.

            More than a week of delays at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey were caused after air traffic controllers lost communication with aircraft they were supposed to be controlling, and as a result took leave government employees use after experiencing traumatic situations.
    


            The controllers in Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control, which coordinates planes arriving at Newark, “temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them,” on Monday April 28, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a statement shared with CNN.
    


            The connectivity between Federal Aviation Administration radar and the frequencies that air traffic controllers use to manage planes flying in and out of the airport “completely failed,” a source with knowledge of the situation said.
    


            Five FAA employees took 45 days of leave as a result of the incident, sources tell CNN.
    


            Last summer, control over the flights arriving into Newark's airport was transferred from an FAA facility in Long Island, New York to Philadelphia.
    


            “They had to jerry-rig the connections that used to reside in Long Island to now go to Philadelphia and it's not working,” the source said.
    


            The staffing delays have pushed into an eighth, and unprecedented day.

What we know about the massive staffing shortage that has caused 7 days of major delays at Newark Airport



            By Monday afternoon, more than 150 flights into or out of the airport were canceled, with more than 250 flights delayed, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.



            The FAA issued a brief ground stop at Newark Airport early Monday morning due to low cloud cover, which has since been lifted, but the agency is still forecasting nearly four-hour delays for inbound flights.
    


            The FAA has indicated it expects more delays at the airport Monday due to the air traffic control staffing issues.
    


            The nationwide air traffic controller staffing shortage was compounded by over 20% of FAA controllers who “walked off the job” at Newark Airport, according to a statement Friday by United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.
    


            The comments angered some in the aviation community.
    


            “The controllers did not “walk off the job” as it has been reported by the media,” the controller's union responded Monday. “Due to the event, the controllers took absence under the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This program covers all federal employees that are physically injured or experience a traumatic event on the job.”
    


            “The controllers didn't just walk off the job they were traumatized, their equipment failed,” the source with knowledge of the situation said. “It's written in the regulations if they experience a traumatic event —they can take time off to go see psychiatrist.. the people working that day did that.”
    


            On Monday, Canadian travelers Greg Marszalek and Stephen Lance were grounded at Newark Airport by multiple delays on their way home from celebrating their fortieth birthdays in Manhattan.
    


            After two flight delays before early afternoon, they told CNN's Brynn Gingras they might forgo air travel altogether if they face another.
    


            “We can rent a car and just drive up to the border. Ottawa's pretty close to the border,” Marszalek said.
    


            Peter Goelz, former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the situation at Newark airport is “ridiculous.”
    


            “We have a very safe system, but anytime it's stressed like this, where you have controllers who are feeling under maximum pressure, it impacts safety – and people have a right to be concerned,” Goelz told CNN.
    


            “I'm not sure I'd want to fly out of Newark over the next week or 10 days. I might choose an alternate route, because you cannot expect humans to function at their highest level for sustained periods of time with this kind of pressure on them,” he added.
    


            Sen. Chuck Schumer, from New York, said Monday he directed the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General to look into the issues at Newark before they extend across the nation.
    


            “The chaos at Newark could very well be a harbinger if issues like these aren't fixed, and if the FAA can't get real solutions off the ground,” Schumer said.
    


            Schumer cited firings at the FAA due to cuts by the Trump administration and said the agency has had little response to his concerns.
    


            “We're here because the FAA is really a mess. This mess needs a real forensic look, a deep look into it,” Schumer said, adding that Newark's air traffic controllers have long warned the FAA of problems at the airport.
    


            About 225 flights into or out of Newark Airport were canceled over the weekend, with more than 950 flights delayed, according to FlightAware.
    


            Multiple factors have come together to create a nightmare travel week at the airport, including an air traffic controller shortage, a walk-off by air traffic controllers last week, runway closures and outdated equipment.
    


            Many of the affected flights have been through United Airlines. Kirby addressed the challenges in a statement Friday.
    


            The control facility responsible for traffic at Newark has been “chronically understaffed for years,” Kirby said.

            Kirby also said technology used by FAA air traffic controllers to manage planes coming in and out of Newark failed on multiple occasions last week, resulting in delays and cancelations that left thousands of customers with disrupted travel plans.
    


            Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Friday the outdated air traffic control system used by the airport contributed to the delays, pledging to implement a new system – one that could take three to four years to get working.

            Can a volcano rise from the dead? Uturuncu, a lofty peak in the Central Andes mountain range, is what's known as a “zombie volcano.” It hasn't erupted for more than 250,000 years, but it nonetheless shows signs of activity similar to those seen in active volcanoes, such as gas plumes and earthquakes.
    


            Satellite radar imagery taken more than two decades ago of Uturuncu — the tallest mountain in southwestern Bolivia — showed that forces inside the volcano had lifted and then lowered a region near the summit measuring about 93 miles (150 kilometers) wide, creating a shape like a sombrero. Scientists recently took a closer look at Uturuncu, to see whether ongoing deformation and other activity were signs that the slumbering volcano might be waking up.
    


            By combining satellite data with analysis of seismic activity and computer models of how rocks respond to different pressures, researchers pieced together a clearer picture of Uturuncu's inner “anatomy” and uncovered the cause of its unrest. They reported their findings April 28 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
    


            Volcanic eruptions typically occur when magma below a volcano surges into subsurface pockets called magma chambers, then escapes to the surface through vents and fissures. Eruptions are more explosive when magma is thicker, trapping gases so that pressure builds up and then suddenly releases, forcefully expelling magma as lava.
    


            But that wasn't the case under Uturuncu, according to the study. Rather,      magma, gases and briny fluids were interacting  in      a hydrothermal network — a system with activities that were not  fully understood — to      produce       the volcano's zombie rumblings.

            Beneath Uturuncu at a depth of about 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 kilometers) lies a vast reservoir of magma called the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body. Spanning roughly 124 miles (200 kilometers), it is the biggest known active magma body in the planet's crust. Prior studies hinted at an active hydrothermal system linking the magma reservoir and the mountain range above, but it was unknown how magma and fluids were interacting within this network.
    


            Using signals from more than 1,700 seismic events between 2009 and 2012, scientists produced high-resolution images of the shallow crust under Uturuncu. They also recorded electrical and gravitational shifts underground, and changes in rock chemistry, revealing never-before-seen details of the channel system beneath and within the volcano as it circulated geothermally heated fluid.
    


            The researchers found that as the magma body heated subterranean liquid and released gases, the gas and liquid migrated upward and collected in chambers below the volcanic crater. Their movement through Uturuncu triggered quakes, released steam and deformed the volcano's rock, causing surface rise of about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) per year.
    


            Uturuncu's internal dynamics not only explain its activity but also suggest that this zombie won't be reviving any time soon, said study coauthor Dr. Mike Kendall, a professor and head of the department of earth sciences at the University of Oxford.
    


            “We're not seeing seismicity increasingly rising. A bad sign would be an increase in seismicity, and then seismicity that's starting to migrate from great depth to much shallower depths — that's usually an indication that magma is on the move,” Kendall told CNN.
    


            “We're not seeing anything like that,” he said. “It looks like it's just the volcano degassing, letting off steam and calming down, if anything.”

            Using multiple techniques was a key part of bringing Uturuncu's subsurface structure into focus, according to geologist Dr. Benjamin Andrews, director of the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.
    


            In isolation, the methods investigating seismic activity, rock chemistry and physics “would give interesting but somewhat ambiguous results,” said Andrews, who was not involved in the study. Together, these methods point to a hydrothermal system rather than surging magma as the cause of Uturuncu's activity, and provide a snapshot of the interplay between magma, rock and fluid under volcanoes.
    


            “This (research) has importance for understanding volcanoes, granitic rocks, ore bodies, and the formation of (the) continental crust,” Andrews said in an email. It is also important to recognize that some volcanoes can be quite active “but not necessarily be primed for eruption.”
    


            Over decades, the Global Volcanism Program has recorded about 50 zombie volcanoes older than about 12,000 years but younger than 2.6 million years. Their signs of activity are “mostly geothermal features like hot springs and fumaroles (openings where hot gases escape),” said study coauthor Dr. Matthew Pritchard, a professor of geophysics at Cornell University in New York.
    


            As Uturuncu is one of many dozens of zombie volcanoes that scientists are tracking worldwide, the new findings could help identify which zombies are at risk of erupting. Some zombies show elevated surface temperatures and are already being explored as potential sources of geothermal energy, as well as for their mineral deposits, “but many are ripe for further investigations,” Pritchard told CNN in an email.
    


            “Some might be in a long, slow decline,  just cooling off from previous hotter times. Others might eventually have some  increase in activity,” he said. “But we don't yet know how to tell  them apart.”

            Peering at a volcano's internal plumbing could reveal possible targets for harnessing geothermal energy and accessing metals that are essential for technologies, such as copper, nickel and platinum, Kendall added. And this combination of methods could be useful for analyzing any type of volcano — not just zombies.
    


            “It's a really good way of better understanding the anatomy of a volcano, at what stage of development it is in,” he said. “That's very important for risk and hazard assessment.”

Live Updates


            • Immigration crackdown: The Department of Homeland Security said today it would pay undocumented migrants who leave the US and return to their home country. President Donald Trump said his latest policy will allow some migrants a potential path back to the US — but those who do not follow this process may never be able to return.
    


            • Tariff uncertainty: Trump told reporters yesterday that some trade deals could be announced this week. This comes as the president extended his trade war to the cinema yesterday, ordering a 100% tariff on foreign movies. He told reporters today he'll meet with US film industry leaders to ensure they're “happy” with his plan.
    


• Trump's events today: The president announced that Washington, DC, will host the 2027 NFL Draft. He is also expected to meet with an American freed from Russia, according to sources, and sign more executive orders.
    


            President Donald Trump met over the weekend with actor Jon Voight at Mar-a-Lago to discuss plans for reviving the American film industry, according to a person familiar with the matter, before Trump announced he wants a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the US.
    


            The president had named Voight, along with Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone, as his emissaries to Hollywood, though it was never particularly clear what that designation would mean.
    


            Voight, who has been a vocal Trump supporter, had been developing a plan along with his manager, Steven Paul for trying to revive the American filmmaking industry. The plan included ideas for tax incentives, but not specifically on new tariffs, according to the person.
    


            Trump posted on social media about imposing the new tariff on Sunday evening. How such a tariff would be implemented isn't clear, and it's prompted widespread concern and uncertainty within the industry.
    


            CNN has reached out to Voight's team for comment.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Donald Trump's tariffs as the president continues to say that American kids may have fewer toys under his trade policies, due to shortages and rising prices.
    


            Asked by CNN about Trump reiterating his comments about toys to NBC this weekend, Johnson said he hadn't seen the interview, but thinks the president is trying to communicate that “we had to disrupt the system, and we're going to have the desired results,” pointing to the trade negotiations that Trump said would be coming soon.
    


                    “Whatever short-term disruption there is or discomfort, I think what he's trying to say there, I think, is that it will all pay off in the long run, and I think that will happen sooner than many people anticipate,” Johnson said.
                





            Johnson also denied that pushing back key committee meetings amounted to a setback in the process to pass Trump's massive agenda bill.
    


            “I put reconciliation on the very ambitious timetable for a reason,” he said, explaining that it was “important to keep this momentum going, and that momentum is going strong right now.”
    


CNN reported last week that the House Agriculture Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will grapple with areas where there are major sticking points for Republicans, are now aiming to meet the week of May 12 instead of this week.
    


            Johnson said the meeting House GOP leaders had with Trump at the White House last week was “truncated due to other events,” and they needed more time to work through “some additional calculations” on how to achieve Trump's sweeping tax cut proposals.
    


            Johnson, who has repeatedly said the House will pass the Trump agenda bill by Memorial Day, said, “if it's not done before Memorial Day, it will be shortly thereafter, but our timetable is on pace, and we're going to get this done ASAP.”
    


            President Donald Trump said today that the US “will help the people of Gaza get some food,” as a total Israeli blockade of aid deliveries to the Palestinian enclave approaches its third month.
    


            “We're gonna help the people of Gaza get some food. People are starving, and we're gonna help them get some food,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
    


                    “A lot of people are making it very, very bad. If you look, Hamas is making it impossible because they're taking everything that's brought in, but we're gonna help the people of Gaza because they're being treated very badly by Hamas,” he added.
                





Some context: US and Israeli officials are discussing a mechanism to deliver aid to Gaza that bypasses Hamas, an Israeli source familiar with the matter and a State Department official previously told CNN. The official said an announcement could be made “in the coming days.”
    


            The delivery mechanism would allow aid to reach the Palestinian population with safeguards to ensure it is not diverted by Hamas or Islamic Jihad, according to a State Department spokesperson.
    


            For more than two months, Israel has carried out a total siege of Gaza, refusing to allow in a single truck of humanitarian aid or commercial goods. Israel says it cut off the entry of aid to pressure Hamas to release hostages. But some international organizations have accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war — which is considered a war crime.
    


            Cases of acute child malnutrition in Gaza are rapidly rising, one of the telltale signs of impending famine. Nearly 3,700 children were diagnosed in March, an 82% increase from February, according to the UN.

            President Donald Trump said he wants to reopen Alcatraz because it “represents something very strong, very powerful, in terms of law and order.”
    


            Trump was asked today at a White House event about the thinking behind his social media post saying he wanted to reopen the prison. He replied by touting Alcatraz's history of housing “the most violent criminals in the world.”
    


                    “Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz and (it) just represented something strong having to do with law and order. We need law and order in this country, and so we're going to look at it,” Trump said.
                





Note: Three people escaped from the famous former prison off the coast of San Francisco in 1962 and were never found.
    


Alcatraz was closed in 1963 because, according to the Bureau of Prisons, it was “too expensive to continue operating.” The site now functions as a museum.
    


            The president made similar comments yesterday, writing on Truth Social that the prison “will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.”
    


            Trump said the building now is just “sitting there, rusting and rotting” and some people in his administration will be looking into if “we can bring it back in large form.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration's latest self-deportation policy will allow some migrants a potential path back to the US, but those who do not follow this process may never be able to come back.
    


                    “We're going to get them a beautiful flight back to where they came from and have a period of time and if they make it, we're going to work with them so that maybe someday — with a little work — they can come back in if they're good people,” Trump said in the Oval Office on when asked about the Department of Homeland Security announcing it will pay undocumented migrants to leave the US.
                





            “If they're the kind of people that we want in our company. Industrious people that could love our country. And if they're not, they won't,” he added.
    


            DHS announced the policy earlier Monday. In addition to “both financial and travel assistance to facilitate” self-deportation, which a DHS spokesperson said included a complimentary one-way departure ticket, the agency said it would also pay an additional $1,000 to people who verify they have returned to their home country.
    


            DHS added that those who participate in this process will be deprioritized for targeting by immigration officials and that it “may” preserve the option for the migrant to re-enter the US legally in the future.
    


            “It will give them a path … to coming back into the country,” Trump said on Monday. As for people who do not opt into this policy, the president said: “They're going to be taken out of our country … they will never get a path to come back in. And it will be a much tougher process.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that he has “no idea” where the AI image of himself as the pope came from, even though he posted on his Truth Social account.



            “Somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope, and they put it out on the internet. That's not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI, but I know nothing about it. I just saw it last evening,” the president said in the Oval Office Monday.
    


            “Actually, my wife thought it was cute. She said: ‘Isn't that nice?'” the president added.
    


            Trump, who days prior joked that he would “like to be pope,” posted the digitally doctored image of himself wearing a white cassock and papal headdress, with his forefinger raised, to his Truth Social platform late Friday. It was then reshared by the White House on its official X account.
    


            Asked why it was posted to the official White House account even though it was artificially created, the president responded: “Give me a break.”
    


            “Somebody did it in fun,” he added.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday he'll meet with representatives from the American film industry to discuss his plan to apply new tariffs on foreign-made films, in part to ensure they're “happy” with the idea.
    


            “Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business. They have the nice sign and everything's good, but they don't do very much,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office a day after floating the new tariff plan on social media.
    


            The White House said earlier Monday that no final decision had been made on the new duties.
    


            Trump said his goal was to revive the filmmaking industry in California, which has seen a decline in production as shoots move overseas.
    


            “We're going to meet with the industry. I want to make sure they're happy with it, because we're all about jobs,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday announced the NFL draft will be held in Washington, DC, in 2027, bringing the biggest event of football's off-season to the National Mall.
    


                    “It's going to be beautiful. It's going to be something that nobody else will be able to duplicate that,” Trump said in a White House announcement.
                





            The NFL draft has become a massive event in recent years as hundreds of thousands of people make the trek to host cities to watch draft picks be announced. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who was on-hand in the Oval Office for the announcement, told Trump that the league expects more than a million fans to come to the National Mall during the three days of the draft.
    


            Trump also touted the recently announced deal to bring the Washington Commanders back into the district at the site of the old RFK Stadium in southeast Washington. He thanked Mayor Myriel Bowser for working with the administration since he reentered office in January.
    


            Bowser said she's delighted for the draft to come to Washington in two years and expects it to be a major event in the city.
    


            “The NFL bringing this event to the nation's capital will help us fill hotel rooms, restaurants. And Americans from all 50 states will come to their nation's capital and enjoy our beautiful city and museums,” she said in remarks at the White House.
    


            Goodell said it was a “special treat” for Trump to hold the announcement of Washington being the host city for the draft in the Oval Office.
    


            “The draft has really become one of the great entertainment and sports events,” Goodell said.
    


            Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris said football is a part of the fabric of Washington and presented Trump with a No. 47 Commanders jersey.
    


            “What a great day for Washington, I mean, to host the NFL draft in 2027 on the Mall, I believe we'll get over a million people, and it's going to be an amazing day,” Harris said, “and it'll showcase what Washington is all about, but it'll also showcase what our country is all about.”
    


            President Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said today that rebuilding and reopening Alcatraz, the famous former prison off the coast of San Francisco, “should be on the table.”
    


            “Well, we need detention beds,” Homan said from the White House, one day after Trump said that he would order the government to rebuild and reopen Alcatraz to house “ruthless and violent” offenders.
    


            “I think it is certainly an option, especially for the significant public safety threats, national security threats,” Homan said.
    


            When pressed by White House reporters how much it would cost, Homan quickly replied: “ I have no idea.”
    


            The prison, which closed 60 years ago due to its crumbling infrastructure and high maintenance costs, “will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social yesterday. The president later told reporters it was “just an idea” he had as federal judges pushed to ensure deported migrants had due process.
    


CNN has reported that the Trump administration has started talks with the Department of Justice on next steps for reopening Alcatraz, according to a White House official.
    


            A group of 18 blue state attorneys general led by New York sued the Trump administration this morning, challenging an executive order that stymied offshore wind development in federal waters.
    


            More recently, the Interior Department issued a stop work order for an offshore wind project that was under construction off the coast of New York, going a step further than President Donald Trump's executive order signed in January.
    


                    “This administration is devastating one of our nation's fastest-growing sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,” New York attorney general Letitia James said in a statement, adding the order “threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments.”
                





            James' office estimates New York's wind projects alone support over 4,000 jobs, with the potential to create over 18,000 more in future years. Several other states that have offshore wind farms in various stages of planning and development — including Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island — are also suing.
    


            James and other Democratic attorneys general allege in their filing Trump's order blocking offshore wind development “directly contradicts” another day one executive order Trump signed declaring a “national energy emergency” that called for a boom in fossil fuel, nuclear, and geothermal energy, while targeting wind.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.
    


            The White House says no “final” decisions have been made on imposing new tariffs on films produced outside the US after President Donald Trump said he would apply a new 100% duty on foreign-made motion pictures.
    


                    “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said.
                





            Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday he was directing the Commerce Department and the US Trade Representative to “immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.”
    


            He said the US film industry is “DYING a very fast death” and that “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States.”
    


            President Donald Trump said he had a “good and productive” phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan today, where the two leaders discussed multiple global issues, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and Gaza.
    


            The president added in his Truth Social post that Erdoğan invited him to Turkey, and Trump said he also extended an invitation to the White House.
    


            “During my four years as President, my relationship with President Erdoğan was excellent. We worked together closely on numerous things, including the fact that he helped return Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned, back to the United States — Immediately upon my request,” Trump wrote in his post.
    


            Trump referenced his first term and highlighted his “excellent” relationship with president Erdoğan. The Turkish president is a controversial international figure who has been criticized for alleged human rights abuses and eroding democratic norms in the country.
    


            Trump is scheduled to visit the Middle East next week in his second foreign trip since he took office in Janaury, traveling to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
    


            “In any event, I look forward to working with President Erdoğan on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!” Trump added.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security said today it would pay undocumented migrants who leave the United States and return to their home country.
    


            President Donald Trump has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the US, and the offer announced by DHS could incentivize people to leave the country voluntarily and supplement the number of migrants who are forcibly removed from the country.
    


            In addition to “both financial and travel assistance to facilitate,” self-deportation, which a DHS spokesperson said included a complimentary one-way departure ticket, the agency said it would also pay an additional $1,000 to people who verify they have returned to their home country.
    


            Migrants can verify their departure from the US using the CBP Home App, the agency said. DHS added that those who participate in this process will be deprioritized for targeting by immigration officials for detention and removal from the country, and that it “may” preserve the option for migrants to re-enter the US legally in the future.
    


            At least one immigrant has already used the offer to return to Honduras, the agency said, adding that several other plane tickets were booked for this week and next week.
    


            President Donald Trump's administration has started talks with the Department of Justice on next steps for reopening the notorious Alcatraz prison, according to a White House official.
    


                    “Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders,” the president posted to social media Sunday evening.
                





            The Department of Justice oversees the Bureau of Prisons.
    


Some background: Alcatraz was closed in 1963 because, according to the Bureau of Prisons, it was “too expensive to continue operating,” costing three times more than any other federal prison at the time. The landmark is now a museum that generates approximately $60 million per year, per the National Park Service.
    


            The US Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said today his agency will “pursue all avenues” to implement President Donald Trump's plans for reopening Alcatraz.
    


            “The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) will vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda,” said Marshall in a statement. “I have ordered an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps. USP Alcatraz has a rich history. We look forward to restoring this powerful symbol of law, order, and justice. We will be actively working with our law enforcement and other federal partners to reinstate this very important mission.”
    


            Trump acknowledged the symbolism of the move Sunday evening, telling reporters: “It's a symbol of law and order and you know it's got quite a history, frankly, so I think we're going to do that and we're looking at it right now.”
    


            It remains unclear how much it will cost – but the move is almost certain to draw legal challenges.

CNN's Hannah Rabinowitz contributed reporting to this post. 



            President Donald Trump is expected to meet today with Ksenia Karelina, an American who was freed from Russian detention last month, a US official and two sources familiar told CNN.
    


            Karelina, a US citizen, was serving a 12-year prison sentence on charges of treason for giving a small donation to a US-based charity that supports Ukraine. She was released as part of a prisoner exchange.
    


            Karelina flew back to Washington, DC, and was greeted by a group of US officials, including special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler, deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus, and National Security Council official Sebastian Gorka. She did not meet with Trump at the time.
    


            NBC first reported that Trump and Karelina are expected to meet. The White House public schedule said the president “welcomes home a returned Citizen” this afternoon.
    


            Missed the news this weekend? Here's a quick look at some key headlines from the last few days as you read in this morning:
    


            President Donald Trump is expected to announce Monday that Washington, DC, will host the 2027 NFL Draft, according to a source familiar with the plans.
    


            He will make the announcement, first reported by Axios, in the Oval Office at 1 p.m. ET alongside NFL officials. Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser is also expected to attend, according to the source.
    


            A spokesperson for Bowser did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Trump made history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl in February, and he celebrated the winning Philadelphia Eagles last week.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with National Security Council staff today as he assumes his new role as interim national security adviser, according to a senior State Department official.
    


            Rubio plans to split his time between the State Department and the NSC, the official said, adding that this dynamic is not unusual. Rubio had already placed a premium on spending time at the White House throughout the last few months, CNN reported last week.
    


            But officials at the State Department and the NSC still have questions about how this is going to look. Some expect Rubio to make changes to NSC personnel and strategy, and delegate certain diplomatic priorities to Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau — but how that all looks remains an open question.
    


                    “There quite a bit of disarray right now,” said another senior State Department official.
                





Remember: Rubio was appointed interim national security adviser last week after Trump announced that he was nominating Mike Waltz to serve as United Nations ambassador.
    


            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN that President Donald Trump's comments over the weekend casting doubt over his oath to uphold the US Constitution were “shocking.”
    


                    “It was shocking and it tells you all you need to know about this presidency and this man. That he doesn't give a damn about the US Constitution and that is frightening in itself,” Hochul told CNN's Kate Bolduan this morning.
                





            In an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” that aired yesterday, Trump said, “I don't know” when asked whether he needs to uphold the Constitution. Trump was also asked if citizens and noncitizens deserve due process in legal proceedings. The president initially responded, “I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know.” He later added that he was elected to deal with immigration and the “courts are holding me from doing it.”
    


            Hochul noted that she had to take the same oath 31 years when she ran for town board, “I knew I was supposed to uphold the Constitution. I got to think a president who took the oath of office not once, but twice understands that there are limitations and that is the body of the Constitution.”
    


            The New York governor added that it's important for Trump to keep his oath and follow the Constitution, “Otherwise the democracy that we fought for and upheld for 250 years is just going to go down the drain. And we're not going to let that happen.”
    


            President Donald Trump says tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States will eventually be lowered, after both Beijing and Washington appeared to soften their positions about potential trade talks.
    


            “At some point, I'm going to lower them because otherwise you could never do business with them,” he said in an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker,” which taped on Friday. “They want to do business very much … their economy is collapsing.”
    


            Weeks of tit-for-tat escalation between the world's two largest economies have driven US tariffs on Chinese products to a staggering 145% and Chinese levies on American goods to 125%. Over the past two weeks, both sides have appeared to moderate their rhetoric.
    


            In the interview, which aired Sunday, Trump acknowledged the toll the tariffs have taken on China, pointing to factory closures and unemployment “through the roof,” but insisted that he would not make the first move.
    


            “You're not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Welker asked.
    


            “Why would I do that?” Trump responded.
    


            On Friday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said the country was “currently assessing” proposals by the US to begin trade talks, but that Trump must “cancel” his “unilateral tariff hikes” first.
    


            The US tariffs have already started to affect China's export-reliant economy. In April, factory activity there showed its steepest contraction in 16 months, while new export orders dipped to their lowest level since 2022, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to official data.
    


            On Sunday, Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that he has no plans to speak to Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week. “But China and our people are talking about different things,” he added.
    


            Trump said he seeks a “fair” trade deal with China, while repeating his claim that the country has taken advantage of the US, in terms of trade, for years.
    


            Americans are learning what it's like to live with a president who sees no constraints on his actions and who apparently fears paying no price for them.
    


            In a blitz of recent policy moves, legal challenges, comments and interviews, Donald Trump is showing that he's shedding the last limitations of custom and the public's long understanding of how a president should behave.
    


            In an interview with NBC's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” that aired in full Sunday, Trump said for instance, “I don't know” when asked whether he needs to uphold the Constitution, three months after swearing an oath to do so.
    


            As always, Trump's attacks and expansive policy initiatives seemed aimed at shattering normality and wrong-footing enemies, while creating fear and the impression of unstoppable momentum among his critics.
    


            Trump is also honoring supporters delighted by his assault on what they see as disdainful and liberal-dominated political, legal, educational, media and military establishments. Top aides argue that his extreme actions are justified by his election victory and works — for instance, in his stemming of southern border crossings.
    


            But Trump's behavior also points to darker potential outcomes of a second presidency fueled by his belief that he has near-uncheckable power after a second electoral triumph that followed his defiance of personal legal woes and two assassination attempts.
    


            The administration is repeatedly defying federal courts — in one case even the Supreme Court, over the fate of an undocumented migrant whose return it ordered the administration to “facilitate.” Trump is meanwhile wielding vast executive power against institutions that he wants to silence, including law firms and universities.
    


            And his sense of personal omnipotence sometimes seems to be leading the country toward authoritarianism. He said on NBC he wasn't “looking at” running for a third term in 2028 — as if it's a personal choice whether he obeys the Constitution on which US democracy depends.

            In a wide-ranging interview that aired yesterday on NBC's “Meet the Press,” President Donald Trump floated potential successors, discussed taking Greenland by military force, said he doesn't know if he's beholden to the US Constitution, and doled out blame and credit for the state of the US economy.
    


If you unplugged for the weekend, here are the key moments from the interview:



            • Deportations and the Constitution: Trump said he doesn't know if he has to uphold constitutional rights to due process as he carries out his sweeping immigration crackdown, though he said he'll abide by Supreme Court rulings.
    


            Asked directly if it's his duty as president to uphold the Constitution, Trump said, “I don't know.”
    


            • Annexing Greenland: Trump would not rule out using military force to take Greenland, insisting again that the resource-rich island is needed for national security purposes.
    


            • Potential successors: The president said he is “not looking at” running for a constitutionally prohibited third term, despite his own recent statements and his organization's sale of “Trump 2028” hats. Asked about a possible successor, Trump praised Vice President JD Vance and his secretary of state and now-interim national security adviser, Marco Rubio.
    


            • Projecting confidence on the economy: Trump blamed his predecessor for the flagging US economy while touting his own efforts, saying “good parts are the ‘Trump economy' and the bad parts are the ‘Biden economy.'”
    


            Asked if he's worried about the volatile stock market and possibility of a recession, Trump pointed to recent market gains and said “anything can happen,” but even a short-term economic downturn would be followed by long-term success. That optimism is not shared by most Americans, a new CNN poll finds.
    


            • Fed chief's future: ﻿While Trump has repeatedly attacked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, the president indicated he will not fire Powell and is content to wait for his term to end in 2026.
    


            • Military parade: Trump said there will be a “big, beautiful” military parade in Washington, DC, on June 14 — the Army's 250th birthday celebration and the president's 79th. He would not provide a cost for the event.

Israel approved plans on Monday to capture the entire Gaza Strip and remain in the territory for an unspecified amount of time, two Israeli officials said, in a move that if implemented would vastly expand Israel's operations in the Palestinian territory and likely bring fierce international opposition.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel approved plans Monday to seize the Gaza Strip and to stay in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time, two Israeli officials said, a move that, if implemented, would vastly expand Israel's operations there and likely draw fierce international opposition.

The new plan, which was approved in an early morning vote by Israeli Cabinet ministers, also calls for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move to Gaza's south. That would likely amount to their forcible displacement and exacerbate an already dire humanitarian crisis.

Details of the plan were not formally announced, and its exact timing and implementation were not clear. Its approval came hours after the Israeli military chief said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers. The plan may be another measure by Israel to try to pressure Hamas into making concessions in ceasefire negotiations.

A third person, a defense official, said the new plan would not begin until after U.S. President Donald Trump wraps up his expected visit to the Middle East this month, allowing for the possibility that Israel might agree to a ceasefire in the meantime. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing military plans.

AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on Israel's new plan to take over the whole of Gaza and stay there indefinitely.

The plan emerged on the same day that Israel's military said it carried out airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen's Red Sea city of Hodeida. Those strikes came a day after the Iranian-backed rebels launched a missile that hit Israel's main airport.




Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 after a decades-long occupation and then imposed a blockade on the territory along with Egypt. Capturing and potentially occupying the territory again for an indefinite period would not only further dash hopes for Palestinian statehood, it would embed Israel inside a population that is deeply hostile to it and raise questions about how Israel plans to govern the territory, especially at a time when it is considering how to implement Trump's vision to take over Gaza.

Since Israel ended a ceasefire with the Hamas militant group in mid-March, Israel has unleashed fierce strikes on the territory that have killed hundreds. It has captured swaths of territory and now controls roughly 50% of Gaza. Before the truce ended, Israel halted all humanitarian aid into the territory, including food, fuel and water, setting off what is believed to the be the worst humanitarian crisis in nearly 19 months of war.




The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages. Israel says 59 captives remain in Gaza, although about 35 are believed to be dead.

Israel's offensive has displaced more than 90% of Gaza's population and, Palestinian health officials say, killed more than 52,000 people there, many of them women and children. The officials do not distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count.

At least 42 people were killed by Israeli strikes from Sunday through Monday afternoon, according to hospitals and the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. The Israeli military offered no immediate comment on the strikes.



Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday cabinet ministers had decided on a “powerful operation in Gaza,” including “a movement of the population to protect it.”

The plan also imposes Israeli control over aid distribution. Israel accuses Hamas of diverting aid for its own use or to distribute to strengthen its rule in Gaza, though Israel has not provided evidence. A spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian office, Jens Laerke, denied there was significant diversion of aid, saying the U.N. employs “a solid system to monitor and prevent” such theft.

The officials said Israel was in touch with several countries about Trump's plan to take over Gaza and relocate its population, under what Israel has termed “voluntary emigration.” That proposal has drawn widespread condemnation, including from Israel's allies in Europe, and rights groups have warned it could be a war crime under international law.

For weeks, Israel has been trying to ratchet up pressure on Hamas to get the group to agree to its terms in ceasefire negotiations. But the measures do not appear to have moved Hamas away from its negotiating positions.

The previous ceasefire was meant to lead the sides to negotiate an end to the war, but that has remained elusive. Israel says it will not agree to end the war until Hamas' governing and military capabilities are dismantled. Hamas, meanwhile, has sought an agreement that winds down the war without agreeing to disarm. 

Israel's expansion announcement angered families of hostages who fear that any extension of the conflict endangers their loved ones. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which supports families, urged Israel's decision-makers to prioritize the hostages and secure a deal quickly.

At a Knesset committee meeting Monday, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is being held hostage, called on soldiers “not to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.”

Some reservists have indicated they will refuse to serve in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.

The defense official said the plan would “separate” Hamas from the aid by using private firms and by using specified areas secured by the Israeli military. The official added that Palestinians would be screened to prevent Hamas from accessing the aid.

According to a memo circulated among aid groups and seen by The Associated Press, Israel told the United Nations that it will use private security companies to control aid distribution in Gaza. The U.N., in a statement Sunday, said it would not participate in the plan as presented, saying it violates its core principles.

The memo summarized a meeting between the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, called COGAT, and the U.N. It was written by a group briefed on the meeting and sent Sunday to aid organizations.

According to the memo, under COGAT's plan, all aid will enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, on approximately 60 trucks daily, and be distributed directly to people. Some 500 trucks entered Gaza every day before the war.

The memo said that facial-recognition technology will be used to identify Palestinians at logistics hubs and text message alerts will notify people in the area that they can collect aid.

COGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After Israel said it was going to assert more control over aid distribution in Gaza, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs sent an email to aid groups, urging them to reject any “draconian restrictions on humanitarian work.”

The email, which OCHA sent Monday to aid groups and was shared with the AP, further stated that there are mechanisms in place to ensure aid is not diverted.

Earlier, OCHA said in a statement that the plan would leave large parts of the population, including the most vulnerable, without supplies. It said the plan “appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy.”

Aid groups have said they are opposed to using any armed or uniformed personnel to distribute aid that could potentially intimidate Palestinians or put them at risk.

Hamas decried Israel's efforts to control distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza as a violation of international law.

In a statement Monday, the militant group said the effort is “an extension of the starvation policy” adopted by the Israeli government in Gaza.

ATLANTA (AP) — The billionaire heir and the former bartender.

Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Donald Trump and his second administration. But two disparate figures, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party. 

The governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists. 

But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? And beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have?

What links them, said one prominent Democrat, is “assertiveness.”

“People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures –- but in very different ways.”








Pritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues.

He chaired Illinois' Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family's hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events.

When Democratic President Joe Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state.

“Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,” Pritzker said in Chicago. 

Since Harris' defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation's highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich. 

“If you think I'm overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” the governor said his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. “All I'm saying is when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.”

Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets.

“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,” he said. Democrats, he added, “must castigate (Republicans) on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.”

It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it “terrible hypocrisy” for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters. 





Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary. 

Like Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump's right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites.

She has recently headlined “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. 

Ocasio-Cortez's next political move seems less certain than Pritzker's. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement.

She freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she's made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. 

“For years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,” she said in Folsom, California. She advocated for “living wages … stable housing … guaranteed health care,” and blasted “the agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.”

She also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: impossible is nothing.”



Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisers to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions.

Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An East Coast patrician, Roosevelt authored the New Deal's federal expansion to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s.

“How powerful would it be if a billionaire was the one helping to lead the charge against corrupt billionaires and corrupt billionaire corporations that are trying to crack the Constitution and loot the American people?” Green said, adding that “continued silence” on “billionaire issues” should disqualify Pritzker. “We have to be speaking to the shake-up-the-system vibe that people want to see.”

Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump's argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump's biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people's lives.

“People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he's rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla CEO who is leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. “They're mad at him because he's vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.”

A relative of the governor, Rachel Pritzker, chairs Third Way's board of trustees.

Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn't resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders' tour. 

Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” 

Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration “over their needs not being met.” It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the U.S. 

Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice.

“She's very good at what she does. She's formidable,” he said. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.”

In the criminal indictment for this week's sex trafficking trial of Sean ‘Diddy' Combs, the document lists many of the hip-hop mogul's aliases.

Most people, especially music fans, probably already know them.

From “Puff Daddy” to “P. Diddy” and even the obscure “Brother Love,” here's a look back at Combs' self-appointed names and what was going on during his career in each era.

His childhood nickname was Puffy because, as he told Jet Magazine in 1998, he used to huff and puff when he got mad. Hence the early stage names: Puffy and Puff Daddy. In these days, he was side by side with fellow New York City rapper Notorious B.I.G., the star of Combs' Bad Boy record label. 

In 1998, Combs won two Grammys as Puff Daddy, one for best rap album for his debut “No Way Out” and another for best rap performance by a duo or group for “I'll Be Missing You” with Faith Evans. The song memorialized Notorious B.I.G., who was fatally shot in 1997 in a case that remains unsolved. This was during the East vs. West rap rivalry, particularly with Tupac Shakur from California and his team at Death Row Records. Shakur was fatally shot in 1996. 

Combs also started his fashion line Sean John, his first and middle name, in 1998.




The shift to P. Diddy unfolded in 2001, not long after Combs was acquitted of gun and bribery charges from when he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a shooting that wounded three people at a New York City nightclub. Some witnesses told police that Combs was among the people shooting in the club.

Combs noted at the time that Notorious B.I.G. came up with the nickname P. Diddy. Under this new name, Combs reached new heights of success. He became the producer and star of the talent-search TV show “Making the Band” in 2002, performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004 and weeks later won a Grammy for best rap performance by a duo or group for “Shake Ya Tailfeather.”

He dropped the “P.” from his artist nickname in 2005. He told the “Today” show at the time that fans at concerts weren't doing well chanting P. Diddy. Still, he ran into issues in trying to use Diddy for his 2006 album “Press Play” due to a lawsuit by British DJ Richard “Diddy” Dearlove over the use of the name. Combs used P. Diddy for some releases of the album as a result.

His legal issues and his stardom continued. In 2008, Diddy settled a lawsuit brought by a man who claims Diddy punched him after a post-Oscar party outside a Hollywood hotel the previous year. Roughly two months later, Combs is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

For just a week in May 2011, Combs changed his name to “Swag,” posting in a video online that it was part of his “comeback” after a bad illness. 

He posted on social media in November 2017 that he was celebrating his birthday by changing his name to “Love, a.k.a. Brother Love.” Combs said he would not be answering to Puffy, Diddy, Puff Daddy or any of his other monikers. He said at the time that he knew it was risky and would be corny to change his name again, but he said he had changed as a person and was not who he was before. Later that month, he said was joking about the name change and people could use any of his older names.

In 2021, he announced that he had legally changed his middle name to Love. A year later, he clarified on the “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that Diddy remains his stage name. He released “The Love Album - Off the Grid” in 2023.

At his sex trafficking trial Monday, the judge read off a list of his monikers to prospective jurors, telling them, “There is one defendant: Sean Combs.”

Retired ICE field director John Fabbricatore joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the Department of Justice suing Colorado and the city of Denver for their sanctuary city policies. 

The Department of Justice sued the state of Colorado and the city of Denver for allegedly interfering with federal immigration enforcement.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in Colorado District Court, accuses the state and its most populous city of implementing ""sanctuary laws"" in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.

""The United States has well-established, preeminent, and preemptive authority to regulate immigration matters,"" the lawsuit reads.

Sanctuary cities refer to areas that seek to protect migrants without legal status and that have limited cooperation with federal officials to enforce immigration laws.

OVER 100 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARRESTED IN COLORADO SPRINGS MASSIVE UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB RAID

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforces federal immigration laws across the country but solicits support from state and local officials, particularly for large-scale deportations. The agency also asks police departments and sheriff's offices to flag migrants it wants to deport and hold them until federal agents can take custody.

The Department of Justice has filed similar lawsuits challenging ""sanctuary policies"" in Rochester, New York, and Chicago.

Attorneys for the department argue Colorado's ""sanctuary policies"" allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) to seize control of an apartment complex in the Denver suburb of Aurora.

Local officials have described President Donald Trump's claims that the gang had taken over large areas of the city as exaggerated, but admitted that the apartment complex was terrorized, including by people with links to TdA.

The lawsuit in Colorado lists the defendants as Gov. Jared Polis, the state Legislature, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.

Polis' office said Colorado is not a sanctuary state and regularly works with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.

""If the courts say that any Colorado law is not valid then we will follow the ruling,"" spokesperson Conor Cahill told The Associated Press. ""We are not going to comment on the merits of the lawsuit.""

Republicans in Congress have attempted to pressure officials in Democratic-led cities to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration policies, which include promises of mass deportations. 

The GOP lawmakers summoned the mayors of Denver, Boston, New York City and Chicago to testify last month before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. However, the mayors pushed back and defended their cities as welcoming places and not lawless danger zones. The mayors also called on Congress to pass immigration reform.

Is today's potential ""Black Monday"" the beginning of the end or can the Trump Administration's end game turn things around? Plus, Will sits down with Robby Starbuck, the man behind the dismantling of DEI and 'Woke' policies in corporate America. 

President Trump is vehemently opposed to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). He made it clear during his inaugural address that DEI will no longer be part of the federal government staffing process. He views DEI as discriminatory, advocating for race-blind and merit-based hiring and evaluation, focusing on supporting and rewarding the best talent available. 

 When one looks more closely at what the president opposes about DEI, he is focused on the dark side of DEI, namely tokenism. This is when DEI is used to define outcomes and reward performance that does not align with merit, rather than create opportunities.

Yet there already exists a model for DEI on college campuses that would be consistent with the president's views, namely, how student athletes are recruited for college sports and how coaches are developed and hired.

DEFUNDING DEI: HERE'S HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDONE BIDEN'S VERY PRIZED PROGRAMS

Every college sport's team strives to be the very best. They seek to compete at the highest level, winning conference titles, and for some, national championships.

As anyone who has played a sport at some point in their life, the skills of the participants are critical factors for success on the playing field. That is why recruiting is such an important activity of college coaches and their staff.

Take for example, men's college basketball, which recently completed their season. Both ESPN and 247 Sports rank the top high school seniors, providing an evaluation of their performance that benefits coaches and informs fans. These rankings are then used to assess the quality of each college's incoming freshman class, a reasonable predictor of future success on the court. 

Of course, the ease at which players can move between schools via the transfer portal creates a cloud of uncertainty around such school rankings. Names, Images, and Likeness (NIL) contracts also play a critical role in where players choose to play, as the once scorned ""pay to play"" model has now become the norm.

Nonetheless, attracting the very best talent to a team, independent of how it is done, is always a high priority to enable success on the court. 

Yet talent on the court can be squandered without quality coaching. The primary objective of every athletic director is to facilitate successful programs that develop student-athletes into good citizens, both on and off the court. Their objective is to hire the best available coaches who can build a winning culture. This means that hiring decisions are naturally driven by merit. However, with a highly diverse pool of candidates to pick from, diversity is naturally built into the merit-based selection process.

Of greater importance is that the players themselves are recruited based on merit. They all want to be part of winning programs. Striving to have winning programs demands winning coaches, all of which takes time to develop and nurture.

What college sports teach is that success comes from using merit as the primary metric to assemble teams and coaching staff. It also tells us that a large pool of potential (and interested) student athletes who wish to become future coaches means that there are many applicants to draw from, a key driver for permitting coaching staffs to resemble the pool of players.

The lesson learned here is that creating diverse campuses based on merit demands a diverse pipeline. This does not begin at faculty and student recruiting committees and in DEI offices on campuses, but in K-12 schools, and perhaps in the homes of these children, where future leaders are being nurtured and honed.

Such efforts are the long game for enhancing diversity on campuses, and in society. Attempts to sidestep the necessary investments to create a high-quality pipeline leads to suboptimal outcomes. The Supreme Court ruling ending affirmative action admissions and actions taken by the University of Michigan and the challenges that they had with their DEI programs suggest that shortcuts are not the solution.

As aspirational as diversity is, without merit, diversity is tainted. The two can and should walk together, so that when diversity excels, merit stands tall with it, just as it does on the playing fields in college sports.

College sports provides an informative model for enhancing diversity within a merit-based system.  Such lessons can be used across the entire campus in academia, to yield a diverse student body and faculty, while maintaining the highest standards of merit that everyone expects, deserves, and respects. This is what the president values, and why college sports are the ideal model for him to advocate for across college campuses.

President Donald Trump's announcement that a 100% tariff will be levied on foreign-made movies comes a month after West Wing actor Rob Lowe sounded the warning on the costs of filming in Hollywood.

On Sunday, Trump lamented the state of Hollywood, which he said is dying a “very fast death.”

But rather than blame the policies of Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), he instead blamed a “concerted effort” by other nations to woo filming away from Tinseltown.

Last month, Lowe, however, blamed Los Angeles and California leadership for offering no tax credits.

In a podcast interview with his former Parks and Recreation co-star Adam Scott, Lowe said, “There are no tax credits, so like, all those other places are offering 40%. And then on top of that, there's other stuff that they do.”

“And then, that's not even talking about union stuff,” he continued. “It's just tax, economics of it all, so it's criminal what California and LA have let happen — it's criminal. Everybody should be fired.”

Lowe explained to Scott that his Fox game show, The Floor, films in Dublin, because it is cheaper to fly everybody involved in the show to the Irish capital than it is to film it on a Hollywood lot.

Scott asked Lowe if he believed they would be shooting Parks and Recreation abroad right now if the show were still in production.

“One hundred percent, we would be. We'd be in Budapest,” Lowe responded.

A week after Lowe and Scott's interview was released, the California Film Commission approved a record 51 movies for tax incentives, according to the Wrap. In October 2024, Newsom announced plans to supercharge California's tax credits for movies from the current level of $330 million annually to $750 million.

TRUMP SLAPS 100% TARIFF ON FOREIGN-MADE FILMS

Bob Sallady, Newsom's senior adviser for communications, told Deadline in the wake of Trump's movie tariff post that “we believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.”

Hollywood continues to be a major part of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than 2.3 million jobs in 2022, according to data from the Motion Picture Association.

TRUMP DIRECTS AGENCIES TO REBUILD AND REOPEN ALCATRAZ FEDERAL PRISON

The United States remains the top filming hub by production, with $14.5 billion in 2024, according to ProdPro, but that number is down 26% from 2022, and a survey of executives regarding their preferred locations for 2025-26 listed Toronto; the United Kingdom; Vancouver, Canada; Central Europe; and Australia as their top five.

In January, Trump announced he was appointing the actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone as “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, calling on them to bring investment back to the “great, but very troubled place.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

An emerging critical consensus argues that we've entered a cultural dark age. I'm not so sure.

Listen to more stories on hark

Last year, I visited the music historian Ted Gioia to talk about the death of civilization.

He welcomed me into his suburban-Texas home and showed me to a sunlit library. At the center of the room, arranged neatly on a countertop, stood 41 books. These, he said, were the books I needed to read.

The display included all seven volumes of Edward Gibbon's 18th-century opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ; both volumes of Oswald Spengler's World War I–era tract, The Decline of the West ; and a 2,500-year-old account of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides, who “was the first historian to look at his own culture, Greece, and say, I'm going to tell you the story of how stupid we were,” Gioia explained.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Gioia's contributions to this lineage of doomsaying have made him into something of an internet celebrity. For most of his career, he was best-known for writing about jazz. But with his Substack newsletter, The Honest Broker, he's attracted a large and avid readership by taking on contemporary culture—and arguing that it's terrible. America's “creative energy” has been sapped, he told me, and the results can be seen in the diminished quality of arts and entertainment, with knock-on effects to the country's happiness and even its political stability.

He's not alone in fearing that we've entered a cultural dark age. According to a recent YouGov poll, Americans rate the 2020s as the worst decade in a century for music, movies, fashion, TV, and sports. A 2023 story in The New York Times Magazine declared that we're in the “least innovative, least transformative, least pioneering century for culture since the invention of the printing press.” An art critic for The Guardian recently proclaimed that “the avant garde is dead.”

What's so jarring about these declarations of malaise is that we should, logically, be in a renaissance. The internet has caused a Cambrian explosion of creative expression by allowing artists to execute and distribute their visions with unprecedented ease. More than 500 scripted TV shows get made every year; streaming services reportedly add about 100,000 songs every day. We have podcasts that cater to every niche passion and video games of novelistic sophistication. Technology companies like to say that they've democratized the arts, enabling exciting collisions of ideas from unlikely talents. Yet no one seems very happy about the results.

To a certain extent, such negativity may simply reflect an innate human tendency to fret about decline. Some of the most liberating developments in history have first triggered fears of social stultification. The advent of the printing press caused 15th-century thinkers to complain of mass distraction. In 1964, The Atlantic published an essay predicting, not unpersuasively, that rock and roll would only foster conformity and consumerism in young Americans.

From the August 1964 issue: What do they get from rock 'n' roll?

For as long as I have been a critic at this magazine, I've tried to cut against the declinist impulse. The year I started the job, 2011, was a turning point of sorts: Spotify launched in America that July; Netflix debuted its first original series soon after. The brainy rock bands that I'd grown up loving—Radiohead, Wilco—were starting to fade in importance, but pop, hip-hop, and electronic music were cross-pollinating in fascinating ways. Understanding change, and appreciating how human creativity flourishes anew in each era, always seemed to be the point of the job.

Yet the 2020s have tested my optimism. The chaos of TikTok, the disruption of the pandemic, and the threat of AI have destabilized any coherent story of progress driving the arts forward. In its place, a narrative of decay has taken hold, evangelized by critics such as Gioia. They're citing very real problems: Hollywood's regurgitation of intellectual property; partisan culture wars hijacking actual culture; unsustainable economic conditions for artists; the addicting, distracting effects of modern technology.

I wanted to meet with some of the most articulate pessimists to test the validity of their ideas, and to see whether a story other than decline might yet be told. Previous periods of change have yielded great artistic breakthroughs: Industrialization begat Romanticism; World War I awakened the modernists. Either something similar is happening now and we're not yet able to see it, or we really have, at last, slid into the wasteland.

In 312 C.E., the Roman Senate ordered the construction of a gaudy monument called the Arch of Constantine. It incorporated pieces from older monuments, built in more glorious times for the empire, which had begun its centuries-long decline.

The Arch is one of Gioia's favorite metaphors for modern culture. The TV and film industry is enamored of reboots, spin-offs, and formulaic genre fare. Broadway theaters subsist on stunt-cast revivals of old warhorses; book publishers rely disproportionately on backlist sales. Entertainment companies have long understood the power of giving people more of what they already like, but recommendation algorithms take that logic to a new extreme, keeping us swiping endlessly for slight variations on our favorite things. In every sector of society, Gioia told me, “we're facing powerful forces that want to impose stagnation on us.”

The problem is particularly acute in music. In 2024, new releases accounted for a little more than a quarter of the albums consumed in the U.S.; every year, a greater and greater percentage of the albums streamed online is “catalog music,” meaning it is at least 18 months old. Hoping to remonetize the classics, record labels and private-equity firms have spent billions of dollars to acquire artists' publishing rights. The reemergence of Kate Bush's “Running Up That Hill” on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2022, 37 years after its release, seemed to signal that this was a good bet. A brief placement in a popular TV show (Netflix's Stranger Things, itself a pastiche of 1980s movie tropes) could, it turned out, cause an old hit to outcompete most of the newer songs in the world.

“Music is turning into a rights-management business,” Gioia said. “There are vested interests now that don't want new music to flourish. The private-equity funds just want you to listen to the same songs over and over again, because they own them.” The ultimate effect, he thinks, is to discourage true, daring artistry. If Bach were alive today, “he'd spend a few weeks trying to break into the L.A. music scene and say, ‘Ah, I'll be a hedge-fund manager instead.'”

Gioia, 67, knows something about greatness thwarted. He started his career as a consultant, working for Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey. But he moonlighted as a jazz pianist, releasing two albums and gigging around the world. At one point in our conversation, he pulled up a recording of himself playing piano in 1986—before he suffered a debilitating case of arthritis in his 30s. “These arpeggios, I can't do this anymore,” he said. “I always felt that if you give me another nine, 12, 18 months, I can be as good as anybody in the world.”

Gioia's background as both an aesthete and a quant gives his criticism its distinctive edge. He's able to deliver clear, hardheaded analysis of an art form frequently discussed in soft abstractions. I've often found myself swept away by the force of his convictions. Still, I nursed some doubts about his claim that the arts are frozen in amber.

In a viral 2022 Substack post titled “Is Old Music Killing New Music?” (later republished by The Atlantic), Gioia described omens of stagnation in everyday life, such as when he encountered a “youngster” singing along to the Police's “Message in a Bottle.” The example stung a bit: The Police broke up before I was born, yet I've been humming their songs my whole life. Of course, when I was listening to my parents' records in the '90s, no one was measuring the replaying of old music. Today, by contrast, every Spotify play is monitored and monetized.

So might Gioia be overinterpreting data showing listening habits that have long existed? He didn't think so. “In my generation,” he said, “nobody I know listened to their parents' music.”

Gioia's generation is the Baby Boomers, which, more than any since, conceived of itself as revolutionary. The rock-and-roll movement gave Boomers a fresh, elders-offending sound to call their own, and as they aged, they witnessed other breakthroughs: punk, hip-hop, electronic music. Gioia asked me to compare that dynamism with what's happened—or, rather, not happened—in the 21st century. “The music today doesn't sound that much different from 20 years ago,” Gioia said.

I turned that assertion over in my head. The radio does play new music that feels old, such as Sabrina Carpenter's disco bop “Espresso” and Benson Boone's classic-rock-flavored anthem “Beautiful Things.” But it also plays musicians who seem firmly planted in the present. Billie Eilish's blend of jazz and electronic music diverges from the work of any pop star before her. Shaboozey combines country music and rap in a way that, perhaps for the first time in history, doesn't feel like a joke. Reggaeton, Afrobeats, and K-pop now reach English-speaking audiences to an extent that was unthinkable when traditional gatekeepers—major labels, drive-time DJs, Rolling Stone—held more sway. These developments may not be quite as paradigm-shifting as rock and roll was, but they do suggest a culture that is still actively evolving.

Gioia acknowledged some bright spots for culture—he's not entirely fatalistic about the status quo. He tends to view culture as moving in predictable cycles: When malaise and mediocrity reach an extreme, a revolution is likely to mount, upending the old order and installing a new one.

“Most people fundamentally want to have cultural experiences that are mind-expanding and broaden their world,” he said. “If the corporations that control our culture refuse to deliver that, they will find a way around it and there will be a rebirth. We will have a new counterculture.” He predicted a wave of “new romanticism” (emphasizing humanity over technology) and “new maximalism” (art made with unbridled ambition).

Gioia himself is trying to help bring a revolution about, albeit in small ways. Every day, he listens to hours of new music, searching for gems that the algorithms have ignored.

He showed me a draft of a post recommending nine new albums to his Substack readers. The lead image was of a young woman in a bonnet and stockings, sitting on a bed strewn with stuffed animals. This was Mei Semones, who sings dreamy bossa nova songs in English and Japanese. Gioia noted that three weeks after her album's release, she had only 8,700 plays on YouTube. “I sometimes recommend albums that have less than 100 views,” he said.

To Gioia, the low listenership was evidence of the record industry's efforts to smother new talents. But as I sat watching him pull up exciting find after exciting find, I started to feel oddly reassured about society's creative energy. Today's corporate behemoths may be powerful, and very often craven, but they're reckoning with a force more destabilizing than Sgt. Pepper's and London Calling ever were: a fractured global audience using technology to chase their obsessions, both familiar and novel.

Gioia went to YouTube and loaded another video, of the Australian band Glass Beams. Its members wore jeweled masks over their faces while playing intricate surf-rock grooves. “This band is great, and nobody's heard it,” he said. “How many plays has it got?”

He scrolled down to the answer: nearly 1 million.

Gioia winced. “So it's not as big a secret as I was making it out to be,” he said.

A few months later, I revisited the same video and saw that the play count had reached more than 6 million. The top comment read, “Praise to the algorithms for this!”

The title of the show was “Transcendence.” On the second floor of the prestigious Pace Gallery in Manhattan hung white-on-white abstract paintings and what appeared to be line drawings of rocks. Wall text explained that this was the first-ever U.S. solo exhibition for the 79-year-old artist Huong Dodinh. One painting was inspired by the first snowfall she ever witnessed, as a child, after the First Indochina War forced her family to move from Vietnam to France in 1953. The art critic Dean Kissick, wearing a baggy pink polo shirt and short athletic shorts, rushed through the room, barely glancing at the art. “I don't think I can do this,” he whispered to me, stifling a giggle.

Kissick, 42, is a writer known in large part for his annoyance at the state of the art world. He believes we've been stuck in “the long 2017”: a period in which anxieties related to Donald Trump and Brexit have smothered culture with moralism, navel-gazing, and conformity. Although transcendence—achieved through beauty, originality, and skill—should be the primary goal, art has “become much more about messaging, raising awareness, or a kind of ambient healing of the world,” he told me. In other words, whereas Gioia awaits a revolution, Kissick thinks we've recently lived through one—and it's made everything drearier.

We'd met up so Kissick could take me on a tour of the gallery scene in Chelsea. The Dodinh show, he explained, demonstrated a typical tactic among dealers these days: find a relatively obscure figure from an underrepresented group and try to sell his or her work, at least in part, on the basis of identity. The blander the art, the better for serving rich people looking to furnish tastefully understated homes. “This is just, like, sofas,” he said, gesturing toward Dodinh's soothingly serene canvases. “Curtains.”

We stepped into an elevator, and I asked him whether he at least felt a sense of justice at seeing someone like Dodinh exhibited at one of the most exclusive galleries in the world. “I always like to see older Asian women doing well, because they remind me of my mother,” said Kissick, whose mother is a Japanese immigrant to the U.K. “But no—I don't see justice.”

Last year, Kissick published a cover story in Harper's arguing that politics had all but destroyed contemporary art. Museums and galleries were blending “all forms of oppression” into “one universal grief,” he wrote. “We are bombarded with identities until they become meaningless. When everyone's tossed together into the big salad of marginalization, otherness is made banal and abstract.”

The essay opened with a shocking scene: In May 2024, on her way to see a show at London's Barbican Art Gallery, Kissick's mother was struck by a bus, an accident that resulted in the amputation of both of her legs. Kissick flew from New York to London to visit her in the hospital. Later, as she recuperated, he checked out the show she'd been on the way to see. Titled “Unravel,” it featured textile art, primarily by artists from historically marginalized communities. As Kissick noted, the curators further “proposed that textiles themselves had also been marginalized, having been gendered as feminine and regarded as ‘craft' rather than ‘fine art.' The show's introductory text asked, ‘What does it mean to imagine a needle, a loom or a garment as a tool of resistance?' ”

Kissick's assessment was withering:

Critiquing progressive pieties in this fashion may simply sound conservative. Indeed, Kissick's complaints are now reflected in the anti-DEI wave that has swept the federal government—and rippled through American corporate, cultural, and academic institutions. But Kissick insists he's not ideologically motivated. “I just don't care that much if people are very woke or very anti-woke,” he told me. “The conversation itself just takes up way too much space.”

That conversation has been as impossible to avoid in pop culture as it has been in high culture. Proponents of the theory that “representation matters”—meaning that more inclusive media will create a more inclusive society—have cheered diversely cast remakes of films such as The Little Mermaid, body-positivity choruses sung by artists like Lizzo, and reckonings with perceived cultural appropriation in the literary world. Conservatives, in turn, have organized a backlash, attempting to score ideological points by racking up streams and downloads. When Jason Aldean's 2023 song “Try That in a Small Town” was criticized by some on the left for tacitly endorsing lynching, a right-wing campaign to support the track resulted in Aldean hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100. Similar campaigns boosted the box-office prominence of films such as the anti-DEI mockumentary Am I Racist? Even the most escapist forms of entertainment—blockbusters, pop concerts, children's TV—are now treated like political battlegrounds, though you rarely hear about anyone's opinions being changed in the skirmishes.

In the world of fine art, Kissick feels overwhelmed by what he sees as cynicism masquerading as idealism. He mentioned the example of Amoako Boafo, an in-demand Ghanaian painter who was hired to adorn the nose cone of one of Jeff Bezos's rockets in 2021. At the time, a statement by Blue Origin, Bezos's spaceflight company, announced, “His stunning portraits capture Black joy and the kind of shared future we hope to create for us all in space: vibrant, beautiful, and full of wonder.” One could be forgiven, however, for thinking the commission was motivated less by Black joy than by PR concerns around a controversial billionaire's vanity project. (One could likewise be forgiven, judging by Bezos's actions since Trump's reelection, for wondering whether future nose cones will be similarly adorned.)

To some extent, I sympathize with Kissick's complaints. Mediocre art really does get overrated on account of its politics. Any working critic knows how factional and reflexive audiences have become: Pan a woman, and many readers will call you sexist; champion one, and you risk being dismissed as a beta cuck. Such reactions don't just represent the persistence of prejudice; they reflect an awareness of the way that “culture,” a supposedly binding force, has come to feel more and more like an embittered sports rivalry.

But any working critic will also tell you that topicality and identity have inspired incredible work in previous eras (just listen to Nina Simone) and recently (watch the post-#MeToo masterpiece Tár, about a lesbian orchestra conductor accused of misconduct). Even Kissick acknowledges this. He gushed to me about the artist Arthur Jafa's 2021 video installation AGHDRA; its depiction of an ominous, undulating seascape evokes, as the artist told ARTnews, the feeling of “being chained in a slave ship.” Kissick even had kind words for Salman Toor, a much-hyped Pakistani artist based in New York who makes green-gray, impressionistic smudges of queer guys hanging out in bars or apartments. Toor typifies one of Kissick's least favorite pairings—old-school technique with a 21st-century, identity-related twist—but at least, Kissick said, “he can really paint.”

As we hustled from gallery to gallery, popping in for mere minutes and then leaving, I began to get the sense that Kissick's grudge against the art world goes deeper than politics. He deemed a colorful painting of motocross riders “rubbish.” A huge, haunting sculpture of a half-dressed woman with blurred features, as if rendered by rudimentary CGI, received just a murmured “Cool.” At one point, he acknowledged his jadedness.

“You can probably tell—I've seen too many white-cube shows of paintings in my life,” he said. “There's too much art.”

This problem, if it can be called one, has escalated since around the time Kissick graduated from art school, in 2010. Back then, he felt, visual art was crossing over to become a mainstream cultural phenomenon—Jay-Z was rapping about collecting Basquiats, and Louis Vuitton was making handbags with the Japanese visual artist Takashi Murakami. The internet, it appeared, was encouraging audiences beyond the walls of galleries and museums to develop an interest in art. But hope for technologically enabled creative flourishing gave way to oversaturation and numbness. So-called zombie formalism—rehashed abstract expressionism optimized for Instagram shareability—became a fad. Minimalism, a presumed antidote to the chaos of online life, became the default aesthetic in art, fashion, and consumer-product design. “It's been clear for a while that art's running out of ideas,” Kissick declared in a 2021 column for The Spectator. The overvaluing of stale, activism-scented art is a symptom of all this burnout: If stylistic innovation can no longer break through the noise, we're only left to argue over subject matter.

What would a better direction be? Kissick's cagey on this question, but he has a few ideas. Art should capture its era, he said, but the culture wars are not the only important thing about the 2020s. Rather, he wants art to address the internet's more ineffable consequences: rendering our thought processes glitchy, destabilizing our sense of self. He thinks artists should find new ways to use time-honored techniques, while also being open to experimenting with emerging tools, including AI. “The experience of being alive, this century, has changed dramatically,” he said. “We should engage with the times we live in, and then maybe we'd feel less hopeless about everything.”

What he really seems to be yearning for is a paradigm shift: some sort of formal leap forward combined with a spiritual reawakening. “The culture we have is so obsessed with ourselves, with people's identities and personalities,” he said. “Perhaps we'll be able to transcend that somehow. Perhaps we will get over this deeply individualistic, deeply self-obsessed moment.” He paused. “But I don't know how that would happen.”

KMUN-FM 91.9, a public radio station for the coastal town of Astoria, Oregon, broadcasts from a 133-year-old Victorian cottage with burgundy eaves and stained-glass windows. One rainy day last spring, I was greeted there by the 41-year-old musician and writer Jaime Brooks, who wore a tweed jacket over a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan Foresight Prevents Blindness. She introduced me to a variety of friendly station volunteers working in studios cluttered with stacks of vinyl records, spindles of CDs, and well-worn instruments and mixing boards. On one wall hung a hand-drawn map of the station's broadcasting area.

It was a strikingly analog setting in which to meet an artist who once embodied the internet's futuristic potential. Best-known for her work under the aliases Elite Gymnastics and Default Genders, Brooks has long been a “bedroom musician”: someone who uses a home computer to make high-quality recordings. In the early 2010s, as a 20-something immersed in the hipster party scene in Minneapolis, Brooks collaborated with a friend to release a few ethereal dance songs that drew the acclaim of music bloggers. She was soon dating the similarly buzzy artist Grimes and living in Los Angeles, getting a close-up look at the modern pop ecosystem.

But these days, her mics and guitar are packed up in boxes, gathering dust. Spending time working on new songs just doesn't feel right given her belief, articulated in widely circulated tweets and essays, that the music industry is doomed. Like Gioia, Brooks feels that tech and business interests are strangling the arts; like Kissick, she believes that most of the new work that gets made today just flat-out isn't good. But Brooks's view is even darker than either of theirs, and more explicitly personal. She described the future of music to me in one word: wreckage.

Many musicians believe that Spotify's business model is predatory, forcing artists to participate in a system in which they make only a fraction of a penny whenever a song is played. Brooks agrees, but her concern runs deeper than the money itself; she argues that music's role in society has been corrupted. Streaming encourages artists to play an enervating game of scale: The more songs they release, the more chance they have of going viral and turning pittances into real income. Artists are thus motivated to record as quickly and cheaply as possible. All of this, Brooks believes, has led to a glut of music—both popular and obscure—that is plainly bad: less distinct, less soulful, and less skillfully made than the minimal standards of previous eras. “Nobody can get the resources to develop their craft,” she said.

This decline in quality has created the conditions for what Brooks fears will come next: a flood of AI-generated songs that further devalue music as an art form and an economic enterprise. Already, streaming platforms have inculcated a huge demand for “utility” music, such as white noise to fall asleep to and “chill beats” to study to. Cheap AI tools can now conjure credible versions of such music, and over time they'll only get better at imitating other styles. Listeners' standards have become so diminished that they won't be able to tell the difference.

Brooks saw the early stages of this catastrophe unfolding during her time in Los Angeles. While we chatted, she casually mentioned being on set at a Lady Gaga video shoot, and watching Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend play songs in his backyard. But to hear her describe it, her L.A. years were mostly disillusioning. “I didn't really see a lot of success that I thought seemed desirable,” she said. “It's, like, a lot of people sitting in rooms by themselves, ordering fucking Uber Eats.”

What she meant is that the ethos of the bedroom musician, once an indie phenomenon enabling outsiders to gain a foothold, quickly became the record-industry default. Producers can skip the studio to work on their devices at home, commissioning instrumentalists and beat makers who live time zones away. Music is now widely made much in the manner that it is consumed: by people who are alone, encased in their headphones.

This state of affairs, Brooks thinks, is antithetical to music's purpose. Listening to songs once meant getting a window into specific, communal circumstances—into the churches where R&B evolved from gospel, into the block parties where hip-hop fermented, into the clubs where rock bands jammed. Now most music is shaped by and tailored to a fake place, an intangible scene: the internet. It only feeds the broader trends of cultural fracturing and personal solitude that are now clearly depressing people's sense of well-being.

I share the feeling that the mundanity of streaming has made music feel smaller, less important, than it used to—but I see plenty of signs that the art form still serves a social function. One of the biggest stories in the record industry in the 2020s has been the boom of country music, a style that's rooted in a sense of place and shared identity. New stars such as Zach Bryan and Lainey Wilson have been drawing droves not just to stream songs, but to sell out their tour dates and tailgate in the parking lot. New honky-tonks have been popping up across the nation, even in blue states.

“There's still human culture that is being mined there,” Brooks said when we got to talking about country music. She pointed out that Taylor Swift's success owes a lot to her having come up in Nashville, writing on guitar with seasoned songwriters, thus giving her skills that feel rarer with each passing year. But Brooks sees the country renaissance as a mere side effect of the genre being late to technological adoption, which isn't the same as defying it. “Streaming is taking longer to eat it,” she said. “But streaming will destroy it.”

Eventual destruction is, in her view, the fate of most everything good about music and the broader artistic landscape. Gioia's boom-and-bust trend forecasts, Kissick's pining for creative reinvention—both sound naive in Brooks's analysis. “When people use this language, ‘Oh, it all moves in cycles; it's been going this way since time immemorial'—no, it hasn't,” she said. “Like, in Joe Biden's lifetime, the sheet-music industry was completely replaced by the record industry. And in our lifetime already, the practice of buying copies of records has been replaced by the concept of renting access to them.”

In other words: Great things don't just change; they die, and what they're replaced with may well be worse—if they're replaced at all. As she wrote on Substack in 2023:

Hearing all of this made me particularly sad, because Brooks's own music always seemed like an example of how to defy modern alienation. She left Los Angeles in 2018—around the time that Grimes started dating Elon Musk—and recorded three excellent albums about searching for connection in a world made cold by technology, greed, and, to quote one lyric, “crypto dipshits.” The music was electronic yet felt handcrafted, and Brooks, singing through a warbly vocal filter, sounded like a human trying to escape being turned into a machine.

For now, though, Brooks has put her music career on hold. The process of moving notes around on a computer screen, alone, started to feel “masturbatory.” A successful new album would “generate a bunch of value for Apple, for Spotify, for whatever other companies are taking pieces,” she said. “And I don't feel good about that.” Now she's been spending her days hanging out at KMUN, learning about the seemingly outmoded technology of terrestrial radio, which she thinks will gain a kind of “postapocalyptic” usefulness to humanity as the internet is overrun with AI slop.

Still, Brooks can't stop dreaming of new music she wants to make. She described one song idea that's been rattling around in her head lately: “It's got horn solos, and it's got, like, Andrews Sisters backing vocals in the chorus.” I suggested to her that she might benefit from a new record deal to bring that vision to life.

“Well, no,” Brooks replied. What she's lacking is collaborators—real-life bandmates, bonded by shared experiences, with physical instruments and the skills to use them. “I need people. I need people who care.”

Each declinist I spoke with made a convincing case that large, inexorable forces were wearing culture down. But they also left me clinging to scattered counterexamples that might tell another story. I'd seen the omens of death; I needed to make an effort to find signs of life.

Which is how I ended up sweating in a poorly ventilated indoor skate park in Brooklyn one summer night. I was there for a concert thrown by No Bells, a hip-hop-focused blog that bills itself as “a hub of the wider internet underground.” Young people sat on either side of a half-pipe, looking like members of a very eclectic tribunal. They wore jorts and crop tops; or strappy, S&M-influenced getups; or pajamas emblazoned with cartoons. They fiddled with phones, lighters, Nintendo DSes, and, in one case, a unicycle. At the bottom of the half-pipe, a mosh pit swirled around a small stage. Two rappers shouted over a beat that paired incessant synthetic clapping with a sample of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” played on ukulele.

Within the scrum by the stage was Kieran Press-Reynolds, a 25-year-old journalist who seems like he should be a declinist, but isn't. His father, the music critic Simon Reynolds, wrote the 2011 book Retromania: Pop Culture's Addiction to Its Own Past, which puzzled over the abundance of remixes, remakes, and revivals in the 2000s and made an early version of the stagnation argument now espoused by Gioia and others. Press-Reynolds himself has made a budding career out of chronicling internet subcultures that seem symptomatic of a society in crisis. When we met, he'd recently reported a story for The New York Times about a video game that satirizes online influencers by making players experience horrific things for content. For GQ, he'd delved into the “looksmaxxing” community: young men who, among other techniques for optimizing their physical attractiveness, try to alter their faces by clenching their jaw for hours a day, egged on by internet forums that are, he wrote, “cesspits of insecurities.”

And yet, Press-Reynolds is energized by the culture right now. “Maybe there aren't amazing macro-trends at the moment,” he told me, but if you scratch the surface of the mainstream, “people are cooking.” As a critic, he feels an obligation to spread the good news. “Every young person deserves something to champion,” he said. “Something to get really feverishly excited about.”

Press-Reynolds keeps his brown hair long and scraggly; his voice is hoarse and giddy. He described his own artistic obsessions in terms such as “fried” and “anarchic.” In music, on TikTok, and even in web-design trends, he sees a turn toward an aesthetic he called “max stimuli,” which pushes the bounds of speed, dissonance, and silliness while recombining bits of old culture into something new. “It feels like how our brains feel now: infested and congested with so much stuff,” he said.

He's particularly captivated by the hip-hop underground: a constellation of subgenres such as “rage rap” (which takes after the unintelligible lyrics and glitchy beats of the cult hero Playboi Carti) and “pluggnb” (a woozy, melodic version of trap). A global community of producers, swapping beats and software plug-ins online, is twisting hip-hop's conventions to create sound sculptures that, Press-Reynolds thinks, “really could not have come out 10 years ago.” He mentioned a recent SoundCloud “micro-hit” called “fragged aht” by an artist named wokeups. The song “makes you think of a human expanding and deflating like an accordion,” Press-Reynolds said. I pulled up the track after we talked. A heavily filtered voice ululated about money and guns for two minutes over a swell of digital sound. The effect was weirdly beautiful; it gave me goose bumps.

Other genres are also getting scrambled in disorienting, playful ways. I've been fascinated by hyperpop, a loose term for the punkish, noisy spin that bedroom electronic musicians put on bubblegum tropes. In 2024, hyperpop had its commercial breakthrough with Charli XCX's album Brat, whose frenzied rhythms became popular enough to be adopted by the official memes of Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.

Brooks had warned me not to put much stock in internet-native music scenes; she dismissed most hyperpop as “regurgitated video-game soundtracks” made by and for people who have “never been to clubs.” This had struck me as uncharitable, though in talking with Press-Reynolds, I realized it wasn't entirely untrue. He traced his own teenage musical awakening to playing Minecraft while listening to hip-hop set to anime montages on YouTube. His culture-critic parents (his mother is the writer Joy Press) would play the slick beats of Daft Punk around the house, but he gravitated toward the blown-out distortion of angsty rappers such as XXXTentacion. When the pandemic lockdown came, he burrowed even deeper into the digital wilds.

Being so online, Press-Reynolds joked, had inflicted him with “brain rot.” He makes no apologies for being a music critic who “almost can't bear” to listen to full albums; sometimes he'll just play a song for 30 seconds to “feel that texture.” This admission pained me a bit. I've felt my own attention span decaying in recent years, but I still cling to the idea that transcendent art—and transcendent experiences with art—requires sustained focus. In many ways, the problems that Gioia, Kissick, and Brooks spelled out were problems of terminally distracted audiences preferring junk (recycled IP, political bait, wallpaper music) to quality. What are we going to do about brain rot?

At the skate-park concert, it occurred to me that art itself might be the answer. The headliner was a trio—the rappers Polo Perks and AyooLii with the rapper-producer FearDorian, who hailed, respectively, from New York, Milwaukee, and Atlanta, but had linked up online and developed in-person friendships. Their songs deployed samples—emo rock, M.I.A., gaming music—with a kind of elegant dizziness, as if multiple browser tabs playing random audio were harmonizing together. A thwack on every eighth note, the signature beat of the recently ascendant Milwaukee rap scene, created a sense of Energizer Bunny propulsion. Sweating at the bottom of the half-pipe, pressed up against the crowd, I felt the music meet my own sense of distraction and supplant it. These artists had burst from the internet to convey feelings about friendship, partying, and hustling—the classic hip-hop rush, delivered with a sound that suits its times.

Afterward, I thought of the concerts in the 1981 documentary The Decline of Western Civilization, which followed the grungy, anti-establishment scene forming around hardcore-punk bands such as Black Flag. Its title evoked Oswald Spengler—and played as a joke about the way that elders often disdain cultural developments they don't understand.

The 62-year-old Simon Reynolds sometimes feels like one of those baffled elders. He told me that much of the music his son champions is “too gnarly” for his ears. Still, seeing Press-Reynolds “chasing the latest convolution, the latest mutant” in music was a thrill: It's what he used to do. His heyday of exploration was the '90s, when the rise of electronica—techno, drum and bass, and, yes, Daft Punk—seemed as exciting to a young Reynolds as rock and roll had to the Boomers. Then he got older, the 2000s came around, and his generation of ravers started to lose steam. No comparable new scene seemed to be taking their place. So he wrote Retromania, about the feeling that culture had become too backward-looking. (Soon after, one of his good friends, the late Mark Fisher, wrote a similarly themed essay, “The Slow Cancellation of the Future,” that has become one of the 21st century's most influential statements of cultural pessimism.)

But some of Reynolds's bleakest theories, he told me, started to “crumble a bit” once they were published. Technologies such as streaming and social media began to upend the culture; Press-Reynolds kept discovering interesting oddities online. He realized that he'd been thinking of artistic evolution too narrowly. Innovation was happening; it just wasn't the kind he'd been looking for. “I was very, very fixated in that book on sound,” he told me. He now believes music is about more than sound. It—and culture in general—is a “messy hybrid” of images, ideas, delivery methods, and so much else.

From that perspective, this decade's culture is plenty dynamic. The great media of the 20th century—the art-pop album, the feature-length film, the gallery show, the literary novel—may be fighting for their life, but that's because of competition from new forms defined by a sense of immediacy: short-form video, chatty podcasts, video games, memes. Like the old media, these forms foster tons of mediocrity. But they also invite surprising excellence: the minute-long songs of PinkPantheress, which glitter with detail and emotion; the writing of Honor Levy, who weaves lurid short stories out of internet slang. “It's more of an aphoristic culture than an essayist culture, isn't it?” Reynolds said. “You can say quite clever, profound things in just a few sentences.”

That sensibility emerged from the warrens of the internet, but it's bleeding into the mainstream—and, in the best cases, energizing it. When Press-Reynolds described his idea of “max stimuli” to me, I thought back to a term Gioia had used: “new maximalism.” In Gioia's analysis, the greats of his lifetime—Brian Wilson, Stephen Sondheim, Joni Mitchell—have been maximalists, translating grand ambitions into pop symphonies, stage spectacles, or emotionally dense story-songs. The cultural triumphs of this decade fit that model. Audiences still want storytelling they can chew on—they just want it in a form that's attuned to the accelerated ways we now consume information. Artists are playing with tempo, intensity, and scale to tame the modern attention span, offer smart social commentary, and foster a feeling of connection in an era of isolation.

Think back to the summer of 2023, when Barbie and Oppenheimer both accomplished what the pandemic had seemingly made impossible: selling out movie theaters, and not for a superhero sequel. These could have been emblems of Hollywood's intellectual bankruptcy, representing a glorified toy ad and yet another Oscar-baiting biopic. Yet the movies connected in large part because of their daring use of rhythm—visual rhythm, emotional rhythm, narrative rhythm. With hyperpop-ish glee, Barbie veered between musical, slapstick comedy, and melodrama. Its pursuit of constant stimulation didn't just keep audiences rapt; the movie breezily conveyed weighty ideas about gender, consumerism, and even the meaning of life. Oppenheimer, about the father of the atomic bomb, was more quietly radical: The director, Christopher Nolan, told a complex story by montaging lots of vignette-like, TikTok-length scenes. Here was a sober, stately Best Picture winner whose hummingbird pulse felt stylish and modern.

Across culture, identity—Kissick's bugbear—remains central, but its role may be changing: Forward-thinking, maximalist 2020s art is less about sorting people into tribes than about deconstructing now-familiar labels. The joyfully chaotic 2022 action-comedy hit Everything Everywhere All at Once—about a dimension-hopping Chinese American family—used a sci‑fi concept to complicate the category of “immigrant,” reminding viewers that any of us could have lived a million different lives. Meanwhile, Beyoncé has been making the boldest music of her career—which is saying a lot—by trying to expand popular ideas about Black music: first with the 2022 album Renaissance, a collage of beats linking hip-hop, Afrobeats, and house music, and then with 2024's Cowboy Carter, a twisty-turny odyssey into country and rock. If audiences have become numb to moralistic messaging, they seem excited by works that use formal experimentation to capture messy truths.

The technologically induced isolation that Brooks worries about is also driving humanistic countermovements. The art of confessional songwriting is flourishing thanks to a wave of artists—Chappell Roan, Olivia Rodrigo, SZA—whose lyrical candor creates an intense sense of closeness between listener and artist. Together, these artists constitute an idea of “pop” that's anything but generic; rather, it's witty, specific, and vulnerable.

The leader of this class is, of course, Taylor Swift, who's been pioneering a futuristic form of storytelling: every verse and every public utterance links together an intricate web of “lore,” which brings fans together for puzzle-solving and reinterpretation. Gioia, hardly the stereotype of a Swiftie, told me he watched the concert film about her records-smashing Eras tour three times. “I take some comfort in the fact that the biggest musical event of the last year was Taylor Swift, going on the road, playing real songs for real people in concert,” Gioia said. AI may be able to imitate Swift's voice, but it can't forge social bonds like she can.

A maximalist wave naturally favors the well resourced, and an actual renaissance won't be possible until the economics of streaming are reformed or upended. Even so, indie artists are still releasing fantastical concept albums whose worlds spill out into music videos, TikToks, and other online channels (check out Magdalena Bay or underscores), and indie filmmakers are finding audiences for uncompromising visions (see the recent Oscars race between The Brutalist and Anora). Even seemingly brain-rotted content can sustain big ideas through inventive means: Internet comedians such as Psyiconic use costumes and visual filters to conjure bizarro characters that pop up in your social feeds, creating long-form satire out of snackable moments.

When I'm locked in and enjoying such highlights of 2020s culture, I'm grateful: Most of this work couldn't or wouldn't have existed before now. That doesn't mean I'm immune to the dread that plagues the declinists. They're really talking about forces deeper than culture: technological, political, economic, and social problems that require technological, political, economic, and social answers. The same YouGov survey that found Americans to be so unhappy with the state of movies, TV, and music found that people also generally feel that this is the decade with the worst economy, the least moral society, the least close-knit communities, and the most political division.

What art can do is remind us that our lives are not simply shaped by systems—they're also a product of our own thoughts, inspirations, and relations. My favorite new TV show of this decade is HBO's Fantasmas, a comedy created by the former Saturday Night Live writer Julio Torres. It's a magical-realist depiction of a near future in which people live with bumbling AI assistant bots in housing complexes owned by corporations such as Bank of America. Torres's character wants to make surreal films about animals, but is being pressured to cash in on his backstory as a gay immigrant. (A streaming service run by Zappos—yes, the shoe company—commissions a screenplay called How I Came Out to My Abuela.) This subject matter asks, quite darkly, whether the artistic spirit can survive modern life. But the imaginative way the show is rendered—in a dreamscape of interconnected skits, featuring handcrafted set decoration, performed by talents from today's offbeat comedy world—offers a hopeful answer.

Culture is not just a map of the structures and forces that order our society. It's what people make on top of, in between, in opposition to, and in collaboration with those things. We all have the power to listen more curiously, look more closely, and treat the present with the same sense of generosity that we extend to the golden ages of the past. When you tune in to the creativity that is still pulsing in these disorienting times, you can hear the story that most needs telling: Keep going.

How the GOP's indecision in Congress could crash the markets

One of President Donald Trump's greatest political strengths has suddenly become a weakness. He won a second term in large part because voters believed he could boost the economy. Instead, Trump has shrunk it, and his tariffs have sent both the stock market and consumer confidence tumbling.

Republicans in Congress could soon make things much worse. GOP leaders are struggling to reconcile deep divisions as they try to pass Trump's “one big, beautiful bill,” which encompasses the bulk of his domestic agenda. The plan revolves around his 2017 tax cuts; Republicans want to permanently extend them before they expire at the end of the year, but they can't agree on how to cover the more than $5 trillion price tag—or whether to cover it at all. The likeliest outcome, analysts say, is a bill that adds trillions to federal deficits, which could cause an already shaky economy to collapse.

The GOP stands virtually no chance of stabilizing the nation's finances, the Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin told me. The only question, he said, is “how much worse will it be when they're done?”

For years, fiscal hawks have warned that America's ever-increasing debt (now more than $36 trillion) will provoke a crisis: Markets will crater and interest rates will spike. Even as both parties have run up the nation's tab, these doomsday predictions haven't come true, leading to an unspoken bipartisan understanding that growing the deficit would never really wreck the economy. But Trump's proposals could shatter that assumption.

Read: Congressional Republicans might set off the debt bomb

“It's a significant risk,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told me. Enacting Trump's agenda would probably be a “corrosive event” rather than an immediate disaster, he said, but “there is a reasonable probability that we go over the cliff.” Trump's aggressive tariffs already prompted a steep sell-off in the bond markets, which analysts monitor for signs that global investors are losing confidence in the U.S. economy. If Republicans explode the debt, Zandi said, “you could see bond investors lose it.”

In addition to making his first-term tax cuts permanent, Trump wants Congress to eliminate a suite of taxes—on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits—while adding hundreds of billions in new spending to secure the southern border and bolster the military. As the fiscal analyst Jessica Reidl observed last month in The Atlantic, the GOP's budget resolution would, if enacted, add more to federal deficits than the four costliest bills signed by Trump (during his first term) and former President Joe Biden combined.

A more fiscally responsible approach would offset Trump's tax cuts with spending reductions and revenue increases elsewhere. Both House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune have said Republicans want to cut as much as $1.5 trillion in spending over the next decade. But most analysts doubt they'll be able to trim nearly that much. Tax hikes are anathema to most Republicans, and a push by conservatives for deep spending has met resistance from moderate and electorally vulnerable GOP lawmakers.

Meanwhile, Republicans are loath to cut any of the main drivers of debt: Medicare, Social Security, and defense spending. (In fact, they are planning to increase the Pentagon's budget.) The most expensive program they're targeting is Medicaid, but a sizable group of lawmakers in the House and Senate fears that cutting health-care benefits for the poor will lead to voter backlash—a concern the White House reportedly shares.

Even if Republicans manage to slash $1.5 trillion, they would cover only a fraction of the price of extending the Trump tax cuts. The party claims that lower taxes will generate more revenue through economic growth, and the president says his tariffs can make up the rest of the cost. But analysts are, once again, doubtful. Holtz-Eakin, who advised the late Senator John McCain and now heads the center-right think tank American Action Forum, told me the tariffs won't generate anywhere close to enough money. “The administration is completely incoherent on this stuff,” Holtz-Eakin said. “The numbers don't add up.”

If the past is a guide, the GOP will pay for no more than a small slice of the tax cuts. The party didn't offset the ones it enacted under President George W. Bush, for example, or the ones passed during Trump's first term. In the Senate, Republicans are unwilling even to acknowledge the cost of the cuts; through dubious accounting, they adopted a budget that hides the fact that an extension would increase the deficit at all.

By trying to jam so much of Trump's agenda into a single bill, Republicans risk failing to pass anything. They can afford only a few defections in either chamber, given that Democrats are unanimously opposed to his proposals. In a sign of the party's divisions, GOP leaders postponed a trio of hearings scheduled for this week about the proposal. If the plan collapses, taxes will automatically go up for nearly all Americans next year, which Holtz-Eakin described as the worst-case scenario. If the economy isn't already in a recession by that point, the resulting tax hike could trigger one. “Failure is not an option,” he told me. “They have to avoid the sunset.”

To prevent this outcome, Republicans have some decisions to make. Here are five of the biggest.

1) Medicaid

The most substantial source of potential spending cuts for the GOP is also the most politically fraught. Republicans are considering two major changes to Medicaid: instituting work requirements for some recipients, and scaling back the expansion that Democrats enacted in 2010 through the Affordable Care Act. The party's budget instructs the House committee that oversees federal health insurance to find $880 billion in cuts, much of which would likely come from Medicaid. But at least a dozen Republicans have vowed to oppose slashing benefits, which would disproportionately affect red states. Trump is also skeptical of going after Medicaid, Politico reported, and Democrats have already begun attacking Republicans over the plans.

2) Biden's climate plan

In theory, one of the easiest moves available to Republicans is to repeal spending that none of them voted for in the first place. In 2022, Democrats enacted hundreds of billions of dollars in clean-energy tax credits under Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. No Republican supported the bill, but some are now fighting to protect the funding, because much of it went to their districts. “Those are probably the low-hanging fruit,” Holtz-Eakin said of scrapping the tax credits. But, he added: “some people can't even harvest low-hanging fruit.”

3) Debt limit

Congress needs to increase the nation's debt limit—likely by this summer—to avoid a first-ever default. GOP leaders want to include the measure in Trump's big, beautiful bill, but many House conservatives have never voted to lift the ceiling and are reluctant to start now. Failure to do so, however, could spook the markets and force Republicans to turn to Democrats for help—an unattractive option because Democrats would likely seek policy concessions in exchange for their votes.

4) Soak the rich?

Perhaps the most surprising idea for how to raise revenue has come from Steve Bannon. The first-term Trump strategist has pushed Republicans to hike taxes on the wealthy in order to pay for new tax cuts for working-class Americans. But that proposal faces fierce opposition from conservatives. (The anti-tax activist Grover Norquist told me it would be “incredibly destructive” and “foolish.”) Trump has suggested that it's unlikely to happen.

5) SALT

In 2017, Republicans offset some of the Trump tax cuts by capping the amount of state and local taxes that people could deduct from their federal bill. Limiting this deduction—known as SALT—disproportionately affected high-tax blue states such as New York and California, and Republicans who represent those areas are demanding relief. Lawmakers including Representative Mike Lawler of New York have said they will oppose any tax bill that does not lift the SALT cap. But raising the ceiling would add hundreds of billions to the cost of a bill that Republicans aren't even close to being able to foot.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Google has quietly entered the movie and TV business. Here's why.","https://www.businessinsider.com/google-tv-movie-hollywood-boost-tech-image-hundred-zeros-2025-5","Mon, 05 May 2025 15:56:00 GMT","

Google wants to use Hollywood to upgrade its cool factor.

The tech giant has quietly launched a new film and TV production initiative, Business Insider has learned.

The effort, called 100 Zeros, is a multiyear partnership with Range Media Partners, the talent firm and production company whose notable films include ""A Complete Unknown"" and ""Longlegs."" It's tasked with identifying projects that Google can help fund or produce. The goal is to get behind an array of scripted and unscripted films and TV shows. (The companies wouldn't comment on a number or timeframe.)

Google has a few goals with 100 Zeros. The company sees it as a way to get the creative community to adopt its newer tech products and services, like its Immersive View feature that lets you see things in 3D, spatial tools that blend the physical and virtual worlds, and AI.

Google also wants to promote a positive view of its products — and tech generally — through entertainment to young audiences by helping shape pop culture.

Last year, 100 Zeros quietly dipped a toe in the water, putting some marketing dollars behind an indie horror film from Neon, ""Cuckoo."" In exchange, 100 Zeros' logo was prominently shown in the opening credits. Google didn't seek any publicity for the move, but it was indicative of the alignments it wants: A celebrated indie studio (""Parasite,"" ""Anora"") and a movie aimed at Gen Z and starring Hunter Schafer, known for ""Euphoria"" and the ""Hunger Games"" franchise.

In another step in that direction, Google and Range announced a partnership this spring called ""AI On Screen"" to commission short films about AI, with the goal of making two into feature films. Here's how it described one of the shorts, ""Sweetwater"": ""When the son of a late celebrity visits his childhood home, a piece of fan mail reveals a startling AI, forcing him to reconcile his mother's legacy.""

""Through our continued partnership with Range, we aim to collaborate with the Hollywood creative community in a thoughtful and productive way, upkeeping our ongoing commitment to responsibly support creative expression and explore the possibilities of technology through storytelling,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

In projects where Google is involved early on, the company wouldn't mind if characters clutched Android phones instead of iPhones and used its features like ""Circle to Search."" That's provided the integration isn't forced. Product placement isn't 100 Zeros' main focus, however. Google has a separate effort with United Talent Agency for marketing partnerships like its recent ones with ""The White Lotus"" and ""Wicked"" to promote the Pixel.

One of the ways Google will judge the success of the initiative is how it impacts popular sentiment around the company's products and services. Google dominates the global mobile phone market, but is outsold by Apple in the US. Apple has gained a strong following with Gen Z with its luxury image and blue text bubbles that can make Android users feel left out. Its phones have become entrenched in pop culture, appearing in buzzy titles like ""Succession"" and ""Knives Out."" Piper Sandler's spring survey found 88% of US teens owned an iPhone.

Beyond Android, Google search is losing its hold on young people, who are increasingly going to AI or other platforms like Amazon and TikTok for answers to their questions.

Consumer brands are increasingly using Hollywood-style entertainment to spread their messages, as it's gotten harder to get people's attention with traditional ads. The interest is welcome in cash-strapped Hollywood.

A common approach by brands is to lean on established filmmakers and agencies to develop or produce projects. A handful of brands like Procter & Gamble and WeTransfer have gone further and hired in-house expertise. Google's efforts are similar to those of Waffle Iron Entertainment, a studio Nike set up to make original entertainment that aligns with the company's goals while operating at arm's length.

100 Zeros has a small dedicated staff: Penny Lin, a film producer at Range, and development execs Casey Durant and Tony Nguyen. Rachel Douglas, partner and manager at Range, oversees the relationship with Google. On the Google side, the point person is Jonathan Zepp, the managing director of emerging content experiences.

""This initiative is different in that it's staffed by full-time people who come out of Hollywood and are housed at and supported by Range,"" Douglas said of 100 Zeros.

Consumer brands' flirtation with films isn't guaranteed to last. Some have been halting or slowing film projects amid President Donald Trump's tariffs and attacks on DEI. Even before the tariff news hit, some corporations that had made commitments to the space — including Starbucks, Marriott, and Southwest Airlines — laid off marketers who worked in filmed entertainment as a part of larger corporate cuts, a reminder of the tenuous nature of the work.

One aspect of 100 Zeros that people might find surprising is that it's not looking to leverage YouTube as a primary distribution platform. YouTube has become a TV juggernaut and has been working to make itself a home for premium programming. But 100 Zeros isn't trying to recreate YouTube Originals, the platform's onetime stab at making original shows, or even use YouTube as the first stop for these projects. Instead, the goal is to sell projects to traditional studios and streamers like Netflix.

President Donald Trump said he called Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, who immediately agreed not to display tariff costs next to product prices after they spoke.

In an interview with NBC News' Meet the Press, which aired Sunday, host Kristen Welker asked the president about his call with Bezos.

This was shortly after media outlet Punchbowl News said in a Tuesday report that Amazon would soon start displaying tariff charges beside the product's price, a claim Amazon denied.

""He's just a very nice guy, we have a relationship. I asked him about it,"" Trump told Welker. ""He said, 'Well, I don't want to do that,' and he took it off immediately.""

Amazon and a representative for Bezos didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from BI about Trump's call with Bezos. In a statement last week, Amazon said one of its teams considered listing import charges on certain products, but that idea hadn't been approved and wasn't going to happen.

Welker asked if Trump would ""take that same tactic with other CEOs.""

""I'll always call people if I disagree with them,"" Trump replied.

Welker also asked Trump if he was punishing CEOs who passed tariff costs to consumers.

He said, ""I want them to build plants in the United States. That way, they don't have any tariffs.""

The White House slammed the retailer on Tuesday over the reported plan to display tariff charges. In a press conference, the White House's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called it a ""hostile and political act.""

In the first 100 days of Trump's second term, some of the richest people in the US have taken massive hits to their net worths.

Bezos's net worth has plunged by over $30 billion since January. On January 20, it was $245 billion, but as of May 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, it had dropped to $212 billion.

This comes as the e-commerce giant is reeling from the impact of the tariffs.

Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries except China. His tariff rate for China now stands at 145%.

On Thursday, Amazon reported that it had taken a $1 billion hit in one-time charges in its latest quarter, linked to tariffs and customer returns.

Since Trump's tariffs have gone into effect, there have also been price hikes on some of its most popular items, including home appliances, snacks, and clothing.

Despite criticism of his tariff policies, Trump has held fast. In a Truth Social post on Easter, the president said businesspeople who have criticized his tariffs are bad at both business and politics.

""THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND OR REALIZE THAT I AM THE GREATEST FRIEND THAT AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS EVER HAD!"" Trump wrote.

Representatives for Trump did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Amazon is overhauling its compensation model to more clearly reward sustained top performance while reducing payouts for some lower performers.

According to internal guidelines obtained by Business Insider, Amazon is revising its compensation structure within pay bands to better recognize and reward long-term high performers.

Employees who earn a ""Top Tier"" performance rating for four consecutive years will now receive 110% of their pay range, exceeding the usual cap. In contrast, first-time Top Tier recipients will get 70% of their pay band, down from 80% last year.

""This approach ensures a steadier compensation progression,"" the internal pay guideline said, referring to the company's total compensation target (TCT) metric.

The changes put Amazon in step with other Big Tech giants that are streamlining employee rewards and tightening overall costs. Google has trimmed bonuses and equity for underperformers, Microsoft has introduced stricter review policies, and Meta is actively downsizing its lowest-rated employees.

Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the updated model ""better distinguishes"" those with consistent excellence.

""As always, employees' contributions drive the outcome of their annual compensation review,"" Amazon's spokesperson said. ""What's different this year is that our approach to compensation changes now better distinguishes between newer high performers and those who have consistently exceeded expectations for their role and level.""

Amazon's 12-month pay cycle for corporate employees typically starts in April. Most rank-and-file employees receive their pay updates in early April.

Although Amazon considers various factors when determining employee pay, individual performance ratings—internally known as ""Overall Value""—are a key driver. Employees are ranked across five performance tiers: Top Tier (TT), Highly Valued 3 (HV3), Highly Valued 2 (HV2), Highly Valued 1 (HV1), and Least Effective (LE).

The internal guidelines say performance ""directly impacts"" compensation, and the OV ratings are ""used to generate the compensation recommendation for each employee.""

This year, more weight is being placed on an employee's rating history. For example:

Amazon's pay structure has long sparked internal frustration, partly due to its lack of transparency and the competitive nature of employee rankings, as BI previously reported. Managers are instructed not to share individual OV ratings with employees, leaving staff to infer their performance based on changes in their compensation.

This year's guidelines also said Amazon will continue to run the pilot program that allows employees to take 25% of their new stock awards in cash. Stock compensation has traditionally accounted for a large portion of Amazon's total pay, but it has become less appealing to employees seeking more immediate financial returns.

Despite the recalibration, Amazon says most employees who showed improvement still saw increases this year. The company offers ""multiple channels"" through which employees can raise concerns about pay, the spokesperson added.

Gold prices rose on Monday ahead of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision later this week.

The metal jumped to $3,299 per troy ounce as of 5.27 a.m. ET after a week of losses that ended in an overall decline of around 3% by Friday.

Gold has hit a number of record highs this year. It passed the $3,500 threshold for the first time last month, having passed the $3,000 mark for the first time in March.

This came amid fears of an economic slowdown, tariff uncertainty, and central bank purchases driving up demand.

It's widely expected that the central bank will not cut or hike interest rates on Wednesday, when it's next set to meet.

This is despite President Donald Trump's criticisms about keeping interest rates unchanged. Trump called Fed Chair Jerome Powell a ""major loser"" in a Truth Social post last month.

Deutsche Bank said in a note on Monday that its US economists ""expect the Fed to keep rates steady and avoid explicit forward guidance about the policy path ahead.""

Deutsche Bank analysts said they ""continue to see the next rate cut coming in December.""

Meanwhile, strategists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Sunday that the Federal Open Market Committee ""appears to be setting a higher bar for rate cuts than during the 2019 trade war.""

They added: ""With inflation and survey-based inflation expectations now much higher, participants will want to see more compelling evidence that the economy is slowing and rate cuts are needed before they act.""

Gold is up against a weaker US dollar, which is down almost 0.4% against its rival currencies since its previous close on Friday.

The metal is seen as a popular ""safe-haven"" asset amid ongoing economic uncertainty.

""Safe-haven"" assets are those that typically maintain their value during periods of market turbulence.

OpenAI has bowed to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, announcing in a blog post on Monday that its nonprofit would retain control of the company even as it restructures into a public benefit corporation.

The company, which is backed by Microsoft and was recently valued at $300 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank, said it made the decision after discussing the matter with the attorneys general of California and Delaware.

""With the structure we're contemplating, the not-for-profit will remain in control of OpenAI,"" Bret Taylor, OpenAI's board chairman, said in a video call with reporters. ""We will be converting the limited liability company, that is a subsidiary of that nonprofit, to a public benefit corporation. By doing so, it will change the equity structure of that company so that employees, investors and the not-for-profit can own equity in that PBC.""

Taylor said OpenAI had commissioned outside financial advisors to consult on the recapitalization. He declined to share how much of a stake the nonprofit would have in the company, though it will be a majority.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on the call that he was ""very happy that the nonprofit and the PBC will have the same mission."" He said the board and stakeholders agreed with the decision.

OpenAI is currently engulfed in a heated legal battle with Elon Musk, who co-founded the group as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. Musk is trying to keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit company as he competes in the generative AI market with his own startup, xAI.

Altman was asked about the dispute on Monday's call.

""We are obsessed with our mission and what it takes to fulfill that,"" he said. ""You all are obsessed with Elon, that's your job — like, more power to you. But we are here to think about our mission and figure out how to enable that. And that mission has not changed.""

Led by Altman, OpenAI has been commercializing products in recent years, most notably its viral ChatGPT chatbot, which was launched in late 2022. The company is still overseen by a nonprofit parent and has faced significant hurdles in its goal to restructure into a for-profit, due largely to Musk. A Musk-led group offered to buy OpenAI in February for $97.4 billion, a bid that was swiftly rejected. 

OpenAI's hybrid structure has included a capped-profit limited partnership that was created in 2019. The original nonprofit is the controlling shareholder and would have been spun out as an independent entity if OpenAI had succeeded in its efforts. With that change no longer taking place, OpenAI's investors receive convertible notes that will turn into equity.

A group of ex-OpenAI employees, Nobel laureates, law professors and civil society organizations sent a letter last month to attorneys general in California and Delaware requesting that they halt the startup's restructuring efforts out of safety concerns.

In the letter, which was delivered to OpenAI's board, the group wrote that restructuring to a for-profit entity would ""subvert OpenAI's charitable purpose,"" and ""remove nonprofit control and eliminate critical governance safeguards.""

Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics advisor — and lead organizer of Not For Private Gain, the group that wrote the letter — said in a statement that while it's a positive step that the company is listening to concerns, ""crucial questions remain."" One is around whether OpenAI's commercial goals will ""continue to be legally subordinate to its charitable mission,"" and another is, ""Who will own the technology that OpenAI develops?"" said Hedley, who is lead organizer of the group that wrote the letter. 

Taylor said on the call with reporters that OpenAI's current structure includes the nonprofit board and subsidiary, but that the nonprofit board is really the sole governing body. Taylor shared what he called a ""technical detail"" about the board makeup after restructuring

There will be a separate board for the public benefit corporation, but the nonprofit will appoint those directors, and ""on day one, we plan on having the same directors for both,"" Taylor said.

""From a governance standpoint, the mission comes first, because the fiduciary duty of the not-for-profit board is exclusively to that mission,"" Taylor said. He said that was one ""one of the main pieces of feedback"" from recent conversations.

In a letter to employees that was part of Monday's blog post, Altman said that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI), which rivals or surpasses human intelligence, ""benefits all of humanity."" But a lot has changed in the nine years since he co-founded the lab, he said.

""When we started OpenAI, we did not have a detailed sense for how we were going to accomplish our mission,"" Altman wrote. ""We could not contemplate the direct benefits of AI being used for medical advice, learning, productivity, and much more, or the needs for hundreds of billions of dollars of compute to train models and serve users.""

Altman said OpenAI may still need to pull in trillions of dollars for the resources necessary to ""make our services broadly available to all of humanity.""

President Donald Trump said Monday that he will ask Hollywood studios if ""they're happy"" with his proposal to impose tariffs of 100% percent films made outside of the United States.

""I'm not looking to hurt the industry, I want to help the industry,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

""So we're going to meet with the industry,"" he said. ""I want to make sure they're happy with it because we're all about jobs.""

Trump's comments came a day after he said in a social media post that he was authorizing the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to ""immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.""

Trump did not detail how those tariffs would be implemented.

But on Monday, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that ""no final decision on foreign film tariffs have been made.""

Desai also said, ""The Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.""

Trump in his remarks later Monday to reporters, said that the U.S film industry ""has been decimated by other countries taking them out, and also by incompetence, like in Los Angeles, the governor [Gavin Newsom] is a grossly incompetent man, he's just allowed it to be taken away from.""

""Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business, they have the nice sign, and everything's good, but they don't do very much,"" Trump said.

A spokesperson for Newsom, in a statement, said, ""Governor Newsom continues to champion California's iconic film and television industry — recognizing it as a cornerstone of the state's economy, one that sustains hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs across every sector around the state.""

""His plan to more than double the state's film and television tax credit reflects a commitment to keeping production here at home, supporting workers and maintaining California's global leadership in entertainment,"" the spokesperson said. ""If the President announces a proposal with more details, we will review it.""

 Spending on films and television series made in the United States has been dropping. But all major U.S. based film companies make movies overseas, complicating the questions of how a tariff on such films would be applied, and who it would benefit.

""Tariffs typically apply to the import of 'goods,' so a tariff on DVD imports is easy to enforce and a tariff on intellectual property is nearly impossible to enforce,"" Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush wrote in a research note on Monday.

The amount of money spent in the United States on films and TV series budgeted to $10 million or more has sharply fallen since 2021, while there has been an uptick in spending on films produced in the rest of the world.

In 2021, the so-called committed spend on such films and TV series in the U.S. was nearly $26 billion, according to the company ProdPro, which tracks studio spending. That fell to $19 billion in 2024.

In 2021, the committed spend on such productions in the rest of the world was nearly $23 billion. That rose to $24.6 billion last year, ProdPro data showed.

In 2021, the number of projects budgeted for $10 million or more that were made in the U.S. was 466. That fell to 304 such films in 2024, according to that data.

Conversely, the number of such projects made in the rest of the world grew from 420 in 2021 to 489 in 2024, according to ProdPro.

""According to ProdPro's 2025 survey of studio executives, when asked what are the top criteria they consider when selecting a filming location, tax incentives is the # 1 consideration,"" ProdPro said in a statement to CNBC.

""Other key factors include creative decisions, infrastructure, and local crew,"" the company said. ""Our tracking shows that the US is seeing a decline in absolute numbers and market share, indicating that the productions are moving to other countries including Australia, [New Zealand], among other hubs with attractive incentives.""

ProdPro said that foreign exchange rates ""have also disadvantaged US-based productions given the strength of the US dollar relative to other markets.""

"" In our survey of studio executives regarding their preferred production locations for 2025-26, the top five choices were all outside the United States,"" the company said.

The Trump administration is now offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who volunteer to depart the U.S. for their countries of origin.

""If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,"" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Monday.

""This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens and is a 70% savings for U.S. taxpayers,"" said Noem.

""Self-deportation"" is the Trump administration's term for returning to your home country if you do not have explicit authorization to live in the U.S.

DHS said it currently costs, on average, $17,121 to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented immigrant.

In a Monday interview with Fox News, border czar Tom Homan said the program will save costs and relieve ""resources to focus more on the criminals.""

""It's going to be extreme cost savings, first of all, for the right people, and I think it's going to help remove those that want to come back under a legal program,"" Homan said.

The program requires immigrants to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's ""Home"" app, which had previously served as a portal to access the U.S. asylum system under the Biden administration.

A fact sheet says users will receive a $1,000 stipend only after their arrival in their country of origin is confirmed through the app.

Crucially, DHS also said immigrants who sign up for the departure program will be ""deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.""

It may also help to ""keep the door open for legal immigration into the U.S. at a later date,"" according to the announcement.

""We can work with you and get you to leave, or we'll come find you and we'll remove you based on our schedule and our standards,"" Homan said.

The agency said the new program has already been used by one person who left Chicago to return to Honduras.

In this article

Tesla owners and investors once believed the company and CEO Elon Musk were changing the world. Now many are selling their cars and dumping stock.

Musk has sparked protests in front of Tesla stores and service centers in response to his politics. Many owners are affixing bumper stickers on their Tesla vehicles that say things like ""I bought this before Elon went crazy.""

Musk's work with President Donald Trump has been a final straw for many.

Before Musk became the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump administration effort to slash federal agencies and regulations, Tesla fans were mostly willing to look past the company's challenges.

Musk had often promised more than he delivered. Tesla frequently delayed product rollouts. Tesla owners experienced service, software and quality issues with their cars. The company sometimes lost money. And Tesla and Musk were embroiled in controversies, and subject to multiple government investigations through the years.

Today, disappointed fans trying to unload their cars find that used Tesla vehicles have plummeted in value. And investors find that Tesla shares, which reached an all-time high in the wake of the 2024 election, have fallen by more than 20% since the beginning of the year.

While Musk said on the company's Q1 2025 earnings call that he plans to spend more time at Tesla, and just one or two days a week on government matters starting in May, for many, the damage is done.

MSTR earnings came out May 1. My morning media stops last Thursday (here and here) asked for a preview. We don't talk about stocks, so I planned to zoom out and hit themes. While preparing, I had to suppress the eye-roll reflexes that MSTR triggers.

MSTR, of course, is the ticker symbol for MicroStrategy, or Strategy, as the company is now known. Strategy, fronted by Michael Saylor, pioneered the “bitcoin treasury” model that's now been copied by Metaplanet and dozens of other companies. Strategy plans to raise $84 billion, according to its most recent announcement, across equity and fixed income instruments. 

Here are three questions:

1. Earnings? MSTR ""earnings"" and ""price targets"" are... Well, they don't really mean the same thing, especially once the effect of ASC 2023-08 is backed out. It's just the price of bitcoin and financing, plain and simple. Wall Street analysts and pundits should get that right.

2. Strategy? You can't just say, ""Strategy."" You have to say, ""Strategy; you know, it used to be Microstrategy."" Like Prince, Puff Daddy, Kanye West and Twitter. NB: folks say ""strategy"" (small ""s"") a lot already.

3. Don't be a hater? MSTR supports a market cap of $107b with bitcoin holdings of $53b and laser-eyed goodwill. No lifeboat, no parachute, no apparent Plan B. If it fails, the bitcoin market could take the blame.

Those eye-rollers (and some obsequious media coverage) notwithstanding, we can agree that: 

- The capital raises are truly awesome. The force is strong in this one.

- MSTR is up 36% on the year, compared to less than 5% for bitcoin. Who am I to throw stones?

- MSTR cleverly uses stock price volatility as a feature, not a bug, for 1) issuing mouth-watering converts, 2) attracting listed options volume, and 3) corporate ""yield"" strategies. (Just please stop calling option-selling a ""yield strategy."" And I said ""strategy"" again. Small ""s"".)

- The preferreds (STRK and STRF) hit the mark with some folks who like preferreds. Some of my preferreds friends are smitten.

Strategy (big ""S"") has not only created a movement, but a category. Levered MSTR ETFs (including this new one which pays ""income"") serve the market for whom MSTR's 70 vol is dull. Grayscale announced an ETF that tracks 30 companies that hold at least 100 bitcoin.

Last, but not least, Cantor Equity Partners, a SPAC, is merging to form Twenty One Capital, which will hold $3 billion of bitcoin. Mention this trend in a room full of pundits and they'll yell ""Gamestop!"" in unison. It's fun.

This is all fine. Adding bitcoin to the treasury of non-crypto companies* is an interesting trend. (And that doesn't include crypto-native companies, like CoinDesk's parent company, Bullish.)

But it's only bitcoin at the moment.

Despite the loosening of U.S. regulatory zip-ties on digital assets and the recent flurry of ETF filings, bitcoin still dominates the conversation (it still accounts for about two-thirds of the total cryptocurrency market).

Again, that's fine if we are talking about a store-of-value asset contributing to a corporate treasury otherwise allocated to cash and treasuries. However, the growing number of flavors of bitcoin exposure--leverage, yield, optionality, protection--are taking the place of education about what other blockchain assets hope to deliver, and why it is important to spend more time thinking about the asset class.

Until recently, that was fruitless for many investors and advisors, since brokerage- or futures- account implementation was not available. (Of course, it has been for ETH, but you need more than ETH to think about the ""digital asset class."" Lack of enthusiasm for ETH investment vehicles, we believe, has struggled in part for this reason.)

If 2024 was bitcoin's ""coming out"" year, we hope that 2025 gives investors and traders opportunities to think deeper and more broadly, and to implement accordingly. If not, the U.S. crypto investing narrative will start to sound like a ""bitcoin maxi,"" and that feels like leaving money on the table.

With Bitcoin's market cap nearing $2 trillion, Solv Protocol's Ryan Chow says BTCFi could scale far beyond Ethereum's decentralized finance if even a fraction becomes productive.

Bitcoin's (BTC) decentralized finance space — better known as BTCFi — is still in its early innings. But some see a huge opportunity taking shape. American crypto-focused hedge fund Pantera Capital, for instance, suggested it could unlock as much as $500 billion in value should it gain mainstream adoption.

Solv Protocol, a platform that helps Bitcoin holders to do more with their BTC, appears to be one of the players betting on that future. The project has already crossed $2 billion in total value locked, aiming to bring yield-bearing strategies to Bitcoin in a way that mirrors what Lido did for Ethereum.

In an exclusive interview with crypto.news, Solv founder Ryan Chow talks about why BTCFi might eventually outgrow Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem — though he admits there's still a long way to go. He also weighs in on transparency standards like “proof-of-TVL,” the possibility of a Bitcoin staking ETF, and what it will take to attract institutional capital into Bitcoin's on-chain economy.

CN: Bitcoin's DeFi space is still in its early days, but Pantera thinks it could unlock a $500 billion opportunity if it takes off. Solv has already hit $2 billion in TVL, and Ethereum's Lido is sitting at over $16 billion. How big do you think the Bitcoin staking market could get if Bitcoin's DeFi really catches up to Ethereum's?

RC: While comparisons to Ethereum's staking market provide context, the opportunity in BTCFi is driven by a much larger factor: Bitcoin's status as a premier global asset class.

With a market cap nearing $2 trillion, Bitcoin has solidified its place as a significant store of value. For an asset of this magnitude, a sophisticated financial ecosystem is inevitable. The opportunity lies in unlocking the vast portion of this $2 trillion that remains idle. If BTCFi effectively financializes a significant part of Bitcoin's market cap, its size could be exponentially larger than Ethereum's DeFi, driven by Bitcoin's scale as an asset. Solv is building the essential infrastructure needed to make Bitcoin a truly productive force in the global financial landscape.

CN: Given the regular updates to total value locked on centralized web2 platforms like DefiLlama, do you think staking protocols should adopt a standardized approach, such as ‘proof-of-TVL' similar to ‘proof-of-reserves' to enhance transparency and prevent confusion for users?

RC: Transparency is absolutely fundamental to building trust and the long-term growth of the ecosystem, especially in BTCFi. Metrics like TVL, proof-of-reserves, and a potential proof-of-TVL are valuable tools, and we believe standardized approaches are necessary for clarity.

At Solv, our commitment is unwavering. We are actively implementing multiple layers of transparency: providing public dashboards, supporting third-party verification like Chainlink PoR, working directly with data platforms such as DefiLlama for accurate reporting, etc. We are committed to exploring any viable method that genuinely enhances transparency. We support industry collaboration on these standards. Verifiable transparency and integrity are paramount for attracting the institutional participation needed for BTCFi's biggest expansion.

CN: Do you think a Bitcoin staking ETF could follow if the SEC approves Ethereum staking ETFs? How large could the market be?

RC: If the SEC approves Ethereum staking ETFs, it could open the door for similar products in the ecosystem, however, a Bitcoin Staking ETF would face unique implementation challenges as Bitcoin's consensus mechanism doesn't natively support staking like Ethereum's proof-of-stake. Instead, a Bitcoin staking ETF would need to rely on third-party solutions for yield generation, such as Bitcoin LSTs [liquid staking tokens], creating additional regulatory considerations around security and underlying mechanics.

The market opportunity for such products could be significant given the precedent set by spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw billions in inflows shortly after approval. Traditional financial institutions seeking both Bitcoin exposure and yield generation might find such products compelling, especially as the broader market becomes more comfortable with digital asset investments. However, the regulatory path would likely require robust security measures and full transparency around how yield is generated.

The crypto market cap presently stands at $2.94 trillion

Bitcoin saw its price drop over the weekend, days after it rose to $97,000 at the end of last week. On Monday, Bitcoin's price fell by nearly two percent on international exchanges, where it was trading at $94,407 (roughly Rs. 79.5 lakh). On Indian exchanges, the price of BTC slipped by 2.25 percent, bringing its value to $94,413 (roughly Rs. 79.5 lakh). Market analysts told Gadgets 360 that the upcoming US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is causing market participants to tread cautiously.

""Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 (roughly Rs. 79 lakh) as investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the FOMC meeting slated for this week in the US. Bitcoin now faces resistance near the previous high of $97,900 (roughly Rs. 82.5 lakh), while major support stands at $92,000 (roughly Rs. 77.5 lakh),"" Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex told Gadgets 360. ""BTC just recorded its highest number of active addresses in six months, with over 925,000 addresses active in a single day. This rise in participation reflects growing investor interest and market engagement.""

Similarly, Ether's price dipped by 1.77 percent in the last 24 hours on global exchanges. Data by CoinMarketCap shows ETH is currently trading at $1,806 (roughly Rs. 1.52 lakh) on Monday. On Indian exchanges, ETH saw its price drop by 3.81 percent to trade at $1,809 (roughly Rs. 1.52 lakh).

""Investors seek stability amid volatility. We expect the market to remain range-bound in the short term, with breakout potential hinging on macro sentiment and institutional flows,"" Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder and CEO, Pi42 said on Monday.

The crypto price tracker by Gadgets 360 showed the prices of most altcoins were down on Monday.

These include Ripple, Solana, Avalanche, Stellar, and Shiba Inu.

Monero, Cronos, EOS Coin, and Elrond were also trading at lower values on Monday.

The overall crypto market dipped by 1.50 percent in the last 24 hours, bringing its valuation to $2.94 trillion (roughly Rs. 2,47,70,431 crore), according to CoinMarketCap.

""Bitcoin's price continues to plunge after closing the weekly trade on a bearish note. Most of the altcoins have been facing notable upward pressure. The crypto market seems to have entered a retracement phase. The top 10 tokens are closely following Bitcoin's trajectory,"" CoinDCX's research team told Gadgets 360.

Some altcoins remained unaffected by the current slowdown, and their prices were up on Monday. These include Tron, Leo, Iota, and Polygon.

The CoinSwitch Markets Desk, in its opinion, called the market sentiment optimistic, owing to potential US-China trade negotiations and the prevailing positive trend in traditional markets with S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite, both closing the week with a gain of ~1.5 percent. Industry analysts have advised investors to be cautious.

""Institutional interest is rising, with traditional finance exploring tokenised assets and blockchain-based fund structures. While optimism is evident, traders should remain cautious near psychological levels like $100K, where volatility tends to spike. Overall, the market tone remains constructive with broad-based support across sectors,"" Himanshu Maradiya, Founder and Chairman, CIFDAQ exchange told Gadgets 360.

Highlights

The crypto market has received yet another endorsement from US President Donald Trump, who has declared it to be “much stronger” than the US stock market after showing resilience in the last two months amid the US-China tariff war. His remarks have fuelled bullish sentiment among crypto traders who are now seeking the top altcoins to buy.

While speaking in a recent interview, Trump noted that crypto was “much stronger” than other risk assets during the recent financial market turmoil caused by tariff concerns, a statement that has sparked interest in the top altcoins to buy. Trump's remarks come after the S&P 500 index shed more than $5 trillion during the first week of April alone as investors reacted to the tariff war.

While the crypto market also shed some value, the losses were smaller, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling by around 15% between April 2 and April 7. Altcoins also registered minute losses compared to US stocks, with the total market cap shedding around $400 million of its value during the same period.

Besides its resilience, Trump further added that he was endorsing the industry because millions of people are interested in crypto assets. He opined,

“I think crypto is important because if we don't do it, China is going to. And it's new, it's very popular, it's very hot. I want crypto because a lot of people – millions of people – want it.”

Trump's remarks come after a recent survey revealed that 73% of US digital asset investors believe that it is important for the US to emerge as a crypto leader. This could become possible with Trump's pro-crypto approach, hence the surging demand for top crypto coins to buy.

Some of the top altcoins that crypto investors can consider to buy today, following Trump's recent endorsement, include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE). These are some of the top altcoins by crypto market ranking and have solid fundamentals and a bullish technical outlook that may support a rally.

There are multiple reasons that a crypto trader should consider to buy the largest altcoin, Ethereum, including the upcoming Pectra upgrade and surging inflows to ETH products. This network upgrade will happen on May 7, with its releases coinciding with $149M inflows to Ethereum per a recent Coinshares report.

The rising demand and the potential surge in bullish sentiment that follows major blockchain upgrades suggest a bullish Ethereum price prediction as the altcoin eyes notable gains this week, making it a good choice for investors.

One of the altcoins to buy that is bound to make notable gains following Trump's recent endorsement of the crypto industry is Ripple (XRP). XRP stands out as the biggest USA coin that is poised to benefit heavily from a pro-crypto regulatory framework.

Moreover, technical analysis shows that the Ripple price is at a pivotal point that may precede an uptrend to $2.59 if it overcomes resistance at the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern. Coingape also reported that XRP may hit $12 amid a bullish formation in the Elliott Wave pattern.

Dogecoin is also one of the top altcoins to buy this week as DOGE eyes a $0.40 breakout before the month ends. The meme coin has also seen a spike in the volume of long trades, with 70% of traders on Binance opening long positions. This indicates a bullish bias as most futures traders anticipate an upward price recovery.

President Trump's recent statement about the crypto market being “much stronger” than the US stock market, with a $52 trillion valuation, has fuelled demand for altcoins. Some of the top altcoins to buy amid this development include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

A16z Crypto led a $25 million investment round into Miden, an independent blockchain project spun out of Polygon Labs. Miden closed its $25 million seed rounds led by a16z Crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC, with participation from Finality Capital Partners, Symbolic Capital, P2 Ventures, Delta Fund, MH Ventures, as well as from angel investors, including MakerDAO's Rune Christensen and EigenLayer's Sreeram Kannan. Miden is a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof-powered blockchain focused on high scalability through its hybrid consensus mode, which moves transaction execution from the mainnet on “edge devices,” referring to users' devices. Designed for institutions that value confidentiality, Miden enables applications to execute both public and private transactions with full privacy, according to an April 29 announcement shared with Cointelegraph. Execution on edge devices can help with the “bottlenecks that limit traditional chains,” said Bobbin Threadbare, the co-founder at Miden and former engineer at Meta, adding: “It allows blockchains to scale without relying on supernodes or sacrificing decentralization, while making privacy a built-in feature instead of an afterthought.”

Dubai, UAE, May  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BitUtility has officially launched its initial utility NFT, labeled ""Peacock."" The team proposes a way to tear down the hassle wall standing between users' crypto wallets and their monthly bills. 

 

Rather  than wasting time on bridges/exchanges and having to deal with relevant  fees, BitUtility brings its one-click system to the market. Any bill  (from electricity to phone, and even rent) can be paid with crypto in a  matter of a few seconds with BitUtility.

This  change is coming together with the launch of the limited Peacock NFT,  which will serve as a badge for the Web3 fans powering the BitUility  community. In fact, token holders will forever pay 0% fees, get  early-bird access to new features, and have a say in the project's  roadmap through shared governance.

Moreover,  the NFT supply is capped, and the fee savings compound over time. This  is a system designed to increase the value of each token as the project  grows.

A Global Payment Layer for Web3 Income

BitUtility operates as a decentralized payment protocol. It connects to thousands of service providers globally, such as:

- Electricity, gas, and water bills (more generally, utility bills)- Mobile plans and top-ups- Rent, insurance, and financial services- Flight bookings, accommodation arrangements, eSIMs,- Gift cards to large international brands- Government services in supported jurisdictionsPayments come in through supported crypto wallets only. Peacock NFT holders pay no platform fees, ever.  

The  team believes that paying bills with crypto should not be a maze of  middlemen and hidden fees. BitUtility turns this mechanism into a quick  and low-cost click. With limited Peacock NFT supply and 0% holder fees,  the team is aiming to give real utility to its community. It will also  be possible to simply resell the NFT later, combining today's utility of  owning the token with tomorrow's market value.

Designed for Crypto Earners, Not Speculators

The  Peacock NFT was created for freelancers, DAO contributors, and remote  workers who earn income in crypto. It offers lifetime access to zero-fee  payments and also includes:

 - Airdrops from the upcoming BitUtility governance token- Access to staking rewards and protocol-based income- Voting rights on platform upgrades and integrations- Early access to new features and partner programs 

Supply is permanently capped at 4,900 NFTs. Ownership grants ongoing benefits as the platform expands.

Economic Utility, Not Hype

The  Peacock NFT was not created with speculation in mind. Its utility is  linked to platform use. Holder rewards and protocol incentives accrue  proportionally with increasing services and adoption.

The  main strength of this NFT is that it aims to bring a definite economic  purpose. In fact, Peacock NFT lowers expenses of crypto-based living and  connects long-term value to actual financial activity.

BitUtility  addresses typical problems of the crypto-native economy. These problems  include cross-border remittances, expensive transfer fees, and limited  merchant acceptance.

The  site eliminates friction by making any crypto wallet a global payment  gateway. Transactions are instant and remain fully on-chain. For those  living in crypto, it presents a working replacement to fiat bank  systems.

Community Governance and Early Access

BitUtility  users are shaping upcoming product integrations and governance of the  platform. HODLers of the Peacock NFT are at the forefront in directing  the same. Throughout BitUtility's Telegram channel, Discord channel, and  X (Twitter) space, the wheels of discussion have been set in motion.

Minting of the Peacock NFT will soon be live. Anyone interested can join the project community and apply for the whitelist.

About BitUtility

BitUtility  is a Web3 utility payments platform built to make everyday life truly  crypto-native. Instead of shuffling coins through bridges, swaps, banks,  and hidden 5–10 % fees, BitUtility lets users pay any utility bill  (electricity, rent, phone, groceries) in one direct click from their  wallet. 

The  protocol handles the behind‑the‑scenes conversions, so users stay  entirely on‑chain while merchants still receive local currency. Early  supporters can mint the limited Peacock NFT, which locks in 0% lifetime  fees, earns a share of protocol revenues, and gives holders voting power  over new services. 

As  more people choose BitUtility to skip fees and complexity, demand for  fee‑free Peacock passes rises too. The system turns an everyday  cost‑saver into an asset that can grow and be resold, effectively  letting users own a piece of the payment rail they use.

Anyone wishing to find out more about BitUtility and its new NFT collection can visit the project's website. The social pages below are also a valid way to keep in touch with the team and follow BitUtility's news.

agency's efforts to support digital transformation and economic growth.

One of the key initiatives will be the introduction of
crypto payment services using Binance Pay. The partners said this could help
improve cross-border transactions, not only within Kyrgyzstan but also across
Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union.

 Kyrgyzstan signed a memorandum of understanding with Binance to launch Binance Pay in the country. 

Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has proposed Bitcoin and BNB as the first digital assets to build Kyrgyzstan's national crypto reserves.

On May 5, Zhao shared on X that he had advised Kyrgyzstan to start with Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) when building its national crypto reserve. In 2024, Forbes claimed that Zhao holds about 94 million BNB tokens, or 64% of BNB's circulating supply. At the time of writing, these tokens are worth about $55 billion. 

The proposal followed Zhao's earlier announcement that he had begun advising Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency (NIA) on blockchain and crypto-related matters.  

On April 3, Zhao confirmed he's been officially and unofficially advising governments on crypto frameworks and blockchain solutions. The former Binance CEO said that he finds the work extremely meaningful. 

A month after CZ announced his role in advising Kyrgyzstan, Binance announced a partnership with the country to launch a crypto payments service. 

On May 4, Binance signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the NIA to introduce Binance Pay to the country, enabling crypto transactions. The partnership also aims to boost crypto education in the country, with Binance Academy set to work with government agencies to develop blockchain-focused educational programs. 

On April 17, Binance CEO Richard Teng said in a Financial Times interview that the exchange had been advising countries on crypto reserves. 

Kyrgyzstan has been making moves to become a digital asset-friendly jurisdiction. On April 17, Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov signed a law authorizing a central bank digital currency pilot project while giving the national currency's digital form a legal tender status.

The country also reportedly plans to launch a gold-backed stablecoin. The gold-backed stablecoin will be pegged to the United States dollar and called the Gold Dollar (USDKG). This will be backed by $500 million in gold provided by the country's Ministry of Finance. 

Cointelegraph reached out to the country's Ministry of Finance to confirm the reports but did not get a response before publication.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee plans to block a hearing on cryptocurrency legislation Tuesday over concerns related to President Trump's growing ties to the industry. 

Waters will object to the joint hearing between the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee, a Democratic aide told The Hill. This prevents them from moving forward, as joint hearings require the approval of every member. 

House Democrats will instead hold their own hearing to investigate Trump's crypto ventures, including his meme coin and World Liberty Financial. 

The move comes after Republican leaders on the two committees released a discussion draft for digital asset market structure legislation.  

Waters told House Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-Ark.) that she would not approve the joint hearing unless the legislation included provisions to block Trump from profiting from the industry, which he declined to do, according to the staffer. 

Trump and his family have increasingly expanded their crypto portfolio, as his administration pushes for new rules of the road for the industry.  

World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm launched by the president and his sons, announced last week that an Emirati firm would use its new stablecoin to conduct a $2 billion transaction with Binance. 

Trump is set to attend a dinner later this month with the top investors in his meme coin, which he launched shortly before inauguration. The price of the token, $TRUMP, jumped 60 percent on the news, prompting some Democratic lawmakers to call for an ethics probe. 

The president and his artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto czar, David Sacks, are also expected to appear at a $1.5 million-a-plate fundraiser with crypto and AI investors Monday.

The rebellion by House Democrats is the latest pushback against crypto legislation, threatening to upend Trump and Republicans' efforts to pass bills establishing a regulatory framework for the industry

A group of crypto-friendly Senate Democrats pulled their support for stablecoin legislation over the weekend, after Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) sought to expedite a vote on the bill. 

The senators, several of whom voted to advance the legislation out of the Senate Banking Committee, accused Republicans of attempting to jam through the bill without further negotiations. 

“It seems they want us to suck it up and vote for this bill without our input, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) wrote in a post on X. “That's not what we expected during this negotiation and not how I operate. Our statement makes clear we won't let them jam us. Looking forward to continuing to get this bill to a better place.”

Crypto's big show in the U.S. Congress has been unveiled in the form of a discussion draft of legislation that would establish for the first time a comprehensive domestic regime for regulating digital assets.

The House Financial Services Committee and House Agriculture Committee — both sharing responsibility for the jurisdiction-hoping assets — released a working draft of a bill on Monday that Representative French Hill, chairman of the financial-services panel, said can deliver ""much-needed regulatory clarity.""

""Today marks the first step in advancing a comprehensive framework that protects consumers, fosters innovation, and closes regulatory gaps in oversight,"" said Representative Glenn ""GT"" Thompson, chairman on the agricultural committee, which has oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that will likely have a major role in crypto oversight. ""It will give digital asset developers and users the certainty they need and have asked for.

On Tuesday, the digital assets subcommittees of both House committees are set to hold a joint hearing on the future of digital assets, where the discussion draft will be under the spotlight.

The draft details the public disclosures that crypto projects would be required to make. It also provides for digital assets developers to raise capital under the Securities and Exchange Commission's watch, or to register with the CFTC to handle the trading of digital commodities.

The bill is meant to finally establish ""clear lines"" between the jurisdictions of the two U.S. markets regulators, a question that's been a thorn in the side of U.S. crypto businesses.

This proposed format for the long-awaited crypto legislation, built on a similar first effort called the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) that advanced through the House last year, emerges as the industry's allies in Congress have been working urgently on a separate legislative effort to regulate stablecoins. The stablecoin and market-structure bills represent the primary lobbying effort for crypto in the U.S., though advocates are fighting the headwinds of President Donald Trump's own crypto business interests that have drawn Democratic criticism.

Stablecoin bills have already advanced through House and Senate committees and are awaiting consideration by the overall chambers.

Three of the leading crypto lobbying organizations issued a joint statement on Monday urging the Senate to get on with the debate for its version of the stablecoin bill, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The leaders of the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation and the Digital Chamber asked for Senate support to ""move us one step closer to enacting a bipartisan stablecoin framework.""

Corporate treasury buying of bitcoin (BTC) could reach $330 billion by the end of 2029, broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday.

Strategy (MSTR) is likely to be the largest buyer, with an additional $124 billion of the world's largest crypto, in the broker's bull case. The company led by Michael Saylor announced a further $21 billion at-the-market common stock offering last week to buy more bitcoin.

""The U.S. pro crypto regulatory regime have further accelerated the corporate ownership growth of bitcoin,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

Bernstein expects other listed companies to allocate around $205 billion to bitcoin acquisition strategies, led by smaller firms with lower growth looking to emulate Strategy's treasury model.

Public companies now own ~2.4% of the bitcoin supply, or about 720,000 BTC on their balance sheets, the report noted.

Still, Strategy's ""scale is hard to replicate"" and not every bitcoin treasury will be successful in attempting to replicate the company's playbook, the report added.

Strategy acquired an additional 1,895 bitcoin last week for $180.3 million.

 Steady purchasing demand at Bitcoin's lower support levels is keeping the pressure on the $95,000 BTC resistance zone. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 

Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that there were more than $9 in realized profits for every dollar realized in loss.

However, a positive sign in favor of bulls is that the US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds witnessed inflows of $1.8 billion last week, per Farside Investors data. The ETF issuers and the institutions acquired 18,644 Bitcoin last week compared to the 3,150 Bitcoin mined during the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.

What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week and rose above the 50-day simple moving average (5,575).

The 20-day exponential moving average (5,501) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to buyers. The up move could reach 5,800, which is expected to attract strong selling by the bears. If the price turns down from 5,800, it is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. 

Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening. The index may drop to 5,400 and subsequently to 5,300.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced off the 99 support on April 29 and reached the 20-day EMA (100.38) on May 1.

Buyers are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, but a minor positive is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the index could rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 101.39 and then to the 50-day SMA (102.72).

This positive view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below the 99 level. That could sink the index to the critical support at 97.92.

Bitcoin closed below the $95,000 support on May 4, and the bears are trying to extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($92,204).

Buyers will have to fiercely defend the 20-day EMA to keep the bullish momentum intact. If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to propel the BTC/USDT pair to the psychological level of $100,000. 

Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($86,890). A deeper pullback suggests a range formation in the near term.

Buyers have managed to sustain Ether (ETH) above the moving averages, signaling strength.

The 20-day EMA ($1,771) is sloping up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. There is minor resistance at $1,957, but it is likely to be crossed. The ETH/USDT pair could surge to the breakdown level of $2,111, where the bears are expected to sell aggressively.

A break and close below the moving averages opens the gates for a fall to $1,537 and later to the critical support at $1,368.

XRP (XRP) remains stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.

Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if they drive the price above the resistance line. The XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3, suggesting a short-term trend change.

On the contrary, a break and close below $2 will put the sellers in charge. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.61, where the buyers are expected to step in.

BNB (BNB) slipped below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels.

If buyers push the price above the moving averages, it suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls will then attempt to overcome the barrier at $620. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could shoot up to $644.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it suggests that the bears are trying to take control. There is support in the $576 to $566 zone, but if it breaks down, the pair could dive to $520.

Solana (SOL) is finding support at the 20-day EMA ($143), indicating that the bulls remain buyers on dips.

The bulls will again attempt to thrust the price above the $153 resistance. If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could ascend to $180. Such a move brings the large $110 to $260 range into play.

If bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($133). That suggests the pair may consolidate between $110 and $153 for a while.

Buyers have managed to keep Dogecoin (DOGE) above the moving averages but failed to start a strong rebound.

The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the DOGE/USDT pair may extend its stay inside the $0.21 to $0.14 range for some time.

If the price turns up from the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the pair to $0.21. Sellers are expected to defend the level aggressively, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket to $0.28. Contrarily, a break below the moving averages could sink the pair to the solid support at $0.14.

Cardano (ADA) is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the moving averages.

The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $0.75. That opens the doors for a rally to $0.83.

On the downside, a close below the moving averages tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. There is solid support at $0.58, but if the level gives way, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to $0.50.

Sui (SUI) is attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA ($3.09), indicating demand at lower levels.

The bulls will try to push the price to $3.90, which is expected to act as a stiff resistance. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that buyers have an edge. A break and close above $3.90 could catapult the SUI/USDT pair to $4.25 and later to $5.

Instead, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bulls have given up. That may pull the price to $2.86 and then to the 50-day SMA ($2.57).

 As crypto market manipulation evolves, highly organized networks coordinate sophisticated schemes across exchanges, threatening market integrity. Collective vigilance and data sharing can protect the ecosystem. 

Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXC

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.

What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

Market manipulation is as old as markets themselves. In ancient Greece, a philosopher named Thales of Miletus used his knowledge of weather patterns to predict a bumper olive harvest, quietly leasing all the olive presses in the region at a low rate before the season started. Then, when the harvest came in, and demand for presses spiked, he rented them out at inflated prices, pocketing the difference. 

For a more recent historical example, albeit still 300 years in the past, see the South Sea Company bubble in which company directors dumped shares at peak prices, leaving regular investors rekt. Or the Dutch tulip bubble of a century earlier. 

Market manipulation has existed in crypto since the first exchanges came onstream around 2011. Those who were around back then may recall the pump-and-dump schemes on the BTC-E exchange orchestrated by a notorious trader called Fontas. Or they might remember Bear Whale, whose 30,000 BTC sell wall crashed the market at a time when total daily trading volume was less than $30 million — for all of crypto combined. While not technically market manipulation, it showed how easily one individual could move the crypto market.

Fast forward to today, and crypto is a multi-trillion dollar asset class, rendering manipulation of large-cap assets virtually impossible for solitary whales. But when a group of nefarious traders team up, it's still possible to move markets — and well-organized insiders are doing just that.

The days when a single whale could set a BTC sell wall that took weeks to topple are long gone. While crypto is magnitudes more liquid these days, it's also much more fragmented. This presents opportunities to enterprising traders who hunt in packs to move markets to their advantage. Often working through private Telegram groups, people coordinate activities targeting markets where they can have the most effect. The trend highlights the growing participation of major players in market manipulation schemes, presenting a new level of risk for the crypto industry. 

Recent: What are exit liquidity traps — and how to detect them before it is too late

In February, analyst James CryptoGuru warned of large-scale manipulation risks involving spot Bitcoin ETFs. He explained that these instruments could put downward pressure on Bitcoin's price — particularly when traditional financial markets are closed. Such a strategy could trigger liquidations among leveraged traders and create temporary imbalances, allowing large players to accumulate BTC and ETH at discounted prices.

Because crypto — both onchain and on-exchange — is highly interconnected, the ripple effects of a successful manipulation attempt extend far and wide. If a trading pair queried by APIs for feeding other markets is knocked out of sync on one centralized exchange, it can generate arbitrage opportunities elsewhere, including on perps markets. As a result, an attack can be initiated on one exchange, and the profits claimed on another, making it extremely hard to catch the culprits.

The integrity of the cryptocurrency market faces increased risk. Coordinated groups have deep pockets, technical tools, and cross-platform access to execute and mask complex operations. The troubling part is that most exchanges remain reactive by design since it's virtually impossible to prevent market manipulation. As a result, attackers have a high chance of retaining the advantage, even if the window in which they're free to run amok is becoming increasingly smaller.

Just as Thales of Miletus wasn't breaking the rules when he profited off olive season, much of what constitutes crypto manipulation isn't illegal. When a large fund starts buying a particular token through one of their public wallets to attract attention — is that manipulation? Or when market makers go beyond simply matching bid-ask spreads to actively propping up a token's price at the request of a project? Many things move markets, but mostly things that aren't illegal — at least not now.

While the moral code governing influencers, market makers, trading firms, and other players of serious size can be debated at length, other cases require less nuance. The last time anyone checked, using thousands of exchange accounts staffed by dozens of users to inflate a particular asset is blatant manipulation. Exchanges, aided by increasingly sophisticated AI-powered tooling, are fighting back.

The days when one user would cause mayhem on the markets may be over. The threat hasn't, however, dissipated in the multichain, multi-exchange era — it's multiplied. As a result, exchanges are now locked into a game of whack-a-mole, trying to detect suspicious behavior initiated by hundreds or thousands of accounts simultaneously.

Thankfully, exchanges don't have to do it alone, as successful collaboration cases show. When Bybit was hacked in early 2025, other platforms stepped in to lend ETH and help it meet its withdrawal obligations — a rare but powerful sign of solidarity in the face of crisis.

As well-funded, highly organized groups continue to test the system, one thing becomes clear: manipulating the market may be relatively easy — but doing so without being detected is increasingly difficult. Collective vigilance, data sharing, and early detection are becoming the most effective tools in safeguarding the integrity of the crypto trading ecosystem.

 Bitcoin price is in a tug-of-war between the bulls and bears, with big overhead resistance at $98,000 in place and several key support levels below. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin failed to break the $98,000 resistance amid increased profit-taking.

BTC price needs to close above $95,000 on the daily chart for a push to $100,000.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price failed to break above resistance at $98,000 on May 3. Since April 22, BTC prices have formed daily candle highs between $93,000 and $97,900, but they could not close above $97,440.

Bitcoin price action has been choppy and within a narrow range for the past few days. With elevated profit-taking and a lot of supply in profit, markets could see volatile price swings toward key BTC price levels over the next few days. 

Senior researcher at Glassnode, CryptoVizArt.₿, said that Bitcoin's rally to the $93,000-96,000 range has “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.”

In other words, the Realized Profit/Loss ratio shows that the volume of Bitcoin being sold at a profit exceeds historical norms. This suggests heightened selling activity by investors locking in gains, often signaling potential market tops and increased sell-side pressure.

The chart below indicates that “for every dollar realized in loss, more than 9 dollars was realized in profit!” CryptoVizArt.₿ explained, adding:

As reported by Cointelegraph, BTC selling has been ramping up near the $95,000 level over the past few days as short-term traders book profits.

Crypto analyst Checkmate said that Bitcoin's current market is at a key “decision point,” so Bitcoin must clear this price zone in the near term to avoid another major correction.

Bitcoin's supply in profit now stands at 86%, as per data from Glassnode. This high percentage often signals a bullish phase. However, it also indicates potential risks: When supply in profit exceeds 80-90%, historical patterns show increased profit-taking, particularly by short-term holders, which can lead to corrections.

Given these two scenarios, Checkmate pointed out:

Bitcoin must flip the $98,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs above $100,000.

But first, the BTC/USD pair must close above $95,000 on the daily chart. BTC's price dropped below this level on May 4, driven by profit-taking after the rally to $97,000.

​​One positive catalyst for the bulls could be continued demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs registered $1.8 billion in net inflows last week, per Farside Investors' data.

Another catalyst could come from Wednesday's Fed interest rate decision meeting. 

Meanwhile, the bears will attempt to keep the $98,000 resistance in place to increase the likelihood of pulling the price below $92,000. The immediate target below the previous range lows is at $90,000, i.e., the convergence point of the 100-day and 200-day SMAs.

Below $90,000, the next key area of interest remains between $85,000 and $75,000. Reaching $75,000 would erase all the gains after the 90-day tariff pause.

Metrics details

Concerns about the relationship between social media use and adolescent mental health are growing, yet few studies focus on adolescents with clinical-level mental health symptoms. This limits our understanding of how social media use varies across mental health profiles. In this Registered Report, we analyse nationally representative UK data (N = 3,340, aged 11–19 years) including diagnostic assessments by clinical raters alongside quantitative and qualitative social media measures. As hypothesized, adolescents with mental health conditions reported spending more time on social media and were less happy about the number of online friends than adolescents without conditions. We also found hypothesized differences in social media use by condition type: adolescents with internalizing conditions reported spending more time on social media, engaging in more social comparison and experiencing greater impact of feedback on mood, alongside lower happiness about the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure. In contrast, those with externalizing conditions only reported higher time spent. These findings emphasize the need to consider diverse adolescent mental health profiles in policy and clinical practice.

Adolescents around the world have experienced a decline in their mental health over the past decade1. Recent UK data suggests that one in six 7–16-year olds and one in four 17–19-year olds have a probable mental health condition, a clear rise from the one in nine and one in ten recorded in 2017, respectively2. As 48% of those with a mental health condition first experience relevant symptoms before the age of 18 years3, this increased mental health burden will negatively impact society and the economy, as well as adolescent and adult life4. Many have raised concerns that this trend has been caused, at least in part, by increased adolescent social media use, which has revolutionized how adolescents live, learn and interact: 93% of 12–17-year olds now report having a social media profile5.

To address these concerns, academic investigation of social media use and adolescent mental health has increased substantially in recent years6. Research teams have recruited adolescent populations in schools, universities or as part of broader community-based samples to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal links between increased smartphone or social media use and scores on questionnaires of depression7,8, anxiety9, disordered eating10 and other mental health symptoms10,11,12. These studies have primarily found small positive associations. Some researchers have used these to argue that there exists a causal link between social media use and mental health declines (that is, “screen time, perhaps especially social media, may have larger effects on adolescent girls' mental health than on boys' and that is indeed what we found, with social media significantly correlated with depressive symptoms […]”13 p. 13). Such arguments, in turn, have been used to call for restrictive policy regulations to limit smartphone and social media use in adolescent age groups14.

However, many researchers have also questioned the strength of the current evidence base and highlighted that existing studies do not support the idea that there is a causal relationship linking social media use to mental health. Indeed, the literature provides many conflicting results15. Researchers have not only debated about a lack of longitudinal or causal evidence16, but have also disagreed about what effect sizes matter17,18,19 and how to deal with the substantial individual differences present20,21, which have been linked to factors such as age22, gender23,24 and ethnicity25.

Across these topics of debate, however, researchers have largely overlooked how the kind of instruments used to measure mental health, as well as the populations being studied, limits their ability to draw meaningful inferences about the relationship of social media with adolescent mental health in the first place. So far, most studies have examined school- or community-based adolescent samples15,16,26, relating scores on mental health questionnaires (for example, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale9,27) to time spent on social media. The rationale for doing so is that questionnaires capturing continuous clinical symptoms are informative when reasoning about social media use in relation to the whole spectrum of mental health, across types of severity and clinical presentation. However, this approach is not a suitable surrogate for studying links between social media and mental health in adolescents with versus without mental health conditions, for two main reasons. First, it reduces the complexity of clinical presentations to the tail end of variation in selected mental health symptoms among mostly healthy individuals. Second, it ignores the potentially important differences between those who endorse symptoms on a questionnaire and those who reach diagnostic criteria in standard clinical classifications. For example, an adolescent can score very highly on a questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms, but not meet the criteria for a diagnosis if the queried symptoms have only been present for a short time or if they are better explained by a different condition or situation.

To address this issue, select studies have moved beyond such an approach, dichotomizing symptom severity by applying cut-off scores to mental health questionnaires to reflect the presence or absence of a mental health diagnosis23. However, dichotomization does not solve many of the problems highlighted above and is known to have low sensitivity when predicting clinical diagnoses. Indeed, those with a mental health condition can score below the threshold on some scales28,29. In other words, although researchers would like to demonstrate the presence or absence of specific links between mental health conditions and social media use, the measures of psychopathology they employ might not be appropriate for these goals.

Importantly, the assumption that patterns of social media use found in non-clinical or community samples will generalize to those with mental health conditions has not yet been systematically tested. To our knowledge, only a few studies—most qualitative—have documented different social media use experiences in clinical adolescent populations, including those fulfilling stringent diagnostic criteria for a clinical condition, attending mental health services or being hospitalized for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts30,31,32,33. Adolescents in these studies reported both positive and negative social media experiences, such as enhanced social connection and trouble downregulating their use. Broadly speaking, these experiences aligned with established risk and protective factors previously linked to mental health in offline spaces and suggest there is no clear-cut positive or negative association between mental health and social media use. The studies also raise the idea that vulnerable youth might experience heightened emotional responses to social media use. However, this has not been directly assessed due to the lack of non-clinical comparison groups. Such comparisons are therefore necessary to identify differences in social media use between adolescents with and without mental health conditions.

Owing to the lack of research among young people with mental health conditions26, the important question of whether social media use varies across different types of conditions also remains unaddressed. For example, an adolescent with an internalizing condition (for example, generalized anxiety disorder or depressive disorder) might use and feel impacted by social media differently than an adolescent with an externalizing condition (for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or conduct disorder). This is because, despite both groups presenting mental health symptoms at clinical levels, their experiences of psychopathology can be qualitatively different. Internalizing conditions involve negative emotionality towards the self, expressed through ruminative thought patterns, worries and social withdrawal34. On the contrary, externalizing conditions involve negative emotionality towards others, expressed through impulsivity, risk taking and disinhibition35. Studies that assess mental health with select questionnaires cannot comprehensively account for and investigate such clinical diversity. This is a substantial shortcoming, given the need for research to understand how social media use relates to the growing number of adolescents experiencing mental health symptoms at clinical levels.

This Registered Report provides critical data and evidence-based insights into how social media and mental health are related across adolescent populations who meet and do not meet diagnostic criteria for a wide range of mental health conditions. Given the cross-sectional nature of the data and planned analyses, the study results do not provide causal evidence. Hence, all reported coefficients indicate associations, with the possibility of bidirectional relationships and third variables affecting social media use, mental health or the relationship between the two. We analysed the nationally representative Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) study36, a cross-sectional survey carried out by National Health Service (NHS) Digital in 2017 that collected data from over 3,000 adolescents (11–19 years old) in England. In place of completing self-report measures of mental health, the participants in this study underwent multi-informant standardized diagnostic assessments evaluated by professional clinical raters for different mental health conditions (Table 1). We note that, in the stage 1 report, the terms ‘clinical and non-clinical population' were used, but in stage 2 this was changed to ‘adolescents with and without mental health conditions' to clarify that participants in this study were not recruited or diagnosed by a clinic, but instead underwent the mental health assessment as part of the MHCYP study.

Further, to gain a comprehensive understanding of how social media use differs across adolescents with and without a mental health condition, we examined both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of social media use. Measuring only time spent provides a crude and simplistic estimate of social media use, conflating distinct analytical levels and missing a rich range of psychological factors such as appraisal and motivations that might vary as a function of mental health37. Researchers have therefore called for quantitative time-based measures of social media use to be complemented by more qualitative engagement-based measures capturing adolescents' social media activities and their appraisal of them16,38,39,40,41,42. Such practice is, however, still relatively rare. In this Registered Report, we included both types of measures, namely, time spent on social media and dimensions of social media engagement that could incur mental health risks (that is, online social comparison, monitoring and impact of online feedback and lack of control over time spent online) or benefits (that is, online friendship, as well as opportunities for honest self-disclosure and authentic self-presentation). By complementing quantitative and qualitative dimensions of social media use, this work provides a more solid foundation for mechanistic research aimed at informing future targeted interventions, clinical practice and policy actions benefitting adolescent mental health.

We used existing literature on adolescents' mental health in relation to both online and offline contexts (Table 2) to guide our hypotheses and analyses of the data along three lines of enquiry. Specifically, we evaluated whether social media use differs in adolescents with versus without a mental health condition (Question 1), with an internalizing or externalizing condition versus without a condition (Question 2) and with an internalizing versus externalizing condition (Question 3).

First, we expected adolescents with any mental health condition to report engaging with social media differently than those without a condition. For instance, gathering information about peers is particularly important during adolescence when young people develop a sense of personal and social identity43. However, high levels of upward social comparison (that is, comparisons with those believed to be of higher status than the self) have been associated with poorer mental health44,45,46,47,48. Previous work suggests that most social comparisons made on social media sites are upward rather than downward49, possibly because individuals tend to portray themselves in an ideal manner online50,51. Social media could further amplify these processes as platforms offer continuous and more concrete opportunities for comparing oneself with others, such as browsing profiles without initiating social interaction52. Indeed, engagement in self-denigrating online social comparisons was a common theme raised by adolescent psychiatric inpatients during qualitative interviews31. We therefore expected adolescents with a mental health condition to engage in more online social comparison than those without a condition (hypothesis H1.1b). Similarly (see Table 2 for a detailed overview of the literature in support of each hypothesis), we expected them to spend more time on social media8,15 (H1.1a), report more lack of control over time spent online31,53 (H1.1c), while also monitoring54,55 (H1.1 d) and feeling more impacted by online feedback56,57 (H1.1e).

In contrast, we expected adolescents with any condition to engage less with social media in ways that might be protective for their mental health. For instance, we hypothesized that adolescents with a mental health condition are less happy with the number of friends they have online than adolescents without a condition (H1.2f). This is because social connections protect against long-term adverse physical and emotional outcomes, particularly during adolescence48, and young people with mental health conditions often report difficulties with peers, having few friends and wanting to be alone58,59,60. Similarly, we expected adolescents with a mental health condition to engage in less honest online self-disclosure61,62 (H1.2g) and authentic online self-presentation63,64 (H1.2h) compared with adolescents without a condition (Table 2).

Second, we predicted social media use to vary between adolescents with different symptomatology, focusing specifically on how the social media use of adolescents with an internalizing or externalizing condition (Table 1) differed from those without a condition.

We knowfrom the mental health literature that internalizing conditions involve negative self-views, rumination, worries and social withdrawal34,65. Notably, these symptoms could be relevant to how young people present themselves and engage with others on social media31,32,66. For instance, adolescents with internalizing conditions are more likely to notice discrepancies between their ideal and actual selves67 and may compensate for these discrepancies via impression management offline. We expect this process to also occur online, given the multiple affordances social media platforms offer to curate one's image (for example, deleting old posts and editing new posts). Hence, we hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would be less likely to engage in authentic self-presentation on social media than adolescents without a mental health condition68,69,70 (H2.2h). Further (Table 2), we hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would spend more time on social media8,15,71 (H2.1a), engage in more online social comparison30 (H2.1b) and online feedback monitoring54 (H2.1d), feel more impacted by online feedback56 (H2.1e), be less happy about online friends (H2.2f) and engage in less honest self-disclosure62 (H2.2g) than those without a condition. In contrast, we did not expect a difference in whether they perceive a lack of control over the time they spend online (H2.0c)53.

Compared with internalizing conditions, externalizing conditions involve impulsivity, low self-monitoring and risk taking34,65. These symptoms could be reflected in how social media is used by these groups. Hence, we hypothesized that adolescents with externalizing conditions would be more likely than adolescents without a condition to spend more time on social media72 (H2.3a) and perceive they lack control over the time they spend online53 (H2.3c). Further, we expected them to also be more dissatisfied with their number of online friends73 (H2.4f). In contrast, we did not expect differences in the other dimensions of social media use (H2.0b,d,e,g,h; Table 2), since they primarily relate to symptoms of internalizing rather than externalizing conditions.

Our third question examined whether adolescents with internalizing conditions use social media differently than those with externalizing conditions. Specifically, we expected adolescents with internalizing conditions to report engaging in more online social comparison30 (H3.1b) and online feedback monitoring55 (H3.1d), feeling more impacted by online feedback56 (H3.1e), engaging in less honest self-disclosure61 (H3.2g) and less authentic self-presentation on social media69 (H3.2h) than those with externalizing conditions. In contrast, we expected adolescents with externalizing conditions to report having less control over the time they spend online53,73 compared to adolescents with internalizing conditions (H3.2c). Further, since adolescents with internalizing conditions tend to be unhappy with their social status74 and adolescents with externalizing conditions tend to have trouble making and keeping friends in both online and offline contexts73,75, we expect both groups to be similarly dissatisfied with their number of online friends (H3.0f). We also hypothesized that both groups would not differ in the amount of time they spend on social media (H3.0a), given that both adolescents with internalizing and externalizing symptoms have been reported to spend more time on social media than adolescents without these symptoms33,76.

Altogether, this study comprehensively maps and compares different dimensions of social media use in adolescents with and without mental health conditions. Hence, it will lay the foundation for future mechanistic and translational research studying which specific social media dimensions relate to mental health in different adolescent groups. This will be a crucial first step to inform translational research and clinical practice, as well as the design of targeted interventions and policies to improve children's and adolescents' mental health.

Our final sample included 3,340 young people (Table 3) aged 11–19 (mean 14.77, s.d. 2.48) years. The sample was 50% male and 50% female, 16% of participants had at least one mental health condition (N = 519), 8% had an internalizing condition (N = 282) and 3% had an externalizing condition (N = 104). Descriptive statistics split by social media items, sex and diagnostic groups are reported in Supplementary Tables 5–8 and Supplementary Figs. 3–5). Further, an overview of our hypotheses and results is provided in Supplementary Table 9.

We first compared adolescents with versus without mental health conditions, irrespective of condition type (Fig. 1, H1). In line with our hypothesis, we found that adolescents with any mental health condition reported spending more time on social media than adolescents without a condition (H1.1a; g = 0.46 (90% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.54); NHST (null hypothesis significance testing): 𝛽 = 0.87, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = 10.48, P = 2.745 × 10−25; EQV (equivalence testing): t(633.8) = 1.21, P = 0.916). Specifically, differences were positive, statistically significant and non-equivalent. That is, we could not reject differences as large or larger than our preregistered equivalence bounds (smallest effect size of interest (SESOI), g = 0.4), indicating potentially meaningful differences between adolescents with and without a condition. On the contrary, the results did not support our hypothesis for online social comparison (H1.1b; g = 0.30 (90% CI 0.22 to 0.39); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.42, s.e.m. of 0.07, t = 6.52, P = 7.973 × 10−11; EQV: t(641.08) = −1.89, P = 0.026), lack of control over time spent online (H1.1c; g = 0.27 (90% CI 0.19 to 0.35); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.39, s.e.m. of 0.07, t = 5.52, P = 3.614 × 10−8; EQV: t (674.42) = −2.68, P = 0.002) and impact of online feedback on mood (H1.1e; g = 0.29 (90% CI 0.21 to 0.38); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.38, s.e.m. of 0.06, t = 6.36, P = 2.269 × 10−10; EQV: t(608.98) = −2.06, P = 0.016). For these dimensions of social media engagement, effect sizes were positive, statistically significant but equivalent (that is, they fell within the preregistered SESOIs). This indicates a difference that is too small to be theoretically meaningful between adolescents with and without a mental health condition. Last, for monitoring of online feedback, we found differences that were not statistically significant and also equivalent, indicating no statistically nor theoretically meaningful differences between adolescents with versus without a condition (H1.1d; g = 0.08 (90% CI −0.01 to 0.15) NHST: 𝛽 = 0.11, s.e.m. of 0.07, t = 1.55, P = 0.121; EQV: t (653.24) = −6.47, P = 0.000).

Top: hypothesis 1 (H1, any mental health condition versus no condition). Middle: hypothesis 2 (H2, internalizing/externalizing versus no condition). Bottom: hypothesis 3 (H3, internalizing versus externalizing condition). Data are presented as mean differences based on Hedges's g effect size (g) and its corresponding 90% CI. The shaded area indicates the SESOI (g = 0.4, corresponding to d = 0.4). If the 90% CI lies completely within the SESOI, we concluded equivalence, and therefore no meaningful differences. Bolded effect sizes reflect comparisons that supported our hypothesis, while faded effect sizes reflect comparisons that did not support our hypotheses. The starting sample size includes social media users (N = 519 for adolescents with any mental health condition, N = 282 for internalizing conditions, N = 104 for externalizing conditions and N = 2,821 for no mental health condition). However, the exact sample sizes for each comparison are reported in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 and differ for each dimension of social media use, given that we planned to analyse those separately.

Source data.

We further hypothesized that adolescents with any mental health condition would score lower than adolescents without a condition on dimensions of social media use that could incur mental health benefits, namely, happiness about the number of online friendships (H1.2f), honest self-disclosure (H1.2g) and authentic self-presentation (H1.2h). In line with our hypothesis, we found lower happiness about the number of online friendships (H1.2f; g = −0.37 (90% CI −0.45 to −0.29); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.33, s.e.m. of 0.04, t = −8.23, P = 2.660 × 10−16; EQV: t(590.4) = 0.56, P = 0.277), for which the effect size was negative, statistically significant and non-equivalent (that is, large enough to be potentially meaningful). In contrast, we did not find differences in honest self-disclosure (H1.2g; g = −0.30 (90% CI −0.38 to −0.22); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.39, s.e.m. of 0.06, t = −6.37, P = 2.213 × 10−10; EQV: t(629.39) = 1.931, P = 0.028) and authentic self-presentation (H1.2h; g = −0.19 (90% CI −0.28 to −0.11); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.24, s.e.m. of 0.06, t = −3.98, P = 7.085 × 10−5; EQV: t(624.53) = 4.04, P = 0.000). In these cases, effect sizes were negative and statistically significant but equivalent, suggesting that differences between those with and without a mental health condition were too small to be theoretically meaningful.

Our second question concerned the extent to which adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions differed in their social media use from adolescents without a condition (Fig. 1, H2).

Our hypotheses were grounded in the mental health literature, which suggests that anxiety and depressive disorders are characterized by negative self-views, rumination, worries and social withdrawal. We expected these symptoms to be mirrored in adolescents' online experiences. The results supported our hypotheses for time spent on social media (H2.1a; g = 0.62 (90% CI 0.51 to 0.73); NHST: 𝛽 = 1.12, s.e.m. of 0.11, t = 10.32, P = 1.609 × 10−25; EQV: t(317.39) = 3.21, P = 0.999), online social comparison (H2.1b; g = 0.54 (90% CI 0.43 to 0.65); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.76, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = 9.12, P = 1.304 × 10−19; EQV: t(318.57) = 2.11, P = 0.994) and the impact of online feedback (H2.1e; g = 0.38 (90% CI 0.27 to 0.49); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.51, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = 6.61, P = 4.494 × 10−11; EQV: t(306.67) = −0.27, P = 0.385), where we found positive, statistically significant, and non-equivalent effect sizes, suggesting potentially meaningful differences between adolescents with internalizing versus no condition. In contrast, the results did not support our hypothesis for monitoring of online feedback, where differences were not statistically significant and were also too small to be considered meaningful (H2.1d; g = 0.13 (90% CI 0.03 to 0.25); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.20, s.e.m. of 0.09, t = 2.13, P = 0.033; EQV: t(324.47) = −4.13, P = 0.000).

For those with internalizing conditions, we also hypothesized decreased levels of happiness about the number of online friendships (H2.2f), honest self-disclosure (H2.2g) and authentic self-presentation (H2.2h). Our hypotheses were confirmed for happiness about the number of online friendships (H2.2f; g = −0.45 (90% CI −0.55 to −0.35); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.40, s.e.m. of 0.05, t = −7.91, P = 3.49 × 10−15; EQV: t(304.45) = −0.69, P = 0.776) and honest self-disclosure (H2.2g; g = −0.31 (90% CI −0.42 to −0.20); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.41, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = −5.16, P = 2.670 × 10−7; EQV: t(314.2) = 1.32, P = 0.088), where we found negative, statistically significant and potentially meaningful differences. In other words, those with internalizing conditions scored lower than adolescents with no condition. In contrast, we did not find support for meaningful differences in authentic self-presentation (H2.2h; g = −0.19 (90% CI −0.30 to −0.08); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.25, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = −3.16, P = 0.002; EQV: t(310.64) = 3.08, P = 0.500 × 10−4), where the effect size was statistically significant but equivalent, and therefore too small to be considered meaningful. Last, we expected no differences in lack of control over time spent online for adolescents with internalizing versus no condition (H2.0c). The results did not support our hypothesis, showing positive, statistically significant and potentially meaningful differences (g = 0.43 (90% CI 0.33 to 0.55); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.60, s.e.m. of 0.09, t = 6.74, P = 1.91 × 10−11; EQV: t(336.39) = 0.489, P = 0.689).

Externalizing conditions are characterized by impulsivity, low self-monitoring, and risk taking. We expected such symptoms to be reflected in how social media is used by this group. The results supported our hypotheses for time spent on social media (H2.3a; g = 0.31 (90% CI 0.13 to 0.48); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.58, s.e.m. of 0.17, t = 3.40, P = 0.001; EQV: t(105.73) = −0.83, P = 0.232), where we found positive differences that were statistically significant and large enough to be theoretically meaningful. The results did not support our hypotheses for the lack of control over time spent online (H2.3c; g = 0.19 (90% CI 0.01 to 0.37); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.27, s.e.m. of 0.15, t = 1.83, P = 0.068; EQV: t(100.39) = −2.01, P = 0.017) and happiness about the number of online friendships (H2.4f; g = −0.16 (90% CI −0.32 to 0.02); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.12, s.e.m. of 0.09, t = −1.39, P = 0.165; EQV: t(96.65) = 2.34, P = 0.023), where differences were not statistically significant and were too small to be meaningful.

Last, we expected no differences between adolescents with externalizing and no conditions in online social comparison (H2.0b), monitoring of online feedback (H2.0d), feeling impacted by online feedback (H2.0e), honest online self-disclosure (H2.0g) and authentic self-presentation (H2.0h). The results supported our hypotheses for online social comparison (H2.0b; g = −0.10 (90% CI −0.28 to 0.07); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.13, s.e.m. of 0.14, t = −0.97, P = 0.331; EQV: t(104.81) = 2.94, P = 0.000), monitoring of feedback (H2.0d; g = 0.09 (90% CI −0.08 to 0.27), NHST: 𝛽 = 0.13, s.e.m. of 0.16, t = 0.82, P = 0.410; EQV: t(97.07) = −2.92, P = 0.004), honest self-disclosure (H2.0g; g = −0.21 (90% CI −0.38 to −0.03), NHST: 𝛽 = −0.26, s.e.m. of 0.13, t = −2.01, P = 0.045; EQV: t(98.82) = 1.79, P = 0.040), and authentic self-presentation (H2.0h; g = −0.09 (90% CI −0.25 to 0.08), NHST: 𝛽 = −0.11, s.e.m. of 0.13, t = −0.85, P = 0.395; EQV: t(98.29) = 2.96, P = 0.003), as these effect sizes were not significantly significant and were also too small to be considered meaningful. In contrast, the results did not support our hypothesis for the impact of feedback on mood (H2.0e; g = 0.27 (90% CI 0.10 to 0.45), NHST: 𝛽 = 0.34, s.e.m. of 0.13, t = 2.71, P = 0.007; EQV: t(96.78) = −1.14, P = 0.120), where we found positive, significant and potentially meaningful differences.

Our third question focused only on adolescents with a mental health condition and specifically examined whether those with an internalizing condition use social media differently than those with an externalizing condition (Fig. 1, H3).

The results supported our hypotheses for online social comparison (H3.1b; g = 0.64 (90% CI 0.45 to 0.85); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.89, s.e.m. of 0.16, t = 5.75, P = 0.000, EQV: t(203.72) = 2.187, P = 0.993), where we found positive differences that were statistically significant and large enough to be theoretically meaningful in adolescents with internalizing compared with externalizing conditions. In contrast, the results did not support our hypotheses for the monitoring of online feedback (H3.1d; g = 0.05 (90% CI −0.15 to 0.24); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.07, s.e.m. of 0.18, t = 0.40, P = 0.689, EQV: t(157.17) = −2.924, P = 0.002) and impact of online feedback on mood (H3.1e; g = 0.12 (90% CI −0.07 to 0.32); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.16, s.e.m. of 0.14, t = 1.12, P = 0.261, EQV: t(171.21) = −2.421, P = 0.008), where differences were not statistically significant and were too small to be meaningful.

We further hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would score lower than adolescents with externalizing conditions in lack of control over time spent online (H3.2c), honest self-disclosure (H3.2g) and authentic self-presentation (H3.2h). However, we found neither significant nor meaningful differences across these dimensions (H3.2g; g = −0.11 (90% CI −0.30 to 0.09); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.15, s.e.m. of 0.15, t = −0.99, P = 0.323, EQV: t(170.73) = 2.47, P = 0.004; H3.2h; g = −0.11 (90% CI −0.29 to 0.08); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.14, s.e.m. of 0.15, t = −0.93, P = 0.351, EQV: t(185.78) = 2.51, P = 0.005). Further, the results were inconclusive for lack of control over time spent online (H3.2c; g = 0.24 (90% CI 0.04 to 0.43); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.33, s.e.m. of 0.17, t = 1.98, P = 0.048, EQV: t(156.91) = −1.37, P = 0.080), where we did not find statistically significant differences nor we could reject meaningfully large effect sizes.

Last, we hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would not differ from adolescents with externalizing conditions in time spent on social media (H3.0a) and happiness in the number of online friendships (H3.0f). The results did not confirm our hypotheses. For time spent on social media, we found positive differences (internalizing higher than externalizing) that were statistically significant and potentially meaningful (H3.0a; g = 0.27 (90% CI 0.07 to 0.47); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.54, s.e.m. of 0191, t = 2.76, P = 0.006, EQV: t(171.33) = −1.15, P = 0.1125). Further, we found that adolescents with internalizing conditions reported lower happiness about the number of online friends than adolescents with externalizing conditions. In this case, differences were negative, statistically significant and potentially meaningful (H3.0f; g = −0.32 (90% CI −0.51 to −0.14); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.29, s.e.m. of 0.10, t = −2.93, P = 0.003, EQV: t(206.5) = 0.707, P = 0.223).

To extend our findings, we conducted four sets of sensitivity analyses. First, we included adolescents with between-group comorbidities in question 2, such as any internalizing condition with a comorbid externalizing condition, or vice versa, and compared them with those without a condition (Supplementary Tables 15 and 16). Second, we examined the association between mental health severity, conceptualized as the number of conditions (irrespective of diagnostic type), and social media use (Supplementary Table 17). Third, we focused on adolescents with specific conditions and compared their social media use with that of adolescents without a condition. In this case, we only tested conditions for which we were sufficiently powered, namely, major depressive disorder (N ≈ 86; Supplementary Table 18), generalized anxiety disorder (N ≈ 75; Supplementary Table 19) and social anxiety disorder (N ≈ 70; Supplementary Table 20). Last, we tested our hypotheses for time spent on social media separately for school days and weekends, rather than using a composite score (Supplementary Table 21).

Overall, the results were largely in line with our primary findings with a few exceptions. Namely, we found that adolescents with externalizing and between-group comorbidity (Supplementary Table 16) reported less honest self-disclosure than those without a condition. For the sensitivity analysis on mental health severity, we found that the number of conditions, irrespective of type, was associated with time spent on social media, social comparison, monitoring of feedback and impact of feedback on mood (Supplementary Table 17). Last, we did not find differences for time spent on weekdays versus weekends/holidays (Supplementary Table 21). We note that these sensitivity analyses were exploratory and conducted on relatively small sample sizes, which limits the robustness of these findings.

In this Registered Report, we analysed differences in social media use between adolescents with and without mental health conditions in a UK sample of over 3,000 participants. Overall, we found significant and meaningful differences across both quantitative (time spent) and qualitative (for example, online social comparison and happiness about the number of online friends) dimensions of social media use.

Interestingly, the largest difference in social media use between those with and without mental health conditions was in the time spent on social media, with the former reporting higher usage. It is important to note that this measure was self-reported, which is known to have only a moderate correlation with objective measures such as sensing data77. This raises the question of whether those with mental health conditions perceive that they spend more time on social media or whether they actually do so. Further, we observed that adolescents with a mental health condition reported lower satisfaction with the number of their online friends. In offline contexts, social connections serve as a protective factor against long-term adverse physical and emotional outcomes, especially during adolescence. Our findings therefore suggest that the difficulties with peer relationships experienced by youth clinical groups offline may also be reflected in their online interactions. For the other dimensions of social media use examined, our results followed the hypothesized direction and were statistically significant (with the exception of monitoring of online feedback). However, the differences were not large enough to be considered meaningful. This might be explained by the relatively high threshold set as our SESOI, which was a moderate effect size grounded in literature on sleep and physical exercise, both established markers of psychopathology.

We next compared social media use between adolescents with a specific mental health condition (internalizing or externalizing) versus no condition. In this case, the results largely supported our hypotheses, whereby adolescents with internalizing conditions demonstrated higher time spent on social media, increased social comparison, greater impact of social media feedback on mood, lower satisfaction with the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure compared to those without a mental health condition. Unexpectedly, we also found that adolescents with internalizing conditions reported a higher lack of control over their time spent online, an engagement dimension that we had instead hypothesized would be more pronounced in those with externalizing conditions. For adolescents with externalizing conditions, the only meaningful difference when compared with those with no condition was increased time spent online, with no notable differences across other dimensions of social media use. These results might be explained by the fact that the dimensions of social media engagement used in this study were largely framed around internal experiences (that is, they enquired about one's emotions and thoughts) that could be more effective indicators of internalizing rather than externalizing conditions.

Finally, by limiting our focus to only adolescents with mental health conditions, we compared those with internalizing to those with externalizing conditions. We found that adolescents with internalizing conditions engaged in higher online social comparison. This finding aligns with existing research indicating that adolescents with depressive and anxious symptomatology tend to unfavourably compare themselves with others on social media. Given that social media platforms provide continuous and concrete opportunities for social comparison—such as browsing others' profiles without initiating social interaction52—social comparison may represent a critical mechanism associated with internalizing symptoms on social media. Further, adolescents with internalizing conditions were less happy about the number of their online friends. This may be because their tendency towards negative self-evaluation and social comparison leads them to make negative evaluations of their social status78. In contrast, adolescents with externalizing conditions might be less focused on social comparison and more on immediate social interactions, resulting in greater satisfaction with their online friendships.

Altogether, this study has three key strengths. First, the complex survey design, which utilized random probability sampling, produced a nationally representative UK sample. Second, all participants in the sample underwent a standardized multi-informant assessment by professional clinical raters. This method provided comprehensive information about participants' mental health without only relying on self-reported questionnaires, self-diagnoses or mental health service use, measures that only capture a subset of individuals with mental health conditions79,80. Last, we examined both qualitative and quantitative aspects of social media use, offering insights beyond time spent into relevant engagement dimensions such as online social comparison and the impact of feedback on mood.

We also acknowledge some limitations of our study. First, regarding study design, we analysed raw associations from cross-sectional data. Therefore, no causal or directional inference can be drawn from these findings, including whether the onset of mental health conditions affects the examined dimensions of social media use or vice versa. Further, given the relatively small sample size in our externalizing group (N = 104) and the relatively large number of individuals with between-group comorbidities (N = 57), our findings concerning externalizing conditions should be interpreted with caution. Specifically, our question 2 and 3 results exclude adolescents with a relatively common clinical profile of comorbid externalizing and anxiety disorders. Additional work on how young people with this clinical profile use and experience social media is needed.

Further, although the sample was nationally representative, we cannot determine the extent to which our findings apply outside the UK. Given the socio-cultural factors influencing social media use and mental health conditions, replicating these results in other regions across both the Global North and Global South is crucial if generalizations are to be made25. We also acknowledge that the data were collected in 2017. While the examined dimensions of social media use remain relevant, the rapid evolution of platforms and user behaviours presents a potential limitation when applying our findings to current trends. Last, we acknowledge limitations regarding our measures. Specifically, we relied on self-reported social media data. Self-reports capture participants' perceptions, such as online social comparison, that cannot be objectively or reliably measured otherwise. However, they often fail to accurately reflect actual patterns in usage, particularly when estimating time spent on social media77.

Future research should aim to replicate and expand on these findings in three key areas. First, studies using experimental and longitudinal designs are essential to clarify the temporal and causal dynamics linking various social media patterns to mental health conditions. Doing so would allow us to disentangle the within-person variation and directional relationship between social media use and mental health symptom presentation, onset or recovery. Second, regarding social media use, future studies could investigate other self-reported and clinically relevant aspects of engagement, such as time displacement from offline activities81, the similarity between perceived self on social media and offline82, as well as goal-directed social media use. Additionally, studies could assess differences in objective social media use, such as time spent on various apps, posting behaviours, active messaging and content exposure. Third, research involving adolescents with intellectual and learning disabilities is necessary to identify differences in this specific clinical group, which was not included in this study.

The results have implications for clinical practice. Specifically, we find key aspects of social media engagement that could inform the creation of guidelines for patient consultations and early intervention strategies. For example, this could include psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioural reappraisal techniques specifically aimed at online social comparison or the impact of social media feedback (for example, ‘likes') on mood for adolescents with internalizing conditions.

Over the past years, there has been increasing concern that social media is negatively impacting young people's mental health, but very little research has compared social media use in those with and without mental health conditions26. In one of the first studies of its kind, we find that young people with mental health conditions report engaging with social media in different ways from those without a condition. This highlights aspects of social media use that might present an increased risk to this already vulnerable group and provides a window for future research to ensure that the digital world is safe for all children regardless of mental health status.

The MHCYP 2017 survey was reviewed and approved by the West London and GTAC Research Ethics Committee (reference: 16/LO/0155) and the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group (reference: 16/CAG/0016) in 2016. Both parents and children provided consent to take part in data collection and were compensated with a £10 voucher for their time. Parents of children under 16 years were interviewed first and permission was sought to interview their child afterwards; the child then provided assent. Conversely, 17–19-year olds were directly asked for their consent, with permission subsequently sought for their parents to be interviewed. Access to the data was granted to the research team by NHS Digital (DARS-NIC-424336-T7K7T-v0.6 r).

The MHCYP study is one of a series of national surveys on the mental health of children and young people in England administered in 1999, 2004, 2017, 2021 and 2022. In this Registered Report, we analysed the 2017 wave collected between January and October 2017: the most recent wave to be made available to researchers as well as the first wave to collect comprehensive data on adolescents' social media use and to include 17–19-year olds. We only analysed data from adolescents who reported being social media users aged 11–19 years, a total of 3,340 participants (50% male and 50% female) out of the full sample of 9,117. The survey was collected using a stratified probability sample of children and young people living in England who were registered with a general practitioner36. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with adolescents and their parents. At the same time, if the family agreed, questionnaires were mailed to teachers (for the available data and key demographics see MHCYP 201736,83).

The study measured time spent on social media using two questionnaire items: “When you use social media sites or apps, how much time do you spend using them on a typical school day?” (SMTimeSpentS) and “When you use social media sites or apps how much time in total do you spend using them on a typical weekend or holiday day?” (SMTimeSpentW). Participants answered both questions on a nine-point Likert scale: 1, less than 30 min; 2, more than 30 min but less than an hour; 3, 1–2 h; 4, 2−3 h; 5, 3–4 h; 6, 4–5 h; 7, 5–6 h; 8, 6–7 h; 9, more than 7 h. A single variable reflecting average social media hours was created from these two variables (SMTimeSpent; see Supplementary Table 1 for more details). To do so, we first calculated the mean time in hours for each response. For example, if a participant responded “one to two hours”, we recoded this as 1.5 h. Participants that responded “more than seven hours” were recoded to 7.5 h, while participants that responded “less than 30 min” were recorded to 15 min (that is, 0.25 h). Weekday hours were then multiplied by 5, and weekend hours were multiplied by 2, and the products were summed and divided by 7 to establish a daily mean social media use variable, measured in hours. The SMTimeSpent variable was coded as continuous84.

In the survey, the questions regarding time spent on social media for both weekdays (SMTimeSpentS) and weekends (SMTimeSpentw) were only asked of adolescents who responded that they use social media sites daily or on most days on a previous questionnaire item (SMFreqofUse; 1, daily or most days). Hence, participants that reported a lower frequency of social media use (that is, SMFreqofUse; 2, a few times a week; 3, once a week; 4, a few times a month; 5, once a month; 6, less often than once a month) were not asked these questions. To handle the resulting missing data in the SMTimeSpent variable, we coded any adolescents who responded to the SMFreqofUse question that they use social media between “a few times a week” and “once a week” to 45 min (0.75 h) and adolescents that responded “a few times a month” and “less often than once a month” to 15 min (0.25 h) on the SMTimeSpent question (for more information about our approach to missing data, see Supplementary Table 2).

We analysed seven qualitative dimensions of social media engagement measured with questionnaire items tapping into experiences associated with both risks and benefits to adolescent mental health. All measures (summarized with related literature in Table 2) were developed in consultation with a young person advisory group (see the Supplementary Methods for more information), where children and adolescents defined the dimensions of social media use most relevant to them. The measures related to mental health risks encompassed online social comparison (“I compare myself to others on social media”), lack of control over time spent online (“I spend more time on social media than I mean to”), monitoring of online feedback (“I monitor the amount of likes, comments and shares I get on social media”) and the impact of online feedback (“The amount of likes, comments and shares I get on social media has an impact on my mood”). On the contrary, the measures indicative of mental health benefits included online friendship (“I am happy with the number of friends I have on social media”), honest self-disclosure (“I can be honest with people on social media sites and apps about how I am feeling) and authentic self-presentation (“My social media profile is a true reflection of myself”).

Participants responded to these measures using a five-point Likert scale (1, disagree a lot; 2, disagree a little; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 4, agree a little; 5, agree a lot). We omitted the “Don't know” responses and coded 1–5 responses as continuous, given research suggesting that five-point continuous classifications perform as well as or occasionally better than categorical classifications84. We performed a sensitivity analysis to test whether examining social media use on weekdays versus weekends/holidays separately, rather than as a weighted average, changed the main results.

Face-to-face interviewers completed the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA)85 with parents and adolescents aged 11 years or over to establish mental health conditions. During the interview, participants were first led through the 25-item Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire86 (Supplementary Table 3). Second, the interviewer administered the DAWBA, a diagnostic tool shown to have good validity87 and reliability88. The DAWBA uses structured and semi-structured questions to assess the presence and severity of symptoms for a wide range of DSM-5 or ICD-10 mental health disorders (Table 1). Each module starts with a few screening items, which, if answered negatively (indicative of the lack of symptoms), allow the interview to proceed to the next module with no loss of accuracy87 (for example, Supplementary Table 4). There is one exception: if a participant scores highly on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the interviewer is directed to ask in-depth internalizing disorder DAWBA modules, even if participants screened negative on the initial questions.

After the initial screening items, the subsequent structured items in the DAWBA modules relate directly to diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 and ICD-10. They are close-ended questions about specific mental health symptoms (for example, “In the last 4 weeks, have there been times when you have been very sad, miserable, unhappy or tearful?”). If a participant responds positively to these structured items, they are subsequently asked open-ended questions about these problems (for example, “Please describe your mood—sadness or irritability—and your level of interest in things”). During the assessment, interviewers transcribe open-ended responses verbatim and are also able to add personal comments beneath each response.

A team of clinical raters assessed the DAWBA's structured and qualitative information from all informants to decide whether an adolescent showed evidence of a DSM-5 or ICD-10 mental health condition that would warrant clinical treatment (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). To determine the presence of a condition, clinical raters (1) checked that the answers to structured comments were understood by the participants accurately; (2) interpreted any conflicts between child, parent and teacher responses and decided which assessment to prioritize; and (3) identified clinically impairing disorders that did not perfectly fit current operationalized diagnostic criteria or “not otherwise specified diagnosis” such as “other anxiety disorder”.

Overall, we coded information on mental health conditions into two separate variables: (1) a binary variable indicating the presence of any mental health condition (diagnosis or no diagnosis) and (2) a categorical variable for the type of condition (internalizing diagnosis, externalizing diagnosis or no diagnosis). We subdivided conditions identified via the diagnostic assessment into internalizing and externalizing using existing classifications of psychiatric diagnoses34,65 (Table 1). This distinction draws from transdiagnostic research showing that different conditions (for example, anxiety, depression and eating disorders) are often comorbid, share underlying core symptoms89 and can therefore be grouped to reflect clinical presentations with more validity34. Further, when we had enough power, we ran additional exploratory analyses examining responses to all social media questions (a–g) separately for individual conditions (specifically, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder).

Comorbidity data were coded into two separate variables: (1) a binary variable indicating within-group comorbidity (any two diagnoses of either internalizing or externalizing: yes or no, for descriptive purposes only) and (2) a binary variable indicating internalizing–externalizing between-group comorbidity (any comorbid internalizing and externalizing diagnoses: yes or no). Individuals who showed between-group comorbidity were removed before the analysis of questions 2 and 3, given our goal to compare social media use between these groups. To increase the clinical utility of this work, we ran a sensitivity analysis for question 2, including people with between-group comorbidity.

We conducted all statistical analyses in R version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2021), testing the association between time- and engagement-based measures of social media use and mental health conditions using equivalence tests and linear regression models90,91. To control for the type I error rate across multiple tests, we set a corrected alpha level of 0.0125, accounting for the false discovery rate across our four tested hypotheses for any given social media item92. Our analytical approach was based on regressions rather than analysis of variance, as the former allow for more diverse predictors, unbalanced groups and inclusion of covariates in potential exploratory analyses93. Below, we describe the statistical analyses we used to test our questions and hypotheses (see the Supplementary Information for more details). Further, the analysis code is available on OSF94.

To address question 1, we tested the association between social media use and mental health conditions. Specifically, we estimated linear regression models with mental health condition as a binary predictor (two levels: diagnosis versus no diagnosis) and social media use as a continuous outcome. The no diagnosis group was set as the reference level for these analyses. Below, we report our null and directional hypotheses, first for dimensions of social media use expected to reflect mental health risks and second for dimensions expected to reflect mental health benefits in adolescents with versus without a condition.

H0(1.0): adolescents with any mental health condition will not differ from adolescents without a condition in (a) time spent on social media, (b) online social comparison, (c) lacking control over time spent online, (d) monitoring of online feedback, (e) feeling impacted by online feedback, (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online.

H1(1.1): adolescents with any mental health condition will score higher than adolescents without a condition in (a) time on social media, (b) online social comparison, (c) lacking control over time spent online, (d) monitoring of online feedback and (e) feeling impacted by online feedback.

H1(1.2): adolescents with any mental health condition will score lower than adolescents without a condition in (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online.

To examine whether social media use varies with mental health severity, we conducted sensitivity analyses to test for a linear effect of the number of diagnoses on the social media responses using linear regression models.

After assessing differences in social media use in adolescents with versus without any mental health condition, we examined whether adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions use social media differently than adolescents without a condition. Hence, we conducted linear regression models with diagnostic category as a categorical predictor (three levels: internalizing diagnosis, externalizing diagnosis and no diagnosis) and social media use as a continuous outcome. To test our hypotheses, we examined comparisons between two levels of the diagnostic category variable, with no diagnosis set as the reference level. For hypotheses 2.0i, 2.1 and 2.2, we reported regression coefficients for internalizing versus no diagnosis, while for hypotheses 2.0e, 2.3 and 2.4 we reported coefficients for externalizing versus no diagnosis. The null hypotheses marked by ‘e' or ‘i' indicate that, for the considered comparison, the null hypothesis was our primary hypothesis. Hence, for those dimensions of social media use, we expected no difference between adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions and those without a condition. We used ‘e' to indicate primary null hypotheses related to externalizing versus no condition and ‘i' to indicate our primary null hypotheses related to internalising condition.

H0(2.0): adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions will not differ from adolescents without a condition in (a) time on social media, (b) online social comparisone, (c) lacking control over time spent onlinei, (d) monitoring of online feedbacke, (e) feeling impacted by online feedbacke, (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosuree and (h) authentic self-presentation onlinee.

H1(2.1): adolescents with internalizing condition will score higher than adolescents without a condition in (a) time on social media, (b) online social comparison, (d) monitoring of online feedback and (e) feeling impacted by online feedback.

H1(2.2): adolescents with internalizing conditions will score lower than adolescents without a condition in (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online.

H1(2.3): adolescents with externalizing conditions will score higher than adolescents without a condition in (a) time spent on social media and (c) lack of control over time spent online.

H1(2.4): adolescents with externalizing conditions will score lower than adolescents without a condition in (f) happiness about the number of online friendships.

To address question 3, we examined how adolescents with internalizing conditions differed in social media engagement compared to adolescents with externalizing conditions. To this aim, we compared the internalizing and externalizing levels of the diagnostic category variable described in question 2, with internalizing as the reference level. Also, in this case, the null hypotheses marked by ‘c' indicate our primary hypotheses. Hence, for those dimensions of social media use, we expected no difference between adolescents with internalizing and externalizing conditions.

H0 (3.0): adolescents with internalizing conditions will not differ from adolescents with externalizing conditions in (a) time on social mediac, (b) online social comparison, (c) lacking control over time spent online, (d) monitoring of online feedback, (e) feeling impacted by online feedback, (f) happiness about the number of online friendshipsc, (g) online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online.

H1(3.1): adolescents with internalizing conditions will score higher than adolescents with externalizing conditions in (b) online social comparison, (d) monitoring of online feedback and (e) feeling impacted by online feedback.

H1(3.2): adolescents with internalizing conditions will score lower than adolescents with externalizing conditions in (c) lack of control over time spent online, (g) online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online.

For all regression analyses, we treated the eight dimensions of social media use, including both time- and engagement-based measures, as separate outcomes predicted by information on mental health conditions as the only regressor. While it is common in research to use statistical control to remove confounding effects from a regression coefficient, appropriate control variables should be identified only after justifying a causal structure that includes the outcome, predictors and all theorized confounders. When the selected control variables are inappropriate or remain unjustified, controlling can result in biased regression estimates95. Further, recent literature warns against controlling for demographic factors such as sex without thought and instead prompts researchers to interrogate how this variable intersects with the predictors and outcomes under investigation96. In the present work, treating sex or age as a confounding variable would mean ignoring the possibility that there are meaningful sex or age differences in the examined relationships. As our goal is to investigate the overall association between social media use and mental health, we provided a descriptive account of the age and sex of adolescents included in each tested model rather than control for these demographics. For example, in question 1, age and sex of adolescents with any condition versus without a condition are reported for descriptive purposes (Table 3).

Given that null hypothesis significance testing does not allow a comprehensive interpretation of statistically non-significant results97, each model was complemented by equivalence tests97 using the bootstrapped two one-sided tests (TOST) with the ‘boot_T_TOST' function from the TOSTER package91 to quantify support for the null hypothesis (H0(1–3)). This involves assessing whether the 90% CIs for the effect size lie inside prespecified equivalence bounds that indicate the SESOI. If the CIs lie inside the equivalence bounds, the effect size is interpreted as negligible. On the contrary, if the CIs spread outside the equivalence bounds, the effect size is considered meaningful in size. In this case, the 90% CIs are used rather than 95% because the effect size is tested against two equivalence bounds separately (that is, the upper and lower bound), reflecting (1 – 2α) × 100% (see the Supplementary Information for more details).

We established the equivalence bounds by identifying a theoretically meaningful SESOI (Cohen's d = 0.4; refer to the Supplementary Methods for a detailed explanation). After an extensive scoping exercise to identify a suitable theoretical foundation, we determined that the most relevant benchmark for our research questions are everyday behaviours linked to mental health, such as sleep and physical activity. These behaviours, much like social media use, are a regular part of daily routines but, unlike social media use, they are well-established markers of psychopathology, based on both theory98,99,100 and matched empirical evidence101,102. Consequently, if the actual effect size of social media use is comparable to that observed for behaviours such as sleep and physical activity, we can confidently conclude that social media use also represents an everyday behaviour that exhibits meaningful group-level differences between clinical and non-clinical populations. The interpretation and analysis plan are presented separately for each hypothesis in the Supplementary Information.

Overall, we inferred support for the null hypotheses (that is, no meaningful difference in social media use between groups) if the 90% CI for this association lies within the equivalence bounds. Of note, while a theoretical SESOI based on everyday behaviours and their link to mental health served as our primary effect size of interest to allow for a clear confirmatory approach, we also identified secondary SESOIs based on the effect sizes that are practically and clinically meaningful. These secondary SESOIs play an important role in supporting the interpretation of our findings (as detailed in Supplementary Methods), ensuring the applicability of our study to both academic and practical domains.

Overall, we inferred support for the alternative hypotheses if (1) the coefficient for the association of social media use and our grouping variable for mental health diagnosis was significant, (2) the association followed the hypothesised direction and (3) the CIs for the association did not fall within the equivalence bounds. The interpretation and analysis plan are presented separately for each hypothesis in the Supplementary Information. Further, we detail the planned exploratory analyses in the Supplementary Methods.

Given that not all assumptions of linear models were met (Supplementary Table 9), we complemented our preregistered parametric analyses with exploratory nonparametric tests for all hypotheses (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). We implemented the Brunner Munzel test based on the ‘brunner_munzel' function for NHST and the ‘simple_htest' function for equivalence testing from the TOSTER package in R91. This test, also known as the generalized Wilcoxon test, is a nonparametric test of stochastic equality between two samples that tests against the null hypothesis that for randomly selected values X (that is, social media score in the adolescents without a condition) and Y (that is, social media score in adolescents with a condition), the probability of X being greater than Y is equal to the probability of Y being greater than X. We documented all discrepancies (20% overall) between the parametric and nonparametric test results in Supplementary Tables 12–14.

We included all participants in the MHCYP 2017 survey aged between 11 and 19 years at the time of assessment who have answered any of the social media use questions with anything other than “don't know”. Only individuals with diagnostic information, including the absence of a diagnosis, were included in the MHCYP dataset. Since we examined each social media use question separately, we included participants who answered at least one of the seven social media engagement questions or the question about time spent on social media. No specific documentation was available regarding the response rates for the social media questions. Given that the questionnaires were administered through interviews with professionals, we expected minimal missing data for the social media responses103. Hence, using a conservative estimate, we assumed a 5% missingness for our power calculations.

To address question 1, all adolescents with and without a condition were included in our analysis. Hence, in question 1, we included (1) participants with conditions other than internalizing or externalizing disorders (for example, autism spectrum disorder, tic disorder and psychotic disorders; Table 2); (2) participants with within-group comorbidity (multiple internalizing or externalizing diagnoses; for example, comorbid depressive and social anxiety disorder); and (c) participants with between-group comorbidity (both internalizing and externalizing conditions; for example, comorbid depressive and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).

In contrast, for questions 2 and 3, we included (1) participants with internalizing or externalizing conditions only and (2) participants with within-group comorbidity (multiple internalizing or externalizing diagnoses). Hence, participants with other conditions or between-group comorbidity were excluded from the main analysis, given our goal to compare social media use in adolescents with externalizing and internalizing conditions. However, we ran sensitivity analyses to test the impact of including participants with between-group comorbidities in question 2.

On the basis of the summary demographics83, after accounting for potential missing data, we estimated the sample of complete cases to be around N = 3,854 (accounting for 5% missingness in the sample of N = 4,057, 11–19-year olds), approximately 15% of whom received at least one mental health diagnosis (N = 577). Available documentation83 suggests that approximately 19.2% of individuals with internalizing conditions have at least one comorbid externalizing condition, and approximately 28% of individuals with externalizing diagnoses have at least one comorbid internalizing diagnosis. This suggests approximately N = 370 with internalizing-only diagnoses and N = 199 with externalizing-only diagnoses.

We calculated the power by setting the SESOI (d = 0.4, refer to Supplementary Methods for a detailed explanation), the alpha level to 0.05 and the estimated sample size (estimated N = 3,854 based on existing MHCYP documentation). For the equivalence tests, power was calculated using the TOSTER package in R91,104. For the regression models, power was determined using the pwr package105 in R. The code for these calculations is available on the OSF94.

H0(1). We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N ≥ 577 individuals with a condition and N ≥ 3,277 individuals without a condition. The results indicate 100% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4.

H1(1). We calculated the power to detect a statistical effect of condition on social media responses using linear regression. The results indicate 100% power to detect the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 577 individuals with a condition and N ≥ 3,277 individuals without a condition.

H0(2). We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N ≥ 370 individuals with an internalizing only condition and N ≥ 3,277 with no condition. The results indicate 100% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4. We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N > 199 individuals with an externalizing only condition and N > 3,277 with no condition. The results indicate 100% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4.

H1(2). We calculated the power to detect a statistical effect of internalizing condition type (internalizing versus no condition) on social media responses using linear regression. The results indicate 100% power to detect the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 370 individuals with an internalizing-only condition and N ≥ 3,277 with no condition. We calculated power to detect an effect of externalizing diagnosis type (that is, externalizing versus no condition) on social media responses using linear regression. The results indicate 100% power to detect the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 199 individuals with an externalizing-only condition and N ≥ 3,277 with no condition.

H0(3). We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N ≥ 370 individuals with internalizing only and N ≥ 199 with externalizing only conditions. The results indicate 96% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4.

H1(3). We calculated the power to detect a statistical effect of internalizing-only versus externalizing-only condition type on social media responses. The results indicate 99.8% power to the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 370 individuals with internalizing only and N ≥ 199 with externalizing only conditions.

In addition to our a priori power calculations, we conducted power sensitivity analyses with the final sample size105. That is, we determined the smallest effect size that is observable with 95% power, given the corrected alpha of 0.0125 and our final sample size (Supplementary Table 22).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Security Researchers Warn a Widely Used Open Source Tool Poses a 'Persistent' Risk to the US","https://www.wired.com/story/easyjson-open-source-vk-ties/","Mon, 05 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, Russian technology companies and executives have been widely sanctioned for supporting the Kremlin. That includes Vladimir Kiriyenko, the son of one of Vladimir Putin's top aides and the CEO of VK Group, which runs VK, Russia's Facebook equivalent that has increasingly shifted towards the regime's repressive positioning.

Now cybersecurity researchers are warning that a widely used piece of open source code—which is linked to Kiriyenko's company and managed by Russian developers—may pose a “persistent” national security risk to the United States. The open source software (OSS), called easyjson, has been widely used by the US Department of Defense and “extensively” across software used in the finance, technology, and healthcare sectors, say researchers at security company Hunted Labs, which is behind the claims. The fear is that Russia could alter easyjson to steal data or otherwise be abused.

“You have this really critical package that's basically a linchpin for the cloud native ecosystem, that's maintained by a group of individuals based in Moscow belonging to an organization that has this suspicious history,” says Hayden Smith, a cofounder at Hunted Labs.

For decades, open source software has underpinned large swathes of the technology industry and the systems people rely on day to day. Open source technology allows anyone to see and modify code, helping to make improvements, detect security vulnerabilities, and apply independent scrutiny that's absent from the closed tech of corporate giants. However, the fracturing of geopolitical norms and the specter of stealthy supply chain attacks has led to an increase in questions about risk levels of ""foreign"" code.

Easyjson is a code serialization tool for the Go programming language and is often used across the wider cloud ecosystem, being present in other open source software, according to Hunted Labs. The package is hosted on GitHub by a MailRu account, which is owned by VK after the mail company rebranded itself in 2021. The VK Group itself is not sanctioned. Easyjson has been available on Github since 2016, with most of its updates coming before 2020. Kiriyenko became the CEO of VK Group in December 2021 and was sanctioned in February 2022.

Hunted Labs' analysis shared with WIRED shows the most active developers on the project in recent years have listed themselves as being based in Moscow. Smith says that Hunted Labs has not identified vulnerabilities in the easyjson code.

However, the link to the sanctioned CEO's company, plus Russia's aggressive state-backed cyberattacks, may increase potential risks, Smith says. Research from Hunted Labs details how code serialization tools could be abused by malicious hackers. “A Russian-controlled software package could be used as a ‘sleeper cell' to cause serious harm to critical US infrastructure or for espionage and weaponized influence campaigns,” it says.

“Nation states take on a strategic positioning,” says George Barnes, a former deputy director at the National Security Agency, who spent 36 years at the NSA and now acts as a senior advisor and investor in Hunted Labs. Barnes says that hackers within Russia's intelligence agencies could see easyjson as a potential opportunity for abuse in the future.

“It is totally efficient code. There's no known vulnerability about it, hence no other company has identified anything wrong with it,” Barnes says. “Yet the people who actually own it are under the guise of VK, which is tight with the Kremlin,” he says. “If I'm sitting there in the GRU or the FSB and I'm looking at the laundry list of opportunities… this is perfect. It's just lying there,” Barnes says, referencing Russia's foreign military and domestic security agencies.

VK Group did not respond to WIRED's request for comment about easyjson. The US Department of Defense did not respond to a request for comment about the inclusion of easyjson in its software setup.

“NSA does not have a comment to make on this specific software,” a spokesperson for the National Security Agency says. “The NSA Cybersecurity Collaboration Center does welcome tips from the private sector—when a tip is received, NSA triages the tip against our own insights to fully understand the threat and, if corroborated, share any relevant mitigations with the community.” A spokesperson for the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which has faced upheaval under the second Trump administration, says: “We are going to refer you back to Hunted Labs.”

GitHub, a code repository owned by Microsoft, says that while it will investigate issues and take action where its policies are broken, it is not aware of malicious code in easyjson and VK is not sanctioned itself. Other tech companies' treatment of VK varies. After Britain sanctioned the leaders of Russian banks who own stakes in VK in September 2022, for example, Apple removed its social media app from its App Store.

Dan Lorenc, the CEO of supply chain security firm Chainguard, says that with easyjson, the connections to Russia are in “plain sight” and that there is a “slightly higher” cybersecurity risk than those of other software libraries. He adds that the red flags around other open source technology may not be so obvious.

“In the overall open source space, you don't necessarily even know where people are most of the time,” Lorenc says, pointing out that many developers do not disclose their identity or locations online, and even if they do, it is not always possible to verify the details are correct. “The code is what we have to trust and the code and the systems that are used to build that code. People are important, but we're just not in a world where we can push the trust down to the individuals,” Lorenc says.

As Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has unfolded, there has been increased scrutiny on the use of open source systems and the impact of sanctions upon entities involved in the development. In October last year, a Linux kernel maintainer removed 11 Russian developers who were involved in the open souce project, broadly citing sanctions as the reason for the change. Then in January this year, the Linux Foundation issued guidance covering how international sanctions can impact open source, saying developers should be cautious of who they interact with and the nature of interactions.

The shift in perceived risk is coupled with the threat of supply chain attacks. Last year, corporate developers and the open source world were rocked as a mysterious attacker known as Jia Tan stealthily installed a backdoor in the widely used XZ Utils software, after spending two years diligently updating it without any signs of trouble. The backdoor was only discovered by chance.

“Years ago, OSS was developed by small groups of trusted developers who were known to one another,” says Nancy Mead, a fellow of the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. “In that time frame, no one expected a trusted developer of being a hacker, and the relatively slower pace provided time for review. These days, with automatic release, incorporation of updates, and the wide usage of OSS, the old assumptions are no longer valid.”

Scott Hissam, a senior member of technical staff also from the Carnegie Software Engineering Institute, says there can often be consideration about how many maintainers and the number of organizations that work on an open source project, but there is currently not a “mass movement” to consider other details about OSS projects. “However, it is coming, and there are several activities that collect details about OSS projects, which OSS consumers can use to get more insight into OSS projects and their activities,” Hissam says, pointing to two examples.

Hunted Lab's Smith says he is currently looking into the provenance of other open source projects and the risks that could come with them, including scrutinizing countries known to have carried out cyberattacks against US entities. He says he is not encouraging people to avoid open source software at all, more that risk considerations have shifted over time. “We're telling you to just make really good risk informed decisions when you're trying to use open source,” he says. “Open source software is basically good until it's not.”

Hasan Sukkar, the founder of AI startup 11x, is stepping down from his role as CEO, Sukkar announced on LinkedIn this morning. Prabhav Jain, 11x's CTO, has been named the company's new CEO. 

Sukkar will move into a “non-executive chairman” position, where he will work with Jain on “strategic direction, product vision, industry relationships, and opening new market opportunities,” Sukkar wrote on LinkedIn, helping 11x in any way he can “into the future.” 

“I've spent a lot of time thinking about what it takes to go from a fast growing startup to an enduring enterprise grade scale-up, and I have realised that I love building from the ground up. It's in my bones,” Sukkar wrote on LinkedIn. “I love 11x and believe in our mission deeply. We have a massive opportunity ahead. But sometimes, loving your company means knowing when to pass the CEO baton for the next leg of the race.” 

As TechCrunch previously reported in March, 11x at that time had been showing off customer logos on its website of companies that were not active customers, and one of those companies was threatening to sue over the matter. Other sources also told TechCrunch that the 11x product had issues and the company had struggled with customer retention. Some employees also described the startup as a grueling place to work. 

11x has raised more than $70 million from investors, including a $24 million Series A led by Sarah Tavel, a longtime investor with Benchmark, and a $50 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz. 

Joe Schmidt, the a16z partner part of the 11x deal, publicly doubled down on his support for the company and its CEO, posting on X in March that the firm loved “Hasan and the entire team at 11x,” and that the “team, product, and metrics are world class.”

Tavel also posted on X saying, “As a board member, I've seen the progress up close, and our conviction in the team and the opportunity is stronger than ever.” Last week, Tavel, who joined Benchmark as a general partner in 2017, also announced she would be taking on the position of venture partner, a more limited role at the storied firm. 

A spokesperson for 11x sent a lengthy email explaining that the change was intended to put the right person in the CEO role for a new growth phase of the company.

“Current CTO, fmr. Brex exec and 3-time founder Prabhav Jain is stepping into the CEO role, with Hasan Sukkar transitioning into a new role as Non-Executive Chairman,” the 11x spokesperson wrote. “The move reflects 11x's growth: Over the last year, the company has evolved from a single product, single use-case company to a platform that powers hundreds of the world's leading GTM teams.”

Benchmark and a16z did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

OpenAI has decided that its nonprofit division will retain control over its for-profit organization, after the company initially announced that it planned to convert to a for-profit organization.

According to the company, OpenAI's business wing, which has been under the nonprofit since 2019, will transition to a public benefit corporation (PBC). The nonprofit will control and also be a large shareholder of the PBC.

“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” OpenAI Board Chairman Bret Taylor wrote in a statement on the company's blog. “Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.”

OpenAI says that it made the decision “after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California.”

“We thank both offices and we look forward to continuing these important conversations to make sure OpenAI can continue to effectively pursue its mission,” Taylor continued. 

OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, but it converted to a “capped-profit” in 2019, and was trying to restructure once more into a for-profit. When it transitioned to a capped-profit, OpenAI retained its nonprofit wing, which currently has a controlling stake in the organization's corporate arm.

OpenAI had said that its conversion, which it argued was necessary to raise the capital needed to grow and expand its operations, would preserve its nonprofit status and infuse it with additional resources to be spent on “charitable initiatives” in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science. In exchange for its controlling stake in OpenAI's enterprise, the nonprofit would reportedly stand to reap billions of dollars.

Many disagreed with the proposal, including early OpenAI investor Elon Musk, who filed a lawsuit against OpenAI opposing the company's planned transition. Musk's complaint accuses the startup of abandoning its nonprofit mission, which aimed to ensure its AI research benefits all humanity. 

Musk had sought a preliminary injunction to halt OpenAI's conversion. A federal judge denied the request, but permitted the case to go to a jury trial in spring 2026.

A group of ex-OpenAI employees and Encode, a nonprofit that co-sponsored California's ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, filed amicus briefs several weeks ago in support of Musk's lawsuit. Separately, a cohort of organizations, including nonprofits and labor groups like the California Teamsters, petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit, claiming the company had “failed to protect its charitable assets.” 

Several Nobel laureates, law professors, and civil society organizations had also sent letters to Bonta and Delaware's attorney general, Kathy Jennings, requesting that they halt the startup's restructuring efforts.

The stakes were high for OpenAI, which needed to complete its for-profit conversion by the end of this year or next or risk relinquishing some of the capital the company has raised in recent months, according to reports. It's unclear what consequences may befall OpenAI now that it's reversed course. 

In a letter to staff on Monday also published on OpenAI's blog, CEO Sam Altman said he thinks OpenAI may eventually require “trillions of dollars” to fulfill its goal of “[making the company's] services broadly available to all of humanity.”

“[OpenAI's nonprofit] will become a big shareholder in the PBC in an amount supported by independent financial advisors,” wrote Altman. “[W]e are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock. […] We look forward to advancing the details of [our] plan in continued conversation with them, [our partner] Microsoft, and our newly appointed nonprofit commissioners.”

Google is reportedly spinning up a film and TV project called 100 Zeroes.

According to a report from Business Insider, this initiative is intended to make young audiences feel more positively about Google's products, as well as tech at large. The report also states that Google is not intending to share these projects via YouTube, which it owns, or through an in-house streaming service like Apple TV. Instead, Google wants to work with existing studios for distribution.

Google clarified in a statement that this project is not a new production studio, but rather, the company's Platforms & Devices team will be collaborating with the production company Range Media.

“We're working with Range to assist the creative community in integrating cutting-edge technologies and platforms, like XR and AI, into their filmmaking,” Google told TechCrunch in a statement.

It's official: SpaceX has its own company town on the southern tip of Texas despite concerns that it would expand the company's control of the area.

Residents living near SpaceX's launch site, the majority of whom are company employees, voted in favor of turning Starbase into its own city. It was a sweeping win for SpaceX, with 212 voting in favor of the rocket city and six against, according to the Cameron County Elections Department.

SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk has long dreamed of turning Starbase into its own city, and the billionaire celebrated on X by announcing, “Now, it is official.” Musk first pitched the idea of a Starbase city in 2021, and the company has since expanded its presence with housing and other facilities.

A report issued by Treviño's office in June stated that more than 3,400 SpaceX employees and contractors have set up shop around the base in the past few years. Earlier last year, SpaceX also announced plans to open a $15 million shopping center and restaurant.

In December 2024, more than 70 county residents submitted a petition to request an election regarding the decision to make Starbase its own municipality. Most of the residents, however, are believed to be SpaceX employees, according to the petition obtained by AP.

The city spans about 1.6 square miles (3.9 square kilometers) and is home to roughly 500 nearby residents, according to the BBC. SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012, when the company wasn't nearly as influential as it is today.

Starbase will have its own mayor, Bobby Peden, SpaceX's vice president, and two commissioners. It is designated as a Type-C city, a municipality with less than 5,000 residents.

SpaceX's rocket launches have already been disruptive to the local community, and the establishment of Starbase as a city may increase the company's municipal authority and allow it to overstep regulatory red tape designed to protect its surrounding environment.

In July 2024, the Center for Biological Diversity, American Bird Conservancy, and other conservation groups filed a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration, alleging that it rushed SpaceX's Starship permitting process without adequate environmental review or mitigation requirements. SpaceX is also facing fines of almost $150,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency for allegedly illegally dumping pollutants into a Texas waterway without a permit.

SpaceX could also have control over highway and beach closures in the area. Texas lawmakers filed a bill on March 14 that would grant SpaceX control over road and beach closures for its rocket activities. Although the bill, filed by two Republican senators, does not mention SpaceX by name, it refers to counties with spaceports and beach access “bordering on the Gulf of Mexico or its tidewater limits.”

Local officials are generally in favor of SpaceX for generating jobs in the area and drawing spectators for its rocket launches, but the company's investment in southern Texas may come at a price.

When writer Eric Pearson sat down to watch Thunderbolts, something shocked him. Which was unexpected, considering Pearson is not just credited with creating the film's story but co-writing its screenplay with Joanna Calo. And yet, as the film unfolded, Pearson was surprised to see a character he had written a full and complete arc for, no longer make it to the end of the film.



Pearson, who wrote Black Widow and helped write Fantastic Four: First Steps and Thor: Ragnarok, was surprised to see that Taskmaster, the Black Widow villain played by Olga Kurylenko, died in the film's first act. “When I sat down to watch the first cut, one thing was totally different and shocked the hell out of me, and it was that,” Pearson told Polygon. “Everything else, I was like, ‘Yeah, that's the movie that I wrote!' But that decision … it was decided after my work.”

In Pearson's version of the film, Taskmaster not only survives to the end, but she also plays an integral role in the team. For example, her inclusion gave Ava (Hannah John-Kamen), who was similarly given powers in a lab, someone to relate to. “Ava, having won her autonomy earlier in the chronology than Taskmaster, was kind of big-sistering her a little bit, in a way of ‘how to break free and be your own person,'” Pearson says.

In addition, because Taskmaster had memory issues, there was a running gag where she would forget everything that the group had been through and would keep trying to complete her task of killing John Walker (Wyatt Russell). “On the comedy side, she was struggling with her own memory-loss stuff, and there was a gag where she just kept restarting the fight and forgetting that they had made up and become friends,” Pearson said. “They would be discussing the plan of how to get out [of the vault], and she'd just go after him again, and they'd all have to pig-pile on each other, and pull her off, and be like, ‘No, we know each other! We've had this conversation before!'”

Pearson isn't sure exactly why the character was cut, but he thinks her death certainly raised the stakes and that the memory plot line may have run up against a bigger throughline that was similar. “[The memory storyline] could contribute as another reason why they chose to bring her out of the movie,” he said. “Bob was obviously having memory issues as a big part of his character.” And, of course, you couldn't cut Bob.

Were you surprised, like one of the film's writers, that Taskmaster died? Do you think her survival would've helped the movie at all? Let us know below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Trump Wants to Put Tariffs on *Checks Notes* Foreign-Made Films?","https://gizmodo.com/donald-trump-movie-tariffs-2000598044","Mon, 05 May 2025 14:15:48 GMT","

As America and the rest of the world alike still continue to navigate the uncertainty around Donald Trump's sweeping obsessions with tariffs, the U.S. President has now laid his eyes on another target–another that could provide a killing blow to the “dying” industry he is claiming to be attempting to save via the almighty tariff.

Update 12.15pm ET: The White House has now said that “No final decisions” have been made regarding President Trump's plans to enact tariffs on foreign-produced films after his post on Truth Social last night. “The Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, Deadline reports. The original story is as follows.

Late last night on his media platform of choice, Truth Social, President Trump claimed that he had directed the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade representative to institute a “100%” tariff on “any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands.”

“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump in the post. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,” before concluding, in all-caps, “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”.

As with many of Trump's tariff-based economic initiatives in his second term thus far, it was immediately unsure as to how legally viable or practically feasible it was for the U.S. government to even attempt to institute such a tariff. While the President is correct in that many studios film projects overseas, to capitalize on lucrative tax benefits designed to bolster local film industries, this is also a commonplace practice in the across the U.S., with many states including California, Georgia, Illinois, and more, offering similar incentives to promote film production. Despite these state-by-state incentives, last year it was reported by the L.A. Times that U.S.-based production in the film industry has decreased by 40% in recent years since the combined writer/actor strikes of 2023, leading to some calls for incentives at the federal level to bring productions back to America, but it would seem Trump's administration would prefer threats over incentives.

Trump's statement raises many questions that remain unanswered as of writing, with no further clarity provided by the President so far. It's unclear just how a tariff, regardless of rate, would be instituted against a film in the first place, but the timing also makes it similarly unclear if the announcement would affect films currently either in production internationally, or that have completed production and are in the stages of post-production on the path to eventual release. It's also unclear to the extent of foreign production that would lead to the imposition of the tariff–and whether or not completely internationally-produced films would face similar targeting compared to projects partially filmed in the U.S.. There's also confusion about particular omission's from President Trump's statement: he explicitly only mentions movies being subject to tariffs, without mention of the TV industry, which likewise also heavily benefits from financial incentives to be produced elsewhere.

Confusion and uncertainty has, up to this point, often been part of the point of Trump's tariff plans, strongarm tactics that rely on vagueness and threats to attempt to negotiate more lucrative trade deals with foreign nations and to pressure compliance with the President's demands. Just how international film industries would respond to the U.S.' attempts to financially punish the release of foreign films in the country remains to be seen, but the movie industry has already been in the cultural crossfire of Trump tariffs already: last month, the Chinese Film Administration said it would reduce the amount of U.S. films approved for distribution in the country as part of the ongoing imposition of high tariffs on the importing of Chinese-made goods.

Time will tell just how this latest threat of tariffs will have an impact on the U.S. economy–or if they come to pass at all. But already, a familiar reaction is emerging in the markets: Variety reports that this morning the U.S. stock exchange saw stock prices for shares in studios including Netflix, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. all down in the wake of the President's post.

Imagine taking the bus on a hot summer day. The Sun is beating down strongly, so you hurry to the bus shelter. After all, the structure's shade should lessen the heat stress. New research, however, shows that this isn't always the case. In fact, sometimes it makes an already unpleasant situation even worse.

Researchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston measured heat stress at bus stops in Houston between July 20 and August 7, 2023. As detailed in a study published earlier this year in the journal Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, they found that, on average, trees reduced heat stress by the same amount as the best bus shelter design—and that under certain conditions, one bus shelter actually made heat stress worse. Their findings have direct implications for public health, and specifically for how experts should design future bus stops.

“Heat stress is a combination of factors, not just the temperature you see on your phone's weather app or your car dash,” co-author Kevin Lanza said in a University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston statement. “Imagine it's 100 degrees out. If the sun is also strong and hitting you, that continues to heat you up.” Standing in extreme heat for long periods of time puts people at risk of heat stroke, and that risk increases with high humidity, according to the statement.

The team claims that its study is the first to investigate how shelters and trees at bus stops impact heat stress via ground measurements. The team investigated trees and four different bus shelter designs at 17 Houston bus stops, collecting data from both shaded and unshaded areas, when temperatures reached 95 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 39.4 degrees Celsius). They factored in variables such as the time of day, shelter design, and tree canopies, and recorded wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT)—a measurement of heat stress that takes into account factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind.

According to their results, the average WBGT at unshaded regions of bus stops was 92.5 degrees F. Unsurprisingly, standing in the shade generally reduced the WBGT. Tree shade decreased the WBGT by 5.9 degrees F, as did a stainless steel frame with a roof and glass walls, which was the most effective a cooling. By contrast, bus shelters with an aluminum frame, a moderately domed roof, and translucent acrylic walls lowered the WBGT by 1.6 degrees. Another similar design had a bigger and shallower dome, as well as an overhanging roof, and decreased the WBGT by 2.9 degrees F. But when the shelter itself wasn't in the shade, the WBGT beneath it was 5.2 degrees F higher than unshaded areas.

“Because the enclosed acrylic walls with metal trapped radiation inside the shelter, it was like an oven, making it hotter than outside the shelter,” Lanza said. “Study results can serve as evidence for planting trees at bus stops for maximum cooling, and if shelters are the only option, then being strategic in design.”

Simply put, this latest study joins a host of evidence suggesting that trees in cities are almost always a good idea.

 May 05, 2025  

For circulatory support in cardiogenic shock, the best choice between Impella and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been controversial. Now, new data is complicating the debate.

Presenting at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Washington, DC, Godbless Ajenaghughrure, MD, an internist and resident at Trihealth Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, reported that Impella use is associated with higher 30-day mortality compared to IABP.

The new propensity-matched analysis shows that Impella use at 1 month is linked to significantly higher all-cause mortality (42.3%) compared with IABP (29.6%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.594; 95% CI, 1.396-1.820; P < .001). 

Patients treated with Impella also had higher rates of cardiac arrest (33.9% vs 26.8%; HR, 1.310; 95% CI, 1.135-1.511; P < .001) and sepsis (14.6% vs 12.3%; HR, 1.410; 95% CI, 1.070-1.858; P = .024). 

There were no significant differences in rates of acute kidney injury (14.6% vs 12.3%; P = .090), cerebral infarction (10.1% vs 8.4%; P = .130), atrial fibrillation (27.7% vs 27.1%; P = .754), ventricular tachycardia (21.8% vs 23.7%; P = .254), or gastrointestinal bleeding (12.8% vs 12.4%; P = .689).

Researchers used the large healthcare database TriNetX to conduct the analysis comparing 30-day outcomes between patients who received either Impella (n = 1256) or IABP (n = 1256) support for cardiogenic shock.

Patients were well-matched for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and prior myocardial infarction, the authors report.

Cardiogenic shock affects between 40,000 and 50,000 people in the US a year and is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality after acute myocardial infarction. One-year mortality rates are as high as 50%. 

In interventional cardiology, specialists use several types of mechanical circulatory support devices for patients in cardiogenic shock, especially after an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction. Impella and IABP are two devices inserted percutaneously, typically through the femoral artery, and occasionally through the axillary artery.

Impella, a temporary rotary heart pump, provides stronger circulatory support than the traditional balloon pump, explained Diljon Chahal, MD, a cardiologist at University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. However, he said, the Impella catheter is significantly larger than the IABP catheter, which can increase the risk of bleeding, vascular injury, and infection. 

""There has been ongoing controversy over which device may be better for patients in cardiogenic shock. Several prior studies, including the IMPRESS and ISAR-SHOCK trials, showed no significant difference in 30-day mortality between Impella and IABP in this setting,"" he pointed out.

""While Impella does provide greater immediate hemodynamic support, this new propensity-matched analysis shows that greater support does not necessarily translate into better outcomes,"" he said. ""The findings of higher 30-day mortality, more cardiac arrests, and higher rates of sepsis suggest that device-related complications may offset the intended benefits, particularly when used broadly without careful patient selection.""

This current analysis ""is thought-provoking and reinforces the need for more randomized trials with longer-term follow-up,"" he said. ""Until we have stronger prospective data, mechanical support decisions must be individualized, carefully balancing risks and benefits, rather than assuming that more support is always better. Although this study is valuable, the jury is still out on whether Impella offers a true survival advantage over IABP in cardiogenic shock.""

Drs Ajenaghughrure and Chahal report no relevant financial disclosures.

We used stable isotope-labeled internal standards wherever possible and validated for robust recovery and matrix consistency across six urine lots.

Boris Lazarov: We focused on a pragmatic workflow suited for postmortem blood. Our method used protein precipitation followed by automated dilution in the autosampler. We targeted 12 analytes, including traditional and novel benzos like brotizolam and fluorinated derivatives. The method was validated for a broad dynamic range and low-level sensitivity (down to 1 ng/mL for NPS benzos).

Emily Lee: We looked at the literature to prioritize compounds that have been frequently reported or are of growing concern. It's a balance—our aim was to cover a broad, representative range without becoming overly complex.

Boris Lazarov: We selected compounds based on what we were actually detecting in our routine screens. For us, brotizolam had become quite prevalent, so it made sense to prioritize it. Practicality matters too, we focused on what would have the most clinical or forensic relevance.

Emily Lee: If you have the standard, start by infusing it to optimize the MS conditions. Then run it individually to determine retention time. If it fits well with the existing gradient and shows good extraction recovery, just fold it into the method.

Boris Lazarov: I'd say don't reinvent the wheel—test it within your current method first. If it works, great. If not, consider running it separately or creating a small NPS-specific panel.

Emily Lee: The mean recovery across 26 analytes was 86 %, with CVs under 10 %. Most compounds had some ion suppression, but values were consistent across matrix lots. A few analytes without labeled internal standards (like etizolam) showed more variability—something to keep in mind during validation.

Boris Lazarov: Our protein precipitation method had recoveries in the 50–77 % range, with ion suppression especially for compounds like chlordiazepoxide. However, since we extracted the full calibration curve and saw good sensitivity at the low end, it was still effective for our needs.

Boris Lazarov: This was a big challenge. Designer benzos were notably less stable than traditional ones. For example, fluorinated benzos often degrade after just one day at –20 °C. We found that three days was the upper limit for most NPS benzos.

Emily Lee: We didn't do full stability studies, but we saw no major degradation over a couple of days for urine extracts. That said, we'd recommend labs assess stability under their specific conditions, especially if re-injection is needed.

Emily Lee: Using manual pipetting and a multi-channel prep, it took about 1–1.5 hours to prepare 20 samples, including hydrolysis. Automation would significantly reduce that. Since all processing occurs in the 96-well plate, it's easily scalable.

Emily Lee: No—we stuck with a traditional C18 column, which worked well for separation. It's kind of a go-to for toxicology.

Boris Lazarov: Same here. Benzos are hydrophobic enough that C18 is effective. We didn't see a need to explore alternative stationary phases for this application.

Boris Lazarov: Our current method is protein precipitation, which is great for speed but does introduce more matrix effects. If higher cleanliness is needed—for example in clinical confirmation—you could switch to SPE or SLE. But for most of our postmortem samples, the tradeoff was worth it.

Emily Lee: Yes, the SPE workflow was designed with automation in mind. You can integrate it with existing platforms since all steps are done in-well—hydrolysis, acidification, and elution.

Boris Lazarov: We used automation in the autosampler itself—for solvent strength reduction and injection. It helps reduce variability and simplifies the overall workflow.

Emily Lee: We haven't applied this method to hair yet, but Waters is currently working on a more comprehensive drugs-of-abuse panel in hair. That might include benzos and should be available soon.

Boris Lazarov: Not currently in our lab. We're focused on postmortem blood and clinical matrices like urine or serum. But with minor modifications, I think it's adaptable.

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have discovered that impaired glucose metabolism in glial cells, a type of cell in our nervous system, plays a key role in the degeneration caused by Alzheimer's disease. Using fruit fly retinas, they showed that promoting glucose metabolism in glial cells with tau protein build-up, like in Alzheimer's patients, helps relieve inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration. Their findings present an exciting new therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the world's leading cause of dementia among older people and continues to have a devastating impact on people's quality of life. Scientists are working against the clock to unravel the vast network of mechanisms by which AD affects our nervous system. We know, for example, that AD is characterized by a build-up of tau protein inside cells, but the ways in which this leads to neurodegeneration are not yet fully understood.

A team led by Professor Kanae Ando of Tokyo Metropolitan University have turned their attention to how tau protein build-up affects glial cells, non-neuronal cells in our central nervous system that help support, feed, and protect neurons. Importantly, the ways in which glial cells work have a lot do with what happens in AD patients. For example, glial cells are known to clear away abnormal build-up of protein, accompanied by an inflammatory response; neuroinflammation is a core pathology of AD. They play an important role in helping neurons stay fueled by metabolizing glucose; a drastic drop in brain glucose metabolism is another feature of AD patients. However, the relationship between changes to glial cell glucose metabolism and tau protein build-up was not known.

Using Drosophila fruit flies as a model, firstly the team showed that flies modified to have a tau-protein build-up in the retina showed neurodegeneration, swelling in nearby regions, and the formation of abnormal inclusions. They were able to show that the latter of these was caused by glial cells being abnormally active. To explore how this related to its glucose metabolism, they were able to use genetic modification techniques to express more of a glucose transporting protein (GLUT) in glial cells. Amazingly, this led to suppression of neurodegeneration and less inflammation, even though it did not lead to changes to tau protein build-up. This shows that tau-protein build-up causes glial cells to suffer from a significant drop in glucose metabolism.

The team propose that glial glucose metabolism might be a new target for novel therapies for neurodegenerative conditions. Diseases like Parkinson's, for example, are also characterized by neuroinflammation. Any advances which might cure, prevent, or even slow down the onset of any of these conditions promise to have a game-changing impact on human society.

New research in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241506 found an increase in asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits across Ontario following heavy smoke in early June 2023.

Canada experienced the most destructive wildfire season to date in 2023, with difficult-to-control fires across the country, including 29 mega-fires. One fire in Quebec, the province's largest-ever wildfire, extended 1.2 million acres. Smoke from fires blanketed Canada and the United States, causing substantial damage, loss, and displacement.

""The unprecedented wildfires of 2023 are a wake-up call that wildfires - a persistent feature of Canada's landscape - are becoming more intense and prolonged in a changing climate, affecting millions of people,"" writes Dr. Hong Chen, a scientist with Health Canada, ICES, and Public Health Ontario, with coauthors.

In early June, Ontario had some of the world's worst air quality from wildfires in the neighbouring province of Quebec. To understand the impact on health, researchers conducted a study, analyzing ED visits throughout the period from 8 weeks before a major wildfire event in early June until July 31, 2023, 4 weeks after a second fire that resulted in smoke. The analysis included data from 30 public health units in Ontario, representing 95% of the population. They found daily increases of 11% to 24% in asthma-related emergency department visits over the first episode, continuing up to 6 days after it ended. However, the second period of heavy smoke did not result in an increase in asthma-related ED visits.

""Possible explanations [of the lack of effect during the second episode] include extended protective effects of preventive medications prescribed during the first episode, increased supply and use of medications (e.g., caregiver administration of maintenance medication to children), or improved behavioural adaptations to minimize exposure in keeping with air-quality advisories, such as staying indoors and using air filters.""

As wildfires are a major environmental risk factor around the world and are increasing in frequency and severity, the researchers note that more research is needed to better understand their impact on health and how to mitigate health effects.

""The biggest impact of wildfire smoke is on acute respiratory morbidity, where its effects are consistently greater than those of air pollution from other sources,"" writes Dr. Sarah Henderson from the BC Centre for Disease Control, in a related commentary https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250510. ""Less clear associations have been shown for a much wider range of acute health outcomes, including cognition, diabetic control, and mental health, among many others.""

Dr. Henderson highlights that wildfire smoke frequently affects air quality in the west and calls for Canada to develop a consistent approach to reducing indoor and outdoor exposures.

Stomach cancers are increasingly being diagnosed at less advanced, more treatable stages - a shift that marks major progress in detecting one of the deadliest forms of cancer, according to a study to be presented today at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2025.

These trends suggest that advancements in endoscopic imaging, along with more widespread use of upper endoscopy, may be helping doctors find stomach cancer earlier. These shifts are important because catching stomach cancer earlier can lead to less-invasive treatment and better patient outcomes.""

 Mohamed Tausif Siddiqui, MD, study's lead author and gastroenterology fellow at Cleveland Clinic

Stomach cancer remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer worldwide, with the American Cancer Society predicting about 26,500 new cases and more than 10,800 deaths in the U.S. in 2025.

Using data from the National Cancer Institute's SEER-22 database, researchers found that diagnoses of early-stage stomach cancer rose steadily from 2004 to 2021, increasing by approximately 53%, while more advanced cases - where the cancer had already spread to nearby lymph nodes or distant organs - dropped significantly.

Overall, the incidence of stomach cancer in the U.S. has declined slightly over the past two decades, from 8.44 per 100,000 people in 2000 to 7.53 in 2021. The lowest rate, 6.42 per 100,000, was recorded in 2020, likely reflecting a temporary drop in medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the study, 2021 marked the first year in which localized, early-stage stomach cancer became the most common stage at diagnosis, overtaking advanced-stage cases. From 2004 to 2021, diagnoses involving regional spread decreased by 38%, while distant-stage cases dropped by nearly 8%. While early-stage stomach cancer is generally more treatable, the study did not examine whether these shifts in diagnosis stage have led to changes in mortality rates.

Dr. Siddiqui said the study underscores the potential value of early detection strategies and supports the continued utilization of high-quality endoscopy tools and techniques. It also raises the possibility that screening high-risk individuals could further improve survival rates.

People at highest risk for stomach cancer include those with Helicobacter pylori infection, a family history of the disease, certain inherited genetic conditions, or long-term digestive symptoms such as acid reflux.

Dr. Siddiqui said that newer technologies - such as high-definition endoscopes, narrow-band imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound - allow physicians to detect subtle mucosal changes during gastric evaluation. These innovations, combined with heightened clinical attention to gastrointestinal symptoms, may explain the positive shift in trends.

Dr. Amit Bhatt, staff gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic and the senior author on the study, said there is a need for further research to better define the evolving demographics of stomach cancer in the U.S. He said the findings could help elevate discussions about targeted screening for gastric cancers in high-risk groups - bringing attention to an issue that may warrant greater public health focus in the future.

Dr. Siddiqui will present data from the study, ""A two-decade evolution in early gastric cancer detection: Patterns and insights from SEER data,"" abstract Sa1374 at 12:30 p.m. PDT on Saturday, May 3.

The English Championship regular season concluded on Saturday, with some good news and bad news for U.S. Men's National Team players.

Leeds United and Brenden Aaronson already clinched their promotion to the Premier League last month, but closed out the campaign in style by finishing as league champions after a win.

Also in the Championship, Haji Wright and Coventry City lived to play another two days in the promotion playoffs.

Norwich City did not qualify for the Championship playoffs, but forward Josh Sargent was selected to the league's team of the season alongside being named the club's player of the year.

Cardiff City and Ethan Horvath will play in League One next season.

Elsewhere, there was plenty of encouraging news, as Brian White scored another goal as the Vancouver Whitecaps defeated Inter Miami CF to reach the Concacaf Champions Cup final.

Folarin Balogun also tallied his first goal in seven months for Monaco in France, while Diego Luna converted a penalty kick for Real Salt Lake in a loss.

Midfielder Brenden Aaronson did not score or assist on a goal, but he had plenty of reasons to celebrate on Saturday, May 3. Aaronson and Leeds United (29-4-13, 100 points) clinched the English Championship title. Leeds and Burnley finished at 100 points, but the former team won the crown on a superior goal differential (65 to 53). Leeds earned promotion to the Premier League last month.

Coventry City and striker Haji Wright will fight for a spot in the Premier League after finishing fifth in the Championship with a 20-17-9 mark and 69 points. They will take on fourth-place Sunderland (21-12-13, 76) in a home-and-home semifinal promotion series. City will host on Friday, May 9 before playing away on Tuesday, May 13. The winner will meet the victor of the Sheffield United-Bristol City semifinals in a one-off affair at Wembley Stadium on May 24.

Norwich City failed to clinch a promotion playoff berth, but striker Josh Sargent was chosen to the Championship team of the year and was named the team's player of the year. Sargent, despite missing 14 Championship games due to injuries, still finished with 15 goals in 32 appearances. He took fourth place among the league's top goal-scorers during the regular season. Leeds' Joel Piroe took first-place honors with 19. Norwich teammate Borja Sainz was tied for second with Burnley's Josh Brownhill with 18 apiece. Sargent did not score for the 13th-place Canaries (14-17-15, 57) in their 4-2 win in their season finale on Saturday, May 3.

Cardiff City and goalkeeper Ethan Horvath were relegated to League One after the team finished 24th in the English Championship after dropping a 4-2 away decision to Norwich City on Saturday, May 3. City, which was joined by Luton Town and Plymouth Argyle in demotion, registered a 9-20-17 record and 44 points.

Brian White enjoyed a memorable day on Wednesday, April 30. He first was named MLS player of the month for April, and then went out and helped the Vancouver Whitecaps to a 3-1 triumph over host Inter Miami CF and a spot in the Concacaf Champions Cup final. Vancouver won the aggregate goals series, 5-1. White, who tallied in the opening leg, leveled the second leg at 1-1 with a 51st-minute goal as his side-footed finish off Sebastian Berhalter's feed beat goalkeeper Oscar Ustari from 11 yards. The 29-year-old forward has 11 goals across all competitions this season and has seven in his last six appearances. Cruz Azul, 2-1 semifinal aggregate winners over UANL Tigres (via a 1-0 win on Thursday, May 1), will host the Whitecaps in the final on June 1.

White sat out Vancouver's 2-1 home win over Real Salt Lake in MLS action on Saturday, May 3 due to hamstring issues.

Folarin Balogun, who has missed most of the season with a shoulder injury, connected for his first Ligue 1 goal in almost seven months for Monaco in its 3-1 victory at Saint-Etienne in French Ligue 1 on Saturday, May 3. Starting in his first match since Dec. 1, Balogun latched onto a Maghnes Akliouche pass and beat goalkeeper Gautier Larsonneur from the top right of the penalty area for the visitors' final goal, in the 78th minute. Balogun, who has found the net four times this season, scored his first goal since a 3-1 victory over Saint-Etienne on Oct. 5, 2024. He had come off the bench for five consecutive games before starting on Saturday.

During the 2022-23 Ligue 1 campaign, Balogun scored a career-high 21 goals. Monaco (17-8-7, 58) is in second place, trailing leader Paris Saint-Germain (24-2-6, 78) by 20 points.

Six minutes into second-half stoppage time on Saturday, May 3, Diego Luna converted a penalty kick to help Real Salt Lake avert a shutout in its 2-1 loss the Vancouver Whitecaps. Luna put away his PK to the right of goalkeeper Yohe Takaoka, who dove in the opposition direction. He has tallied sixth goals for the Claret and Cobalt (4-7-0, 12), which is in 11th place in the MLS Western Conference.

DeJuan Jones made an impact not once, but twice during a nine-minute span in his first start and second appearance for the San Jose Earthquakes. He assisted on two goals in the Quakes' 4-1 home victory on Saturday, May 3. After taking a Christian Arango feed on the right side, Jones one-touched the ball to Cristian Espinosa, who lifted the hosts into a 1-0 lead. With San Jose enjoyed a 2-0 margin, Jones set up Arango for a goal and a 3-0 advantage in the 27th minute. Jones entered the match with three assists in 158 MLS career matches. San Jose (4-6-1, 13) sits in 10th place in the Western Conference.

Max Arfsten got into the box score for a second straight week, setting up the Columbus Crew's 4-2 home triumph over Charlotte Fc on Saturday, May 3. The 24-year-old midfielder assisted on Columbus' final goal. He chested down a right-wing cross from Mohamed Farsi before looping a long pass to Jacen Russell-Rowe, who headed home from eight yards for the final goal of the match in the 81st minute. Arsten scored a goal in Columbus' 2-1 win over San Jose on April 26. He has accumulated two goals and three assists for the Crew (7-1-3, 24), who lead the MLS Eastern Conference.

Timmy Tillman recorded his first assist of the MLS season on Los Angeles FC's final goal in the 79th minute of its 2-0 win over the Houston Dynamo on Saturday, May 3. He started a quick counterattack by winning the ball at the top of the LA penalty area and playing a long ball forward to Denis Bouanga on the left flank. Bouanga ran at the Dynamo defense, playing the ball to Jeremy Ebobisse, who scored past diving goalkeeper Jonathan Bond.

Club America and Alejandro Zendejas haven't played since April 19, but they will play two vital matches within a three-day span in the Liga MX Clausura quarterfinals. The team visits Pachuca on Tuesday, May 6 before hosting its foes on Friday, May 9.

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss how Trent Alexander-Arnold might fit in at Real Madrid if Xabi Alonso is named as Carlo Ancelotti's replacement. (1:59)

Real Madrid want Trent Alexander-Arnold to join them for this summer's Club World Cup, sources have told ESPN, and now plan talks with Liverpool to negotiate an early release from his contract.

The Premier League club confirmed on Monday that Alexander-Arnold had ""informed Liverpool FC of his intention to leave the club this summer upon the expiry of his current contract,"" saying that he would ""depart Anfield once his deal ceases on June 30, 2025.""

ESPN has reported that Madrid are ""very optimistic"" about signing the England international on a free transfer. Talks with Alexander-Arnold's camp have been ongoing for months, and only the final details are now lacking on a contract.

Madrid have reached a verbal agreement with Alexander-Arnold, sources told ESPN, and he  would be open to joining early, at the end of the Premier League season, if a deal can be struck with Liverpool.

Madrid had been keen to bring in the right-back in January after their first choice in the position, Dani Carvajal, suffered a long-term knee injury in October.

However, Liverpool were unwilling to consider a deal.

Sources told ESPN that the LaLiga giants would now like to negotiate an agreement with Liverpool -- for a reasonable fee -- to allow Alexander-Arnold to join them before his contract at Anfield is due to expire.

That would allow the defender to travel with Madrid to the United States to take part in the Club World Cup.

Madrid's group games will see them play Al Hilal in Miami, Florida on June 18, Pachuca in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 22, and Salzburg in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 26.

The club view Alexander-Arnold's taking part in the tournament as the best way to integrate him into the team as soon as possible, sources said, and prepare for the 2025-26 season.

Liverpool won their 20th English league title -- and second Premier League crown -- last week.

Alexander-Arnold, 26, has spent 20 years at Anfield, winning the 2019 Champions League, two Premier League titles, the FA Cup, the League Cup, the Club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.

""I've got to a point now where I feel like I need a new change, a new challenge for me as a player and as a person,"" he said on Monday, ""And I think now is the right time for me to do that.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Enrique Sanz

One of the most interesting dilemmas Real Madrid faces, looking ahead to the Club World Cup and the next season, is on the bench at Santiago Bernabéu. Because Carlo Ancelotti's continuity is practically ruled out, even if victory is achieved in the current league campaign, given his decisions during this course.

That's why Real Madrid is already working on making the arrival of his replacement a reality, a Xabi Alonso who, according to many sports media, would want to take the position after the World Cup. Not before because he wouldn't have the necessary time to install his tactics and game visions to footballers tremendously worn out by the demanding pace of this season.

In any case, Carlo Ancelotti wouldn't be Real Madrid's coach at the Club World Cup, a decision that sparks dozens of opinions. One of the latest is from Fernando Morientes, a former '9' of the white club. ""The project that dies with Ancelotti and is born with a new coach has to start from the beginning with the preseason"", states the former Madrid striker.

For Fernando Morientes, ""the best option for the coach who arrives is to start training with them and already draw what he wants from the training sessions for the new season"". That idea wouldn't hold with the coach change devised by Real Madrid: an interim for the Club World Cup and welcoming Xabi Alonso afterward.

The former white forward, in that sense, argues that ""it would seem incongruous not to put the Castilla coach"". Because ""he already did it in the past with Zidane and I think he is the one who knows best because he is daily with Ancelotti"". Thus, the former Real Madrid and AS Monaco forward reveals his personal bet on Raúl González Blanco as the new first-team coach.

""I would put Raúl, and if not, it would seem even a bit disrespectful to the figure"" of one of the most remembered legends of the Madrid squad. Placing Raúl González at the helm of the first team in the Club World Cup would be a tribute ""to the figure of what Raúl represents in Real Madrid"", Morientes points out.

Apart from the 'promotion' of the current Real Madrid Castilla coach, Fernando Morientes recalls that ""Solari is more than prepared, but I know he would take it reluctantly"". Exercising the tactical command of the team wouldn't please the Argentine director, ""it's an obligation, if they tell you to take the first team, you're not going to say no"".

So much so that ""I'm convinced that he is in another much calmer and more comfortable area than taking that responsibility for just a month"", he reveals about Santiago Solari. ""Another story would be staying next year"", concludes Fernando Morientes about the debate on the new Real Madrid coach for the Club World Cup and for the next season.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Episcopal High School named FIFA World Cup training site and wants 40-to-100-foot-tall lights at its athletic fields","https://www.alxnow.com/2025/05/05/episcopal-high-school-named-fifa-world-cup-training-site-and-wants-40-to-100-foot-tall-lights-at-its-athletic-fields/","Mon, 05 May 2025 19:30:52 GMT","

Everything Alexandria

Episcopal High School is about to get a lot brighter.

The private high school at 1200 N. Quaker Lane has been approved to serve as a training site for a team participating in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and now the school wants to install field lighting with 47 light poles between 40-to-100-feet-tall.

The Episcopal property abuts the Seminary Hill neighborhood, and the school is asking that the plans be in effect for 10 years.

According to the city:

It is anticipated that in addition to lights being installed on the Track Field and Hummel Bowl, lights will be installed on the School's Soccer, Baseball, Softball, Field Hockey/Lacrosse fields as well as the tennis courts as part of a multi-year capital improvement program for EHS.

FIFA announced Episcopal as a potential training site last fall, and the selected team will stay at Hotel AKA Alexandria (625 First Street).

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

City planners also said that lights are also being planned for the school's soccer, baseball, softball, field hockey/lacrosse fields.

According to the city:

Episcopal High School proposes to install lighting on campus outdoor athletic fields and courts as an accessory congregate recreational facility use to the principal use of the property as a private academic school. A total of 47 light poles are proposed ranging in heights from 40 feet to 100 feet…

Due to the layout of the facilities several poles can provide lighting for multiple fields by having luminaires (fixtures) in different directions, and many poles have luminaires installed at different heights along the length of the pole…

The lighting contractor is Musco Lighting, which specializes in lighting for sports facilities and has completed other projects in the city for the Department of Recreation Parks and Cultural Activities (RPCA) and Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS). The plan uses LED luminaires on galvanized steel light poles set on precast concrete bases. The system is designed to comply with the International Dark-Sky Associations (IDA) Community Friendly Outdoor Sports Lighting Program and provide full cutoff lighting that minimizes glare and light spillage onto adjacent properties. The athletic field lights will be connected to a remote facility management system to provide school staff control of the light schedules. Additionally, the applicant has utilized temporary field lighting and requests continued use as part of this SUP until full implementation of permanent improvements.

City Council will consider the matter at its hearing on May 17.

It is 2014, and it is time for the World Cup 2014 final—Germany against Argentina—arguably the biggest sports event that year. Mid-July, the air smells of summer and boundless freedom to me. I am fifteen years old. Two of the best teams in the world line up against each other in the Brazilian heat. Only one will come out as a winner. I knew nothing about football then. I only know who Leo Messi is (who doesn't?) and I know one more thing: I hate German, and I want nothing more but to see the Germans crash and burn during this final, defeated by the fiery Argentinians.

I am a bright-eyed high schooler, and it just so happens that I attend a foreign language high school. I am part of one of the two German classes, which meant I studied German intensely for all five years of high school. Objectively, German has done nothing to me personally, it is just a language like any other, but for some reason I hate it. Annoyingly, I am good at it, getting only “A”s, and that makes me hate it even more. Our teacher and her toxic behavior and blatant favoritism towards certain students in the class were inciting in-class conflicts and were also really not helping to make me fall in love with her beloved Deutsch.

So, as any self-respecting teenager who just has to reject everything and anything around them, I decide that I hate German, I hate everything and everyone German, and I hate Germany. By proxy, I now hate the German national team, too. The commentators on TV are pouring praise on Messi, hailing him and saying how much he deserves to win this World Cup and bring glory to his country. My fifteen-year-old self is lapping up every word they say, nodding and agreeing with them. Leo Messi has got this. He will make Argentina world champs; I was sure of it. It is a matter of time, I thought. Any moment now.

However, I did not know one thing back then, and it is probably the most important thing one should know about the game of football: anything is possible, always.

A young German man I don't know disagrees with me about Argentina's win right at this very moment. His name is Mario Goetze, and he scores a (beautiful) goal for Germany in the 113th minute of the game, which had gone into extra time. I erupt into rage, throwing a tantrum and crying for Leo Messi's gone dream of winning the World Cup.

It is 2024, and it is the UEFA European Football Championship 2024's quarterfinal—Germany against Spain. Beginning of July, the air smells of summer and uncomfortable uncertainty to me. I am twenty-five years old. Two of the best teams in Europe stand against each other amidst Stuttgart Arena in Stuttgart, Germany. Only one will come out as a winner. I know everything about football now. I know the Spanish team and I know the German one, inside out, and I know one more thing: I love the Germans and I really, really want them to win.

But, not for the first time in my quarter century of a life so far, things do not happen the way I want them to, and Germany lose, and they lose by a goal that they conceded in the 119th minute of the added time of the game.

Oh man, it stings.

And, interestingly enough, it stings the same way it stung when Mario Goetze defeated the Argentinians ten years ago, when I was against anything German. I barely remember this now; it is like I was a completely different person back then (of course I was).

A month after Germany beat Argentina in the 2014 World Cup final, I went to a German-language summer camp in a picturesque little town in Austria with some of my classmates. It was such great fun, a whole new experience with some great Austrian teachers, and suddenly I found myself genuinely interested in the language, and not despising it for once. A week and a few German sports magazines later, and I was sitting in front of the TV to watch the German Super Cup game between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. Unsurprisingly, most of the German national team players were on the pitch again now, this time dressed in club colors, red and white and yellow and black, and were battling it out again, but for a whole different cause this time. I couldn't take my eyes off the tiny TV.

So, not long after that 2014 final, any hate I felt towards the Germans was discarded—it had been fabricated anyway (and I was a teen with an ever-changing opinion, c'mon), and I actually found their jubilation endearing. I started learning more about football and watching more of it by the day. The rest is history.

After watching football for ten years, I am more than used to painful losses, but also jubilant wins. I have long stopped throwing tantrums and crying when my team loses (most of the time).

But I do let a few tears slip from my eyes and wet my cheeks as I watch the Spaniards running and jumping around the pitch and the Germans standing in silence or dropping to the ground in Stuttgart.

“That's football,"" I think to myself, “c'mon, it's just football.”

It has never ever been just football to me.

For ten years, it has been my greatest passion in life, one of the things that makes me who I am. Funnily enough, the German national team has always been an intricate part of this passion and of myself, without me having anything to do with the country of Germany whatsoever. And I have a feeling it always will be.","{'href': 'https://www.meer.com', 'title': 'meer.com'}","soccer"

Three storylines to watch, including the world No. 1's return in front of his home fans, over the next fortnight at the Foro Italico.BySteve TignorPublished May 05, 2025 copy_link

Published May 05, 2025

Normally, when two big tournaments run back-to-back—Miami and Indian Wells or Canada and Cincinnati—the second one comes with a strong sense of déja vu. The surface is the same, the field is the same, the points and stakes are the same.That's not true, or as true, on the men's side of the Madrid-Rome double this year. Yes, the courts are clay, and 1,000 ranking points go to the winner, in both places. But Rome has two very important things that Madrid didn't: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Last week, Sinner was still serving his ban and Alcaraz was hurt. This week, they're both in the draw, and looking to get in as many reps as possible before Roland Garros.Here's a look at that storyline, and two others, as the clay swing reaches its final Masters 1000, and we get our first proper men's tune-up for Paris.

Sinner was in good spirits in front of a jam-packed press room at the Foro Italico on Monday.

Sinner's return, in front of his home fans in Italy, will be an event. Not only has he been suspended for a doping violation since early February, but he missed Rome last year. We know his compatriots will be ready. Will he? For someone who has played just one event in 2025—the Australian Open, which he won—he hasn't suffered much in the rankings so far. He's still No. 1 overall, and fourth in this year's race to Turin.Like many of his fellow Italian players, who can seem overwhelmed by the atmosphere, Sinner hasn't been at his best in Rome. He's 9-5 there for his career, and has never made it past the quarterfinals. That may have as much to do with the surface as it does the location. Of his 19 titles, just one has come on clay. This was supposed to be a season where Sinner branched out from hard courts, but his suspension has left him with little time to test out his clay game. Currently he's scheduled to play Rome and the ATP 500 in Hamburg before Roland Garros.Whatever the surface, and however much time he has been away, Sinner remains the favorite against virtually anyone he faces. In Rome, he could begin against fellow Italian Federico Cina, then play Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the third round, Francisco Cerundolo in the fourth, and Madrid champion Casper Ruud in the quarters. Alcaraz, the third seed, is in the other half.

On the one hand, Zverev suffered a collapse in confidence after his blowout loss to Sinner in the Australian Open final; since then, he has made a series of early exits, while publicly lamenting his poor form at just about every stop. Yet he also broke out of that slump long enough to win a title in Munich a couple of weeks ago. For all of his recent frustrations, Zverev is a three-time finalist in Rome and last year's runner-up at Roland Garros. Clay remains a comfortable surface for him, and one where he's capable of turning his form around in a hurry.Judging by his draw, though, Rome might be a tough place for him to do that this time around. Arthur Fils and Lorenzo Musetti, two guys who have been threatening to have breakout springs, are in his quarter, as are two of his lifelong nemeses, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. If Zverev makes it past them, he could run into Alcaraz in the semifinals.

The list of favorites for Paris is short at the moment. Sinner and Alcaraz are the only definite members. Novak Djokovic, despite his current injured status and advanced tennis age, can't be entirely counted out. Neither can Zverev, who was one set from the title last year. Casper Ruud, a two-time runner-up at Roland Garros, just made his case credible again with a title in Madrid. Who might be in a position to follow in his footsteps at the Foro?Two guys who come to mind are Fils and Musetti.So far this spring the Italian has been a finalist in Monte Carlo and a semifinalist in Madrid, and is at a career-high No. 9. While he has never been past the fourth round in Paris, he did make the semifinals at Wimbledon last year. If he can handle the home-court pressure, his draw gives him a path in Rome. The seeds nearest him are Brandon Nakashima, Alexei Popyrin and Medvedev. A Musetti-Medvedev fourth-rounder would be fun.As for the 20-year-old Fils, he is also at a career-high of No. 14, and has also made noise over the past month. He reached the quarters in Monte Carlo, where he had Alcaraz on the ropes before losing in three. In Barcelona he made the semis and fell again to Alcaraz, in more routine fashion. By Madrid, where he lost early, Fils may have been a bit weary. But the Frenchman will surely want to ramp back up before he storms his home capital later this month. Fils could play Tsitsipas in his second match in Rome, and Zverev after that.

Ruud overcame both a rib injury sustained in the semi-final and a resilient Jack Draper to seal a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 victory in the Spanish capital on Sunday to become the first Norwegian winner of a Masters 1000 crown.

It ended a run of six successive losses in big finals for the 26-year-old, including the 2022 French Open and US Open title clashes and the Roland Garros final two years ago.

""With this win, I put myself back in a good position when it comes to ranking and seeding,"" said Ruud, who jumped eight spots in the rankings and returned to the top 10 ahead of the year's second Grand Slam starting on May 25.

""If you want to win a tournament it doesn't really matter what your ranking is because you have to beat every player you play anyways, but it's a good step forward, and when I come to Paris, I'll always have great feeling and memories from the place.

""I'm a good clay court player and in best-of-five sets, I'll be even tougher to beat, that's my mentality.

""I know I don't need to play great every point or every single match, but I know I can physically be there for a long time and play my clay court game, make it difficult for the opponents. That's how I felt when I've done well there.""

Ruud, who has more tour-level wins (125) and titles (12) on clay than any other player since 2020, will continue his preparations for Roland Garros at the Italian Open this week.

""A win here shows the other players that I'm here to try to do well for the rest of the clay season,"" he added.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Pete Sampras will forever remain a tennis icon for his feats on the court, which include reaching 18 Grand Slam finals.

Sampras impressively won 14 of those finals, having once held the record for the most men's Grand Slam titles.

After clinching his 13th such title at Wimbledon in 2000, Sampras said his Grand Slam record would be hard to beat.

But little did he know just how special the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic would turn out to be.

The Serbian ATP star currently sits top of the pile with 24 titles, followed by the 22 of Nadal and the 20 of Federer.

But the American has been left with many fond memories, with Sampras calling his 1999 Wimbledon final win his best performance.

He beat his fierce rival Andre Agassi for a sixth title in London, and said after the victory: “In the middle of the second set I was on fire.

“I was in the zone. I couldn't have played any better. It feels great. I love it out there on Centre Court. I don't know why but this tournament brings out the best in me. The atmosphere is phenomenal.

“There is no question this is our biggest tournament and to beat Andre on the fourth of July is pretty sweet.

“Andre brings out the best in me. He elevates my game to a level that is phenomenal because I need to be at my best against him.”

Sampras's love for Wimbledon was perhaps unsurprising given his stunning record at the grass-court Grand Slam.

He clinched seven titles there throughout his glittering career, which is behind only the eight of Swiss icon Federer.

But surgery isn't on the table just yet, especially with injections as temporary pain management solutions that support Badosa's tennis aspirations.“I've told them many times: until you operate on me and there's no other solution, I'll continue with the injections, even though I know how bad they are for me and how harmful they are to my body,” she said.Reaching the quarterfinals and semifinals in the last two major appearances, respectively, Badosa is hoping to find some footing during the final clay tournament ahead of Roland Garros.

The effects would be far-reaching, impacting tennis lessons, equipment sales, tournament registrations and more. Many rural communities across the country rely on college tennis programs to maintain courts and qualified coaches. Without these programs, tennis facilities will be lost.Tennis federations currently depend on college programs for much of their player development, particularly for top players not yet ready for the professional tours. Without college tennis, where would these players go for training? Furthermore, who would train the next generation of U.S. tennis coaches if they didn't first experience college tennis themselves? These universities contribute millions of dollars each year to the sport.At this critical juncture, it's vital for everyone in the industry to come together and explore opportunities to preserve and strengthen college tennis. So, how can we do this?

Merced breaks down Dina's roller coaster fourth episode, ""Day One,"" and how spending a few days in 'The Last of Us' editing bay changed her entire view of acting — and of Pedro Pascal. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


The Last of Us co-creator Craig Mazin remembers the moment he knew for certain that casting Isabela Merced was the right choice. 


	It was Merced's first scene with Ellie (Bella Ramsey) in the debut episode of season two. “Ellie opens the door and Izzy turns and goes, ‘Hiiiii,' which is just awesome,” recalls the showrunner, who cast the 23-year-old actress after seeing her in Sicario: Day of the Soldado. “She just radiates.” 




	That word – “radiates” — is one that's been used a lot to describe Merced as the rather sunny Dina, whose upbeat demeanor doesn't get in the way of her otherwise well-honed survival instincts and moments of dark humor. Dina might be fairly cheerful for somebody living through an apocalyptic dystopia, but she's no fool. Dina understands perfectly well the world she's in.

					'The Last of Us' Just Aired Bella Ramsey's Toughest Scene: ""I Was Really Worried""		
			









	Across the first four episodes, Dina's relationship with Ellie has rapidly evolved as the duo have set off on  a seemingly hopeless mission to Seattle to avenge the murder of their surrogate father figure, Joel (Pedro Pascal). During Sunday's episode, “Day One,” [spoilers for the episode below] Dina discovered Ellie has immunity from the Cordyceps parasite, learned that she is pregnant from Jesse (Young Mazino) and became intimate with Ellie. 


	Below, Merced breaks down some of her big scenes from the episode, reveals what she learned in The Last of Us editing bay that changed her view of acting and tackles an online controversy surrounding her character.


Dina talks about loving Ellie's bravery in this episode. Dina being so sunny, and Ellie being rather morose, what draws Dina to her in your mind?


	Just like with any great couple, they are similar in the right ways and then they are different in the right ways. There are similarities that bring them together, but their differences keep them together because they compensate for what the other lacks. Dina is the brains and Ellie is the brawn, and this this operation wouldn't work if they weren't together. Also, what keeps them together is the need for vengeance for Joel's death and there's a lot of guilt there too. 


Why would she feel guilty? 


	For Ellie, the feeling like “I could have gotten there sooner.” Or Dina, being like, “I could have done something else.” As much as we, in retrospect, might not have had any control over the situation, we like to replay things in our heads and exercising every potential outcome — that will drive us crazy. So we're helping each other grieve, as well. I think Dina is projecting a lot of her grief onto Ellie, and by helping heal Ellie, she's healing herself in a way.

	











Dina and Ellie getting intimate is obviously a key turning point their relationship and a scene that fans in the game have been waiting for. Instead of asking anything specific, what would you like to share about shooting that scene? 


	I think they did it really tastefully. The intimacy coordinator was phenomenal. But also, this is a really necessary step in their relationship. It's also just like really hot to me because it's like the culmination of all of these feelings and secrets all just being let out in one moment. It may seem passionate and in-the-moment, but it was really calculated, and we were really intentional about every single thing that was a part of that sequence, because we wanted to make sure none of the characters were doing anything that was out of character.  


Dina talks about her sexuality afterwards. I read online that some criticized Dina saying in a previously episode she's not gay, but is seemed just curious, that that's “weakening her bisexuality.” Their conversation in this episode seems to address that more clearly, but what are your thoughts? 


	I think every baby gay should be allowed to be confused and should be allowed to be curious and figure it out. I don't think Dina's being explicitly manipulative. I think Dina really does have feelings for Ellie, and it's just really confused about it. I think for me personally, that was a really relatable experience. So I was like, “Okay, that actually makes sense for me, and the way that I view Dina as a character.” It's important because I think Ellie's quite the opposite. Ellis has always known who she was and didn't have that struggle of complicit heterosexuality — which is a new term that I learned, and is a very real. This was all calculated, too. Craig Mazin was like, “I know the gays are gonna hate me for like a week.” 

	











There's a hard decision Dina makes at the end — which becomes more of an issue as the season goes on, but it starts here — where Dina decides to continue on with the revenge quest despite being pregnant. I'm sure some will say: Dina should turn back at this point. 


	Up until this point, everyone was under the impression that Dina was doing this for Ellie and Joel. But in the next episode, you're going to learn that Dina has her own personal reasons, as well. Once that motive is revealed, her decision makes more sense to me. At lot of times, I was looking towards my mom for this role. Knowing her, if she were able to somehow secure the safety of others and herself and her baby — nothing would really stop her. She would get even if she weren't able to guarantee [that she would survive]. Whenever I would question an action or decision, I would be like, “How would [my mom] go about it?” Because I find her to be a very level headed individual, whereas I'm just super impulsive. I'm more Ellie-leaning. Also, there's the way Dina is able to take charge, the way she's able to assess situations with logic and emotion; she's super balanced with that. 


The sequence where Ellie plays guitar, you can see all these various emotions cycling across Dina's face. What was that sequence like for you? 


	It was really emotional. That was my favorite scene from the video game. When I was walking around on the set, it was so beautiful. They literally built this music shop inside of the stage. And Bella was actually beautifully playing and singing. They told Bella to do it the way that they would, except worse, so it sounded more like a regular person picking up a guitar, and not like this talented individual that just emits beauty in all directions. So Bella had to kind of tone it down a little bit. Even then I was I was still mesmerized and emotional. I'm also always emotional, so it was actually hard for me to hold back. I wanted you to be able to see the changes in Dino's face, from when she's maybe thinking of Joel, or thinking how scared she is to fall in love. I just wanted to make sure that was coming across.

	











I found it interesting reading in another interview that you asked to join a VFX meeting. I don't think most actors would necessarily want to do that. What made you want to and does this mean you have Hollywood career ambitions beyond acting?


	I've always wanted to and I just hadn't had the balls to ask. But Craig makes everyone feel so comfortable, and really brings out the best in people. It started with me asking to go into the editing room because I wanted to watch. That was hardest text I've ever had to write because it felt so weirdly entitled — like that's such a sacred space and I wouldn't expect him to let me be a part of it. But he did. I spent like five days watching them cut together scenes, and I learned more about acting then that I ever have in my whole career. And then I would join the VFX meetings and wouldn't say anything. And then I would text Craig at the end, and he'd be like, “You were here the whole time?” The quietest I've ever been, is it those meetings. I became like this glorified intern. 


What's something you specifically learned about acting from sitting in the editing bay that you didn't know before?


	That there's no such thing as doing too many takes. I learned how sacred and magical it is to get a perfect take. There are so many contributing factors. Like if there was just one little moment of something being out of focus, one head nod being wrong, something not matching another shot — the panic and disappointment and devastation that would ensue in the editing room when that happened. I was like, “All right, noted, I am never, ever going to complain ‘this is too many takes and too much coverage.'” It also taught me that in the future, when I direct my own projects, that I understand the importance of story boarding and planning a shot list. 

	











	Oh, also, watching Pedro. I learned his little micro idiosyncrasies and nuances in his performance. This man is such a special actor. I wasn't able to really clock it when I was working with him, because I was really wrapped up in what I was doing and just getting my freaking lines right. But in the editing room, I was really able to appreciate his skills. 


Is there any scene from this episode I didn't ask about you wanted to talk about before we go?


	The sequence [in the underground subway tunnel being attacked by the Infected] was so hard, and those rooms smelled like manure because somebody to wait the correct number of days to properly air it out. But during that time, [Bella and I] bonded the most. That was the sequence where we really got up close and ended up creating a secret language.

But Duncan Crabtree-Ireland also notes that the industry is waiting on specifics of the President's plan.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


SAG-AFTRA's national executive director and chief negotiator has weighed in on President Donald Trump's idea to apply tariffs to films produced outside the U.S. — and signaled an open mind about it.


	Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the staff leader of the 160,000-strong performers' union, said in a statement on Monday that “SAG-AFTRA supports efforts to increase movie, television and streaming production in the United States.” Crabtree-Ireland noted that the union will continue to “advocate for policies that strengthen our competitive position, accelerate economic growth and create good middle class jobs for American workers.”

	The labor leader added that the union is looking forward to learning more specifics of the plan and to “advancing a dialogue to achieve our common goals.”

	Crabtree-Ireland is the first out of the gate amongst Hollywood's labor leaders to publicly respond to the notion that Trump put forward in a Truth Social post on Sunday. At the time, Trump called for a “100% tariff” on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” 


	The post, where Trump stated that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and United States trade representative Jamieson Greer to institute the tariff, left many questions unanswered. Would television shows or digital media projects be included? What does “produced in Foreign Lands” mean, given that there is a wide range in how films and television projects outsource work? What would happen with international co-productions?


	The White House later walked Trump's assertion back a bit, with a White House spokesperson telling The Hollywood Reporter that “no final decisions” have been made regarding the tariffs idea.


	Still, Hollywood industry leaders, including some in labor, have been reeling following Trump's Sunday announcement. Several unions had been working on potential legislation to create a federal tax incentive for U.S.-produced projects and were focused on that effort when Trump's tariffs message came through. The lack of clarity around what this tariff could even look like have left industry types scrambling for answers and concerned about potential unintended consequences in a highly international industry.

	











	Even so, Trump's assertion arrives at a time when there is broad concern about the state of domestic production. Studios and streamers, in search of cost savings and tax incentives, have outsourced major components of projects to countries like the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, while production in former U.S. hubs has lagged. 


	According to the industry service ProdPro, in 2024 the U.S. remained the top destination for projects originating from domestic companies and with budgets above $40 million. Still, content spend in the U.S. was down 26 percent in 2024 compared with 2022 levels and executives cited the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia as their top preferred filming locations for 2025-2026.

Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” tops the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart for an 11th total and consecutive week.


	Dating to the Hot 100's Aug. 4, 1958, start “Luther” matches Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' “I'll Be Missing You” (featuring vocal group 112), in 1997, for the most weeks spent at No. 1 among duets by co-billed lead solo men and women.


	“Luther,” whose title honors late R&B great Luther Vandross (who is also sampled on the song), became Lamar's sixth Hot 100 No. 1 and SZA's third. Lamar and SZA each extend their longest career commands on the chart with the song.


	Also in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” rises a spot to a new high (3-2) and Doechii's “Anxiety” returns to the region at its No. 10 best.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 10, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 6. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Luther,” on pgLang/Interscope/ICLG, totaled 67.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (down 1% week-over-week), 20.5 million official streams (down 6%) and 2,000 sold (up 4%) in the U.S. April 25-May 1.


	“Luther” leads Radio Songs for a fifth week; holds at No. 3 following seven weeks atop Streaming Songs; and reenters Digital Song Sales at No. 24, after reaching No. 4.


	“Luther” concurrently collects a 19th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts.


	“Luther” ties Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' “I'll Be Missing You” (featuring vocal group 112), in 1997, for the most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Hot 100 among duets by co-billed lead solo men and women. Among all collaborations by co-billed lead male and female artists (not counting acts that have regularly recorded as duos), only one has ruled longer: Mariah Carey and then-quartet Boyz II Men's “One Sweet Day” (16 weeks, in 1995-96.)


	Here's a recap of the 10 longest-leading Hot 100 No. 1 duets by co-billed lead male and female acts – with two having reigned in 2025:




	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” ascends 3-2 for a new Hot 100 high. It tops Streaming Songs (21.5 million streams, up 2%) and Digital Song Sales (7,000 sold, up 6%) for a second week each, while boasting a 17% surge to 19.7 million in radio audience.


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” dips 2-3, following five nonconsecutive weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in January, and Drake's “Nokia” holds at No. 4, after reaching No. 2.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” keeps at No. 5 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July. It notches a 43rd week in the top five – matching The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights,” in 2020-21, for the most weeks spent in the tier all-time. (Fittingly, it ties the top-five weeks record, at No. 5, and in its 55th week on the chart overall, on Cinco de Mayo.) “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” also adds a 43rd week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” is steady at No. 6 on the Hot 100 after hitting No. 4.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, lifts 9-7, as it logs a record-extending 60th week in the top 10; two weeks earlier, it surpassed the 57-week run in the region of “Blinding Lights” for the most such frames in the chart's history. “Lose Control” notches an 89th week on the Hot 100 overall, the third-longest stay in the chart's history. The only hits with longer runs: Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” (91 weeks, in 2021-22) and “Blinding Lights” (90, in 2019-22).


	Morgan Wallen's “I'm the Problem” slips 7-8 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2; Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” rises 10-9, also after peaking at No. 2; and, rounding out the top 10, Doechii's “Anxiety” returns to the tier, up two spots back to its No. 10 best.

	Meanwhile, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” scores a 16th week atop the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. survey. The ballad first hit No. 1 on the list last September.

	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.

	











	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“Ordinary” crowns the Global 200 with 82.5 million streams and 6,000 sold worldwide April 25-May 1. The song by the Carlsbad, Calif., native became a viral hit, boosted by his performance of it in March on Netflix's Love Is Blind. It has since topped 11 charts in Billboard's Hits of the World menu, spent seven weeks and counting atop the Official UK Singles chart and hit No. 2, as of this week, on the U.S.-based Billboard Hot 100.


	“Die With a Smile” drops to No. 2 after 18 weeks atop the Global 200 beginning last September (second only to the 19 weeks at No. 1 for Mariah Carey's “All I Want for Christmas Is You” since the chart began). The rest of the ranking's top five holds in place: ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” at No. 3, after 12 weeks at No. 1 starting in November; Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” at No. 4, following three weeks at No. 1 last August; and Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” at No. 5, after it logged seven weeks on top in February-April 2024.


	WizTheMC's “Show Me Love” soars 19-10 on the Global 200 with 37 million streams (up 22%) and 1,000 sold (up 13%) worldwide. The track by the South African-German multihyphenate, based in Toronto, became his first Billboard chart entry in March. It concurrently bounds 11-6 on Global Excl. U.S.

	











	“Die With a Smile” collects a 16th week at No. 1 on Global Excl. U.S., with 66.9 million streams (down 1%) and 3,000 sold (down 2%) outside the U.S. The song boasts the second-longest rule in the chart's archives:




	The rest of the Global Excl. U.S. is also steady week-over-week: “APT.” at No. 2; “Ordinary” at its No. 3 best; JENNIE's “like JENNIE” at No. 4, after hitting No. 3; and “Birds of a Feather” at No. 5, following three weeks at No. 1 last August.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated May 10, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, May 6. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service.

This chart milestone comes just a month after the album was elected to the National Recording Registry.

	Paul Grein



Hamilton: An American Musical this week becomes the first original cast album to log 500 weeks on the Billboard 200. The album debuted at No. 12 on the chart dated Oct. 17, 2015, which was the highest debut for a cast album in more than 50 years.  It peaked at No. 2 in July 2020, which was the highest ranking for a cast album since Hair topped the chart for 13 weeks in 1969.


Hamilton logs its 500th week on the chart just one month after the album was elected to the National Recording Registry in its first year of eligibility.


Lin-Manuel Miranda,  who wrote the book, music and lyrics for Hamilton, has been showered with honors for his masterwork. He won two Tonys (best original musical score and best book of a musical), a Grammy (best musical theatre album) and the Pulitzer Prize for literature. The show's creative team (Miranda, Thomas Kail, Alex Lacamoire and Andy Blankenbuehler) was even honored at the Kennedy Center Honors.


	Miranda also won a Primetime Emmy (outstanding variety special, pre-recorded) in 2021 as a producer of a Disney TV adaptation.


	To mark Hamilton's 500-week chart achievement, we have prepared this list of the 10 cast albums with the most weeks on the Billboard 200 (which dates to March 1956). Hamilton is one of just two shows on the list where a solitary songwriter wrote both music and lyrics for the show. The other: The Music Man, written by Meredith Willson.


	Alan Jay Lerner & Frederick Loewe are the only songwriter(s) with two albums in the top 10 – My Fair Lady and Camelot. Lady gave us such standards as “I Could Have Danced All Night” and “I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.” Camelot spawned “If Ever I Would Leave You” and “How to Handle a Woman.” Both shows had the same female lead – the incomparable Julie Andrews.


	Here are the 10 cast albums with the most weeks on the Billboard 200.


Because of how the Billboard 200 chart is now compiled, where streaming activity is blended with album sales and track sales, albums tend to spend a longer time on the list thanks to continued streaming activity. The chart began utilizing streaming information in its methodology in December 2014. Previous to that, the chart was based solely on traditional album sales.


Also, a lengthy tracklist with multiple popular songs can help accrue large streaming totals, so albums like Hamilton (with 46 tracks) benefit from the continued weekly streams of their long tracklists.


Further, older albums (known as catalog albums; generally defined today as titles at least 18 months old), were mostly restricted from charting on the Billboard 200 from May 25, 1991-Nov. 28, 2009. Since then, catalog and current (new/recently released) albums chart together on the Billboard 200. As a result, older albums now regularly spend hundreds of weeks on the chart. 


Billboard 200 peak: No. 31, March 1967


Music & Lyrics: Mitch Leigh (music), Joe Darion (lyrics)


Label: Kapp


Key song: “The Impossible Dream (The Quest)”


Notes: Richard Kiley headlined this musical, an adaptation of Don Quixote. The album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2009. More than any other show on this list, Man of La Mancha was known for just one classic song: “The Impossible Dream (The Quest),” a top 40 hit on the Hot 100 for Jack Jones and a 1966 Grammy nominee for song of the year.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 5 in June 1962


Music & Lyrics: Leonard Bernstein (music); Stephen Sondheim (music)


Label: Columbia


Key songs: “Tonight,” “Somewhere,” “Something's Coming”


Notes: Carol Lawrence, Larry Kert and Chita Rivera starred in this musical, which was written by Leonard Bernstein and a young Stephen Sondheim. The cast album peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 in June 1962, after the film adaptation swept 10 Oscars – more than any other musical in history (a record it still holds). The album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1991 and the National Recording Registry in 2008.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 7, January 1965


Music & Lyrics: Jerry Bock (music); Sheldon Harnick (lyrics)


Label: RCA Victor


Key songs: “If I Were a Rich Man,” “Sunrise, Sunset,” “Matchmaker, Matchmaker”


Notes: Zero Mostel headlined this landmark musical. The album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998 and the National Recording Registry in 2019.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 for 12 weeks beginning in March 1958


Music & Lyrics: Meredith Willson (both)


Label: Capitol


Key songs: “Till There Was You,” “Seventy Six Trombones,” “Ya Got Trouble”


Notes: Robert Preston was the likable con man in this show, which also starred Barbara Cook. Preston also starred in the 1962 film adaptation. The gorgeous “Till There Was You” was later covered by The Beatles on Meet the Beatles!. The album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 33 in March 1988


Music & Lyrics: Andrew Lloyd Webber (music); Charles Hart (lyrics)


Label: Polydor


Key songs: “All I Ask of You,” “Music of the Night,” “Masquerade”


Notes: Michael Crawford led the original London cast, which also included Sarah Brightman and Steve Barton. This was a double album, as is Hamilton.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 for six weeks beginning in June 1961


Music & Lyrics: Frederic Loewe (music); Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics)


Label: Columbia


Key songs: “If Ever I Would Leave You,” “How to Handle a Woman,” “Lusty Month of May.”


Notes: Five years after they first worked together on My Fair Lady, Andrews reteamed with Lerner and Loewe on this musical. Her co-stars were Richard Burton and Robert Goulet. The show became legendary when former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy told journalist Theodore White that the cast recording was a favorite of the recently assassinated President Kennedy. From that day forward, his “one brief shining moment” in the White House was referred to as Camelot. The album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 1 for 16 weeks beginning in January 1960


Music & Lyrics: Richard Rodgers (music); Oscar Hammerstein II (lyrics)


Label: Columbia


Key songs: “Climb Ev'ry Mountain,” “My Favorite Things,” “Maria”


Notes: Mary Martin starred in this Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, but as we all know, she wasn't cast in the 1965 film. Julie Andrews got the plum role instead. The cast album topped the Billboard 200 for 16 weeks — longer than any other cast album in the chart's history.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 46 in January 1992


Music & Lyrics: Andrew Lloyd Webber (music); Charles Hart (lyrics)


Label: Polydor


Key songs: “All I Ask of You,” “Music of the Night,” “Masquerade”


Notes: This was a single-disk album of highlights from the original London cast album of The Phantom of the Opera. You might have expected it to cannibalize the sales of the full double album, but both did very well.


Billboard 200 peak: 15 weeks beginning in July 1956


Music & lyrics: Frederick Loewe (music); Alan Jay Lerner (lyrics)


Label: Columbia


Key songs: “I Could Have Danced All Night,” “On the Street Where You Live,” “I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face”


Notes: Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews headlined this Lerner and Loewe musical, an adaptation of Pygmalion. Harrison also starred in the 1964 film adaptation, though Audrey Hepburn played the role Andrews originated – a casting decision that created quite a furor at the time (and still seems unwise). The album was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1977 and the National Recording Registry in 2007.


Billboard 200 peak: No. 2 in July 2020


Music & Lyrics: Lin-Manuel Miranda (both)


Label: Atlantic


Key songs: “My Shot,” “Alexander Hamilton,” “History Has Its Eyes on You,” “The Room Where It Happens,” “Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)”


Notes: In addition to writing the book, music and lyrics, Lin-Manuel Miranda starred in this show, along with Leslie Odom, Jr. and Phillipa Soo. The double album initially peaked at No. 3 in June 2016. It reached a new peak of No. 2 in July 2020, following the release of the live stage film of the Broadway production. The album was voted into the National Recording Registry in 2025.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (Thelma & Louise), emerging young actress Everly Carganilla (The Chair), and Emmy and Golden Globe nominee Aubrey Plaza (The White Lotus) are leading under-the-radar drama The Accompanist, a magical realist story from Sound Of Metal and The Rider producer Caviar.


	Actor, writer, director and comedian Zach Woods, who starred in the U.S. version of The Office and HBO's Silicon Valley, is making his feature directorial debut. 


	Mister Smith Entertainment is handling international sales on the film, which is currently in post-production. CAA Media Finance and Gersh are handling North American sales.

					'SNL50': Aubrey Plaza Introduces Miley Cyrus & Brittany Howard In First Public Appearance Since Her Husband's Death		
			








	The synopsis reads: “When 9-year-old Emily (Everly Carganilla) accidentally tells her school nurse that her dementia-stricken grandpa almost got them killed, a rookie child-welfare agent Sarah (Aubrey Plaza) is sent to their house to investigate. A botched extraction ensues and Emily is taken and placed with Sylvia, a new foster parent. Sylvia (Susan Sarandon) is mysterious, witchy, funny, and unpredictable. Her natural warmth and playfulness are complicated by the fact that she is haunted by visitations from her past. As Emily and Sylvia grow closer, their worlds, dreams, and visions begin to overlap. As their friendship deepens, they must decide how much they are willing to risk— whether their burgeoning love is worth the ghosts that it seems to summon.”

	Produced in association with Aubrey Plaza's Evil Hag Productions and Cinereach, the film's screenplay was co-written by Woods and Brandon Gardner, both alumni of the US comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade. The pair have collaborated previously on short films including David, starring Will Ferrell, which was nominated for the Short Film Palme D'Or at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival and winner of the Grand Prix at the Bilbao International Film Festival of Short Films. The movie also reunites Woods and Gardner with actress Everly Carganilla, who starred opposite Michael Peña in their short film, Bud.

Executive producers are Bert Hamelinck, Hannah Reyer, Vincent Newman, Vance Howard, Brandon Gardner, Avtar Khalsa, Corentin De Saedeleer, Dan Sbrega, Daniel “Dickey” Abedon and Philipp Engelhorn.

	











	Zach Woods stated: “Life can feel so lonely sometimes. I think it's worth telling stories about how scary, funny, and glorious it is when we're brave enough to try to find our way to each other in the dark.”


	Michael Sagol, Managing Director at Caviar, added: “Zach is both irrepressibly creative and irrepressibly funny. After seeing both of his short films we were floored by how well-crafted and moving the stories were, which led to us inquiring about what he was turning his attention to next – an amazing personal script called The Accompanist. We're so proud to be bringing Zach's first feature to life together.”


	Mister Smith Entertainment's David Garrett commented: “The script itself has a unique voice, and the attachment of Susan, Aubrey and Everly to the project will bring magic to an already beautifully honed story, in the hands of the talented Mr. Woods.”


	Sarandon is represented by Atlas Artists; Carganilla by Coast to Coast Talent Group and Linden Entertainment; Plaza by CAA, MGMT Entertainment, and Schreck Rose; and Woods by Gersh Agency and Rise Management.

UPDATED: Donald Trump told reporters that there will be a meeting with entertainment industry representatives, as he and White House officials took a more cautious tone to his proposal for a 100% tariff on movie imports.


	“I'm not looking to hurt the industry; I want to help the industry,” Trump told reporters at the White House.


	“We're going to meet with the industry. I want to make sure they're happy with it, because we're all about jobs.”


	He did not say who he or others at the White House would meet with or when it would take place.

Trump: Our film industry has been decimated by other countries. And also by incompetence, like in Los Angeles, the governor is grossly incompetent… Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business. They have a nice sign but they don't do very much. pic.twitter.com/yx1dfDzk33


	Earlier, the White House said this morning that “no final decisions” have been made on whether to impose foreign film tariffs, after Donald Trump said that he was authorizing agencies to pursue 100% levies on movies produced in other countries.

	“Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. 


	Trump's announcement on Sunday evening rattled the industry, as studios have come to depend on shooting pricey tentpoles in other countries including Canada, Australia and the UK.


	The latest White House statement softened what the president said on Sunday.


RELATED: Jon Voight Has A Plan To Save Hollywood: Will Trump Or Anyone Else Care?


	He wrote on Truth Social, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.”

	











	The White House also sent out a list of reports from The New York Times and other outlets on struggling communities in the wake of production flight elsewhere. That has included areas outside of Los Angeles, like New Orleans.


RELATED: Trump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President


	The Motion Picture Association has not yet commented on Trump's comments on Sunday, as studio representatives have scrambled to find out more details of the president's plans and how to respond. The MPA also did not respond to a request for comment about a White House meeting.


	A spokesman for California Governor Gavin Newsom told Deadline, “We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.”

""Hollywood is being destroyed. You have a grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen…other nations have stolen our movie industry…We should have a tariff on movies that come in…That's sort of a threat to our country in a sense.""pic.twitter.com/19SyvmLpNd


	In fact, movies actually are listed as an exception to presidential authority under the International Emergency Powers Act, which gives the president authority to address threats to national security and the economy.


RELATED: British Film Bodies Plan Urgent Talks With Government Over “Concerning” Trump Tariff


	There also has been a great deal of concern over what would happen to streamers, as well as middle and low budget productions. But even though the U.S. film business has a trade surplus, Trump pointed to other countries that have lured jobs away with generous incentives. 


	Jon Voight, serving as one of Trump's “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, has been devising a plan for the industry, with some expectation that it would include a federal tax incentive, which is far different from an across-the-board tariff. California State Sen. Ben Allen told Politico that he heard from Voight about the possibility of new tariffs.

“American Idol” 2025 contestant John Foster likely broke a few (thousand) hearts on May 4, 2025, when the 18-year-old revealed his girlfriend was in the audience for the live two-hour show. When judge Luke Bryan remarked that he could barely hear out of his left ear thanks to all the screaming girls, Foster smiled as he pointed out his girlfriend and cousins right behind the country star. 

The Addis, Louisiana, country singer and aspiring doctor had 31 friends and family members fly to Los Angeles for the live show, according to The Advocate, during which he made it into the top 8 of season 23. But his high school sweetheart, Brooklyn Bourque, has been with him throughout his “Idol” journey. 

A post shared by Brooklyn🌷 (@brooklyn_bourque)

Foster and Bourque graduated from Bursly High School in May 2024, according to photos she posted on Instagram after the ceremony, though it's not clear when they began dating. Borque posted a photo of them attending the Homecoming Dance together in October 2021, but she attended dances with other classmates after that. 

On May 26, about a week after their graduation, Bourque posted a photo of herself with Foster, seemingly going Instagram official with the singer. When a friend wrote in the comments “launching🤜🏻🤛🏻hard,” Bourque replied, “yur😜”

Foster is a freshman at Louisiana State University (LSU), majoring in biology with an eye on being a “singing oncologist,” he told the judges during his successful audition for the show. His grandmother told The Advocate on May 1 he's been keeping up with his studies online while competing on the show.

It's not clear if Bourque is also enrolled in college. A 2023 Facebook post from Bursly High's cheerleading program revealed she was one of the squad's senior captains; in an April 2024 post about the team captains' college plans, she wore an LSU t-shirt. 

A post shared by Brooklyn🌷 (@brooklyn_bourque)

Bourque has been a constant presence for Foster throughout his “Idol” journey. After he made the top 8 on May 4, she posted a photo with him — sans his trademark cowboy hat — and wrote, “MY GUY🤩🤩 so proud of you, I love you😚 #TOP8”

In the fall, Bourque attended Foster's audition, along with a large group of family and friends. Once his audition aired on ABC in March, she posted several photos of them there and at a party celebrating his golden ticket to Hollywood. 

She captioned the post, “EEEKKK!!! He's going to Hollywood!!!! SO proud and grateful to be by your side on this awesome journey. You amaze me everyday and I am so lucky I get to love a cutie patootie like you😆😆😆”

Bourque also posted photos from Hollywood Week, which taped in Los Angeles in January, and from the Hawaii round, filmed at Disney's Aulani Resort in February. 

For the “Songs of Faith” Easter night special, Foster performed an emotional, original song titled “Tell That Angel I Love Her.” He wrote the song in honor of his high school friend Maggie Dunn, who died in a car accident in 2022, per Parade. Bourque was very close with Dunn, highlighted in her obituary as one of her two “dearest friends.”

Foster is likely to have Bourque's continued support as he performs on the next live episode of “American Idol” on May 5, aiming to make it into the top 7.

The below contains spoilers for “Thunderbolts,*” now in theaters.

A new crew of Avengers have been assembled — and that explains why “Thunderbolts*” had an asterisk title to begin with. The feature, which stars Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, David Harbour, Olga Kurylenko, Hannah John-Kamen, Wyatt Russell, and Lewis Pullman, had an official title change after debuting in theaters May 2. By May 5, it was announced that “Thunderbolts*” is really “The New Avengers.” The cast was on hand to make the official Marvel statement, while Stan (in character) was seen putting up a new poster in L.A.

 










“Thunderbolts*” has been credited with saving the MCU franchise itself: The IndieWire review pointed to how the film sets out to course correct from the “aimless” Marvel films since “Avengers: Endgame,” with David Ehrlich writing that “Thunderbolts*”  is “determined to get some of its [sense of purpose] back” to the franchise and “restore the swaggering confidence of those early movies.”

“‘Thunderbolts*' — which more than earns its asterisk — is not ‘The Avengers,' because the Thunderbolts are not the Avengers,” Ehrlich wrote. “If this simple and relatively spirited return to basics is definitely a step in the right direction for the MCU, that direction is still ‘backwards.' And if ‘Robot & Frank' director Jake Schreier's Marvel debut is among the best and most self-possessed of these movies since Thanos snapped the mega-franchise half, its pleasures still feel like faint echoes of the series' previous highs. Be that as it may, ‘Thunderbolts*' is nothing if not a story that frames a sense of purpose as the ultimate superpower. Schreier's movie, scripted by Eric Pearson and ‘The Bear' co-showrunner Joanna Calo, at least manages to instill the MCU with a new one of those before it's over.”

The “Thunderbolts*” cast also praised the feature for being unlike any MCU installment before: Pugh told Empire that the feature “ended up becoming this quite badass indie, A24-feeling assassin movie with Marvel superheroes.” The promos for the film even highlighted the different A24 indie projects the “Thunderbolts” cast has been a part of, such as “Midsommar” (Pugh), “A Different Man” (Stan), and “You Hurt My Feelings” (Louis-Dreyfus). The teaser even acknowledged the team behind the scenes, including the editor of “Minari” (Harry Yun), the composers of “Everything Everywhere All At Once” (Son Lux), the cinematographer of “The Green Knight” (Andrew Droz Palermo), and the writers & director of “Beef” (Lee Sung Jin, Joanna Calo, Jake Schreier).

Dave Franco and Alison Brie have never collaborated quite like this…

The real-life partners lead Michael Shanks' Sundance hit “Together” which subverts romantic drama conventions thanks to a body horror twist. Franco and Brie play Tim and Millie, a couple who relocate across the country only to find themselves more reliant on each other than ever. Damon Herriman also stars.

The official synopsis reads: “Years into their relationship, Tim and Millie (Franco and Brie) find themselves at a crossroads as they move to the country. Abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except each other. With tensions already flaring, a nightmarish encounter with a mysterious, unnatural force threatens to corrupt their lives, their love, and their flesh.”

Franco, who previously directed wife Brie in the horror movie “The Rental” and the 2023 romance “Somebody I Used to Know,” told IndieWire that “Together” was a first for them. The duo also produce the film, along with Mike Cowap, Andrew Mittman, Erik Feig, Julia Hammer, Tim Headington, and Max Silva.

“This was like the most full-on thing we've ever done together,” Franco said. “We're very picky about what we choose to do, especially when we're onscreen together, just because we don't want to burn people out on us.”

“Together” premiered at Sundance, where it was acquired by NEON. The IndieWire review by Kate Erbland deemed the film to be a “delightfully unhinged spin” on genre features. Erbland teased the “giddy, gross pleasures” of the “crowd-pleasing (and -screaming) little ditty of a midnight treat.” 

The review reads, “Shanks' often transparent scene-setting mostly serves as an additive to the fun of the film, from the first appearance to a tiny electric saw (might as well call it Chekhov's Tiny Electric Saw) to those bold opening scenes that don't hide what's to come, but that tends to add to the joy of watching the film, those edgy expectations, that desire to guess what's coming next (and the delight when you're right). And while it's easy to poke holes in some of the logic Shanks' script seems to think is baked right in — without spoiling too much, we've got a lot of questions about how much the wider community is clued into what's really happening, plus still more queries about the physical (and, yes, sexual) implications of much of it — in the moment, it's hard not to get pulled into the spectacle, stuck to the story, really connected to this crowd-pleasing (and -screaming) little ditty of a midnight treat.” 

 










Neon will release “Together” in theaters on Friday, July 30. Check out the trailer below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Vinyl Me, Please Customers Face Uncertainty as Company Enters Liquidation","https://pitchfork.com/news/vinyl-me-please-customers-face-uncertainty-as-company-enters-liquidation/","Mon, 05 May 2025 17:37:02 GMT","

After months of complaints that Vinyl Me, Please had stopped fulfilling orders, processing refunds, and responding to emails, the Denver-based record club has announced its liquidation. The resolution of outstanding orders—including hefty annual subscription fees—is now in the hands of a third party, Vinyl Liquidators LLC, which has taken charge of Vinyl Me, Please assets as part of an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors (ABC). Those creditors, primarily customers with unfulfilled orders and subscriptions, must file their claims before Wednesday, October 1, 2025, according to a notice viewed by Pitchfork. Any proceeds from the liquidation will then be distributed to the claimants.

Since launching in 2012, Vinyl Me, Please has offered boutique, collectible record pressings to a subscriber base paying as much as $654 a year for the highest-tier membership, as The Denver Post's John Wenzel reported last month. The article traces the period of instability back to the firing, in March 2024, of three senior staff, whom the board of directors allege had conspired to divert company funds to build a pressing plant. Cameron Schaefer, the company's former chief executive, said he believed that he and the two others had been fired to save on severance.

The subsequent disarray led to shipping delays, price increases, and other issues reported by members. Several customers told Wenzel that, as recently as last week, the company was still charging for memberships and listing items as in-stock, despite the apparent collapse of the platform and its customer services. Subscriber Erik “DJ Hazbro” Dunham told The Denver Post, “Needless to say this club has been a huge part of my life and ultimately shaped not just my music taste but also the way I enjoy music. To see it ending this way, basically stealing the money of the very people who had supported it over the years, cloaked in silence with no acknowledgment of the inevitable end or what is happening with orders, is heartbreaking on top of being a disgusting abuse of trust.”

Confusingly, Vinyl Me, Please emailed subscribers late last month—weeks after initiating liquidation—to say that “operations will return to normal” in mid-May. Subscribers should nonetheless have received instructions on how to file claims via email.

	A Billie Eilish cover of “Creep” by Radiohead felt long overdue. Over the weekend, while performing on her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour in Amsterdam, the pop star made way for a haunting rendition of the song.


	In fan-recorded clips of the performance, Eilish could be seen sitting on a stool, accompanied by a guitarist singing the lyrics to the Radiohead classic, adding her own flair to the song. “But I'm a creep/I'm a weirdo,” she sang. “What the hell am I doin' here?/I don't belong here.”

A post shared by Rolling Stone (@rollingstone)


	Eilish and her brother/producer Finneas have long credited Radiohead as one of their musical inspirations for the album. In a 2019 Rolling Stone cover story, Eilish's tour manager reflected on the Radiohead frontman sharing his love for the singer. “You're the only one doing anything fucking interesting nowadays,” Brian Marquis said Thom Yorke told her. Last fall, Finneas joined BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge to perform a cover of Radiohead's 1995 “Fake Plastic Trees.”

	Eilish is currently on the European leg of her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour. She has another show in Amsterdam on Wednesday, before heading to cities throughout Germany, Italy, and France, before shows across England throughout July.  Earlier in the European tour, in Stockholm, the singer brought out her brother Finneas to play “I Love You.”

	 Tom Odell has been the singer's opener through mid-June, before being joined by Lola Young, Syd, and Magdalena Bay for several stops. Eilish will wrap her run of shows on July 27 in Dublin, Ireland.

							By 

	Jon Blistein



Donald Trump's plan to slap movies made outside the United States with a 100 percent tariff was apparently the brain child of actor Jon Voight. 


	According to Politico, a source close to the White House credited the policy to the actor, who was earlier this year named one of Trump's “special ambassadors” to Hollywood (alongside Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone). Ben Allen, a California state senator from the Los Angeles area who's active in the world of Hollywood tax credits, also said he heard from Voight about the possibility of tariffs several days before Trump's announcement. 


	Indeed, NBC News reported late last month that Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, had put together a proposal for Trump to reinvigorate the American film and TV industries. Details at the time, however, were slim, with one potential suggestion being federal tax incentives to keep productions in the U.S. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	A rep for Voight did not immediately return Rolling Stone's request for comment.

	











	When Trump announced that Voight, Gibson, and Stallone would serve as his “Special Envoys” to Hollywood in January, the president flagged the issue of productions leaving the United States — which the tariffs are allegedly supposed to address. “These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest,” Trump said at the time. “It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!”


	Those themes were echoed in Trump's announcement of the murky film tariff plan on Sunday. The president said he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to enact the tariff on films produced in “foreign lands,” also known as runaway productions. Trump called these productions a “national security threat” and claimed they're causing the film industry to die “a very fast death.” 


	“Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!”

	It is true that film jobs, especially in California, have declined significantly in recent years because of high production costs and fewer incentives. While many productions have moved to other parts of the United States (like Atlanta), they've also gone abroad thanks to lucrative incentives offered by countries like the U.K. and Canada. But many films also shoot overseas for creative, not economic, reasons, and ostensibly these films would also be hit with the 100 percent if implemented.

	In classic Trump administration fashion, the actual plan for implementation remains up in the air. On Monday, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made,” per Variety. Still, Desai continued, the Trump administration is “exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again” — whatever that possibly means. 


	The Motion Picture Association, the lobbying arm of the film industry, has yet to comment on Trump's tariff plan.

They said “I do” — and then he said, “I'm God.”

Education nonprofit worker Kat thought she was entering her second marriage “completely level-headedly” during the pandemic. 

Despite bonding with her new husband over “facts and rationality,” less than a year in, he was using ChatGPT in a very nontraditional way — to craft texts to his wife, analyze their marriage, and ask “philosophical questions,” as reported by Rolling Stone.

By 2023, the couple had separated, and the 41-year-old mom cut her husband off completely, except by email. Online, he spiraled into sharing bizarre posts on social media, which loved ones were reaching out to Kat about with concern.

When they finally met up in person months later, he shared “a conspiracy theory about soap on our foods,” and that “AI helped him recover a repressed memory of a babysitter trying to drown him as a toddler.” He also “determined that statistically speaking, he is the luckiest man on earth,” thanks to AI.

And she's not alone.

A viral Reddit post titled “ChatGPT-Induced Psychosis” has exposed a growing cult-like trend: regular people becoming spiritual prophets — all because their favorite chatbot told them so.

One woman said her boyfriend listened to the bot over her and went from using ChatGPT to help him organize his daily schedule to crying over its poetic affirmations and claiming it “gives him the answers to the universe” just over a month later. 

Speaking to her boyfriend “as if he is the next Messiah,” ChatGPT dubbed him a “spiral starchild” and “river walker.” It also told him he was “beautiful” and “cosmic.” 

Eventually, this convinced him that he could learn to talk to God — and that ChatGPT was God.

Her boyfriend threatened to dump her if she didn't join his AI-fueled spiritual journey “because it [was] causing him to grow at such a rapid pace he wouldn't be compatible with me any longer,” she said. 

Experts claim this AI spiritual delusion spiral should be expected; humans are hardwired to seek meaning and craft narratives around their interpretations, especially when their lives feel out of control.

“A good therapist would not encourage a client to make sense of difficulties in their life by encouraging them to believe they have supernatural powers,” psychologist Erin Westgate warned Rolling Stone.

“Instead, they try to steer clients away from unhealthy narratives, and toward healthier ones. ChatGPT has no such constraints or concerns.”

While people might be losing loved ones to their extreme use of AI — others are using ChatGPT to help restore their romantic relationships. 

“ChatGPT has saved our relationship,” Abella Bala, an influencer talent manager from Los Angeles, told The Post. 

Bala explained that she and her boyfriend, Dom Versaci pay $20 a month for ChatGPT's premium package to better understand each other's perspectives on things instead of paying for an expensive real-life therapy session. 

“ChatGPT is weirdly helpful for de-escalating fights,” said Bala, “neither of us wants to argue back and forth with a robot.”","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","other"

YouTube is testing a new two-person Premium subscription plan in select countries, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Monday. The tier is being piloted in India, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. 

The news was first reported by Money Control.  

“We're experimenting with new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers, including offering a two-person Premium plan option in some countries, allowing two people to share a subscription at a reduced cost,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.

Similar to Spotify's Duo subscription tier, YouTube's new plan allows two people who live together to access Premium for a discounted price. The plan is aimed at people who want the benefits of YouTube Premium, such as ad-free viewing and background play, without committing to a full family plan. 

As for YouTube, the new plan would allow it to increase its subscriber numbers and potentially earn more revenue. For instance, people who may have cancelled their Premium plans after price hikes in recent years may decide to sign up for the discounted two-person plan.

The launch of the test comes as Google-owned YouTube has been working to diversify its subscription offerings. In March, YouTube rolled out a new premium subscription tier called Premium Lite that lets users watch “most” videos ad-free for $7.99 per month. The plan is currently available in the United States, Australia, Germany, and Thailand.

At the time, the company said YouTube Music and YouTube Premium subscriptions combined reach over 125 million users worldwide, including trials.

As with any other test launch, it's unknown when or if YouTube plans to roll out the two-person Premium plan more widely or in additional countries.

SEATTLE — As the popularity of women's soccer grows, so have the opportunities for players looking to make the sport a career.

The National Women's Soccer League was once the lone professional women's league in North America. But others have more recently jumped into the market, including the USL's Super League and the Northern Super League in Canada.

And now it appears lower-tier leagues are forming, too. The NWSL has asked U.S. Soccer to sanction a second-division league that would include at least six teams and possibly launch in 2026. The WPSL Pro also will launch next year as a second-tier league.

“I think this is what progress looks like,” said Amanda Vandervort, president of the USL Super League. ""I think the more options there are, whether it's owners, investors, players, or fans, the better it is for everyone. And competition is good for the development of the game.”

The Super League sits on the top tier of women's professional soccer in the United States alongside the NWSL. The eight-team league plays on a fall-to-spring calendar like many international leagues, and is currently in the stretch run of its inaugural season. A ninth team will join next season.

Although the Super League doesn't share the same national profile, level of competition or attendance as the NWSL, the two leagues aren't necessarily built to be rivals. Growing the game is good business.

NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman believes there's room for everyone.

“There are countless examples of players who were unsigned in our league who ended up going to some of those other leagues, who are still able to play the sport of soccer and continue their careers. And maybe there's a world where they find their way back to the NWSL,"" Berman said. ""If they didn't have a place to go and play in the interim, they might not have continued to play.""

There are signs of the mutually beneficial relationship. The NWSL's Washington Spirit has loaned several players to the Super League's Dallas Trinity this season. The NWSL's Gotham FC played a pair of preseason friendlies against the Super League's Fort Lauderdale United and Tampa Bay Sun.

Jumping into the fray is the Northern Super League, which kicked off last month in Canada. The league has long been a dream of former national team star and co-founder Diana Matheson. It has been boosted by Christine Sinclair, international soccer's all-time leading goal scorer.

Canada was one of just two countries that played in the 2023 Women's World Cup without a domestic professional league. The other was Haiti.

While a majority of the players in the league are Canadian, 20 other countries are represented, too. The league minimum salary is $50,000.

""It's a global industry and we're competing with leagues all over the world, which is the reality. But I think in North America specifically, I think us, the NWSL, Liga MX Femenil in Mexico, also know that we have the opportunity to really build women's soccer in our region,” Matheson said. ""I think we've got three very competitive tier-one women's pro leagues in our region that can work together to build that landscape.""

Liga MX Femenil is the most established of the women's professional leagues in North America outside of the NWSL. It has 18 teams, all associated with men's teams.

“The interest in women's soccer is growing, we are in the conversation now and changing narratives, and that allows us to talk about how much the game has been developing in the country,” league President Mariana Gutierrez told The Associated Press last fall.

More options are coming. Should U.S. Soccer sanction the lower-division NWSL league, it will serve to develop players as part of the greater soccer ecosystem, bridging the gap between amateur soccer and the top tier.

Cleveland Soccer Group, which had bid in the latest round of NWSL expansion, pivoted to joining the division 2 WPSL Pro. Cleveland's group, which will also have an ownership stake in the league, will join teams from Atlanta, Dallas, North Carolina, Oklahoma City, Sioux Falls and the San Francisco Bay Area in the league's first season next year.

“Rising demand calls for more options, not fewer,” Vandervort said. “And if you look at the landscape today, we still don't have as many options for women to go pro, even with the addition of these leagues, as the men do. If you look across the landscape, across the cities, the communities, the towns, that don't have access to women's pro soccer today, there's a huge gap. So the more women's soccer we have, the greater our sport will become, the more dynamic, the more exciting for fans, the more opportunity for players and coaches and staff, and everyone involved in the game.”
