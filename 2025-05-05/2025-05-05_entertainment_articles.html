                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Billie Eilish cover of “Creep” by Radiohead felt long overdue. Eilish and her brother/producer Finneas have long credited Radiohead as one of their musical inspirations for the album. “You're the only one doing anything fucking interesting nowadays,” Brian Marquis said Thom Yorke told her. Last fall, Finneas joined BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge to perform a cover of Radiohead's 1995 “Fake Plastic Trees.” Lady Gaga Performs to Record-Breaking Crowd at Rio's Copacabana Beach Elon Musk: It Is ‘Outrageous' to ‘Claim That I'm a Nazi' Trump White House Engages in 'Star Wars' Cosplay to Demonize Immigrants Eilish is currently on the European leg of her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour. Tom Odell has been the singer's opener through mid-June, before being joined by Lola Young, Syd, and Magdalena Bay for several stops. Eilish will wrap her run of shows on July 27 in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAG-AFTRA's national executive director and chief negotiator has weighed in on President Donald Trump's idea to apply tariffs to films produced outside the U.S. — and signaled an open mind about it. Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the staff leader of the 160,000-strong performers' union, said in a statement on Monday that “SAG-AFTRA supports efforts to increase movie, television and streaming production in the United States.” Crabtree-Ireland noted that the union will continue to “advocate for policies that strengthen our competitive position, accelerate economic growth and create good middle class jobs for American workers.” California, Once a Mecca for Animation Work, Is Rapidly Losing Ground, Report Claims At the time, Trump called for a “100% tariff” on “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” Still, Hollywood industry leaders, including some in labor, have been reeling following Trump's Sunday announcement. Several unions had been working on potential legislation to create a federal tax incentive for U.S.-produced projects and were focused on that effort when Trump's tariffs message came through. The lack of clarity around what this tariff could even look like have left industry types scrambling for answers and concerned about potential unintended consequences in a highly international industry. Even so, Trump's assertion arrives at a time when there is broad concern about the state of domestic production. Still, content spend in the U.S. was down 26 percent in 2024 compared with 2022 levels and executives cited the U.K., Vancouver, Central Europe and Australia as their top preferred filming locations for 2025-2026.

Alex Warren's “Ordinary” ascends a spot to No. Meanwhile, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” scores a 16th week atop the Billboard Global Excl. Elsewhere, WizTheMC earns his first top 10 on both tallies with “Show Me Love.” U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States. Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations. “Ordinary” crowns the Global 200 with 82.5 million streams and 6,000 sold worldwide April 25-May 1. The song by the Carlsbad, Calif., native became a viral hit, boosted by his performance of it in March on Netflix's Love Is Blind. It has since topped 11 charts in Billboard's Hits of the World menu, spent seven weeks and counting atop the Official UK Singles chart and hit No. 2, as of this week, on the U.S.-based Billboard Hot 100. “Die With a Smile” drops to No. 2 after 18 weeks atop the Global 200 beginning last September (second only to the 19 weeks at No. The rest of the ranking's top five holds in place: ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” at No. 1 starting in November; Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” at No. 1 last August; and Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” at No. 5, after it logged seven weeks on top in February-April 2024. WizTheMC's “Show Me Love” soars 19-10 on the Global 200 with 37 million streams (up 22%) and 1,000 sold (up 13%) worldwide. The track by the South African-German multihyphenate, based in Toronto, became his first Billboard chart entry in March. It concurrently bounds 11-6 on Global Excl.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I want to make sure they're happy with it, because we're all about jobs.” Trump: Our film industry has been decimated by other countries. And also by incompetence, like in Los Angeles, the governor is grossly incompetent… Hollywood doesn't do very much of that business. Earlier, the White House said this morning that “no final decisions” have been made on whether to impose foreign film tariffs, after Donald Trump said that he was authorizing agencies to pursue 100% levies on movies produced in other countries. RELATED: Media Stocks Hit After Trump's Bombshell Plan To Tax Films Produced Outside U.S. – “Studios Carry A Significant Amount Of Risk” “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. Trump's announcement on Sunday evening rattled the industry, as studios have come to depend on shooting pricey tentpoles in other countries including Canada, Australia and the UK. RELATED: Jon Voight Has A Plan To Save Hollywood: Will Trump Or Anyone Else Care? He wrote on Truth Social, “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” That has included areas outside of Los Angeles, like New Orleans. RELATED: Trump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President The Motion Picture Association has not yet commented on Trump's comments on Sunday, as studio representatives have scrambled to find out more details of the president's plans and how to respond. A spokesman for California Governor Gavin Newsom told Deadline, “We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.” RELATED: British Film Bodies Plan Urgent Talks With Government Over “Concerning” Trump Tariff But even though the U.S. film business has a trade surplus, Trump pointed to other countries that have lured jobs away with generous incentives. Jon Voight, serving as one of Trump's “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, has been devising a plan for the industry, with some expectation that it would include a federal tax incentive, which is far different from an across-the-board tariff. California State Sen. Ben Allen told Politico that he heard from Voight about the possibility of new tariffs. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of complaints that Vinyl Me, Please had stopped fulfilling orders, processing refunds, and responding to emails, the Denver-based record club has announced its liquidation. Those creditors, primarily customers with unfulfilled orders and subscriptions, must file their claims before Wednesday, October 1, 2025, according to a notice viewed by Pitchfork. Cameron Schaefer, the company's former chief executive, said he believed that he and the two others had been fired to save on severance. The subsequent disarray led to shipping delays, price increases, and other issues reported by members. Subscriber Erik “DJ Hazbro” Dunham told The Denver Post, “Needless to say this club has been a huge part of my life and ultimately shaped not just my music taste but also the way I enjoy music. To see it ending this way, basically stealing the money of the very people who had supported it over the years, cloaked in silence with no acknowledgment of the inevitable end or what is happening with orders, is heartbreaking on top of being a disgusting abuse of trust.” Confusingly, Vinyl Me, Please emailed subscribers late last month—weeks after initiating liquidation—to say that “operations will return to normal” in mid-May. Subscribers should nonetheless have received instructions on how to file claims via email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When judge Luke Bryan remarked that he could barely hear out of his left ear thanks to all the screaming girls, Foster smiled as he pointed out his girlfriend and cousins right behind the country star. Foster and Bourque graduated from Bursly High School in May 2024, according to photos she posted on Instagram after the ceremony, though it's not clear when they began dating. Borque posted a photo of them attending the Homecoming Dance together in October 2021, but she attended dances with other classmates after that. Foster is a freshman at Louisiana State University (LSU), majoring in biology with an eye on being a “singing oncologist,” he told the judges during his successful audition for the show. It's not clear if Bourque is also enrolled in college. A 2023 Facebook post from Bursly High's cheerleading program revealed she was one of the squad's senior captains; in an April 2024 post about the team captains' college plans, she wore an LSU t-shirt. Bourque has been a constant presence for Foster throughout his “Idol” journey. After he made the top 8 on May 4, she posted a photo with him — sans his trademark cowboy hat — and wrote, “MY GUY🤩🤩 so proud of you, I love you😚 #TOP8” In the fall, Bourque attended Foster's audition, along with a large group of family and friends. Once his audition aired on ABC in March, she posted several photos of them there and at a party celebrating his golden ticket to Hollywood. SO proud and grateful to be by your side on this awesome journey. For the “Songs of Faith” Easter night special, Foster performed an emotional, original song titled “Tell That Angel I Love Her.” He wrote the song in honor of his high school friend Maggie Dunn, who died in a car accident in 2022, per Parade. Foster is likely to have Bourque's continued support as he performs on the next live episode of “American Idol” on May 5, aiming to make it into the top 7.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's plan to slap movies made outside the United States with a 100 percent tariff was apparently the brain child of actor Jon Voight. Indeed, NBC News reported late last month that Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, had put together a proposal for Trump to reinvigorate the American film and TV industries. “These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest,” Trump said at the time. Those themes were echoed in Trump's announcement of the murky film tariff plan on Sunday. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding: “This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” It is true that film jobs, especially in California, have declined significantly in recent years because of high production costs and fewer incentives. While many productions have moved to other parts of the United States (like Atlanta), they've also gone abroad thanks to lucrative incentives offered by countries like the U.K. and Canada. But many films also shoot overseas for creative, not economic, reasons, and ostensibly these films would also be hit with the 100 percent if implemented.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emmy nominee Mandy Moore (This Is Us) has found her next major role in The Breadwinner, a TriStar Pictures comedy in which she'll star opposite top comic Nate Bargatze, Deadline has learned. Marking Bargatze's feature film acting debut, the film sees Nate's supermom wife, Katie, land a deal on Shark Tank. Subsequently, the lifelong breadwinner of the family becomes a stay-at-home dad and quickly realizes he's in way over his head. Bargatze and Dan Lagana penned the script, with TriStar preemptively acquiring the package back in November, as we were first to report. In addition to Bargatze and Lagana, Jeremy Latcham will produce through Wonder Project, with Shary Shirazi overseeing for the studio. Since starring in NBC's lauded ensemble family drama This Is Us from creator Dan Fogelman, which ran for six seasons, Moore has starred in Peacock's Dr. Death and lent her voice to #1 Happy Family USA, Amazon's new adult animated series from Ramy Youssef and Pam Brady, which premiered on Prime Video on April 17. In 2023, she attached to star opposite Kumail Nanjiani in Screen Gems' Thread: An Insidious Tale, though the status of that project is unclear. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Dave Franco and Alison Brie have never collaborated quite like this… The real-life partners lead Michael Shanks' Sundance hit “Together” which subverts romantic drama conventions thanks to a body horror twist. Franco and Brie play Tim and Millie, a couple who relocate across the country only to find themselves more reliant on each other than ever. The official synopsis reads: “Years into their relationship, Tim and Millie (Franco and Brie) find themselves at a crossroads as they move to the country. Abandoning all that is familiar in their lives except each other. Let's Roast Marshmallows and Make a Plan What Does a ‘100 Percent Tariff' on Movies Made in ‘Foreign Lands' Even Mean — and Can Trump Literally Do It? The duo also produce the film, along with Mike Cowap, Andrew Mittman, Erik Feig, Julia Hammer, Tim Headington, and Max Silva. “This was like the most full-on thing we've ever done together,” Franco said. “Together” premiered at Sundance, where it was acquired by NEON. And while it's easy to poke holes in some of the logic Shanks' script seems to think is baked right in — without spoiling too much, we've got a lot of questions about how much the wider community is clued into what's really happening, plus still more queries about the physical (and, yes, sexual) implications of much of it — in the moment, it's hard not to get pulled into the spectacle, stuck to the story, really connected to this crowd-pleasing (and -screaming) little ditty of a midnight treat.” Neon will release “Together” in theaters on Friday, July 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the entertainment business is still grappling with President Donald Trump‘s post suggesting that a tariff on foreign-made films is in the works, the White House said in a clarifying statement Monday that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made.” “Although no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made, the Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again,” White House spokesman Kush Desai tells The Hollywood Reporter. The comment suggests that any further clarity on the tariffs, what form they would take, how they would be implemented, etc. It also suggests that the White House may be exploring what legal avenues it has to pursue them, given the complexities and uncertainties on implementing a tariff on what amounts to a service rather than a physical good. Trump announced the tariff on Sunday night, writing that “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” and that a 100% tariff could help solve that problem, ordering the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative to begin exploring options. The news instantly reverberated across the industry, with executives, filmmakers and other stakeholders wondering what it meant for their businesses, and how they would work. The announcement instatly created more questions than it did answers, with uncertainty around whether it would apply to TV shows, streaming films, co-productions, or films with some production done in the U.S. and other pieces done abroad. The White House has been concerned that film and TV productions have increasingly shot overseas to take advantage of a lower-paid workforce as well as extensive local tax credits. While many U.S. states have also offered tax credits, some of the overseas options have become too appealing for U.S. studios to ignore. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Russell, adding a Gen Z icon to the mix: Jenna Ortega. IndieWire confirmed that De Niro and Ortega will play a pseudo Paul Newman and Tom Cruise for Russell's version of “The Color of Money,” titled “Shutout.” Ortega is set to star as the ingenue pool hall amateur who learns the ways of lifelong pool hustler De Niro. Having lived and lost by the roll of a ball in smoky backroom halls, Jake encounters Mia (Ortega), a young prodigy whose raw, electrifying talent reignites a fire he thought long extinguished. Sensing a rare opportunity to shape a legend, Jake takes Mia under his wing, honing her instincts and sharpening her natural gift. Together, they plunge into the ruthless world of high-stakes pool, where the line between unimaginable fortune and devastating failure is razor-thin.
