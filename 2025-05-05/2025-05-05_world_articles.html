                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Accepting the offer could sabotage pending or future cases people might have in US immigration court, an expert warns. The Trump administration on Monday announced what it called “historic travel assistance and stipend for voluntary self-deportation,” prompting one expert to issue a warning to undocumented immigrants who may consider the offer. “If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, a key leader of President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda. According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), immigrants who use the CBP Home smartphone application to self-deport will receive “financial and travel assistance” as well as “a stipend of $1,000 dollars, paid after their return to their home country has been confirmed through the app.” DHS framed the offer as “a dignified way to leave” the United States without encountering Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and claimed people who submit their intent to self-deport in the app “will also be deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure.” Responding to the announcement on social media, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, stressed that “it is incredibly important for all reporting on this to emphasize that DHS's claim that people who do this will be able to return is, in many cases, an outright LIE that will trap people into WORSE outcomes for them than if they stayed and fought a case in immigration court.” And having a deportation order makes it VERY hard to ever come back legally. “This move also raises VERY serious questions about statutory authority and funding sources.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that his administration is implementing a 100 percent tariff on all films produced in foreign countries, denouncing them as “propaganda” as he aims to wrest further control over information and the media in the U.S. He dubiously declared it a “National Security threat” that foreign studios are “offering all sorts of incentives” to draw U.S. filmmakers to other countries. “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” the president wrote. It's unclear how the policy would be implemented, since movies are distributed in numerous ways and may involve foreign labor or locations for filming and other aspects of the filmmaking process. Several recent and upcoming blockbuster films like A Minecraft Movie, Wicked, and Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning were largely shot outside of the U.S. by American production companies. Any potential reciprocal tariffs would also deal a major blow to American filmmaking, experts have said; last month, China already said that it would restrict imports of Hollywood films in retaliation for Trump's sweeping tariffs on the country. Sunday's announcement has already caused U.S. media companies' stocks to fall. Like Trump's other tariffs, any raised costs for things like physical media or movie tickets would inevitably be passed on to the consumer. The right has spent years targeting thousands of books with bans, while the Trump administration has uplifted right-wing influencers, podcasters and news outlets as it attacks legacy news outlets it perceives to be biased against the right. This has come through vague threats and outright attacks to cause capitulation, as with Trump's attacks on CBS and “60 Minutes”; credential revocations, as with the White House's attempts to bar the Associated Press from the press pool; and, on Thursday, an executive order Trump signed to defund NPR and PBS, which the outlets are challenging in court.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix, Amazon, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount shares fall as studios reel from announcement Shares in US streamers and production companies fell on Monday, after Donald Trump said he would introduce 100% tariffs on films made abroad, a move that couldsharply raise costs for Hollywood studios. Trump's announcement on his Truth Social platform, revived worries about the US president's trade policy and its impact on the world economy. Netflix shares were down 1.7% by early afternoon on Wall Street, Amazon fell 1.5%, while Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount dropped by 1.1% and 1% respectively. The president said he had already ordered the commerce department and the US trade representative to begin instituting such a tariff, but his post did not say whether the levies would apply to films on streaming platforms as well as theatrical releases, nor did it detail whether tariffs would be based on production costs or box office revenue. Paolo Pescatore, a media analyst at PP Foresight, said: “It doesn't feel like something that will happen in the short term as everyone will be grappling to understand the whole process. The tariffs could hit Netflix in particular because the US streaming company relies on its global production network to produce content for international audiences. Despite their historic base in Los Angeles, Hollywood studios have over the years shifted production overseas to locations such as the UK, Canada and Australia to take advantage of generous tax credits and lower labour costs. Most of this year's Oscar best picture nominees were filmed outside the US, and a survey by ProdPro of studio executives, asking them about their preferred production locations for 2025 to 2026, showed that the top five choices were overseas. Forcing a return to US soil would push up production budgets and disrupt a global production supply chain that includes shooting in Europe, post-production in Canada and visual effects work in south-east Asia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steven J Hatfill, who promoted the drug despite scant evidence of efficacy, becomes special adviser at HHS A proponent of using the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 despite scant evidence of its efficacy has been named to a top pandemic prevention role at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Washington Post reports. Steven J Hatfill is a virologist who served in Donald Trump's first administration, during which he promoted hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus in the early months of the pandemic, when vaccines and treatments were not yet available. The Trump administration embraced using the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, along with other drugs such as ivermectin and chloroquine, as treatments against Covid-19, despite concerns over both their efficacy and potentially serious side-effects. In June 2020, just months after the pandemic started, the Food and Drug Administration warned against using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat Covid-19 over “reports of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues”, even after Trump approved ordering millions of doses of the drug for US patients from Brazil. In an interview with the Post, Hatfill defended his support of hydroxychloroquine, which remains in use to treat diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It is a safe drug,” Hatfill said, noting that “they gave the drug to the president” in 2020, when Trump contracted Covid-19. In his new job, Hatfill said he would “help get us ready for the next pandemic” and work with his agency's scientists on achieving “complete awareness of the scientific literature, not just for influenza, bird flu or Covid but other global diseases that could represent a threat to the US”. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former appointee under Joe Biden, told the Washington Post: “My hope is that Dr Hatfill will pursue the things that are of greatest value in preparing for another pandemic, such as new medicines and vaccines.” He noted that hydroxychloroquine “doesn't cure Covid and has risks”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain is marking the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day this week with four days of commemorations honoring the end of World War II on the continent, as well as those who served and perished during the conflict. London's commemorations began Monday when Big Ben, the clock and bell in Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament, struck at midday and extracts from wartime leader Winston Churchill's VE Day speech echoed across the capital. A military parade, featuring members of the United Kingdom's armed forces, marched from parliament to Buckingham Palace. Moments later, the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows display team streaked across the sky in a flypast that left trails of red, white and blue smoke. Members of the British royal family attending Monday's procession wore uniforms chosen to reflect both personal military ties and historical resonance. King Charles wore a Naval No.1 uniform with no medals or decorations – mirroring the attire of his grandfather, King George VI, who stood on the Buckingham Palace balcony on VE Day in 1945. Queen Camilla appeared beside him in a sapphire blue wool crepe dress and coat, adorned with a 12th Royal Lancers Brooch – honoring her late father's regiment. Events will continue across the UK this week. On Tuesday, 30,000 ceramic poppies will be installed at the Tower of London to remember those killed in conflict. Elsewhere, historic landmarks across the UK will be illuminated in the national colors of red, white and blue. VE Day itself, Thursday, will include a national two-minute silence at midday, a service at Westminster Abbey attended by the King and Queen, and a large-scale concert at Horse Guards Palace. Later, 2,500 beacons will be lit across the UK. In London, the late Queen Elizabeth, then a 19-year-old princess, and her younger sister Margaret famously slipped out of Buckingham Palace to join the revelers. Just days ago, Prince Harry revealed that his father, King Charles, no longer speaks to him and that he cannot imagine bringing his family back to the UK after losing a court case over his security arrangements on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House after arriving in Washington on May 4.TIERNEY L. CROSS/The New York Times News Service (The other two unofficial envoys, announced by Trump in January, are Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson, right-leaning Hollywood fixtures who, unlike Voight, are presumably too busy making movies to take the White House's instructions seriously.) Over the past decade, countless international territories have seriously beefed up their financial incentives and infrastructures while the more familiar U.S. production hotbeds of L.A., New York, and Atlanta struggled to respond. Many mid-budget action flicks (including this summer's forthcoming John Wick spinoff, Ballerina) have decamped to Eastern Europe. Last week, word around Hollywood was that Voight was set to finally unveil his grand Make American Movies Great Again plan to Trump. The President announced that instead of, say, reasonably coaxing U.S. states into revamping their tax-break programs for film productions or adding a federal layer of financial incentives for shooting domestically, he will slap a 100-per-cent tariff on “any and all movies coming into our country that are produced by foreign lands.” Like so many of Trump's pronouncements, there were no details or timelines offered – only the thoroughly ridiculous notion that the situation represented a “National Security threat.” U.S. President Donald Trump on May 4 announced a 100-per-cent tariff on movies produced outside the country, saying the American movie industry was dying a "very fast death" due to the incentives that other countries were offering to lure filmmakers. For starters, films and any other “informational sources” produced abroad are constitutionally protected from any sanctions thanks to the Berman Amendment, which was passed in 1988 to protect the free flow of culture internationally, even from “adversarial” states. Second, Hollywood's major studios – which are controlled by some of the largest corporations in the United States – would simply implode were they forced to add tariffs to, say, this summer's new Fantastic Four movie (filmed in London) or James Cameron's upcoming Avatar sequel (New Zealand) or the latest Mission: Impossible instalment (filmed absolutely everywhere). Donald Trump's Truth Social post about the movie industry from May 4, 2025. While Hollywood CEOs have so far shown a craven attitude toward Trump in his second term – squashing diversity initiatives, erasing trans characters from productions, throwing millions to the First Family – any so-called tariff would kill their businesses overnight, and result in a never-ending stream of apoplectic phone calls to the Oval Office from the heads of such American behemoths as Amazon, Comcast, Apple, Disney, and Netflix. Who would then have exceedingly plausible cause to sue. (The 2025 U.S. box office is actually up compared with 2024, refuting any Trump claims about economic emergency, while the national-security threat is equally implausible.) Meanwhile, if the move is simply a sneering response to Beijing – which recently restricted the number of U.S. films it lets into China over Trump's other tariffs – then it is far too little, too late, given that Hollywood largely abandoned the complex and fickle Chinese marketplace years ago. But – and because Trump's 2025 tenure has so far demanded countless “buts” – if some iteration of a foreign-film tariff were to become reality, it would swiftly and single-handedly destroy Canadian culture. Typically, Hollywood productions coming here to shoot pump even more money into the domestic screen sector – we are talking about billions and billions of dollars that keep our sound stages humming, our craftspeople employed (more than 26,000 in B.C. So much of Canadian culture – films and series that are shot here, written and directed by Canadian creatives, and starring Canadian performers – are largely made possible thanks to the FLS side of the screen-sector equation. And while television was not mentioned in Trump's post, so much of our homegrown TV is financed with the assumption that it can be sold to global markets, including American broadcasters. Any tariff would kill our big- and small-screen industry cold. Could Ottawa respond to any possible Trump tariff by placing a counter-tax on Hollywood movies coming into Canada? Movie theatre owners, already tackling a generational audience crisis, would lose whatever precious little cool they had left. And consumers would riot over any extra ticket or streaming subscription cost passed onto them. But, before Mark Carney threatens to forcibly repatriate Seth Rogen and Ryan Gosling under the cover of darkness, everyone in the film industry – both in Canada and in any other “foreign land” that is apparently pumping “propaganda” into the hearts and minds of Americans – should take a breather. Trump's movie-tariff idea arrived at the tail end of a 48-hour period in which the President also, in no particular order, said he “doesn't know” if he has to abide by the U.S. Constitution, announced that he wanted to reopen Alcatraz prison even though it's been a museum for more than half a century, and revealed that he thinks himself as a Jedi warrior fighting the Empire of woke-ism (albeit brandishing the red lightsaber favoured by the evil Sith).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Romanian residents have been deprived of the opportunity to vote for their preferred presidential candidate, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing, responding to a TASS request to comment on the results of the first round of the presidential election in the country. According to the voting results, right-wing candidate George Simion, a co-party of politician Calin Georgescu, who was withdrawn from the election for farfetched reasons, emerged as the first-round leader. "One of the favorites of these elections was thrown out of the electoral race in a totally arbitrary manner," the Kremlin spokesman recalled. "In any case, Romanian voters were deprived of the right to cast their vote for the person they want," he added. Asked whether Europe could be considered tired of candidates imposed by the EU bureaucracy, Peskov said that the matter should be assessed "not by us, but by the Romanians." The first round of Romania's new presidential election was held on Sunday. According to its results, Simion (40.96%) and an independent candidate, Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan (20.99%), moved to the next stage with a large gap. Scheduled presidential elections were suspended in late 2024 by Romania's Constitutional Court after nationalist candidate Calin Georgescu won the most votes in the first round on November 24, 2024. He was suspected of having ties to Russia, but even an internal Romanian investigation failed to confirm the allegations. Georgescu, on the other hand, was barred from running as a candidate in the runoff election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Embassy in Slovakia on May 4 condemned what it called "anti-Ukrainian" remarks by Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who criticized President Volodymyr Zelensky's warning that Russia could stage provocations during its May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow. In a statement, the Ukrainian Embassy said it regretted Fico's accusations and urged Slovak officials to "more carefully study, rewatch, and analyze" Zelensky's statements. Zelensky on May 3 said Ukraine cannot guarantee the safety of foreign officials planning to attend Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, warning Russia could orchestrate provocations, including "arsons, explosions, or other actions," and attempt to blame Ukraine. Russia is responsible for ensuring safety and security on its territory, Zelensky added. Fico, who plans to attend Russia's Victory Day celebrations, had earlier denounced Zelensky for "threatening" foreign delegations, calling the remarks "unacceptable" and accusing the Ukrainian leader of disrespecting Russia's role in defeating fascism in World War II. In its response, the Ukrainian Embassy said it viewed Fico's remarks as "deeply regrettable," particularly amid ongoing Russian aggression. The war, it said, claimed over eight million Ukrainian lives. The embassy also pushed back against Fico's calls for a ceasefire timed with the WWII anniversary, noting that Ukraine had already agreed to a full ceasefire on March 11, while Russia "constantly rejects this option and puts forward new demands, manipulates, escalates terror, and now offers a short truce for 3 days, which is not a serious path to peace." Fico, a populist with pro-Russian leanings, is one of few European leaders set to attend Russia's Victory Day amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Ukraine and most European nations mark May 8 as Victory in Europe Day. The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, on April 15 warned European leaders against attending Russia's Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.</p>

Consumers without an order number will need to submit a photo of the portable charger with their name and date written on the portable charger in permanent marker.” To receive a replacement, customers must confirm they have disposed of the charger in accordance with applicable rules. CPSC warned against throwing away lithium-ion batteries in the trash can or general recycling systems, such as curbside recycling bins. Lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of in a different manner than other types of batteries, as they pose a higher fire risk. Multiple other products have been recalled in recent months over faulty lithium batteries. The bill comes at a time when fires from these batteries have grown “exponentially” in New York City, it said. My district specifically is acutely aware of the unmitigated disaster that urban fires pose and the urgent need for stronger safety standards,” Torres said. “Today's success demonstrates the broad bipartisan support for this urgently needed legislation. I urge the Senate and President Trump to swiftly pass and sign the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act into law.” “For far too long, members of the fire service have had to deal with these dangerous and toxic fires.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union is set to propose measures to ban Russian gas imports by the end of 2027, Bloomberg reported citing sources. The EU plans to unveil in June a proposal to prohibit all gas imports under new agreements with Russia as well as existing spot contracts, according to the agency. The European Commission (EC) intends to announce its proposed restrictions on Russian pipeline gas and LNG supplies under long-term contracts in Strasbourg on May 6, the sources said. Policies targeting spot contracts will come into effect no later than 2025, while restrictions on long-term agreements will be implemented by the end of 2027, Bloomberg wrote. Their timeline depends on the EU's ability to secure alternative LNG sources from Africa, Canada, Qatar, and the US among others, through trade negotiations with US President Donald Trump's administration, the agency added. The plans, scheduled to be presented at the European Parliament's session on May 6, are still subject to change, sources noted. Reuters reported earlier that the EC was assessing legal options to allow EU companies to exit current gas supply contracts with Russia without incurring penalties. Additionally, the EU intends to present a comprehensive roadmap for phasing out Russian energy resources on May 6. In May 2022, the European Union launched the REPowerEU program to eliminate Europe's reliance on Russian gas by 2027. Meanwhile, the cost of Russian LNG imports for the EU has nearly quadrupled in three years due to rising prices and increased supply volumes.</p>

By Eitaro Hayashi / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writer OYAMA, Tochigi — About 6 kilometers north of JR Oyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture, located in the middle of a fork in the road, sits a restaurant with soda labels on its signboard. Inside the restaurant, called Drive-in Fuso, several groups of people, including families and men in work uniforms, were sitting at tables waiting for their food. I'm putting my whole heart into it.” One customer informed me, “She doesn't have anyone to help her.” The restaurant serves three dishes: tanmen (ramen with stir-fried vegetables and pork on top), katsudon pork cutlet rice bowl and yakiniku grilled meat set. There used to be more items on the menu, but the owner narrowed them down a few years ago to make it easier to run the shop by herself. The dishes are inexpensive yet come with a lot of food. Suzuki's husband, Shoji, opened the restaurant in 1965, around the time more people in Japan began buying cars, and it became very popular. She also got a large vehicle license so that she could drive a minibus to pick up and drop off banquet customers. Shoji passed away in 2022, but she continues to run the restaurant. She was able to reopen the restaurant after about two months, as customers donated chairs and tatami mats. “The only way I can repay them is to serve delicious food with all my heart,” she said. I render a service for you with my humble homemade dishes.” I am not even a regular customer, but I want to watch over her and her shop. Access: Get off at the Fuso Center bus stop from JR Oyama Station and walk for about 12 minutes. It is a 15-minute drive from the station.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clients who wanted to lock in the lower capital gains inclusion rate undertook costly 'crystallization' transactions to opt out of realizing the gain later.PeopleImages/iStockPhoto / Getty Images Some wealthy Canadians spent tens of thousands of dollars last year on sophisticated tax planning to get ahead of Ottawa's proposed hike to the capital gains inclusion rate, only to see the federal government abandon the measure earlier this year. Now that the proposed capital gains changes aren't proceeding, Canadians who acted find themselves no better off from a tax perspective than those who did nothing. “In June [2024], when everyone was doing this planning, nobody knew that we'd get to a point at which the government never actually followed through with the legislation,” says Armando Minicucci, partner with Doane Grant Thornton LLP in Mississauga. Michael Cadesky, managing partner with Cadesky Tax in Toronto, says professional advisory costs related to pre-June 25 planning could run as high as $100,000 for taxpayers with “sophisticated structures” who may have used crystallization transactions as part of broader planning. “For a lot of people, it was an expensive proposition,” Mr. Cadesky says. Here's an example of how such a transaction works: Now that the capital gains tax changes have been cancelled, many clients will elect to have pre-June 25 crystallization transactions completed at ACB to defer taxes, experts say. Alexandra Spinner, a partner with Crowe Soberman LLP in Toronto, says clients who had plans to sell a property soon – or were already in the process of selling but didn't anticipate closing a deal before June 25 – used crystallization transactions to lock in access to the lower inclusion rate while giving themselves more time to find a buyer or close a deal. Costs to put such planning in place generally start at $10,000, “and then only climb higher,” Ms. Spinner says. Some taxpayers used strategies other than transfers to corporations and partnerships to plan around the proposed capital gains tax changes last year. For example, some taxpayers transferred an asset to a spouse before June 25. Transfers to a spouse are automatic rollovers of property unless the transferor elects out of the rollover on their tax return to have the transfer completed on a taxable basis, triggering a capital gain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced on May 4 that he was authorizing his administration to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside of the United States. Trump said the move was necessary to protect the once globally dominant U.S. movie industry, as he noted that some countries have been offering incentives to attract American filmmakers and studios overseas. He warned that the local industry is “dying a very fast death,” with Hollywood and many other local entertainment businesses facing devastation. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,” Trump stated. “At some point, I'm going to lower them because otherwise, you could never do business with them and they want to do business very much,” he said. Seth Shafer, principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence Kagan, said the number of domestic films released in China has been declining. “Only roughly 25 percent of domestic wide-release films are now released in China, and that percentage has dropped steadily over time due to increasing competition from China's local film production industry,” Shafer said. Shafer said that for domestic films that are released in China, “typically less than 10 percent of the film's global gross box office revenue comes from China.” Trump said the three envoys will serve as his “eyes and ears” in Hollywood, advising him on strategies to revitalize the entertainment industry and restore its former glory. This reported subversion is contrasted with Hollywood's early days under the Hays Code, which set strict content guidelines until its erosion in the 1950s and replacement by the modern ratings system in 1968, which ushered in a more permissive era.</p>
