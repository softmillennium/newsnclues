But little did he know just how special the careers of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic would turn out to be. But the American has been left with many fond memories, with Sampras calling his 1999 Wimbledon final win his best performance. I love it out there on Centre Court.

This week, they're both in the draw, and looking to get in as many reps as possible before Roland Garros.Here's a look at that storyline, and two others, as the clay swing reaches its final Masters 1000, and we get our first proper men's tune-up for Paris.

Here's a look at that storyline, and two others, as the clay swing reaches its final Masters 1000, and we get our first proper men's tune-up for Paris. For someone who has played just one event in 2025—the Australian Open, which he won—he hasn't suffered much in the rankings so far. 1 overall, and fourth in this year's race to Turin.Like many of his fellow Italian players, who can seem overwhelmed by the atmosphere, Sinner hasn't been at his best in Rome. He's 9-5 there for his career, and has never made it past the quarterfinals. Of his 19 titles, just one has come on clay. This was supposed to be a season where Sinner branched out from hard courts, but his suspension has left him with little time to test out his clay game. Currently he's scheduled to play Rome and the ATP 500 in Hamburg before Roland Garros.Whatever the surface, and however much time he has been away, Sinner remains the favorite against virtually anyone he faces.

Whatever the surface, and however much time he has been away, Sinner remains the favorite against virtually anyone he faces. A post shared by Tennis Channel DE (@tennischannelde) On the one hand, Zverev suffered a collapse in confidence after his blowout loss to Sinner in the Australian Open final; since then, he has made a series of early exits, while publicly lamenting his poor form at just about every stop. Yet he also broke out of that slump long enough to win a title in Munich a couple of weeks ago. For all of his recent frustrations, Zverev is a three-time finalist in Rome and last year's runner-up at Roland Garros. Clay remains a comfortable surface for him, and one where he's capable of turning his form around in a hurry.Judging by his draw, though, Rome might be a tough place for him to do that this time around. Arthur Fils and Lorenzo Musetti, two guys who have been threatening to have breakout springs, are in his quarter, as are two of his lifelong nemeses, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. If Zverev makes it past them, he could run into Alcaraz in the semifinals. Judging by his draw, though, Rome might be a tough place for him to do that this time around. Arthur Fils and Lorenzo Musetti, two guys who have been threatening to have breakout springs, are in his quarter, as are two of his lifelong nemeses, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. If Zverev makes it past them, he could run into Alcaraz in the semifinals. Sinner and Alcaraz are the only definite members. Novak Djokovic, despite his current injured status and advanced tennis age, can't be entirely counted out. Neither can Zverev, who was one set from the title last year. Who might be in a position to follow in his footsteps at the Foro?Two guys who come to mind are Fils and Musetti.So far this spring the Italian has been a finalist in Monte Carlo and a semifinalist in Madrid, and is at a career-high No. While he has never been past the fourth round in Paris, he did make the semifinals at Wimbledon last year. If he can handle the home-court pressure, his draw gives him a path in Rome. The seeds nearest him are Brandon Nakashima, Alexei Popyrin and Medvedev. 14, and has also made noise over the past month. He reached the quarters in Monte Carlo, where he had Alcaraz on the ropes before losing in three. By Madrid, where he lost early, Fils may have been a bit weary. But the Frenchman will surely want to ramp back up before he storms his home capital later this month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer played out a thrilling rivalry once upon a time, with the two legends having sadly both retired from tennis. Nadal has backed Carlos Alcaraz for big success, but the latter has a long way to go if he wants to emulate the former. The King of Clay retired last year with 22 Grand Slam titles to his name, second only to the 24 of Novak Djokovic. Incidentally, the legendary trio of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer have all impressively completed the career Grand Slam. He was asked after the match what he thought he needed to accomplish to put himself ahead of Federer as the greatest ever, with Nadal replying: “Remain a lot of titles, so that's no doubt about that, no? “I think I am more than happy that with my titles, for sure… I think is talk about if I am better or worse than Roger is stupid, because the titles say he's much better than me, so that's the truth at that moment. I think will be the truth all my life. “But, sure, for me, always, always Roger was an example, especially because he improved his tennis I think during all his career, and that's a good thing that you can copy, no? “So I try to copy this, and I know Roger and me are different, much different styles. Nadal bowed out on a high, having proven his worth on all three surfaces at the US Open, with his 2010 title arriving at the age of just 24.

But Nadal was pressed further on his clearly exciting rivalry with Federer as the post-match questions continued, having been asked for his thoughts on it and how long he though it would last. But Roger is there, too, to finish No. “You know, we start every year, and a lot of new players and good players are there like… well, not new, Novak and Andy are not new, Andy Murray, but always come new players, very good players. “But for the last six years, Roger and me was… we were No. We will see what happens in the future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis World no.1 Jannik Sinner is set for a comeback at the Italian Open on May 5 after serving three-month ban for doping. In a press conference, ahead of the tournament, Sinner spoke about his complicated relationship with other tennis players during this phase. “Tennis is an individual sport, everyone has their own team. In Monte Carlo I met Draper and Sonego, we had a great time. At the beginning I had surprising messages from tennis players that I would not have expected to receive. And nothing from those who instead I expected to receive something. I don't want to name them. “I have low expectations for this tournament. He also detailed how tough it was for him to handle the ban, especially at its start. I couldn't go to the stadium to watch a football match or follow a cycling race of my friends. But I was happy to spend time with my family”. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Sinner is to be honoured alongside his Davis Cup teammates and the Billie Jean King Cup players after Italy swept both of tennis' biggest team titles last year. He was scheduled to hold an open practice session later on Campo Centrale that is expected to attract a sold-out crowd of 10,500 spectators. It will be broadcast live on Italian TV.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner is officially back on the ATP Tour seeking further history. The Italian was suspended for three months due to a doping scandal. However, his ban has officially ended on May 4 2025. Now, as he is eligible to play professional tennis again, he is set to make his return at the Rome Masters. Sinner will be in action in multiple tournaments before Roland Garros, as he also has the Hamburg event on his calendar. However, there are many more things that he can achieve in the 2025 season. We boil down three things he can achieve this year after his return. His quick ground strokes proved fundamental on that surface. The signs were there when he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to love in the Wimbledon 2022 quarterfinals. Then, he made his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon in 2023, again losing to the Serb. However, he was battling physical problems and potentially having nightmare situations in his head regarding the doping scandal that was set to surface in a couple of months. With the doping scandal now behind him, he can look forward to bringing his dominance on the grass courts and winning his first Wimbledon title. He has the Halle Open to defend this season, which can tune him up for SW19. No one has defended the US Open title since 2008, when Roger Federer defeated Andy Murray to win his fifth consecutive title at Flushing Meadows. Despite Djokovic's dominance on hard courts, the Serb has never been able to defend the title once. He is a four-time champion at the event, winning titles in 2011, 2015, 2018, and 2023. Despite coming from a three-month break, he is still the man to beat on hard courts. In this century, only two players have finished successive seasons with the World No. 1 on five occasions, but never once did it happen in successive seasons. Sinner has a great chance of joining Federer and Djokovic. The big issue here is that the Italian has a bunch of points to defend, especially after Wimbledon. Moreover, he has Masters 1000 titles at Cincinnati and Shanghai to defend as well. Hence, Sinner has his work cut out for him if he wants to accomplish this milestone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Rafael Nadal's masterclasses to Novak Djokovic's rise, the French Open has seen a number of landmark moments in men's tennis. Looking at the top 5 biggest tennis moments in Roland Garros history With every tennis fan waiting for the event, let's have a look at the top five moments – upsets, dominance, and landmark events – in men's tennis matches at Roland Garros. 1 with a 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 victory – the most lopsided French Open men's final since 1977. Federer, appearing in his third consecutive Roland Garros final, looked helpless against Nadal's topspin and court coverage, and the Spaniard went on to win the tournament without dropping a single set and losing only 41 games across seven matches. The 1991 French Open final match between Andre Agassi and Jim Courier is an event that shaped the future of Roland Garros as well as tennis itself. It was anything but routine, as Courier, who lost 6-3 in the first set, roared back with a 6-4 win against Agassi, but the former world No. What happened next is one of the best comebacks in tennis history, with Courier dominating Agassi with a 6-1 win and going on to win the final set 6-4. Robin Soderling's 2009 French Open fourth-round win against Rafael Nadal is still considered one of the biggest upsets in tennis history. 24-year-old Soderling completely disrupted Nadal's play with his fearless approach and aggressive baseline play, ending the Spaniard's French Open dominance and inadvertently paving the way for Roger Federer to win his first and only Roland Garros title, completing his career Grand Slam. In the 2021 French Open semi-finals, Novak Djokovic accomplished a feat few thought possible – defeating Rafael Nadal on his beloved Court Philippe Chatrier. With this landmark win, the Serbian star not only clinched his second French Open title but also, as per many tennis fans, inherited the “greatest of all time” title from his Spanish opponent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World No 1 Sinner's three-month suspension for a doping violation ended on Sunday, allowing the Italian to return to competitive tennis on home soil at the Foro Italico this week. After receiving a round-one bye, the 23-year-old will face either world No 99 Mariano Navone or Italian 17-year-old Federico Cina in his first match back. Sinner is then expected to face a quarter-final against sixth seed and newly-crowned Madrid Open champion Casper Ruud, before a semi-final versus fourth seed Taylor Fritz. Three-time Rome semi-finalist Ruud could face a blockbuster third-round clash against 29th seed Matteo Berrettini, who will hope to be at full fitness on home turf after retiring injured in Madrid. Rafael Nadal, Iga Swiatek and Boris Becker react to Casper Ruud's Madrid Open victory Points and money earned by Ruud, Draper, Musetti, Zverev, Djokovic at Madrid Open Fourth seed Fritz was a Rome quarter-finalist back in 2024 and could face a tricky opening-match test against Madrid surprise package Gabriel Diallo, who opens against Marcos Giron. Fritz is in the same quarter of the draw as seventh seed Alex de Minaur, who faces a tricky opener against one of two Italians: Luca Nardi or Flavio Cobolli. Defending champion Zverev is searching for his third Italian Open title and, after a round-one bye, will start his campaign against a qualifier or Camilo Ugo Carabelli. Zverev was drawn in the same quarter as eighth seed and home favourite Lorenzo Musetti, who is projected to face 10th seed and 2023 champion Daniil Medvedev in the fourth round. New world No 5 and Madrid runner-up Draper could face 32nd seed Sebastian Baez in the third round and ninth seed Holger Rune in the round of 16.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Should Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz reignite their gripping rivalry at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, it must wait until the championship match. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner will open against Mariano Navone or #NextGenATP wild card Federico Cina at the clay-court ATP Masters 1000 event, following Monday's draw ceremony in Rome. The 23-year-old will be playing just his second tournament of the year, and first since winning the Australian Open, after completing a three-month period of ineligibility in a case resolution agreement with WADA. Sinner could face a potential quarter-final clash with Madrid champion Casper Ruud, whom the Italian leads 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Fresh from claiming his maiden Masters 1000 title, Ruud will start against Roman Safiullin or Alexander Bublik in Rome. After withdrawing from the Masters 1000 in Madrid, Alcaraz will return to action against Jan-Lennard Struff or Yoshihito Nishioka. The Spaniard sustained an adductor injury during his championship-match run in Barcelona, but will hope to bounce back in Rome, where he is competing for just the second time. 5 and Madrid runner-up, Jack Draper, in the quarter-finals. Defending champion Alexander Zverev will begin his campaign against a qualifier or Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli. The second-seeded Zverev saw his seven-match winning streak come to an end in the fourth round in Madrid, where he suffered his third consecutive defeat to Francisco Cerundolo. Zverev could face Alcaraz in an intriguing semi-final, but the German must first navigate a testing quarter, which includes Lorenzo Musetti, Daniil Medvedev, Arthur Fils and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Musetti starts against Hamad Medjedovic or a qualifier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff's former coach, Brad Gilbert, voices strong disapproval of Iga Swiatek's potential decision to skip Wimbledon this year. Despite their history of encounters favoring Swiatek on clay, Gauff's recent triumph marked her first win over the Polish powerhouse on clay courts in their sixth face-off on the surface. Gilbert, taking to social media, expressed his dismay at the prospect of Swiatek skipping Wimbledon, asserting, “Not a fan of skipping Wimbledon if healthy.” The tennis community remains divided on whether Swiatek's reported decision is a strategic move or a misstep in her career trajectory. The 23-year-old player expressed her disappointment, stating, “For sure I feel like I haven't been moving well and, you know, the tennis also was like on and off, you know, for most of the tournament. So I wasn't really sure what I have in my tool box… For sure, like I didn't even have a plan B because nothing was working today.” Stay tuned for more updates on this gripping saga unfolding in the world of professional tennis. 1 tennis player Jannik Sinner is set to make...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

Ruud overcame both a rib injury sustained in the semi-final and a resilient Jack Draper to seal a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 victory in the Spanish capital on Sunday to become the first Norwegian winner of a Masters 1000 crown.

It ended a run of six successive losses in big finals for the 26-year-old, including the 2022 French Open and US Open title clashes and the Roland Garros final two years ago.

"With this win, I put myself back in a good position when it comes to ranking and seeding," said Ruud, who jumped eight spots in the rankings and returned to the top 10 ahead of the year's second Grand Slam starting on May 25.

"If you want to win a tournament it doesn't really matter what your ranking is because you have to beat every player you play anyways, but it's a good step forward, and when I come to Paris, I'll always have great feeling and memories from the place.

"I'm a good clay court player and in best-of-five sets, I'll be even tougher to beat, that's my mentality.

"I know I don't need to play great every point or every single match, but I know I can physically be there for a long time and play my clay court game, make it difficult for the opponents. That's how I felt when I've done well there."

Ruud, who has more tour-level wins (125) and titles (12) on clay than any other player since 2020, will continue his preparations for Roland Garros at the Italian Open this week.

"A win here shows the other players that I'm here to try to do well for the rest of the clay season," he added.</p>
