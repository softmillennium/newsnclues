                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Education nonprofit worker Kat thought she was entering her second marriage “completely level-headedly” during the pandemic. Despite bonding with her new husband over “facts and rationality,” less than a year in, he was using ChatGPT in a very nontraditional way — to craft texts to his wife, analyze their marriage, and ask “philosophical questions,” as reported by Rolling Stone. Online, he spiraled into sharing bizarre posts on social media, which loved ones were reaching out to Kat about with concern. Her boyfriend threatened to dump her if she didn't join his AI-fueled spiritual journey “because it [was] causing him to grow at such a rapid pace he wouldn't be compatible with me any longer,” she said. Experts claim this AI spiritual delusion spiral should be expected; humans are hardwired to seek meaning and craft narratives around their interpretations, especially when their lives feel out of control. “A good therapist would not encourage a client to make sense of difficulties in their life by encouraging them to believe they have supernatural powers,” psychologist Erin Westgate warned Rolling Stone. “Instead, they try to steer clients away from unhealthy narratives, and toward healthier ones. “ChatGPT has saved our relationship,” Abella Bala, an influencer talent manager from Los Angeles, told The Post. Bala explained that she and her boyfriend, Dom Versaci pay $20 a month for ChatGPT's premium package to better understand each other's perspectives on things instead of paying for an expensive real-life therapy session. “ChatGPT is weirdly helpful for de-escalating fights,” said Bala, “neither of us wants to argue back and forth with a robot.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its infamous 'illegals' programme - in which Soviet agents led double lives abroad for decades while spying for the Kremlin - was a masterclass in long-term infiltration and espionage. Russian intelligence officers or trusted private intermediaries now operate like gig economy recruiters, trawling Telegram channels, web forums and job boards for individuals willing to smuggle, surveil or sabotage, with no questions asked. More often than not, they are pawns drawn unwittingly into a grand, sinister game to do the bidding of Russia's intelligence services. Many of them are petty criminals, drifters or financially desperate citizens approached under the guise of legitimate jobs as couriers, security contractors or other seemingly innocuous occupations. Others know more, but are paid well enough to turn a blind eye. Most recently, a bomb plot which saw explosives and incendiary devices hidden in sex toys and cosmetics was foiled before it could threaten a passenger jet or cargo plane. Meanwhile, in Germany, would-be arsonists targeted US military facilities. In France, a macabre stunt at the Eiffel Tower claimed to mourn 'French soldiers killed in Ukraine' to provoke unrest and fear, and opposition journalists across Europe have been marked out for kidnap or assassination. A man accused of involvement in the DHL parcel bomb plot is pictured being extradited to Poland A deadly fire ignited at a plant in Berlin containing poisonous sulphuric acid and copper cyanide that is reportedly linked to the manufacture of IRIS-T SL/SLM missiles supplied to Ukraine for use against Russia Bulgarian beautician Vanya Gaberova (pictured), decorator Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, and lab technician Katrin Ivanova, 33, were found guilty of conspiring to spy for Russia At first glance the boxes, originating from Lithuania, contained a host of items that included sex toys, massage pillows and cosmetics. Investigators soon uncovered a more troubling layer to the saga when another package, shipped from the same Lithuanian origin point, failed to detonate and was intercepted at a Polish depot. Inside, forensic specialists discovered a crude yet effective ignition mechanism concealed within the casing of yet another erotic gadget, along with traces of an incendiary gel designed to ignite on contact with air. Polish security services arrested four people in connection with the blazes and charged them with participating in sabotage or terrorist operations on behalf of a foreign intelligence agency. Before long it emerged that they were suspected of involvement in a Russian-backed plot to distribute the explosive packages throughout Europe. It is suspected the incidents were test runs for a plot to target US-bound flights. Bezrukavyi had vanished soon after the parcels were mailed but was eventually captured in Bosnia, where he was on the run and attempting to reach Russia using forged documents. Massage pillows and other erotic gadgets were reportedly found in a shipment that concealed incendiary devices that later detonated in British and German DHL depots Bezrukavyi and his associates are believed to have been recruited via the Telegram messaging app by an account known only as 'VWarrior' that was offering hundreds of dollars for seemingly simple courier assignments. One associate of Bezrukavyi said: 'It could be true that the purpose of the parcels was sinister... We just wanted easy money, work that wouldn't involve drugs or weapons. Dr Samuel Ramani, an expert at leading defence and security think tank RUSI, told MailOnline that, had a package caught fire or exploded on a passenger jet to the States, an 'all-out confrontation' between Washington and Moscow may have followed. When asked if people should be fearful of the threat posed by such operations, Dr Ramani said: 'Yes, people should be very vigilant - they should not take such a threat less seriously than ISIS or any other terror group. 'They are terrorists in the same way, very serious intent, strategic action, not just a rogue action, criminal for hire, this is a state-sponsored operation.' In March, three Bulgarian nationals - beautician Vanya Gaberova, 30, decorator Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, and lab technician Katrin Ivanova, 33 - were found guilty of espionage charges by an Old Bailey jury. None of them underwent extensive training programmes conducted by Russia's intelligence services, nor did they have any discernible background in the military, politics or technology. Yet for three years, these individuals passed secrets to Moscow, travelling across Europe to spy on enemies of the state, journalists and a US air base. The hungry-for-money Bulgarians were contracted by a man named Orlin Roussev, who, along with his right-hand men Biser Dzhambazov and Ivan Stoyanov, planned and oversaw covert operations from a warehouse in Great Yarmouth stacked with all manner of surveillance technology, fake passports and burner phones. At least £200,000 was sent by the group's Moscow-based handler, fugitive businessman turned Russian intelligence associate Jan Marsalek, to finance the operations, which were planned over 80,000 messages exchanged with Roussev over Telegram. 'We can definitely record something for Pornhub too, that girl is real hot,' Roussev wrote to Marsalek in uncovered Telegram messages. One member of the group got so close to Grozev that she was able to capture the pin code of his phone while recording with a hidden camera. Thankfully for him, the plan was not followed through. Dissident journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, editor-in-chief of independent Russian publication 'The Insider', was targeted alongside Grozev. Meanwhile, the spies were tasked with information gathering and infiltrating restricted areas. For several months, the group surveilled a US military base in Stuttgart, believing that the base was being used to train Ukrainian forces in the use of surface-to-air weapons to down Russian fighter jets and drones. A car that was recovered had also been adapted to house and deploy technical surveillance devices outside the base. 'This was spying on an almost industrial scale on behalf of Russia,' he said at the sentencing of the Bulgarian spy ring. 'It felt like something you would expect to read in a spy novel. Sophisticated technology including rocks containing hidden cameras and a £120,000 device for intercepting mobile phone numbers was found at an address in Great Yarmouth Security footage captured the moment a white van bearing Bulgarian licence plates pulled up near the landmark before two men, dressed head to toe in black, unloaded five full-sized coffins and dumped them on the pavement on Saturday morning One of the most high-profile examples of such psychological operations, known as 'psy-ops', came last summer as Paris prepared to host the Olympic Games. All three individuals involved were quickly arrested, with Parisian investigators reportedly discovering material on the phone of one detainee connecting him to another group that defaced a Holocaust memorial in the French capital a month prior, according to Le Monde. Both acts are thought to have been organised by Russia's security services, according to France's Foreign Ministry, but carried out by non-Russian nationals who were freelancers for hire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A mysterious photo believed to be of a massive 1,000-foot-wide UFO, hovering over the American Southwest, has gone viral on social media. Released by controversial former Department of Defence employee and activist Luis "Lue" Elizondo, the image has caught the attention of social media users who are now debating if the picture is real or if it has been digitally altered. The grainy photo was allegedly snapped by a commercial airline pilot in 2021 flying at 21,000 feet near the Four Corners landmark joining parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. "Captured near Four Corners at FL20, estimated 600-1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped," the UAP Disclosure Fund captioned the image on X (formerly Twitter). ✈️ NEW PHOTO (civilian pilot)Captured near Four Corners at FL210—estimated 600-1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped.Released moments ago by @LueElizondo during our “Science, National Security & Innovation” panel. Mislabeling known terrestrial phenomena erodes public trust and undermines legitimate disclosure efforts. Please correct this mistake, your reputation is on the line," wrote one user. Have you never flown in a plane before? These agricultural circles are extremely common,” said another user. After the photo and related claims were debunked by the social media users, Mr Elizondo released a statement, admitting he got it wrong but refused to share an apology. As you know, I am always first to admit mistakes, but this is not one of those times. The specific photo had only just been provided to me… This is not the first instance when Mr Elizondo has come under scrutiny for his "extraterrestrial" claims, with the Pentagon also debunking his statements that alien life was present on Earth.</p>

Extreme Weather:

As last week's power blackout in Iberia shows, weather can attract disinformation as simplistic explanations and conspiracy theories are spread on social media.

When a massive blackout plunged Iberia into darkness last week, one theory pinned it on a “rare atmospheric phenomenon,” fueled by extreme temperature variations in Spain that triggered oscillations in high-voltage transmission lines.

The explanation — attributed to Portugal's grid operatorBloomberg Terminal Redes Energéticas Nacionais — caught fire and spread in news reports and across social media. Meteorologists scrambled to look at computer models, maps and weather data to see if something in the atmosphere had caused power lines to “gallop” uncontrollably, a phenomenon known to occur under the right conditions.</p>

BRATISLAVA - As Moscow prepares for Victory Day on 9 May, the only two European politicians expected to attend – Slovak PM Robert Fico and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić – have both unexpectedly cancelled their recent programmes, fuelling speculation which Fico has since denied. Another Russian portal news cited a political analyst who also suggested the leaders could be faking their health issues for strategic reasons. When asked about his health by journalists, Fico responded irritably, saying, “My health is none of your business,” though he did admit to ongoing issues stemming from an assassination attempt he survived in May last year. “There are things related to the attack that sometimes prevent me from sitting in a car for four hours. He also criticised recent remarks by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling them a threat.
