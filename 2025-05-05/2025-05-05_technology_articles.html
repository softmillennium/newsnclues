                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YouTube is testing a new two-person Premium subscription plan in select countries, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Monday. The tier is being piloted in India, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The plan is aimed at people who want the benefits of YouTube Premium, such as ad-free viewing and background play, without committing to a full family plan. As for YouTube, the new plan would allow it to increase its subscriber numbers and potentially earn more revenue. For instance, people who may have cancelled their Premium plans after price hikes in recent years may decide to sign up for the discounted two-person plan. As with any other test launch, it's unknown when or if YouTube plans to roll out the two-person Premium plan more widely or in additional countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI has decided that its nonprofit division will retain control over its for-profit organization, after the company initially announced that it planned to convert to a for-profit organization. “OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” OpenAI Board Chairman Bret Taylor wrote in a statement on the company's blog. “Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.” OpenAI had said that its conversion, which it argued was necessary to raise the capital needed to grow and expand its operations, would preserve its nonprofit status and infuse it with additional resources to be spent on “charitable initiatives” in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science. Musk had sought a preliminary injunction to halt OpenAI's conversion. A group of ex-OpenAI employees and Encode, a nonprofit that co-sponsored California's ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, filed amicus briefs several weeks ago in support of Musk's lawsuit. Separately, a cohort of organizations, including nonprofits and labor groups like the California Teamsters, petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit, claiming the company had “failed to protect its charitable assets.” Several Nobel laureates, law professors, and civil society organizations had also sent letters to Bonta and Delaware's attorney general, Kathy Jennings, requesting that they halt the startup's restructuring efforts. In a letter to staff on Monday also published on OpenAI's blog, CEO Sam Altman said he thinks OpenAI may eventually require “trillions of dollars” to fulfill its goal of “[making the company's] services broadly available to all of humanity.” “[W]e are moving to a normal capital structure where everyone has stock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is reportedly spinning up a film and TV project called 100 Zeroes. According to a report from Business Insider, this initiative is intended to make young audiences feel more positively about Google's products, as well as tech at large. The report also states that Google is not intending to share these projects via YouTube, which it owns, or through an in-house streaming service like Apple TV. Google clarified in a statement that this project is not a new production studio, but rather, the company's Platforms & Devices team will be collaborating with the production company Range Media. “We're working with Range to assist the creative community in integrating cutting-edge technologies and platforms, like XR and AI, into their filmmaking,” Google told TechCrunch in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When writer Eric Pearson sat down to watch Thunderbolts, something shocked him. Which was unexpected, considering Pearson is not just credited with creating the film's story but co-writing its screenplay with Joanna Calo. And yet, as the film unfolded, Pearson was surprised to see a character he had written a full and complete arc for, no longer make it to the end of the film. Pearson, who wrote Black Widow and helped write Fantastic Four: First Steps and Thor: Ragnarok, was surprised to see that Taskmaster, the Black Widow villain played by Olga Kurylenko, died in the film's first act. “When I sat down to watch the first cut, one thing was totally different and shocked the hell out of me, and it was that,” Pearson told Polygon. But that decision … it was decided after my work.” For example, her inclusion gave Ava (Hannah John-Kamen), who was similarly given powers in a lab, someone to relate to. “Ava, having won her autonomy earlier in the chronology than Taskmaster, was kind of big-sistering her a little bit, in a way of ‘how to break free and be your own person,'” Pearson says. In addition, because Taskmaster had memory issues, there was a running gag where she would forget everything that the group had been through and would keep trying to complete her task of killing John Walker (Wyatt Russell). “On the comedy side, she was struggling with her own memory-loss stuff, and there was a gag where she just kept restarting the fight and forgetting that they had made up and become friends,” Pearson said. Pearson isn't sure exactly why the character was cut, but he thinks her death certainly raised the stakes and that the memory plot line may have run up against a bigger throughline that was similar. “Bob was obviously having memory issues as a big part of his character.” And, of course, you couldn't cut Bob. Were you surprised, like one of the film's writers, that Taskmaster died? Do you think her survival would've helped the movie at all?

Microsoft specifically says "Devices running Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, versions 23H2, 22H2, and 21H2 that are not managed by IT departments will receive the update to version 24H2 automatically." Windows Latest spotted this bulletin and points out that, for many folks, Windows 11 24H2 is going to be downloaded whether you intend to install it or not. Microsoft says it's in the last phase of a gradual rollout for Windows 11 24H2. This phase began on Friday and will offer the newest version of Windows to anyone on version 10 or 11, which isn't affected by a compatibility hold. If you are on a storage-limited device, Microsoft's pushy behavior might therefore cause some issues. There are ways to cancel Windows 11 24H2's forced installation if a delay of up to four weeks offered by the system UI isn't enough for you. The linked Windows Latest post includes a few command prompt strings you can input, even if it has already started downloading. The most recent figures shared by StatCounter show that, in April, Windows 11 user market share moved to within single digit percentage points behind Windows 10. With just a few months left before Windows 10 reaches the end of support (October 14, 2025), Microsoft likely hopes that the Windows 11 user base will command a much larger proportion of user hearts and minds. Still, keeping the update path open and free for Windows 10 holdouts is a more than welcome measure. Many will likely want to take that path when October comes around.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine taking the bus on a hot summer day. New research, however, shows that this isn't always the case. In fact, sometimes it makes an already unpleasant situation even worse. Researchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston measured heat stress at bus stops in Houston between July 20 and August 7, 2023. As detailed in a study published earlier this year in the journal Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, they found that, on average, trees reduced heat stress by the same amount as the best bus shelter design—and that under certain conditions, one bus shelter actually made heat stress worse. “Heat stress is a combination of factors, not just the temperature you see on your phone's weather app or your car dash,” co-author Kevin Lanza said in a University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston statement. If the sun is also strong and hitting you, that continues to heat you up.” Standing in extreme heat for long periods of time puts people at risk of heat stroke, and that risk increases with high humidity, according to the statement. The team claims that its study is the first to investigate how shelters and trees at bus stops impact heat stress via ground measurements. The team investigated trees and four different bus shelter designs at 17 Houston bus stops, collecting data from both shaded and unshaded areas, when temperatures reached 95 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit (35 to 39.4 degrees Celsius). They factored in variables such as the time of day, shelter design, and tree canopies, and recorded wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT)—a measurement of heat stress that takes into account factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind. By contrast, bus shelters with an aluminum frame, a moderately domed roof, and translucent acrylic walls lowered the WBGT by 1.6 degrees. “Study results can serve as evidence for planting trees at bus stops for maximum cooling, and if shelters are the only option, then being strategic in design.” Simply put, this latest study joins a host of evidence suggesting that trees in cities are almost always a good idea.

My home office desk setup, with multiple screens and browser windows, helps me be very productive. Spatial computing—usually driven by a mixed reality headset or smart glasses—lets you craft a multi-monitor virtual workspace, where you can place apps and browser windows around your periphery to replicate the experience you have set up at home or the office. No one has been able to offer a reasonable experience—until now. I first saw Sightful's Spacetop spatial computing software in a hotel suite at CES 2023, before the company came out of stealth mode. In 2024, the company debuted the G1, a polished version ready for market, but Sightful CEO Tamir Berliner says the sudden advent of “AI PCs," which now offered enough power to drive a spatial computing experience, forced it to revisit its hardware. Instead of a custom laptop hardware sans display and software powered by Chromium, Sightful's new approach is to provide the smart glasses and let you download its Spacetop software onto a compatible Windows laptop. Despite working at a few coffee shops this past week, I've been just as efficient virtually as in my work-from-home setup. I already don't want to be without it. Spacetop for Windows is a piece of downloadable software, and it's designed to work with Xreal's Air 2 Ultra augmented reality glasses, which are included in your purchase. You can get prescription lens inserts for the glasses, as I did, meaning I could remove my eyeglasses to use the Xreal. If you have smart glasses from another company with similar features (namely, six degrees of freedom), you can reach out to Sightful to see if there's a solution to get Spacetop running on them. The company hopes to support a wider range of smart glasses over time. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. The caveat is that Spacetop has specific laptop requirements. The company says that as adoption grows, it may add support for other CPUs, like those from Qualcomm, and it hopes to have a working version for MacBooks in 2026. (You use the laptop's keyboard and trackpad to interface with Spacetop.) If you unplug the glasses and then plug them back in some time later, Spacetop still remembers your preferred layout, unless you close specific apps. You can push the virtual screens away from your eyes or closer, move them up or down, and even tilt them if you want to recline in a chair. Plus, I like that you can click on an empty space and drag the virtual screen to a specific app instead of turning your neck. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. I primarily used multiple Chrome browser windows and tabs, had the Telegram messaging client on top, and Slack over to the left. I even launched Zoom and had it on the right during video calls. I gave Adobe Lightroom Classic a shot, but the app began behaving strangely in Spacetop, so I didn't use it. Sightful says as much on its website: “We are still working to make advanced applications like video editors or 3D graphics software run smoothly.” Gaming also falls into that camp. No one can view your work, which is nice for handling sensitive information, and the only way around that on a traditional laptop is to use a privacy screen. At the moment, the laptop screen stays on when you're in Spacetop, but people will only be able to see a blank desktop. Speaking of which, I haven't used the HP OmniBook Ultra Flip as a normal laptop, so I can't confirm its regular battery stats, but HP claims “all-day battery life,” and various reviews of this laptop around the web seem to confirm this. With the AR glasses plugged in and Spacetop running, though, you're more likely to get roughly three to four hours of use, depending on what you're doing. I don't see this being a huge issue because most of the time you'd be using Spacetop will likely be in those short periods at a coffee shop or airport lounge, or heck, even on a plane. (There's a travel mode that lets you use Spacetop on fast-moving transportation.) And usually, if that's the case, there's probably a spot you can plug in your PC. So much of what makes Spacetop a joy to use is the glasses. More importantly, this isn't a bulky Apple Vision Pro—I wore Xreal's glasses for more than three hours in one sitting, and I can't imagine doing that with Apple's VR headset. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. This is especially handy if you're sitting in front of someone and working, but are occasionally chit-chatting. You won't look like a douchebag with these on, unlike if you wore Apple's Vision Pro in public, but it only takes a little more than a passing glance for someone to realize Xreal's Air 2 Ultra aren't sunglasses. I sat outside a busy coffee shop, and no one gave me weird looks, and I also felt far more comfortable wearing them in public. “You look like Dr. Strangelove," a coworker commented on the Zoom chat. The meeting notes capped it off: “The meeting was fine, but Julian may or may not look like an idiot.” I don't need to crane my neck and stare at a fixed laptop screen. The easiest solution is to just turn your video off (if you really care). All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. I haven't run into many bugs or issues with Spacetop—it feels remarkably slick. But here are a few: Sometimes, when I boot it up for the first time, I need to unplug the glasses and plug them back in for Spacetop to load, but Sightful says this is an HP-specific bug it's addressing soon. On another occasion, a few Chrome tabs struggled to load, but I haven't encountered that problem since. Sightful says Spacetop can accommodate any number of tabs and apps, but it all depends on the power of the processor in your laptop. You also can't ungroup or group browser tabs easily by dragging them; instead, I right-click the tab and tap “Move tab to another window.” It's not as user-friendly but at least there's a solution; Sightful says it's working on a fix. One annoying thing I dealt with was more of a Windows problem, where the trackpad would think my two-finger swipe up was a three-finger swipe up and would try to show the desktop. This looked jarring in Spacetop and disrupted my flow. Thankfully, I was able to turn it off in the Windows settings. It's for power users who have too many browser tabs open to count and have multi-monitor setups they miss when traveling. There are things that are still not supported, like screen sharing in apps like Zoom, but Sightful says it's on the road map, with more to come. The software hinges on the smart-glasses experience, which I imagine will continue to get smaller, thinner, lighter—maybe even wireless—until you can't tell them apart from regular eyeglasses. But for now, Sightful has crafted a practical and genuinely useful spatial computing experience that I haven't experienced before. There's almost no learning curve since it still very much feels like you're using a laptop, just with an expansive virtual screen that's yours to fill.

According to Twitter/X user @jisakuhibi, a Japanese retailer has listed the GPU for ¥1,630,600, which is approximately $11,326. We also spotted the GPU at UK-based online retailer Scan, which is accepting pre-orders for a PNY-branded RTX Pro 6000 graphics card at £7,859.99 (around $10,433). Last month the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell was spotted on a US-based IT retailer for enterprise customers, just days after the official announcement at GTC. The RTX Pro 6000 GPU primarily targets professionals working in high-performance computing, AI development, data science, content creation, and engineering visualization. It's designed for workstation users who need extreme levels of GPU acceleration for tasks such as complex simulations, large-scale AI model training, real-time ray tracing, and advanced 3D rendering. Based on the GB202 chip, the RTX Pro 6000 workstation-class GPU features 24,064 CUDA cores spread across 188 streaming multiprocessors with 128 CUDA cores each. For comparison, the RTX 5090, which is currently the most powerful consumer-grade GPU from Nvidia, also uses the GB202 chip but with a reduced core count of 21,760 CUDA cores, a peak clock of 2,410MHz, and 32GB of GDDR7 memory. However, as a pre-release product with early drivers, its full potential likely hasn't been realized yet. Power limitations and restricted memory access due to unfinished software further explain the current performance shortfall. While raw specifications of the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell are impressive, buying one, especially at these sky-high prices, seems impractical for typical enthusiasts. The GPU is clearly going to end up being a niche solution for enterprise and specialized professional workloads. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. This is the strongest Taiwan dollar appreciation in over 30 years, according to DigiTimes. Crucially, when a trading partner's currency gets stronger, it typically becomes more expensive to buy their goods. So, are we looking at even more upwards pressure on electronics heading to U.S. retail? DigiTimes shared statements and reports from some of Taiwan's major electronics players like Acer, Asus, Pegatron, Wistron, Foxxconn. It noted that most of these companies hold broad currency portfolios to lessen impacts / shocks when there is turbulence in exchange rates. However, if we are seeing the biggest currency valuation moves in over three decades, it is difficult to be prepared enough. One might hope this 10% dive in USD valuation is a temporary blip on the radar, or else there will be significant pressure on profit margins witnessed. The source publication, and others, indicate that semiconductor companies have larger profit margins, to afford some flexibility on their part. It says TSMC and UMC would be hurt similarly by this valuation shift. In summary, the Central Bank believes that the TWD has surged due to speculation about recent trade discussions between Taiwanese and American officials. Taiwan's Central Bank confirmed the country's economy remains strong. Last but not least, individuals and organizations with an eye on currencies should be wary of speculators seeking to move valuations, helped by "overly exaggerated or untrue market analysis, generating irrational expectations." Looking at live data, the Central Bank's statement seems to have stemmed TWD's appreciation vs USD, for now. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, Russian technology companies and executives have been widely sanctioned for supporting the Kremlin. Now cybersecurity researchers are warning that a widely used piece of open source code—which is linked to Kiriyenko's company and managed by Russian developers—may pose a “persistent” national security risk to the United States. The fear is that Russia could alter easyjson to steal data or otherwise be abused. “You have this really critical package that's basically a linchpin for the cloud native ecosystem, that's maintained by a group of individuals based in Moscow belonging to an organization that has this suspicious history,” says Hayden Smith, a cofounder at Hunted Labs. For decades, open source software has underpinned large swathes of the technology industry and the systems people rely on day to day. Open source technology allows anyone to see and modify code, helping to make improvements, detect security vulnerabilities, and apply independent scrutiny that's absent from the closed tech of corporate giants. Easyjson is a code serialization tool for the Go programming language and is often used across the wider cloud ecosystem, being present in other open source software, according to Hunted Labs. The package is hosted on GitHub by a MailRu account, which is owned by VK after the mail company rebranded itself in 2021. Easyjson has been available on Github since 2016, with most of its updates coming before 2020. Hunted Labs' analysis shared with WIRED shows the most active developers on the project in recent years have listed themselves as being based in Moscow. Smith says that Hunted Labs has not identified vulnerabilities in the easyjson code. Research from Hunted Labs details how code serialization tools could be abused by malicious hackers. “A Russian-controlled software package could be used as a ‘sleeper cell' to cause serious harm to critical US infrastructure or for espionage and weaponized influence campaigns,” it says. “Nation states take on a strategic positioning,” says George Barnes, a former deputy director at the National Security Agency, who spent 36 years at the NSA and now acts as a senior advisor and investor in Hunted Labs. Barnes says that hackers within Russia's intelligence agencies could see easyjson as a potential opportunity for abuse in the future. It's just lying there,” Barnes says, referencing Russia's foreign military and domestic security agencies. VK Group did not respond to WIRED's request for comment about easyjson. GitHub, a code repository owned by Microsoft, says that while it will investigate issues and take action where its policies are broken, it is not aware of malicious code in easyjson and VK is not sanctioned itself. After Britain sanctioned the leaders of Russian banks who own stakes in VK in September 2022, for example, Apple removed its social media app from its App Store. Dan Lorenc, the CEO of supply chain security firm Chainguard, says that with easyjson, the connections to Russia are in “plain sight” and that there is a “slightly higher” cybersecurity risk than those of other software libraries. He adds that the red flags around other open source technology may not be so obvious. “In the overall open source space, you don't necessarily even know where people are most of the time,” Lorenc says, pointing out that many developers do not disclose their identity or locations online, and even if they do, it is not always possible to verify the details are correct. Then in January this year, the Linux Foundation issued guidance covering how international sanctions can impact open source, saying developers should be cautious of who they interact with and the nature of interactions. Last year, corporate developers and the open source world were rocked as a mysterious attacker known as Jia Tan stealthily installed a backdoor in the widely used XZ Utils software, after spending two years diligently updating it without any signs of trouble. “Years ago, OSS was developed by small groups of trusted developers who were known to one another,” says Nancy Mead, a fellow of the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. “In that time frame, no one expected a trusted developer of being a hacker, and the relatively slower pace provided time for review. Scott Hissam, a senior member of technical staff also from the Carnegie Software Engineering Institute, says there can often be consideration about how many maintainers and the number of organizations that work on an open source project, but there is currently not a “mass movement” to consider other details about OSS projects. “However, it is coming, and there are several activities that collect details about OSS projects, which OSS consumers can use to get more insight into OSS projects and their activities,” Hissam says, pointing to two examples. Hunted Lab's Smith says he is currently looking into the provenance of other open source projects and the risks that could come with them, including scrutinizing countries known to have carried out cyberattacks against US entities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new species of bacteria that functions like electrical wiring has recently been discovered on a brackish beach in Oregon. This species is a type of cable bacteria: rod-shaped microbes that are connected at both ends to one another to create a chain and which share an outer membrane, forming filaments several centimeters long. This is due to their special metabolism, in which electrons generated by oxidizing sulfides in their deeper layers are sent to their surface layer, where they are received by oxygen and nitric acid. The 25 species of cable bacteria known so far have been organized into two genera, Candidatus Electrothrix, which live in saltwater, and Candidatus Electronema, which live in fresh and brackish water. The recently discovered species may provide new insights into how cable bacteria evolved and how they can function in diverse environments, Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University and coauthor of the research, explained in a statement. Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis is distinct from existing cable bacteria in its appearance. Cable bacteria have outer shells that feature ridges, which spread out like mountains. The ridges of the new species are much thicker than those of previously known species, reaching an average thickness of about 228 nanometers, up to three times thicker than what has been seen before. This sheath does not conduct electricity and is thought to protect the filament from the environment and foreign enemies. It is as if the structure itself was designed with an engineering intent. The new species' electrical resistance was approximately 370 kilo-ohms, which is equal to or better than that of known cable bacteria. Genomic analysis revealed that the new species has genetic features of both the Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema genera. This phenomenon, where genetically distinct material is intermingled within a single individual, is known as “mosaicism.” For example, this can be seen in the novel bacteria's cytochrome, a type of protein involved in electron transport. This new species is also unique in the way it adapts to saline environments. Candidatus Electrothrix species, which live in saltwater, typically use an electron-transfer enzyme called “sodium-transporting NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (NQR)” to regulate osmotic pressure. But this enzyme is absent in Candidatus Electrothrix yaqonensis, which instead has several proteins— “sodium and proton exchange transporters (NHE)”—that exchange sodium ions and protons across the cell membrane. This is thought to be the result of adaptation to the unique environment of brackish water, where salinity fluctuates. Its characteristics may also be useful for remediation of heavy metals and organic pollutants in sedimentary environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. Bryan Johnson is on a mission to not die. The 47-year-old multimillionaire has already applied his slogan “Don't Die” to events, merchandise, and a Netflix documentary. Now he's founding a Don't Die religion. Johnson, who famously spends millions of dollars on scans, tests, supplements, and a lifestyle routine designed to slow or reverse the aging process, has enjoyed extensive media coverage, and a huge social media following. Longevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. We spoke on the sidelines after lunch (conference plastic-lidded container meal for me; what seemed to be a plastic-free, compostable box of chicken and vegetables for him), and he sat with an impeccable posture, his expression neutral. Earlier that morning, Johnson, in worn trainers and the kind of hoodie that is almost certainly deceptively expensive, had told the audience about what he saw as the end of humanity. Specifically, he was worried about AI—that we face an “event horizon,” a point at which superintelligent AI escapes human understanding and control. It is this particular concern that ultimately underpins his Don't Die mission. First, humans must embrace the Don't Die ideology. Then we must ensure AI is aligned with preserving human existence. Were it not for AI, he says, he wouldn't be doing any of his anti-death activities and regimens. “I am convinced that we are at an existential moment as a species,” says Johnson, who was raised Mormon but has since left the church. Solving aging will take decades, he says—we'll survive that long only if we make sure that AI is aligned with human survival. The following Q&A has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Why are you creating a new religion? We're in this new phase where [because of advances in AI] we're trying to reimagine what it means to be human. Approaching that conversation as a community, or a lifestyle, doesn't carry enough weight or power. Religions have proven, over the past several thousand years, to be the most efficacious form to organize human efforts. How do you go about founding a new religion? If you look at historical [examples], Buddha went through his own self-exploratory process and came up with a framework. Jesus had an origin story … You might even say Satoshi [Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin] is like [the founder of] a modern-day religion, [launched] with the white paper. Adam Smith launched capitalism with his book. Your goal is to align AI with Don't Die—or, in other words, ensure that AI models prioritize and protect human life. I'm talking to a lot of AI researchers about this. Would you say that Don't Die is “your” religion? It's different from other religions, which are very founder-centric. I think this is going to be decentralized, and it will be something that everybody can make their own. We've been experimenting with this format of a Don't Die fam, where eight to 12 people get together on a weekly basis. It's patterned off of other groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. And then there's a part where people apologize to their body for something they've done that has inflicted harm upon themselves. If someone believes in God, that's fine. People can be Christian and do this; they can be Muslim and do this. Don't Die is a “yes, and” to all groups. So it's a different way of thinking about religion? Right now, religion doesn't hold the highest status in society. A lot of people look down on it in some way. I think as AI progresses, it's going to create additional questions on who we are: What is our identity? What do we believe about our existence in the future? People are going to want some kind of framework that helps them make sense of the moment. So I think there's going to be a shift toward religion in the coming years. People might say that [founding a religion now] is kind of a weird move, and that [religion] turns people off. Does the religion incorporate, or make reference to, AI in any way? And this is why we've been contemplating “the body is God.” Over the past couple of years … I've been testing the hypothesis that if I get a whole bunch of data about my body, and I give it to an algorithm, and feed that algorithm updates with scientific evidence, then it would eventually do a better job than a doctor. So I gave myself over to an algorithm. It really is in my best interest to let it tell me what to eat, tell me when to sleep and exercise, because it would do a better job of making me happy. Instead of my mind haphazardly deciding what it wants to eat based on how it feels in the moment, the body is elevated to a position of authority. AI is going to be omnipresent and built into our everyday activities. Might some people interpret that as AI being God? The thing we want to align upon is that none of us want to die right now. We're attempting to make Don't Die the world's most influential ideology in the next 18 months. Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages. Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical. But truly deleting your personal genetic information from the DNA testing company is easier said than done.

You have to live in another country for that benefit to be legible - I'm not sure most people living in the US would be aware of it.Tariff retaliation against US media could cause deep invisible harm to US interests.

Oh if this works out for Trump,  expect tv series to follow.

About half (and more than half depending on the content) of US film & TV sales comes from foreign markets.
