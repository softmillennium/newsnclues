                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Monday that he will ask Hollywood studios if "they're happy" with his proposal to impose tariffs of 100% percent films made outside of the United States. "So we're going to meet with the industry," he said. "I want to make sure they're happy with it because we're all about jobs." Trump's comments came a day after he said in a social media post that he was authorizing the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to "immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands." Trump did not detail how those tariffs would be implemented. But on Monday, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that "no final decision on foreign film tariffs have been made." Desai also said, "The Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard our country's national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again." Trump in his remarks later Monday to reporters, said that the U.S film industry "has been decimated by other countries taking them out, and also by incompetence, like in Los Angeles, the governor [Gavin Newsom] is a grossly incompetent man, he's just allowed it to be taken away from." A spokesperson for Newsom, in a statement, said, "Governor Newsom continues to champion California's iconic film and television industry — recognizing it as a cornerstone of the state's economy, one that sustains hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs across every sector around the state." "His plan to more than double the state's film and television tax credit reflects a commitment to keeping production here at home, supporting workers and maintaining California's global leadership in entertainment," the spokesperson said. "If the President announces a proposal with more details, we will review it." Spending on films and television series made in the United States has been dropping. But all major U.S. based film companies make movies overseas, complicating the questions of how a tariff on such films would be applied, and who it would benefit. "Tariffs typically apply to the import of 'goods,' so a tariff on DVD imports is easy to enforce and a tariff on intellectual property is nearly impossible to enforce," Alicia Reese, analyst at Wedbush wrote in a research note on Monday. The amount of money spent in the United States on films and TV series budgeted to $10 million or more has sharply fallen since 2021, while there has been an uptick in spending on films produced in the rest of the world. That rose to $24.6 billion last year, ProdPro data showed. "According to ProdPro's 2025 survey of studio executives, when asked what are the top criteria they consider when selecting a filming location, tax incentives is the # 1 consideration," ProdPro said in a statement to CNBC. "Other key factors include creative decisions, infrastructure, and local crew," the company said. "Our tracking shows that the US is seeing a decline in absolute numbers and market share, indicating that the productions are moving to other countries including Australia, [New Zealand], among other hubs with attractive incentives." ProdPro said that foreign exchange rates "have also disadvantaged US-based productions given the strength of the US dollar relative to other markets." — CNBC's Julia Boorstein contributed to this story Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI has bowed to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, announcing in a blog post on Monday that its nonprofit would retain control of the company even as it restructures into a public benefit corporation. The company, which is backed by Microsoft and was recently valued at $300 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank, said it made the decision after discussing the matter with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. "With the structure we're contemplating, the not-for-profit will remain in control of OpenAI," Bret Taylor, OpenAI's board chairman, said in a video call with reporters. "We will be converting the limited liability company, that is a subsidiary of that nonprofit, to a public benefit corporation. Taylor said OpenAI had commissioned outside financial advisors to consult on the recapitalization. He declined to share how much of a stake the nonprofit would have in the company, though it will be a majority. OpenAI is currently engulfed in a heated legal battle with Elon Musk, who co-founded the group as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. Musk is trying to keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit company as he competes in the generative AI market with his own startup, xAI. Altman was asked about the dispute on Monday's call. "We are obsessed with our mission and what it takes to fulfill that," he said. Led by Altman, OpenAI has been commercializing products in recent years, most notably its viral ChatGPT chatbot, which was launched in late 2022. The company is still overseen by a nonprofit parent and has faced significant hurdles in its goal to restructure into a for-profit, due largely to Musk. A Musk-led group offered to buy OpenAI in February for $97.4 billion, a bid that was swiftly rejected. OpenAI's hybrid structure has included a capped-profit limited partnership that was created in 2019. The original nonprofit is the controlling shareholder and would have been spun out as an independent entity if OpenAI had succeeded in its efforts. With that change no longer taking place, OpenAI's investors receive convertible notes that will turn into equity. A group of ex-OpenAI employees, Nobel laureates, law professors and civil society organizations sent a letter last month to attorneys general in California and Delaware requesting that they halt the startup's restructuring efforts out of safety concerns. In the letter, which was delivered to OpenAI's board, the group wrote that restructuring to a for-profit entity would "subvert OpenAI's charitable purpose," and "remove nonprofit control and eliminate critical governance safeguards." Page Hedley, OpenAI's former policy and ethics advisor — and lead organizer of Not For Private Gain, the group that wrote the letter — said in a statement that while it's a positive step that the company is listening to concerns, "crucial questions remain." One is around whether OpenAI's commercial goals will "continue to be legally subordinate to its charitable mission," and another is, "Who will own the technology that OpenAI develops?" Taylor shared what he called a "technical detail" about the board makeup after restructuring There will be a separate board for the public benefit corporation, but the nonprofit will appoint those directors, and "on day one, we plan on having the same directors for both," Taylor said. In a letter to employees that was part of Monday's blog post, Altman said that OpenAI remains committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI), which rivals or surpasses human intelligence, "benefits all of humanity." But a lot has changed in the nine years since he co-founded the lab, he said. "We could not contemplate the direct benefits of AI being used for medical advice, learning, productivity, and much more, or the needs for hundreds of billions of dollars of compute to train models and serve users."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is overhauling its compensation model to more clearly reward sustained top performance while reducing payouts for some lower performers. According to internal guidelines obtained by Business Insider, Amazon is revising its compensation structure within pay bands to better recognize and reward long-term high performers. Employees who earn a "Top Tier" performance rating for four consecutive years will now receive 110% of their pay range, exceeding the usual cap. In contrast, first-time Top Tier recipients will get 70% of their pay band, down from 80% last year. The changes put Amazon in step with other Big Tech giants that are streamlining employee rewards and tightening overall costs. Amazon's spokesperson told BI that the updated model "better distinguishes" those with consistent excellence. "As always, employees' contributions drive the outcome of their annual compensation review," Amazon's spokesperson said. "What's different this year is that our approach to compensation changes now better distinguishes between newer high performers and those who have consistently exceeded expectations for their role and level." Amazon's 12-month pay cycle for corporate employees typically starts in April. Most rank-and-file employees receive their pay updates in early April. Although Amazon considers various factors when determining employee pay, individual performance ratings—internally known as "Overall Value"—are a key driver. This year, more weight is being placed on an employee's rating history. Amazon's pay structure has long sparked internal frustration, partly due to its lack of transparency and the competitive nature of employee rankings, as BI previously reported. This year's guidelines also said Amazon will continue to run the pilot program that allows employees to take 25% of their new stock awards in cash. Stock compensation has traditionally accounted for a large portion of Amazon's total pay, but it has become less appealing to employees seeking more immediate financial returns. Despite the recalibration, Amazon says most employees who showed improvement still saw increases this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blood testing startup Function Health on Monday announced the acquisition of full-body MRI scanning company Ezra and launched a new, 22-minute scan for $499. Function offers a $499 annual subscription where members complete more than 160 blood tests and track their results over time. The company said adding Ezra's scanning technology to its platform will allow its users to screen for more conditions and access a more complete picture of their health. "It makes so much sense," Jonathan Swerdlin, the co-founder and CEO of Function, said in an interview. Before Monday's announcement, Ezra's cheapest offering was a 30-minute scan that cost participants $1,495. Ezra, founded in 2018, offers a range of full-body MRI scans that can help patients detect cancer and other conditions. Full-body MRI scans have surged in popularity in recent years after celebrities like Kim Kardashian began posting about them on social media. Medical experts have mixed feelings about the screenings, in part because they're expensive, can result in unnecessary care and can cause patients to worry. Ezra's primary competitor is Prenuvo, another full-body MRI scanning startup. In February, Prenuvo announced that it closed a $120 million funding round, and it also launched a new blood test to provide insights into patients' hormonal, cardiovascular, metabolic and immune health. Function is reportedly seeking more than $200 million in fresh capital at a valuation of around $2 billion, according to a February report from Bloomberg. Emi Gal, the founder and CEO of Ezra, said he has known Function's Swerdlin for years, and that the two began chatting last year about potentially collaborating through a commercial partnership. Over time, though, he said it became clear that an acquisition ultimately made more sense. The company was able to shorten its new scan time to 22 minutes by leveraging artificial intelligence that was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January, Gal said. The new 22-minute scan will be available to Function members starting on Monday. Function does not publicly disclose how many patients subscribe to its platform, but Swerdlin said it's in the "hundreds of thousands." Dr. Mark Hyman, co-founder and the chief medical officer of Function, said acquiring Ezra was a natural part of Function's evolution. "What used to be the domain of the wealthy is now accessible to everybody, including comprehensive imaging," Hyman said in an interview. "It truly makes a difference for people and saves lives."

EToro offers a platform where users can trade and follow top investors in assets including stocks and crypto.

EToro Group Ltd. and some of its shareholders are seeking to raise as much as $500 million in a US initial public offering, after the trading and investment platform paused its listing plans amid tariff-related stock volatility.

The Israel-based company and some of its shareholders are offering 10 million shares for $46 to $50 each, according to a filing Monday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. At the top of the price range, EToro would have a market value of about $4 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is now offering $1,000 stipends and travel assistance to undocumented immigrants who volunteer to depart the U.S. for their countries of origin. "If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Monday. "This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens and is a 70% savings for U.S. taxpayers," said Noem. "Self-deportation" is the Trump administration's term for returning to your home country if you do not have explicit authorization to live in the U.S. DHS said it currently costs, on average, $17,121 to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented immigrant. In a Monday interview with Fox News, border czar Tom Homan said the program will save costs and relieve "resources to focus more on the criminals." "It's going to be extreme cost savings, first of all, for the right people, and I think it's going to help remove those that want to come back under a legal program," Homan said. A fact sheet says users will receive a $1,000 stipend only after their arrival in their country of origin is confirmed through the app. Crucially, DHS also said immigrants who sign up for the departure program will be "deprioritized for detention and removal ahead of their departure as long as they demonstrate they are making meaningful strides in completing that departure." The agency said the new program has already been used by one person who left Chicago to return to Honduras. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gates, who is also chairman of the non-profit Gates Foundation, was speaking at the opening dinner of Ecosperity in Singapore on Monday, the flagship sustainability event for state investor Temasek. In a fireside chat with Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action Ravi Menon, Gates said that rich countries must get to net zero, regardless of "whether the entire world gets to [net zero]." "There are levels of emissions that are small enough that the temperature worsening actually is not a problem," he said. Therefore, it is not a must for all countries to achieve "absolute zero," but richer countries must do so in order to show that there are solutions to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. Net zero is defined by the United Nations as "cutting carbon emissions to a small amount of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere." Gates also called for the world to be more bold with innovation investments that seek to combat climate change, saying that even though he was a huge believer in innovation, "the notion that the entire world is going to get [to net zero] by 2050 is at this point not realistic. "The UN has said that to keep global warming to no more than 1.5°C  — as called for in the Paris Agreement — emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Gates said, pointing out that the main obstacles include securing risk capital to fund these solutions. On Monday, Gates also met with Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who said in the Gates Foundation would be setting up an office in the city state. "We had a wide-ranging conversation on the challenges ahead, from clean energy to vaccine development. Singapore looks forward to working closely with the Gates Foundation to advance innovation and improve lives — here in Asia and around the world," Wong said in a Facebook post. The former Microsoft CEO also met with Singapore Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong to discuss how the foundation could work with more entities in the country, such as universities. "We welcome the Gates Foundation and others to continue to bring their businesses and interests here to Singapore and invest in our ecosystem and deepen our ties with the region," Lee said in a post on Facebook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The effort, called 100 Zeros, is a multiyear partnership with Range Media Partners, the talent firm and production company whose notable films include "A Complete Unknown" and "Longlegs." It's tasked with identifying projects that Google can help fund or produce. (The companies wouldn't comment on a number or timeframe.) The company sees it as a way to get the creative community to adopt its newer tech products and services, like its Immersive View feature that lets you see things in 3D, spatial tools that blend the physical and virtual worlds, and AI. Google also wants to promote a positive view of its products — and tech generally — through entertainment to young audiences by helping shape pop culture. Last year, 100 Zeros quietly dipped a toe in the water, putting some marketing dollars behind an indie horror film from Neon, "Cuckoo." Google didn't seek any publicity for the move, but it was indicative of the alignments it wants: A celebrated indie studio ("Parasite," "Anora") and a movie aimed at Gen Z and starring Hunter Schafer, known for "Euphoria" and the "Hunger Games" franchise. In another step in that direction, Google and Range announced a partnership this spring called "AI On Screen" to commission short films about AI, with the goal of making two into feature films. Here's how it described one of the shorts, "Sweetwater": "When the son of a late celebrity visits his childhood home, a piece of fan mail reveals a startling AI, forcing him to reconcile his mother's legacy." "Through our continued partnership with Range, we aim to collaborate with the Hollywood creative community in a thoughtful and productive way, upkeeping our ongoing commitment to responsibly support creative expression and explore the possibilities of technology through storytelling," a Google spokesperson said in a statement. In projects where Google is involved early on, the company wouldn't mind if characters clutched Android phones instead of iPhones and used its features like "Circle to Search." Google has a separate effort with United Talent Agency for marketing partnerships like its recent ones with "The White Lotus" and "Wicked" to promote the Pixel. Apple has gained a strong following with Gen Z with its luxury image and blue text bubbles that can make Android users feel left out. Piper Sandler's spring survey found 88% of US teens owned an iPhone. Beyond Android, Google search is losing its hold on young people, who are increasingly going to AI or other platforms like Amazon and TikTok for answers to their questions. Consumer brands are increasingly using Hollywood-style entertainment to spread their messages, as it's gotten harder to get people's attention with traditional ads. Google's efforts are similar to those of Waffle Iron Entertainment, a studio Nike set up to make original entertainment that aligns with the company's goals while operating at arm's length. 100 Zeros has a small dedicated staff: Penny Lin, a film producer at Range, and development execs Casey Durant and Tony Nguyen. Rachel Douglas, partner and manager at Range, oversees the relationship with Google. "This initiative is different in that it's staffed by full-time people who come out of Hollywood and are housed at and supported by Range," Douglas said of 100 Zeros. Consumer brands' flirtation with films isn't guaranteed to last. Some have been halting or slowing film projects amid President Donald Trump's tariffs and attacks on DEI. Even before the tariff news hit, some corporations that had made commitments to the space — including Starbucks, Marriott, and Southwest Airlines — laid off marketers who worked in filmed entertainment as a part of larger corporate cuts, a reminder of the tenuous nature of the work. One aspect of 100 Zeros that people might find surprising is that it's not looking to leverage YouTube as a primary distribution platform. But 100 Zeros isn't trying to recreate YouTube Originals, the platform's onetime stab at making original shows, or even use YouTube as the first stop for these projects.</p>

The US dollar got a fresh jolt to start the week as speculation around potential trade deals sparked an extraordinary spike in Taiwan's currency and reverberated across global foreign exchange markets.

Already under pressure as President Donald Trump's economic agenda dents attitudes around American assets, the greenback weakened further on Monday against most major currencies, with a Bloomberg gauge of the dollar falling about 0.2% as of 1:20 p.m. in New York. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold prices rose on Monday ahead of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision later this week. Gold has hit a number of record highs this year. This came amid fears of an economic slowdown, tariff uncertainty, and central bank purchases driving up demand. This is despite President Donald Trump's criticisms about keeping interest rates unchanged. Deutsche Bank said in a note on Monday that its US economists "expect the Fed to keep rates steady and avoid explicit forward guidance about the policy path ahead." Deutsche Bank analysts said they "continue to see the next rate cut coming in December." Meanwhile, strategists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Sunday that the Federal Open Market Committee "appears to be setting a higher bar for rate cuts than during the 2019 trade war." They added: "With inflation and survey-based inflation expectations now much higher, participants will want to see more compelling evidence that the economy is slowing and rate cuts are needed before they act." Gold is up against a weaker US dollar, which is down almost 0.4% against its rival currencies since its previous close on Friday. The metal is seen as a popular "safe-haven" asset amid ongoing economic uncertainty. "Safe-haven" assets are those that typically maintain their value during periods of market turbulence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international volunteer who fought in Ukraine told Business Insider that Russia's armed forces have such a reputation for brutality that his unit agreed never to be captured alive. Russian forces are "incredibly dangerous, oftentimes fanatical or desperate people that would torture you and kill you if they caught you," said Macer Gifford, the nom de guerre of British former trader Harry Rowe. He spoke to BI's Authorized Account about the realities of fighting Russia, and the tough decisions his unit had to take. While some Russians have reported torture and ill-treatment at the hands of Ukrainian captors, it has largely happened at the point of capture and "stopped when prisoners arrived at official places of internment," a UN investigation found last year. This includes beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence, suffocation, sleep deprivation, and mock executions, it said. There have also been killings: Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr Matsievsky became a cause célèbre after he was forced to dig his own grave before being shot in captivity, the BBC reported. "Russia has gone to every depth of depravity you could possibly imagine," Gifford said. That's why his unit entered into a pact — even expelling one member who tried to surrender during a firefight, he said. Gifford believes that Russian forces learned many of their more brutal tactics in Syria. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave military support to Syria's then-president, Bashar Assad, starting in 2015, supplying military equipment and air strikes to push back rebel groups, including the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. But it's the jihadist group that appears to have provided a model for Russian troops in Ukraine, Gifford said. Gifford recalled how, during his time fighting in Syria, he would find cages, torture instruments, and mattresses with chains next to them for holding female captives in Islamic State-controlled areas. "I thought that the Islamic State was a fringe, that it was a unique thing," he said, but in his view, "many of their brutal practices have been adopted by Russia — mainly, I suppose, because they were so effective in Syria," he added. But while Russia leads in scale — its army is on track to grow to 1.5 million active troops — its forces have been "decimated" in Ukraine, he said. Russia's approach to war is about scale and "meat wave" attacks in which astonishing numbers of casualties are tolerated, Gifford said. Russia is just fighting for more territory, and that's the difference." But Gifford stressed that Ukraine's allies need to stop seeing the war as "a conflict on the edge of Europe," and that for Putin it means much more. For him, it's "a war of annihilation," Gifford said. The Russian Ministry of Defence didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said he called Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, who immediately agreed not to display tariff costs next to product prices after they spoke. In an interview with NBC News' Meet the Press, which aired Sunday, host Kristen Welker asked the president about his call with Bezos. This was shortly after media outlet Punchbowl News said in a Tuesday report that Amazon would soon start displaying tariff charges beside the product's price, a claim Amazon denied. I asked him about it," Trump told Welker. Amazon and a representative for Bezos didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from BI about Trump's call with Bezos. In a statement last week, Amazon said one of its teams considered listing import charges on certain products, but that idea hadn't been approved and wasn't going to happen. Welker asked if Trump would "take that same tactic with other CEOs." Welker also asked Trump if he was punishing CEOs who passed tariff costs to consumers. He said, "I want them to build plants in the United States. Bezos's net worth has plunged by over $30 billion since January. On January 20, it was $245 billion, but as of May 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, it had dropped to $212 billion. Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries except China. His tariff rate for China now stands at 145%. On Thursday, Amazon reported that it had taken a $1 billion hit in one-time charges in its latest quarter, linked to tariffs and customer returns. Since Trump's tariffs have gone into effect, there have also been price hikes on some of its most popular items, including home appliances, snacks, and clothing. Despite criticism of his tariff policies, Trump has held fast. In a Truth Social post on Easter, the president said businesspeople who have criticized his tariffs are bad at both business and politics.</p>
