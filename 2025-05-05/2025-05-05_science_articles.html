The survey asked more than 3,000 UK teens about their experiences using social media.Credit: Ute Grabowsky/Photothek/Getty The study, published today in Nature Human Behaviour1, explores how teens with specific mental-health conditions use social media, finding that participants with disorders such as anxiety and depression are more vulnerable to negative online experiences than are those with conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The results are “a good warning to families that if your youth is vulnerable because of anxiety, a tendency to have depression or be low in mood, then social media is something that really needs to be carefully monitored”, says Anne Marie Albano, a clinical child and adolescent psychologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. Sixteen per cent of respondents had at least one mental-health condition. Of those, 8% had ‘internalizing' conditions, such as depression and anxiety — characterized by negative emotions towards the self — and 3% had externalizing conditions, such as ADHD, characterized by negative emotions towards others. Those with internalizing conditions were also more affected by comments or reactions to their posts and had less control over how much time they spent on platforms.

Nature Human Behaviour (2025)Cite this article Concerns about the relationship between social media use and adolescent mental health are growing, yet few studies focus on adolescents with clinical-level mental health symptoms. This limits our understanding of how social media use varies across mental health profiles. In this Registered Report, we analyse nationally representative UK data (N = 3,340, aged 11–19 years) including diagnostic assessments by clinical raters alongside quantitative and qualitative social media measures. As hypothesized, adolescents with mental health conditions reported spending more time on social media and were less happy about the number of online friends than adolescents without conditions. We also found hypothesized differences in social media use by condition type: adolescents with internalizing conditions reported spending more time on social media, engaging in more social comparison and experiencing greater impact of feedback on mood, alongside lower happiness about the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure. In contrast, those with externalizing conditions only reported higher time spent. These findings emphasize the need to consider diverse adolescent mental health profiles in policy and clinical practice. Adolescents around the world have experienced a decline in their mental health over the past decade1. Recent UK data suggests that one in six 7–16-year olds and one in four 17–19-year olds have a probable mental health condition, a clear rise from the one in nine and one in ten recorded in 2017, respectively2. As 48% of those with a mental health condition first experience relevant symptoms before the age of 18 years3, this increased mental health burden will negatively impact society and the economy, as well as adolescent and adult life4. Many have raised concerns that this trend has been caused, at least in part, by increased adolescent social media use, which has revolutionized how adolescents live, learn and interact: 93% of 12–17-year olds now report having a social media profile5. To address these concerns, academic investigation of social media use and adolescent mental health has increased substantially in recent years6. Research teams have recruited adolescent populations in schools, universities or as part of broader community-based samples to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal links between increased smartphone or social media use and scores on questionnaires of depression7,8, anxiety9, disordered eating10 and other mental health symptoms10,11,12. These studies have primarily found small positive associations. Some researchers have used these to argue that there exists a causal link between social media use and mental health declines (that is, “screen time, perhaps especially social media, may have larger effects on adolescent girls' mental health than on boys' and that is indeed what we found, with social media significantly correlated with depressive symptoms […]”13 p. 13). Such arguments, in turn, have been used to call for restrictive policy regulations to limit smartphone and social media use in adolescent age groups14. However, many researchers have also questioned the strength of the current evidence base and highlighted that existing studies do not support the idea that there is a causal relationship linking social media use to mental health. Indeed, the literature provides many conflicting results15. Researchers have not only debated about a lack of longitudinal or causal evidence16, but have also disagreed about what effect sizes matter17,18,19 and how to deal with the substantial individual differences present20,21, which have been linked to factors such as age22, gender23,24 and ethnicity25. Across these topics of debate, however, researchers have largely overlooked how the kind of instruments used to measure mental health, as well as the populations being studied, limits their ability to draw meaningful inferences about the relationship of social media with adolescent mental health in the first place. So far, most studies have examined school- or community-based adolescent samples15,16,26, relating scores on mental health questionnaires (for example, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale9,27) to time spent on social media. The rationale for doing so is that questionnaires capturing continuous clinical symptoms are informative when reasoning about social media use in relation to the whole spectrum of mental health, across types of severity and clinical presentation. However, this approach is not a suitable surrogate for studying links between social media and mental health in adolescents with versus without mental health conditions, for two main reasons. First, it reduces the complexity of clinical presentations to the tail end of variation in selected mental health symptoms among mostly healthy individuals. Second, it ignores the potentially important differences between those who endorse symptoms on a questionnaire and those who reach diagnostic criteria in standard clinical classifications. For example, an adolescent can score very highly on a questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms, but not meet the criteria for a diagnosis if the queried symptoms have only been present for a short time or if they are better explained by a different condition or situation. To address this issue, select studies have moved beyond such an approach, dichotomizing symptom severity by applying cut-off scores to mental health questionnaires to reflect the presence or absence of a mental health diagnosis23. However, dichotomization does not solve many of the problems highlighted above and is known to have low sensitivity when predicting clinical diagnoses. Indeed, those with a mental health condition can score below the threshold on some scales28,29. In other words, although researchers would like to demonstrate the presence or absence of specific links between mental health conditions and social media use, the measures of psychopathology they employ might not be appropriate for these goals. Importantly, the assumption that patterns of social media use found in non-clinical or community samples will generalize to those with mental health conditions has not yet been systematically tested. To our knowledge, only a few studies—most qualitative—have documented different social media use experiences in clinical adolescent populations, including those fulfilling stringent diagnostic criteria for a clinical condition, attending mental health services or being hospitalized for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts30,31,32,33. Adolescents in these studies reported both positive and negative social media experiences, such as enhanced social connection and trouble downregulating their use. Broadly speaking, these experiences aligned with established risk and protective factors previously linked to mental health in offline spaces and suggest there is no clear-cut positive or negative association between mental health and social media use. The studies also raise the idea that vulnerable youth might experience heightened emotional responses to social media use. However, this has not been directly assessed due to the lack of non-clinical comparison groups. Such comparisons are therefore necessary to identify differences in social media use between adolescents with and without mental health conditions. Owing to the lack of research among young people with mental health conditions26, the important question of whether social media use varies across different types of conditions also remains unaddressed. For example, an adolescent with an internalizing condition (for example, generalized anxiety disorder or depressive disorder) might use and feel impacted by social media differently than an adolescent with an externalizing condition (for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or conduct disorder). This is because, despite both groups presenting mental health symptoms at clinical levels, their experiences of psychopathology can be qualitatively different. Internalizing conditions involve negative emotionality towards the self, expressed through ruminative thought patterns, worries and social withdrawal34. On the contrary, externalizing conditions involve negative emotionality towards others, expressed through impulsivity, risk taking and disinhibition35. Studies that assess mental health with select questionnaires cannot comprehensively account for and investigate such clinical diversity. This is a substantial shortcoming, given the need for research to understand how social media use relates to the growing number of adolescents experiencing mental health symptoms at clinical levels. This Registered Report provides critical data and evidence-based insights into how social media and mental health are related across adolescent populations who meet and do not meet diagnostic criteria for a wide range of mental health conditions. Given the cross-sectional nature of the data and planned analyses, the study results do not provide causal evidence. Hence, all reported coefficients indicate associations, with the possibility of bidirectional relationships and third variables affecting social media use, mental health or the relationship between the two. We analysed the nationally representative Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) study36, a cross-sectional survey carried out by National Health Service (NHS) Digital in 2017 that collected data from over 3,000 adolescents (11–19 years old) in England. In place of completing self-report measures of mental health, the participants in this study underwent multi-informant standardized diagnostic assessments evaluated by professional clinical raters for different mental health conditions (Table 1). We note that, in the stage 1 report, the terms ‘clinical and non-clinical population' were used, but in stage 2 this was changed to ‘adolescents with and without mental health conditions' to clarify that participants in this study were not recruited or diagnosed by a clinic, but instead underwent the mental health assessment as part of the MHCYP study. Further, to gain a comprehensive understanding of how social media use differs across adolescents with and without a mental health condition, we examined both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of social media use. Measuring only time spent provides a crude and simplistic estimate of social media use, conflating distinct analytical levels and missing a rich range of psychological factors such as appraisal and motivations that might vary as a function of mental health37. Researchers have therefore called for quantitative time-based measures of social media use to be complemented by more qualitative engagement-based measures capturing adolescents' social media activities and their appraisal of them16,38,39,40,41,42. Such practice is, however, still relatively rare. In this Registered Report, we included both types of measures, namely, time spent on social media and dimensions of social media engagement that could incur mental health risks (that is, online social comparison, monitoring and impact of online feedback and lack of control over time spent online) or benefits (that is, online friendship, as well as opportunities for honest self-disclosure and authentic self-presentation). By complementing quantitative and qualitative dimensions of social media use, this work provides a more solid foundation for mechanistic research aimed at informing future targeted interventions, clinical practice and policy actions benefitting adolescent mental health. We used existing literature on adolescents' mental health in relation to both online and offline contexts (Table 2) to guide our hypotheses and analyses of the data along three lines of enquiry. Specifically, we evaluated whether social media use differs in adolescents with versus without a mental health condition (Question 1), with an internalizing or externalizing condition versus without a condition (Question 2) and with an internalizing versus externalizing condition (Question 3). First, we expected adolescents with any mental health condition to report engaging with social media differently than those without a condition. For instance, gathering information about peers is particularly important during adolescence when young people develop a sense of personal and social identity43. However, high levels of upward social comparison (that is, comparisons with those believed to be of higher status than the self) have been associated with poorer mental health44,45,46,47,48. Previous work suggests that most social comparisons made on social media sites are upward rather than downward49, possibly because individuals tend to portray themselves in an ideal manner online50,51. Social media could further amplify these processes as platforms offer continuous and more concrete opportunities for comparing oneself with others, such as browsing profiles without initiating social interaction52. Indeed, engagement in self-denigrating online social comparisons was a common theme raised by adolescent psychiatric inpatients during qualitative interviews31. We therefore expected adolescents with a mental health condition to engage in more online social comparison than those without a condition (hypothesis H1.1b). Similarly (see Table 2 for a detailed overview of the literature in support of each hypothesis), we expected them to spend more time on social media8,15 (H1.1a), report more lack of control over time spent online31,53 (H1.1c), while also monitoring54,55 (H1.1 d) and feeling more impacted by online feedback56,57 (H1.1e). In contrast, we expected adolescents with any condition to engage less with social media in ways that might be protective for their mental health. For instance, we hypothesized that adolescents with a mental health condition are less happy with the number of friends they have online than adolescents without a condition (H1.2f). This is because social connections protect against long-term adverse physical and emotional outcomes, particularly during adolescence48, and young people with mental health conditions often report difficulties with peers, having few friends and wanting to be alone58,59,60. Similarly, we expected adolescents with a mental health condition to engage in less honest online self-disclosure61,62 (H1.2g) and authentic online self-presentation63,64 (H1.2h) compared with adolescents without a condition (Table 2). Second, we predicted social media use to vary between adolescents with different symptomatology, focusing specifically on how the social media use of adolescents with an internalizing or externalizing condition (Table 1) differed from those without a condition. We knowfrom the mental health literature that internalizing conditions involve negative self-views, rumination, worries and social withdrawal34,65. Notably, these symptoms could be relevant to how young people present themselves and engage with others on social media31,32,66. For instance, adolescents with internalizing conditions are more likely to notice discrepancies between their ideal and actual selves67 and may compensate for these discrepancies via impression management offline. We expect this process to also occur online, given the multiple affordances social media platforms offer to curate one's image (for example, deleting old posts and editing new posts). Hence, we hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would be less likely to engage in authentic self-presentation on social media than adolescents without a mental health condition68,69,70 (H2.2h). Further (Table 2), we hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would spend more time on social media8,15,71 (H2.1a), engage in more online social comparison30 (H2.1b) and online feedback monitoring54 (H2.1d), feel more impacted by online feedback56 (H2.1e), be less happy about online friends (H2.2f) and engage in less honest self-disclosure62 (H2.2g) than those without a condition. In contrast, we did not expect a difference in whether they perceive a lack of control over the time they spend online (H2.0c)53. Compared with internalizing conditions, externalizing conditions involve impulsivity, low self-monitoring and risk taking34,65. These symptoms could be reflected in how social media is used by these groups. Hence, we hypothesized that adolescents with externalizing conditions would be more likely than adolescents without a condition to spend more time on social media72 (H2.3a) and perceive they lack control over the time they spend online53 (H2.3c). Further, we expected them to also be more dissatisfied with their number of online friends73 (H2.4f). In contrast, we did not expect differences in the other dimensions of social media use (H2.0b,d,e,g,h; Table 2), since they primarily relate to symptoms of internalizing rather than externalizing conditions. Our third question examined whether adolescents with internalizing conditions use social media differently than those with externalizing conditions. Specifically, we expected adolescents with internalizing conditions to report engaging in more online social comparison30 (H3.1b) and online feedback monitoring55 (H3.1d), feeling more impacted by online feedback56 (H3.1e), engaging in less honest self-disclosure61 (H3.2g) and less authentic self-presentation on social media69 (H3.2h) than those with externalizing conditions. In contrast, we expected adolescents with externalizing conditions to report having less control over the time they spend online53,73 compared to adolescents with internalizing conditions (H3.2c). Further, since adolescents with internalizing conditions tend to be unhappy with their social status74 and adolescents with externalizing conditions tend to have trouble making and keeping friends in both online and offline contexts73,75, we expect both groups to be similarly dissatisfied with their number of online friends (H3.0f). We also hypothesized that both groups would not differ in the amount of time they spend on social media (H3.0a), given that both adolescents with internalizing and externalizing symptoms have been reported to spend more time on social media than adolescents without these symptoms33,76. Altogether, this study comprehensively maps and compares different dimensions of social media use in adolescents with and without mental health conditions. Hence, it will lay the foundation for future mechanistic and translational research studying which specific social media dimensions relate to mental health in different adolescent groups. This will be a crucial first step to inform translational research and clinical practice, as well as the design of targeted interventions and policies to improve children's and adolescents' mental health. Our final sample included 3,340 young people (Table 3) aged 11–19 (mean 14.77, s.d. The sample was 50% male and 50% female, 16% of participants had at least one mental health condition (N = 519), 8% had an internalizing condition (N = 282) and 3% had an externalizing condition (N = 104). Descriptive statistics split by social media items, sex and diagnostic groups are reported in Supplementary Tables 5–8 and Supplementary Figs. Further, an overview of our hypotheses and results is provided in Supplementary Table 9. We first compared adolescents with versus without mental health conditions, irrespective of condition type (Fig. In line with our hypothesis, we found that adolescents with any mental health condition reported spending more time on social media than adolescents without a condition (H1.1a; g = 0.46 (90% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.54); NHST (null hypothesis significance testing): 𝛽 = 0.87, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = 10.48, P = 2.745 × 10−25; EQV (equivalence testing): t(633.8) = 1.21, P = 0.916). Specifically, differences were positive, statistically significant and non-equivalent. That is, we could not reject differences as large or larger than our preregistered equivalence bounds (smallest effect size of interest (SESOI), g = 0.4), indicating potentially meaningful differences between adolescents with and without a condition. On the contrary, the results did not support our hypothesis for online social comparison (H1.1b; g = 0.30 (90% CI 0.22 to 0.39); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.42, s.e.m. of 0.07, t = 6.52, P = 7.973 × 10−11; EQV: t(641.08) = −1.89, P = 0.026), lack of control over time spent online (H1.1c; g = 0.27 (90% CI 0.19 to 0.35); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.39, s.e.m. of 0.07, t = 5.52, P = 3.614 × 10−8; EQV: t (674.42) = −2.68, P = 0.002) and impact of online feedback on mood (H1.1e; g = 0.29 (90% CI 0.21 to 0.38); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.38, s.e.m. of 0.06, t = 6.36, P = 2.269 × 10−10; EQV: t(608.98) = −2.06, P = 0.016). For these dimensions of social media engagement, effect sizes were positive, statistically significant but equivalent (that is, they fell within the preregistered SESOIs). This indicates a difference that is too small to be theoretically meaningful between adolescents with and without a mental health condition. Last, for monitoring of online feedback, we found differences that were not statistically significant and also equivalent, indicating no statistically nor theoretically meaningful differences between adolescents with versus without a condition (H1.1d; g = 0.08 (90% CI −0.01 to 0.15) NHST: 𝛽 = 0.11, s.e.m. of 0.07, t = 1.55, P = 0.121; EQV: t (653.24) = −6.47, P = 0.000). Top: hypothesis 1 (H1, any mental health condition versus no condition). Middle: hypothesis 2 (H2, internalizing/externalizing versus no condition). Bottom: hypothesis 3 (H3, internalizing versus externalizing condition). Data are presented as mean differences based on Hedges's g effect size (g) and its corresponding 90% CI. The shaded area indicates the SESOI (g = 0.4, corresponding to d = 0.4). If the 90% CI lies completely within the SESOI, we concluded equivalence, and therefore no meaningful differences. Bolded effect sizes reflect comparisons that supported our hypothesis, while faded effect sizes reflect comparisons that did not support our hypotheses. The starting sample size includes social media users (N = 519 for adolescents with any mental health condition, N = 282 for internalizing conditions, N = 104 for externalizing conditions and N = 2,821 for no mental health condition). However, the exact sample sizes for each comparison are reported in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6 and differ for each dimension of social media use, given that we planned to analyse those separately. We further hypothesized that adolescents with any mental health condition would score lower than adolescents without a condition on dimensions of social media use that could incur mental health benefits, namely, happiness about the number of online friendships (H1.2f), honest self-disclosure (H1.2g) and authentic self-presentation (H1.2h). In line with our hypothesis, we found lower happiness about the number of online friendships (H1.2f; g = −0.37 (90% CI −0.45 to −0.29); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.33, s.e.m. of 0.04, t = −8.23, P = 2.660 × 10−16; EQV: t(590.4) = 0.56, P = 0.277), for which the effect size was negative, statistically significant and non-equivalent (that is, large enough to be potentially meaningful). In contrast, we did not find differences in honest self-disclosure (H1.2g; g = −0.30 (90% CI −0.38 to −0.22); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.39, s.e.m. of 0.06, t = −6.37, P = 2.213 × 10−10; EQV: t(629.39) = 1.931, P = 0.028) and authentic self-presentation (H1.2h; g = −0.19 (90% CI −0.28 to −0.11); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.24, s.e.m. of 0.06, t = −3.98, P = 7.085 × 10−5; EQV: t(624.53) = 4.04, P = 0.000). In these cases, effect sizes were negative and statistically significant but equivalent, suggesting that differences between those with and without a mental health condition were too small to be theoretically meaningful. Our second question concerned the extent to which adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions differed in their social media use from adolescents without a condition (Fig. Our hypotheses were grounded in the mental health literature, which suggests that anxiety and depressive disorders are characterized by negative self-views, rumination, worries and social withdrawal. We expected these symptoms to be mirrored in adolescents' online experiences. The results supported our hypotheses for time spent on social media (H2.1a; g = 0.62 (90% CI 0.51 to 0.73); NHST: 𝛽 = 1.12, s.e.m. of 0.11, t = 10.32, P = 1.609 × 10−25; EQV: t(317.39) = 3.21, P = 0.999), online social comparison (H2.1b; g = 0.54 (90% CI 0.43 to 0.65); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.76, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = 9.12, P = 1.304 × 10−19; EQV: t(318.57) = 2.11, P = 0.994) and the impact of online feedback (H2.1e; g = 0.38 (90% CI 0.27 to 0.49); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.51, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = 6.61, P = 4.494 × 10−11; EQV: t(306.67) = −0.27, P = 0.385), where we found positive, statistically significant, and non-equivalent effect sizes, suggesting potentially meaningful differences between adolescents with internalizing versus no condition. In contrast, the results did not support our hypothesis for monitoring of online feedback, where differences were not statistically significant and were also too small to be considered meaningful (H2.1d; g = 0.13 (90% CI 0.03 to 0.25); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.20, s.e.m. of 0.09, t = 2.13, P = 0.033; EQV: t(324.47) = −4.13, P = 0.000). For those with internalizing conditions, we also hypothesized decreased levels of happiness about the number of online friendships (H2.2f), honest self-disclosure (H2.2g) and authentic self-presentation (H2.2h). Our hypotheses were confirmed for happiness about the number of online friendships (H2.2f; g = −0.45 (90% CI −0.55 to −0.35); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.40, s.e.m. of 0.05, t = −7.91, P = 3.49 × 10−15; EQV: t(304.45) = −0.69, P = 0.776) and honest self-disclosure (H2.2g; g = −0.31 (90% CI −0.42 to −0.20); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.41, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = −5.16, P = 2.670 × 10−7; EQV: t(314.2) = 1.32, P = 0.088), where we found negative, statistically significant and potentially meaningful differences. In other words, those with internalizing conditions scored lower than adolescents with no condition. In contrast, we did not find support for meaningful differences in authentic self-presentation (H2.2h; g = −0.19 (90% CI −0.30 to −0.08); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.25, s.e.m. of 0.08, t = −3.16, P = 0.002; EQV: t(310.64) = 3.08, P = 0.500 × 10−4), where the effect size was statistically significant but equivalent, and therefore too small to be considered meaningful. Last, we expected no differences in lack of control over time spent online for adolescents with internalizing versus no condition (H2.0c). The results did not support our hypothesis, showing positive, statistically significant and potentially meaningful differences (g = 0.43 (90% CI 0.33 to 0.55); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.60, s.e.m. of 0.09, t = 6.74, P = 1.91 × 10−11; EQV: t(336.39) = 0.489, P = 0.689). Externalizing conditions are characterized by impulsivity, low self-monitoring, and risk taking. We expected such symptoms to be reflected in how social media is used by this group. The results supported our hypotheses for time spent on social media (H2.3a; g = 0.31 (90% CI 0.13 to 0.48); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.58, s.e.m. of 0.17, t = 3.40, P = 0.001; EQV: t(105.73) = −0.83, P = 0.232), where we found positive differences that were statistically significant and large enough to be theoretically meaningful. The results did not support our hypotheses for the lack of control over time spent online (H2.3c; g = 0.19 (90% CI 0.01 to 0.37); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.27, s.e.m. of 0.15, t = 1.83, P = 0.068; EQV: t(100.39) = −2.01, P = 0.017) and happiness about the number of online friendships (H2.4f; g = −0.16 (90% CI −0.32 to 0.02); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.12, s.e.m. of 0.09, t = −1.39, P = 0.165; EQV: t(96.65) = 2.34, P = 0.023), where differences were not statistically significant and were too small to be meaningful. Last, we expected no differences between adolescents with externalizing and no conditions in online social comparison (H2.0b), monitoring of online feedback (H2.0d), feeling impacted by online feedback (H2.0e), honest online self-disclosure (H2.0g) and authentic self-presentation (H2.0h). The results supported our hypotheses for online social comparison (H2.0b; g = −0.10 (90% CI −0.28 to 0.07); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.13, s.e.m. of 0.14, t = −0.97, P = 0.331; EQV: t(104.81) = 2.94, P = 0.000), monitoring of feedback (H2.0d; g = 0.09 (90% CI −0.08 to 0.27), NHST: 𝛽 = 0.13, s.e.m. of 0.16, t = 0.82, P = 0.410; EQV: t(97.07) = −2.92, P = 0.004), honest self-disclosure (H2.0g; g = −0.21 (90% CI −0.38 to −0.03), NHST: 𝛽 = −0.26, s.e.m. of 0.13, t = −2.01, P = 0.045; EQV: t(98.82) = 1.79, P = 0.040), and authentic self-presentation (H2.0h; g = −0.09 (90% CI −0.25 to 0.08), NHST: 𝛽 = −0.11, s.e.m. of 0.13, t = −0.85, P = 0.395; EQV: t(98.29) = 2.96, P = 0.003), as these effect sizes were not significantly significant and were also too small to be considered meaningful. In contrast, the results did not support our hypothesis for the impact of feedback on mood (H2.0e; g = 0.27 (90% CI 0.10 to 0.45), NHST: 𝛽 = 0.34, s.e.m. of 0.13, t = 2.71, P = 0.007; EQV: t(96.78) = −1.14, P = 0.120), where we found positive, significant and potentially meaningful differences. Our third question focused only on adolescents with a mental health condition and specifically examined whether those with an internalizing condition use social media differently than those with an externalizing condition (Fig. The results supported our hypotheses for online social comparison (H3.1b; g = 0.64 (90% CI 0.45 to 0.85); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.89, s.e.m. of 0.16, t = 5.75, P = 0.000, EQV: t(203.72) = 2.187, P = 0.993), where we found positive differences that were statistically significant and large enough to be theoretically meaningful in adolescents with internalizing compared with externalizing conditions. In contrast, the results did not support our hypotheses for the monitoring of online feedback (H3.1d; g = 0.05 (90% CI −0.15 to 0.24); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.07, s.e.m. of 0.18, t = 0.40, P = 0.689, EQV: t(157.17) = −2.924, P = 0.002) and impact of online feedback on mood (H3.1e; g = 0.12 (90% CI −0.07 to 0.32); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.16, s.e.m. of 0.14, t = 1.12, P = 0.261, EQV: t(171.21) = −2.421, P = 0.008), where differences were not statistically significant and were too small to be meaningful. We further hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would score lower than adolescents with externalizing conditions in lack of control over time spent online (H3.2c), honest self-disclosure (H3.2g) and authentic self-presentation (H3.2h). However, we found neither significant nor meaningful differences across these dimensions (H3.2g; g = −0.11 (90% CI −0.30 to 0.09); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.15, s.e.m. of 0.15, t = −0.99, P = 0.323, EQV: t(170.73) = 2.47, P = 0.004; H3.2h; g = −0.11 (90% CI −0.29 to 0.08); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.14, s.e.m. of 0.15, t = −0.93, P = 0.351, EQV: t(185.78) = 2.51, P = 0.005). Further, the results were inconclusive for lack of control over time spent online (H3.2c; g = 0.24 (90% CI 0.04 to 0.43); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.33, s.e.m. of 0.17, t = 1.98, P = 0.048, EQV: t(156.91) = −1.37, P = 0.080), where we did not find statistically significant differences nor we could reject meaningfully large effect sizes. Last, we hypothesized that adolescents with internalizing conditions would not differ from adolescents with externalizing conditions in time spent on social media (H3.0a) and happiness in the number of online friendships (H3.0f). The results did not confirm our hypotheses. For time spent on social media, we found positive differences (internalizing higher than externalizing) that were statistically significant and potentially meaningful (H3.0a; g = 0.27 (90% CI 0.07 to 0.47); NHST: 𝛽 = 0.54, s.e.m. Further, we found that adolescents with internalizing conditions reported lower happiness about the number of online friends than adolescents with externalizing conditions. In this case, differences were negative, statistically significant and potentially meaningful (H3.0f; g = −0.32 (90% CI −0.51 to −0.14); NHST: 𝛽 = −0.29, s.e.m. To extend our findings, we conducted four sets of sensitivity analyses. First, we included adolescents with between-group comorbidities in question 2, such as any internalizing condition with a comorbid externalizing condition, or vice versa, and compared them with those without a condition (Supplementary Tables 15 and 16). Second, we examined the association between mental health severity, conceptualized as the number of conditions (irrespective of diagnostic type), and social media use (Supplementary Table 17). Third, we focused on adolescents with specific conditions and compared their social media use with that of adolescents without a condition. In this case, we only tested conditions for which we were sufficiently powered, namely, major depressive disorder (N ≈ 86; Supplementary Table 18), generalized anxiety disorder (N ≈ 75; Supplementary Table 19) and social anxiety disorder (N ≈ 70; Supplementary Table 20). Last, we tested our hypotheses for time spent on social media separately for school days and weekends, rather than using a composite score (Supplementary Table 21). Overall, the results were largely in line with our primary findings with a few exceptions. Namely, we found that adolescents with externalizing and between-group comorbidity (Supplementary Table 16) reported less honest self-disclosure than those without a condition. For the sensitivity analysis on mental health severity, we found that the number of conditions, irrespective of type, was associated with time spent on social media, social comparison, monitoring of feedback and impact of feedback on mood (Supplementary Table 17). Last, we did not find differences for time spent on weekdays versus weekends/holidays (Supplementary Table 21). We note that these sensitivity analyses were exploratory and conducted on relatively small sample sizes, which limits the robustness of these findings. In this Registered Report, we analysed differences in social media use between adolescents with and without mental health conditions in a UK sample of over 3,000 participants. Overall, we found significant and meaningful differences across both quantitative (time spent) and qualitative (for example, online social comparison and happiness about the number of online friends) dimensions of social media use. Interestingly, the largest difference in social media use between those with and without mental health conditions was in the time spent on social media, with the former reporting higher usage. It is important to note that this measure was self-reported, which is known to have only a moderate correlation with objective measures such as sensing data77. This raises the question of whether those with mental health conditions perceive that they spend more time on social media or whether they actually do so. Further, we observed that adolescents with a mental health condition reported lower satisfaction with the number of their online friends. In offline contexts, social connections serve as a protective factor against long-term adverse physical and emotional outcomes, especially during adolescence. Our findings therefore suggest that the difficulties with peer relationships experienced by youth clinical groups offline may also be reflected in their online interactions. For the other dimensions of social media use examined, our results followed the hypothesized direction and were statistically significant (with the exception of monitoring of online feedback). However, the differences were not large enough to be considered meaningful. This might be explained by the relatively high threshold set as our SESOI, which was a moderate effect size grounded in literature on sleep and physical exercise, both established markers of psychopathology. We next compared social media use between adolescents with a specific mental health condition (internalizing or externalizing) versus no condition. In this case, the results largely supported our hypotheses, whereby adolescents with internalizing conditions demonstrated higher time spent on social media, increased social comparison, greater impact of social media feedback on mood, lower satisfaction with the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure compared to those without a mental health condition. Unexpectedly, we also found that adolescents with internalizing conditions reported a higher lack of control over their time spent online, an engagement dimension that we had instead hypothesized would be more pronounced in those with externalizing conditions. For adolescents with externalizing conditions, the only meaningful difference when compared with those with no condition was increased time spent online, with no notable differences across other dimensions of social media use. These results might be explained by the fact that the dimensions of social media engagement used in this study were largely framed around internal experiences (that is, they enquired about one's emotions and thoughts) that could be more effective indicators of internalizing rather than externalizing conditions. Finally, by limiting our focus to only adolescents with mental health conditions, we compared those with internalizing to those with externalizing conditions. We found that adolescents with internalizing conditions engaged in higher online social comparison. This finding aligns with existing research indicating that adolescents with depressive and anxious symptomatology tend to unfavourably compare themselves with others on social media. Given that social media platforms provide continuous and concrete opportunities for social comparison—such as browsing others' profiles without initiating social interaction52—social comparison may represent a critical mechanism associated with internalizing symptoms on social media. Further, adolescents with internalizing conditions were less happy about the number of their online friends. This may be because their tendency towards negative self-evaluation and social comparison leads them to make negative evaluations of their social status78. In contrast, adolescents with externalizing conditions might be less focused on social comparison and more on immediate social interactions, resulting in greater satisfaction with their online friendships. Altogether, this study has three key strengths. First, the complex survey design, which utilized random probability sampling, produced a nationally representative UK sample. Second, all participants in the sample underwent a standardized multi-informant assessment by professional clinical raters. This method provided comprehensive information about participants' mental health without only relying on self-reported questionnaires, self-diagnoses or mental health service use, measures that only capture a subset of individuals with mental health conditions79,80. Last, we examined both qualitative and quantitative aspects of social media use, offering insights beyond time spent into relevant engagement dimensions such as online social comparison and the impact of feedback on mood. We also acknowledge some limitations of our study. First, regarding study design, we analysed raw associations from cross-sectional data. Therefore, no causal or directional inference can be drawn from these findings, including whether the onset of mental health conditions affects the examined dimensions of social media use or vice versa. Further, given the relatively small sample size in our externalizing group (N = 104) and the relatively large number of individuals with between-group comorbidities (N = 57), our findings concerning externalizing conditions should be interpreted with caution. Specifically, our question 2 and 3 results exclude adolescents with a relatively common clinical profile of comorbid externalizing and anxiety disorders. Additional work on how young people with this clinical profile use and experience social media is needed. Further, although the sample was nationally representative, we cannot determine the extent to which our findings apply outside the UK. Given the socio-cultural factors influencing social media use and mental health conditions, replicating these results in other regions across both the Global North and Global South is crucial if generalizations are to be made25. We also acknowledge that the data were collected in 2017. While the examined dimensions of social media use remain relevant, the rapid evolution of platforms and user behaviours presents a potential limitation when applying our findings to current trends. Last, we acknowledge limitations regarding our measures. Specifically, we relied on self-reported social media data. Self-reports capture participants' perceptions, such as online social comparison, that cannot be objectively or reliably measured otherwise. However, they often fail to accurately reflect actual patterns in usage, particularly when estimating time spent on social media77. Future research should aim to replicate and expand on these findings in three key areas. First, studies using experimental and longitudinal designs are essential to clarify the temporal and causal dynamics linking various social media patterns to mental health conditions. Doing so would allow us to disentangle the within-person variation and directional relationship between social media use and mental health symptom presentation, onset or recovery. Second, regarding social media use, future studies could investigate other self-reported and clinically relevant aspects of engagement, such as time displacement from offline activities81, the similarity between perceived self on social media and offline82, as well as goal-directed social media use. Additionally, studies could assess differences in objective social media use, such as time spent on various apps, posting behaviours, active messaging and content exposure. Third, research involving adolescents with intellectual and learning disabilities is necessary to identify differences in this specific clinical group, which was not included in this study. The results have implications for clinical practice. Specifically, we find key aspects of social media engagement that could inform the creation of guidelines for patient consultations and early intervention strategies. For example, this could include psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioural reappraisal techniques specifically aimed at online social comparison or the impact of social media feedback (for example, ‘likes') on mood for adolescents with internalizing conditions. Over the past years, there has been increasing concern that social media is negatively impacting young people's mental health, but very little research has compared social media use in those with and without mental health conditions26. In one of the first studies of its kind, we find that young people with mental health conditions report engaging with social media in different ways from those without a condition. This highlights aspects of social media use that might present an increased risk to this already vulnerable group and provides a window for future research to ensure that the digital world is safe for all children regardless of mental health status. The MHCYP 2017 survey was reviewed and approved by the West London and GTAC Research Ethics Committee (reference: 16/LO/0155) and the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group (reference: 16/CAG/0016) in 2016. Both parents and children provided consent to take part in data collection and were compensated with a £10 voucher for their time. Parents of children under 16 years were interviewed first and permission was sought to interview their child afterwards; the child then provided assent. Conversely, 17–19-year olds were directly asked for their consent, with permission subsequently sought for their parents to be interviewed. Access to the data was granted to the research team by NHS Digital (DARS-NIC-424336-T7K7T-v0.6 r). The MHCYP study is one of a series of national surveys on the mental health of children and young people in England administered in 1999, 2004, 2017, 2021 and 2022. In this Registered Report, we analysed the 2017 wave collected between January and October 2017: the most recent wave to be made available to researchers as well as the first wave to collect comprehensive data on adolescents' social media use and to include 17–19-year olds. We only analysed data from adolescents who reported being social media users aged 11–19 years, a total of 3,340 participants (50% male and 50% female) out of the full sample of 9,117. The survey was collected using a stratified probability sample of children and young people living in England who were registered with a general practitioner36. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with adolescents and their parents. At the same time, if the family agreed, questionnaires were mailed to teachers (for the available data and key demographics see MHCYP 201736,83). The study measured time spent on social media using two questionnaire items: “When you use social media sites or apps, how much time do you spend using them on a typical school day?” (SMTimeSpentS) and “When you use social media sites or apps how much time in total do you spend using them on a typical weekend or holiday day?” (SMTimeSpentW). Participants answered both questions on a nine-point Likert scale: 1, less than 30 min; 2, more than 30 min but less than an hour; 3, 1–2 h; 4, 2−3 h; 5, 3–4 h; 6, 4–5 h; 7, 5–6 h; 8, 6–7 h; 9, more than 7 h. A single variable reflecting average social media hours was created from these two variables (SMTimeSpent; see Supplementary Table 1 for more details). To do so, we first calculated the mean time in hours for each response. For example, if a participant responded “one to two hours”, we recoded this as 1.5 h. Participants that responded “more than seven hours” were recoded to 7.5 h, while participants that responded “less than 30 min” were recorded to 15 min (that is, 0.25 h). Weekday hours were then multiplied by 5, and weekend hours were multiplied by 2, and the products were summed and divided by 7 to establish a daily mean social media use variable, measured in hours. The SMTimeSpent variable was coded as continuous84. In the survey, the questions regarding time spent on social media for both weekdays (SMTimeSpentS) and weekends (SMTimeSpentw) were only asked of adolescents who responded that they use social media sites daily or on most days on a previous questionnaire item (SMFreqofUse; 1, daily or most days). Hence, participants that reported a lower frequency of social media use (that is, SMFreqofUse; 2, a few times a week; 3, once a week; 4, a few times a month; 5, once a month; 6, less often than once a month) were not asked these questions. To handle the resulting missing data in the SMTimeSpent variable, we coded any adolescents who responded to the SMFreqofUse question that they use social media between “a few times a week” and “once a week” to 45 min (0.75 h) and adolescents that responded “a few times a month” and “less often than once a month” to 15 min (0.25 h) on the SMTimeSpent question (for more information about our approach to missing data, see Supplementary Table 2). We analysed seven qualitative dimensions of social media engagement measured with questionnaire items tapping into experiences associated with both risks and benefits to adolescent mental health. All measures (summarized with related literature in Table 2) were developed in consultation with a young person advisory group (see the Supplementary Methods for more information), where children and adolescents defined the dimensions of social media use most relevant to them. The measures related to mental health risks encompassed online social comparison (“I compare myself to others on social media”), lack of control over time spent online (“I spend more time on social media than I mean to”), monitoring of online feedback (“I monitor the amount of likes, comments and shares I get on social media”) and the impact of online feedback (“The amount of likes, comments and shares I get on social media has an impact on my mood”). On the contrary, the measures indicative of mental health benefits included online friendship (“I am happy with the number of friends I have on social media”), honest self-disclosure (“I can be honest with people on social media sites and apps about how I am feeling) and authentic self-presentation (“My social media profile is a true reflection of myself”). Participants responded to these measures using a five-point Likert scale (1, disagree a lot; 2, disagree a little; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 4, agree a little; 5, agree a lot). We omitted the “Don't know” responses and coded 1–5 responses as continuous, given research suggesting that five-point continuous classifications perform as well as or occasionally better than categorical classifications84. We performed a sensitivity analysis to test whether examining social media use on weekdays versus weekends/holidays separately, rather than as a weighted average, changed the main results. Face-to-face interviewers completed the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA)85 with parents and adolescents aged 11 years or over to establish mental health conditions. During the interview, participants were first led through the 25-item Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire86 (Supplementary Table 3). Second, the interviewer administered the DAWBA, a diagnostic tool shown to have good validity87 and reliability88. The DAWBA uses structured and semi-structured questions to assess the presence and severity of symptoms for a wide range of DSM-5 or ICD-10 mental health disorders (Table 1). Each module starts with a few screening items, which, if answered negatively (indicative of the lack of symptoms), allow the interview to proceed to the next module with no loss of accuracy87 (for example, Supplementary Table 4). There is one exception: if a participant scores highly on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the interviewer is directed to ask in-depth internalizing disorder DAWBA modules, even if participants screened negative on the initial questions. After the initial screening items, the subsequent structured items in the DAWBA modules relate directly to diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 and ICD-10. They are close-ended questions about specific mental health symptoms (for example, “In the last 4 weeks, have there been times when you have been very sad, miserable, unhappy or tearful?”). If a participant responds positively to these structured items, they are subsequently asked open-ended questions about these problems (for example, “Please describe your mood—sadness or irritability—and your level of interest in things”). During the assessment, interviewers transcribe open-ended responses verbatim and are also able to add personal comments beneath each response. A team of clinical raters assessed the DAWBA's structured and qualitative information from all informants to decide whether an adolescent showed evidence of a DSM-5 or ICD-10 mental health condition that would warrant clinical treatment (Supplementary Figs. To determine the presence of a condition, clinical raters (1) checked that the answers to structured comments were understood by the participants accurately; (2) interpreted any conflicts between child, parent and teacher responses and decided which assessment to prioritize; and (3) identified clinically impairing disorders that did not perfectly fit current operationalized diagnostic criteria or “not otherwise specified diagnosis” such as “other anxiety disorder”. Overall, we coded information on mental health conditions into two separate variables: (1) a binary variable indicating the presence of any mental health condition (diagnosis or no diagnosis) and (2) a categorical variable for the type of condition (internalizing diagnosis, externalizing diagnosis or no diagnosis). We subdivided conditions identified via the diagnostic assessment into internalizing and externalizing using existing classifications of psychiatric diagnoses34,65 (Table 1). This distinction draws from transdiagnostic research showing that different conditions (for example, anxiety, depression and eating disorders) are often comorbid, share underlying core symptoms89 and can therefore be grouped to reflect clinical presentations with more validity34. Further, when we had enough power, we ran additional exploratory analyses examining responses to all social media questions (a–g) separately for individual conditions (specifically, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder). Comorbidity data were coded into two separate variables: (1) a binary variable indicating within-group comorbidity (any two diagnoses of either internalizing or externalizing: yes or no, for descriptive purposes only) and (2) a binary variable indicating internalizing–externalizing between-group comorbidity (any comorbid internalizing and externalizing diagnoses: yes or no). Individuals who showed between-group comorbidity were removed before the analysis of questions 2 and 3, given our goal to compare social media use between these groups. To increase the clinical utility of this work, we ran a sensitivity analysis for question 2, including people with between-group comorbidity. We conducted all statistical analyses in R version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2021), testing the association between time- and engagement-based measures of social media use and mental health conditions using equivalence tests and linear regression models90,91. To control for the type I error rate across multiple tests, we set a corrected alpha level of 0.0125, accounting for the false discovery rate across our four tested hypotheses for any given social media item92. Our analytical approach was based on regressions rather than analysis of variance, as the former allow for more diverse predictors, unbalanced groups and inclusion of covariates in potential exploratory analyses93. Below, we describe the statistical analyses we used to test our questions and hypotheses (see the Supplementary Information for more details). Further, the analysis code is available on OSF94. To address question 1, we tested the association between social media use and mental health conditions. Specifically, we estimated linear regression models with mental health condition as a binary predictor (two levels: diagnosis versus no diagnosis) and social media use as a continuous outcome. The no diagnosis group was set as the reference level for these analyses. Below, we report our null and directional hypotheses, first for dimensions of social media use expected to reflect mental health risks and second for dimensions expected to reflect mental health benefits in adolescents with versus without a condition. H0(1.0): adolescents with any mental health condition will not differ from adolescents without a condition in (a) time spent on social media, (b) online social comparison, (c) lacking control over time spent online, (d) monitoring of online feedback, (e) feeling impacted by online feedback, (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online. H1(1.1): adolescents with any mental health condition will score higher than adolescents without a condition in (a) time on social media, (b) online social comparison, (c) lacking control over time spent online, (d) monitoring of online feedback and (e) feeling impacted by online feedback. H1(1.2): adolescents with any mental health condition will score lower than adolescents without a condition in (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online. To examine whether social media use varies with mental health severity, we conducted sensitivity analyses to test for a linear effect of the number of diagnoses on the social media responses using linear regression models. After assessing differences in social media use in adolescents with versus without any mental health condition, we examined whether adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions use social media differently than adolescents without a condition. Hence, we conducted linear regression models with diagnostic category as a categorical predictor (three levels: internalizing diagnosis, externalizing diagnosis and no diagnosis) and social media use as a continuous outcome. To test our hypotheses, we examined comparisons between two levels of the diagnostic category variable, with no diagnosis set as the reference level. For hypotheses 2.0i, 2.1 and 2.2, we reported regression coefficients for internalizing versus no diagnosis, while for hypotheses 2.0e, 2.3 and 2.4 we reported coefficients for externalizing versus no diagnosis. The null hypotheses marked by ‘e' or ‘i' indicate that, for the considered comparison, the null hypothesis was our primary hypothesis. Hence, for those dimensions of social media use, we expected no difference between adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions and those without a condition. We used ‘e' to indicate primary null hypotheses related to externalizing versus no condition and ‘i' to indicate our primary null hypotheses related to internalising condition. H0(2.0): adolescents with internalizing or externalizing conditions will not differ from adolescents without a condition in (a) time on social media, (b) online social comparisone, (c) lacking control over time spent onlinei, (d) monitoring of online feedbacke, (e) feeling impacted by online feedbacke, (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosuree and (h) authentic self-presentation onlinee. H1(2.1): adolescents with internalizing condition will score higher than adolescents without a condition in (a) time on social media, (b) online social comparison, (d) monitoring of online feedback and (e) feeling impacted by online feedback. H1(2.2): adolescents with internalizing conditions will score lower than adolescents without a condition in (f) happiness about the number of online friendships, (g) honest online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online. H1(2.3): adolescents with externalizing conditions will score higher than adolescents without a condition in (a) time spent on social media and (c) lack of control over time spent online. H1(2.4): adolescents with externalizing conditions will score lower than adolescents without a condition in (f) happiness about the number of online friendships. To address question 3, we examined how adolescents with internalizing conditions differed in social media engagement compared to adolescents with externalizing conditions. To this aim, we compared the internalizing and externalizing levels of the diagnostic category variable described in question 2, with internalizing as the reference level. Also, in this case, the null hypotheses marked by ‘c' indicate our primary hypotheses. Hence, for those dimensions of social media use, we expected no difference between adolescents with internalizing and externalizing conditions. H0 (3.0): adolescents with internalizing conditions will not differ from adolescents with externalizing conditions in (a) time on social mediac, (b) online social comparison, (c) lacking control over time spent online, (d) monitoring of online feedback, (e) feeling impacted by online feedback, (f) happiness about the number of online friendshipsc, (g) online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online. H1(3.1): adolescents with internalizing conditions will score higher than adolescents with externalizing conditions in (b) online social comparison, (d) monitoring of online feedback and (e) feeling impacted by online feedback. H1(3.2): adolescents with internalizing conditions will score lower than adolescents with externalizing conditions in (c) lack of control over time spent online, (g) online self-disclosure and (h) authentic self-presentation online. For all regression analyses, we treated the eight dimensions of social media use, including both time- and engagement-based measures, as separate outcomes predicted by information on mental health conditions as the only regressor. While it is common in research to use statistical control to remove confounding effects from a regression coefficient, appropriate control variables should be identified only after justifying a causal structure that includes the outcome, predictors and all theorized confounders. When the selected control variables are inappropriate or remain unjustified, controlling can result in biased regression estimates95. Further, recent literature warns against controlling for demographic factors such as sex without thought and instead prompts researchers to interrogate how this variable intersects with the predictors and outcomes under investigation96. In the present work, treating sex or age as a confounding variable would mean ignoring the possibility that there are meaningful sex or age differences in the examined relationships. As our goal is to investigate the overall association between social media use and mental health, we provided a descriptive account of the age and sex of adolescents included in each tested model rather than control for these demographics. For example, in question 1, age and sex of adolescents with any condition versus without a condition are reported for descriptive purposes (Table 3). Given that null hypothesis significance testing does not allow a comprehensive interpretation of statistically non-significant results97, each model was complemented by equivalence tests97 using the bootstrapped two one-sided tests (TOST) with the ‘boot_T_TOST' function from the TOSTER package91 to quantify support for the null hypothesis (H0(1–3)). This involves assessing whether the 90% CIs for the effect size lie inside prespecified equivalence bounds that indicate the SESOI. If the CIs lie inside the equivalence bounds, the effect size is interpreted as negligible. On the contrary, if the CIs spread outside the equivalence bounds, the effect size is considered meaningful in size. In this case, the 90% CIs are used rather than 95% because the effect size is tested against two equivalence bounds separately (that is, the upper and lower bound), reflecting (1 – 2α) × 100% (see the Supplementary Information for more details). We established the equivalence bounds by identifying a theoretically meaningful SESOI (Cohen's d = 0.4; refer to the Supplementary Methods for a detailed explanation). After an extensive scoping exercise to identify a suitable theoretical foundation, we determined that the most relevant benchmark for our research questions are everyday behaviours linked to mental health, such as sleep and physical activity. These behaviours, much like social media use, are a regular part of daily routines but, unlike social media use, they are well-established markers of psychopathology, based on both theory98,99,100 and matched empirical evidence101,102. Consequently, if the actual effect size of social media use is comparable to that observed for behaviours such as sleep and physical activity, we can confidently conclude that social media use also represents an everyday behaviour that exhibits meaningful group-level differences between clinical and non-clinical populations. The interpretation and analysis plan are presented separately for each hypothesis in the Supplementary Information. Overall, we inferred support for the null hypotheses (that is, no meaningful difference in social media use between groups) if the 90% CI for this association lies within the equivalence bounds. Of note, while a theoretical SESOI based on everyday behaviours and their link to mental health served as our primary effect size of interest to allow for a clear confirmatory approach, we also identified secondary SESOIs based on the effect sizes that are practically and clinically meaningful. These secondary SESOIs play an important role in supporting the interpretation of our findings (as detailed in Supplementary Methods), ensuring the applicability of our study to both academic and practical domains. Overall, we inferred support for the alternative hypotheses if (1) the coefficient for the association of social media use and our grouping variable for mental health diagnosis was significant, (2) the association followed the hypothesised direction and (3) the CIs for the association did not fall within the equivalence bounds. The interpretation and analysis plan are presented separately for each hypothesis in the Supplementary Information. Further, we detail the planned exploratory analyses in the Supplementary Methods. Given that not all assumptions of linear models were met (Supplementary Table 9), we complemented our preregistered parametric analyses with exploratory nonparametric tests for all hypotheses (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). We implemented the Brunner Munzel test based on the ‘brunner_munzel' function for NHST and the ‘simple_htest' function for equivalence testing from the TOSTER package in R91. This test, also known as the generalized Wilcoxon test, is a nonparametric test of stochastic equality between two samples that tests against the null hypothesis that for randomly selected values X (that is, social media score in the adolescents without a condition) and Y (that is, social media score in adolescents with a condition), the probability of X being greater than Y is equal to the probability of Y being greater than X. We documented all discrepancies (20% overall) between the parametric and nonparametric test results in Supplementary Tables 12–14. We included all participants in the MHCYP 2017 survey aged between 11 and 19 years at the time of assessment who have answered any of the social media use questions with anything other than “don't know”. Only individuals with diagnostic information, including the absence of a diagnosis, were included in the MHCYP dataset. Since we examined each social media use question separately, we included participants who answered at least one of the seven social media engagement questions or the question about time spent on social media. No specific documentation was available regarding the response rates for the social media questions. Given that the questionnaires were administered through interviews with professionals, we expected minimal missing data for the social media responses103. Hence, using a conservative estimate, we assumed a 5% missingness for our power calculations. To address question 1, all adolescents with and without a condition were included in our analysis. Hence, in question 1, we included (1) participants with conditions other than internalizing or externalizing disorders (for example, autism spectrum disorder, tic disorder and psychotic disorders; Table 2); (2) participants with within-group comorbidity (multiple internalizing or externalizing diagnoses; for example, comorbid depressive and social anxiety disorder); and (c) participants with between-group comorbidity (both internalizing and externalizing conditions; for example, comorbid depressive and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). In contrast, for questions 2 and 3, we included (1) participants with internalizing or externalizing conditions only and (2) participants with within-group comorbidity (multiple internalizing or externalizing diagnoses). Hence, participants with other conditions or between-group comorbidity were excluded from the main analysis, given our goal to compare social media use in adolescents with externalizing and internalizing conditions. However, we ran sensitivity analyses to test the impact of including participants with between-group comorbidities in question 2. On the basis of the summary demographics83, after accounting for potential missing data, we estimated the sample of complete cases to be around N = 3,854 (accounting for 5% missingness in the sample of N = 4,057, 11–19-year olds), approximately 15% of whom received at least one mental health diagnosis (N = 577). Available documentation83 suggests that approximately 19.2% of individuals with internalizing conditions have at least one comorbid externalizing condition, and approximately 28% of individuals with externalizing diagnoses have at least one comorbid internalizing diagnosis. This suggests approximately N = 370 with internalizing-only diagnoses and N = 199 with externalizing-only diagnoses. We calculated the power by setting the SESOI (d = 0.4, refer to Supplementary Methods for a detailed explanation), the alpha level to 0.05 and the estimated sample size (estimated N = 3,854 based on existing MHCYP documentation). For the equivalence tests, power was calculated using the TOSTER package in R91,104. For the regression models, power was determined using the pwr package105 in R. The code for these calculations is available on the OSF94. We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N ≥ 577 individuals with a condition and N ≥ 3,277 individuals without a condition. The results indicate 100% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4. We calculated the power to detect a statistical effect of condition on social media responses using linear regression. The results indicate 100% power to detect the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 577 individuals with a condition and N ≥ 3,277 individuals without a condition. We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N ≥ 370 individuals with an internalizing only condition and N ≥ 3,277 with no condition. The results indicate 100% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4. We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N > 199 individuals with an externalizing only condition and N > 3,277 with no condition. The results indicate 100% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4. We calculated the power to detect a statistical effect of internalizing condition type (internalizing versus no condition) on social media responses using linear regression. The results indicate 100% power to detect the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 370 individuals with an internalizing-only condition and N ≥ 3,277 with no condition. We calculated power to detect an effect of externalizing diagnosis type (that is, externalizing versus no condition) on social media responses using linear regression. The results indicate 100% power to detect the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 199 individuals with an externalizing-only condition and N ≥ 3,277 with no condition. We calculated the power for equivalence testing to detect a SESOI of d = 0.4 given at least N ≥ 370 individuals with internalizing only and N ≥ 199 with externalizing only conditions. The results indicate 96% power to reject the presence of effects that are larger than d = 0.4. We calculated the power to detect a statistical effect of internalizing-only versus externalizing-only condition type on social media responses. The results indicate 99.8% power to the SESOI (d = 0.4) with at least N ≥ 370 individuals with internalizing only and N ≥ 199 with externalizing only conditions. In addition to our a priori power calculations, we conducted power sensitivity analyses with the final sample size105. That is, we determined the smallest effect size that is observable with 95% power, given the corrected alpha of 0.0125 and our final sample size (Supplementary Table 22).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 1745, Chinese emperor and poet Qianlong was sailing on the Yangtze River toward the eastern city of Zhenjiang when he encountered a breathtaking sight: a group of what we now call Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) emerged from the water's surface. Found exclusively in China's Yangtze River, it is the world's only freshwater porpoise. “Having access to past data allows us to detect when declines began and correlate those changes with potential threats like habitat destruction, climate change, overhunting, disease or the introduction of invasive species,” says Yaoyao Zhang, an ecologist at the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A Ming Dynasty woodblock-printed illustration from "Sancai Tuhui" (in English, Compendium of the Three Powers), compiled by Wang Qi (1573–1620), which is a 49-volume book of poems on birds and animals. This poem meticulously documents the Yangtze finless porpoise through morphological details, surfacing postures, and maternal care behaviors. "Sancai Tuhui," compiled by Wang Qi (1573–1620) (CC BY-SA) Zhang and her colleagues turned to ancient poems because official records rarely mentioned these animals. Using an online database of Chinese literature, “we searched for various historical names of the Yangtze finless porpoise across dynastic poetry, manually verifying each mention to ensure it referred to the porpoise and not other animals,” Zhang says. Half contained information about where they were seen. Poems from the distant past mentioned these animals living in tributaries and lakes along the Yangtze, but in more recent poems, these references dramatically decreased.

The study “builds on many prior examples on how historical texts of various kinds can help understand past species distributions and, not least, human-caused biodiversity losses,” says Jens-Christian Svenning, a macroecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, who was not involved with the new research. For example, scientists reconstructed the former composition of fauna in Greece with the aid of descriptions from ancient epic poems. For their next step, Zhang says she and her team are planning to dig back into the poems they have collected to search for information about “what the river looked like in the past, how big the groups of porpoises used to be and how they might have behaved before their numbers dwindled.” Gennaro Tomma is a freelance journalist who covers science, with a focus on the natural world, biodiversity, conservation, climate change, environmental and science-related policies, and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is nearly 40 years in the making, and its most complex component is now ready for assembly. When completer, ITER will be able to withstand temperatures 10 times hotter than the core of the Sun (150 million degrees Celsius) while also keeping certain components of itself near absolute zero (-273.15 degrees Celsius). At the heart of this engineering miracle is a 3,000-ton magnet system central to creating an “invisible shield” that keeps superheated plasma contained long enough to kickstart a fusion reaction. Once assembled, this solenoid will be the world's most powerful magnet. It will be contained inside an “exoskeleton”—made of 9,000 individual parts from eight U.S. suppliers—which will support the Central Solenoid as it generates extreme forces capable of kickstarting a fusion reaction. Although ITER is fundamentally different from our Sun (of course), it does work in a somewhat similar fashion. The Sun uses a “too big to fail” fusion regime—its sheer mass (330,000 times more than that of the Earth) is enough to fuse hydrogen nuclei into helium. On Earth, however, scientists need to compensate for this lack of mass with even more heat. At a certain temperature threshold, deuterium, and tritium—isotopes of hydrogen that will be used as fuel in ITER—overcome electromagnetic repulsion via quantum tunneling and fuse. Some quick calculations using everyone's favorite equation e=mc2 show that converting a little mass can give you tons of energy. ITER's 10,000 tons worth of superconducting magnets (with a combined energy of 51 gigajoules) will maintain the plasma for long enough at high enough temperatures for this fusion reaction to take place. However, that's still a long ways off, as recent ITER estimates place the reactor's first plasma date at around 2035. But once this gargantuan machine of human ingenuity is completely, we will have truly bottled a star—or, at least, a close approximation of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A field in an overgrown Czech Republic forest has, for nearly 100 years, served as the hiding place for a secret stash of nearly 600 gold coins and other precious metal goods tucked into a stone wall. But the cache of treasure is hiding no more. Just a few feet away, they found another hidden cache—this one an iron box holding jewelry, cigarette cases, and other personal items all made from gold. The lucky hikers wound up finishing their trip with an extra 15 pounds of precious cargo. They eventually took their discovery for an assessment by experts at the Museum of Eastern Bohemia. “At first, religious movements were more common, later it was property stored in uncertain times with the intention of returning later for it.” Still, the latest find—considering its unusual weight of precious metal—is quite unique, Novak said. Inside were 598 gold coins 11 separate stacks wrapped in  black fabric. The 15 pounds of gold coins and jewelry is valued at over $330,000. They come from far and wide across Europe, with coins originating from France, Turkey, Belgium, Romania, Italy, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. The range of provenances makes it difficult to track how the coins got to where they were—or just why they were stashed away at all. “It is hard to say whether it was Czech, German, or Jewish gold,” said Petr Grulich, museum director, according to Arkeo News. “When he opened it,” Novak said, according to the Daily Mail, “my jaw dropped.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conversational tactics such as looping and reframing may help As Americans become more polarized, even family dinners can feel fraught, surfacing differences that could spark out-and-out conflict. Tense conversations often end with a familiar refrain: “Let's just drop it.” As a communications educator and trainer, I am frequently asked how to handle these conversations, especially when they involve social and political issues. One piece of advice I give is that “agree to disagree,” or any other phrase that politely stands in for “stop talking,” will not restore harmony. Not only that, but it could also do permanent harm to those important family bonds. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. When families talk about anything – from “What are your top five favorite movies?” to “What possessed you to load the dishwasher like that?” – they are not just exchanging information. According to communication researcher Mark L. Knapp'smodel of relationship development, all relationships have a life cycle. People come together and solidify their connection through five stages, from “initiation” to “bonding.” But many relationships eventually come apart, going through five stages of breakdown. No relationship is as linear as the model assumes, but it can help pinpoint potential danger zones – moments when a bond is at risk of coming apart. One stage, in particular, illustrates why avoiding these hard conversations is so dangerous: “circumscribing.” However, marking too many ideas as off-limits makes it easier for people to avoid conversation altogether. Circumscribing is one of the “coming apart” stages in Knapp's model. Sadly, this estrangement from loved ones is not a theoretical problem. What's more, these relationships are not always replaced by other close ties. About half of Americans say they only have three or fewer close friends. In 2023, then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared widespread loneliness and isolation an “epidemic.” Relationships do more than provide support; they play a key role in how people define themselves. According to psychology's “social penetration theory,” conversation with close family and loved ones deepens relationships while helping people learn to articulate their deepest values. There is no one-time process that will fix all conflict over the course of a family dinner. These techniques take time, patience and compassion – all things that can be in short supply amid conflict. However, there are two techniques I not only recommend to others, but I use in my own conflicts: “looping for understanding” and “reframe and pivot.” Looping, which was originally developed for legal mediation, helps both people in a conversation understand each other. Feeling misunderstood tends to escalate conflict, so this is a great starting place. During a “loop,” each person uses active listening, meaning they pay careful attention to what their partner is saying without judgment or interruptions. Finally, they ask the original speaker for confirmation. If the speaker says no, then the listener “loops” by asking them to explain what they got wrong, and tries to paraphrase again. In one study, emphatic paraphrasing not only made participants less anxious but also made the speaker see the paraphraser in a more positive light. Feeling fully heard and understood can go a long way to turning down the heat on difficult conversations. Once both parties understand each other, another technique, “reframing,” can help pivot the conversation away from confrontation and move toward resolution. In reframing, the speakers find and discuss a single point of agreement. Finding a point of agreement is not always possible. Careful communication can be mentally exhausting, and pressing pause is always OK: I don't think we are going to solve our nation's financial issues tonight, but thank you for talking about it. It's also important to accept that not all relationships can or should be saved. However, it is always good to know that the relationship ended for a clear reason, and not over a misunderstanding that was never addressed. Hopefully, though, these tactics will help keep communication open and relationships healthy, no matter what topic is brought up at dinner.

(2025)Cite this article NMR spectroscopy of biomolecules provides atomic level information into their structure, dynamics and interactions with their binding partners. However, signal attenuation from line broadening caused by fast relaxation and signal overlap often limits the application of NMR to large macromolecular systems. Here we leverage the slow relaxation properties of 13C nuclei attached to 19F in aromatic 19F–13C spin pairs as well as the spin–spin coupling between the fluorinated 13C nucleus and the hydrogen atom at the meta-position to record two-dimensional 1H–13CF correlation spectra with transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy selection on 13CF. To accomplish this, we synthesized [4-19F13Cζ; 3,5-2H2ε] Phe, engineered for optimal relaxation properties, and adapted a residue-specific route to incorporate this residue globally into proteins and a site-specific 4-19F Phe encoding strategy. This approach resulted in narrow linewidths for proteins ranging from 30 kDa to 180 kDa, enabling interaction studies with small-molecule ligands without requiring specialized 19F-compatible probes.

Advances in long-read sequencing have enabled routine complete assembly of human genomes, but much remains to be done to represent broader populations and show impact on disease-gene discovery. Here, we report highly accurate, near-complete and phased genomes from six Middle Eastern (ME) family trios (n = 18) with neurodevelopmental conditions, representing ancestries from Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Qatar and Afghanistan. These genomes revealed 42.2 Mb of new sequence (13.8% impacting known genes), 75 new HLA/KIR alleles and strong signals of inbreeding, with ROH covering up to one-third of chromosomes 6 and 12 in one individual. Using assembly-based variant calling, we identified 23 de novo and recessive variants as strong candidates for causing previously unresolved symptoms in the probands. The ME genomes revealed unique variation relative to existing references, showing enhanced mappability and variant calling. These results underscore the value of de novo assembly for disease variant discovery and the need for sampled ME-specific references to better characterize population-relevant variation. Advances in long-read sequencing and bioinformatics have enabled the generation of high-quality genome assemblies from various ancestries, ranging from Korea1 to Puerto Rico2,3. Recently, over a hundred near-complete and fully phased genomes have been produced by the Human Pangenome Research Consortium (HPRC)4 and the Chinese Pangenome Consortium (CPC)5, in addition to complete telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes for a haploid genome of primarily European ancestry (CHM13)6 and a diploid Han Chinese male (CHN1)7. This has allowed major gaps in GRCh38 to be filled, especially in complex and repetitive regions6,8, capturing previously inaccessible variation9 and uncovering genome mechanistic insights9,10. Nevertheless, complete genome assembly is yet to be leveraged in disease-gene discovery, especially in under-represented populations where there is a particular need for understanding haplotype diversity and structure, which is important in assessing variant pathogenicity. The Middle Eastern (ME) populations lie at a historical intersection of human migration and civilization11,12,13,14. They are generally characterized by isolated structures and high consanguinity, leading to increased incidence of genetic conditions impacting normal development15,16,17, often due to founder mutations. Recent studies have identified peculiar ancestral groups such as Peninsular Arabs who were found to be the closest to the ancient population that migrated out of Africa11,14 and harbor a differential mutational spectrum of Mendelian disorders and cancer predisposition18,19. Currently, ME populations are heavily under-represented in genomic literature, lacking high-quality assemblies20,21 needed to shed light on how inbreeding shapes genome structure and disease architecture20,21. In this study, we use a de novo genome assembly approach to characterize six family trios from diverse ME ancestries (Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Qatar and Afghanistan), involving probands with various unresolved neurodevelopmental conditions whereby we (1) assemble near-complete genomes and map their high-resolution features, (2) apply assembly approach to identify disease-causing variants and (3) assess the value of ME-specific genetic reference in improving read mapping and variant calling (Extended Data Fig. We assemble near-complete phased genomes which we interrogate for various structural features, comparing against the latest genome references. Using trio analyses, we identify previously undetected deleterious variants. Finally, we demonstrate the value of population-specific references, emphasizing the need for a carefully sampled pangenome for ME ancestries. Our study samples consist of six parent–child trios (n = 18) from five different nationalities spanning the wide ME region: two trios from Qatar (Qatari 1 and Qatari 2) and single trios from Sudan, Jordan, Syria and Afghanistan (Fig. The children, male (XY) except for the Afghani female (XX), are aged 3–15 years and were ascertained with multiple symptoms of developmental disorders (Extended Data Fig. Three of these families (Sudanese, Jordanian, Qatari 2) have undergone genetic testing previously based on microarrays and selected panels, returning negative results. Subsequent analysis using whole-genome sequencing from Illumina (Methods) did not identify plausible pathogenic variants except for Qatari 1, where we found a likely pathogenic variant (a de novo SNV in splice donor site) in the transcription factor nuclear factor IX (NFIX) reported to cause Malan syndrome22. This finding explained some of this patient's symptoms, namely global developmental delay and tall stature. a, Geographic location of the study cohort. b, Global ancestral composition of the individual participants alongside that of CN1, CHM13 and HG002. c, Principal component analysis showing the study samples and reference dataset from QGP and 1KG. d, Local ancestry analysis showing the genetic ancestral makeup of each chromosome for the Sudanese, Afghani, Jordanian and Qatari 2 child participants. The displayed map is from Mapbox and OpenStreetMap, used under the ODbL. ADM, admixed; AFR, Africans; AMR, American; EAS, East Asian; EUR, Europeans; SAS, South Asian; ODbL, Open Database License. Given the lack of diagnosis of these diverse ME families, we used the latest technologies of long-read sequencing and de novo assembly methods to gain insight into high-resolution genomic structure and disease-causing genetic variants. For each participant, we generated high-quality PacBio HiFi long-read and Illumina short-read data and subsequently processed them using established pipelines (Methods). For the short-read data, the average coverage is 31–38× (Supplementary Fig. To explore the detailed genetic ancestry of the ME trios, we conducted admixture inference of global and local ancestry based on a diverse population dataset as a reference panel based on 1000 Genomes (1KG) and Qatar Genome Program (QGP) phase 1 cohort (Methods). As expected, CHM13 is predominantly of European ancestry (Fig. The Sudanese trio has >99% African ancestry, while the Afghani, Syrian, Jordanian, Qatari 1 and Qatari 2 participants in this order showed a prominent trend of increasing General Arab (GAR) and Peninsular Arab (PAR) ancestries and decreasing European ancestry. The highest proportion of GAR was shown in Qatari 2 participants (63%), the highest PAR was in Qatari 1 and Qatari 2 (15% and 16%, respectively), while the highest West Eurasian and Persian (WEP) ancestry was found in the Syrian, Jordanian and Qatari 1 (20–22%; Fig. The highest East Asian and South Asian ancestries were found in the Afghani participants (8% and 12% respectively). Consistent with this, an overlay of the dominant global ancestries on principal components showed that the family trios co-clustered with samples of similar ancestries, namely GAR, PAR, WEP14 (for Syrian, Jordanian, Qatari 1 and Qatari 2), Africans (for Sudanese), while the Afghanis are found between Europeans, West Eurasians and Asians (Fig. Next, we conducted local ancestry inference to assign ancestry components to individual chromosomal segments (Fig. We could see relatively high ancestral homogeneity for the Sudanese participants as well as CHM13, while more admixture is seen for the remaining participants. The average ancestry segment length across the samples is 570 kb. Notably, the longest non-African stretches were found in Qatari 2 (PAR), Syrian (GAR) and Qatari 1 (WEP). We generated de novo phased assemblies for the six ME trios using trioHifiasm23, incorporating PacBio HiFi long reads and parental Illumina short reads, as per the best recommended workflow for phased genome assembly23. Standard quality check (QC) metrics were calculated to evaluate assembly contiguity and accuracy (Fig. The obtained assemblies were of high quality as indicated by the various metrics, the ranges and averages of which are as follows: coverage (30.4–49.1×, 37.7×), contig N50 (52.9–98.2 Mb, 77.3 Mb), contig count (146–372, 263.4), longest contig (133.5–232.6 Mb, 169.2 Mb) and per-base accuracy quality value (QV; 44.0–59.3, 53.7). Of note, the children were better than the parents for most metrics, reflecting the higher mean coverage (38.8 versus 34.9), higher average HiFi read length (19.9 kb versus 18.8 kb) and the complementary use of parental data for assembling and phasing. The assembly with the best contig N50 was for Qatari 1 child (94.6 Mb for haplotype 1 and 97.4 Mb for haplotype 2) which also had the best QV (59.3 for haplotype 1 and 58.8 for haplotype 2), the best coverage (49.1×) and second highest HiFi read length average (21.0 kb). The longest contig was 232.6 Mb, belonging to the Jordanian child participant. a, QC metrics of each child assembly showing coverage, depth, total contigs, contig N50, maximum contig length and QV. b, Hapmer blob plot of Qatari 2 child sample showing a clear separation of maternal (red) and paternal (blue) haplotypes.

The x axis represents the percentage of genome size and y axis represents the block size. Incorrectly phased haplotype blocks are virtually absent.

Using the parental short reads, we evaluated the phasing accuracy for the child assemblies using haplotype-specific markers (hapmers)24, whereby contigs are plotted as a function of hapmers assigned from maternal and paternal libraries (Fig. All assemblies show a clear segregation of the parental haplotypes indicating the high quality of phasing. Furthermore, N* plots indicate low levels of haplotype switch errors (Fig. In addition, inherited hapmer plots show balanced distributions of k-mers private to children, fathers, mothers and those shared between the parents (Supplementary Fig. Furthermore, we performed an independent evaluation of the accuracy of the assemblies using the Flagger pipeline which assesses coverage and variants from the alignment of HiFi reads to the respective assemblies4. We found that >99% of the assemblies' sequences consisted of reliable (haploid) blocks (Fig. Alignment of the child assemblies to CHM13 using Minimap2 (ref. 25) showed high mappability across various chromosomes, with an average of 91% of contigs with high alignment coverage mapping to a unique location (Fig. Using CHM13 as reference, the ratio of completeness per chromosome was 93% on average, with 43 chromosomes from all six participants having >99% completeness including 14 T2T chromosomes, which we verified confirming the presence of telomeric repeats (Fig. Qatari 2 shows the highest overall completeness of 92%. Notably, 14 chromosomes were spanned by a single contig covering the centromeric region, including a T2T single contig for chromosome 10 from a Qatari 2 child (Fig. a, Alignment of child assemblies to CHM13 for individual chromosomes. Individual contigs are delineated with distinct colors per chromosomal haplotype. Diamond symbols denote the end points of CHM13 haplotypes. b, Percentage of completeness (y axis) relative to CHM13 per chromosome (x axis), colored by the number of contigs in the alignment. c, Alignment of chromosome 10 of Qatari 2 (top) child assembly to CHM13 (bottom) showing a singular contig spanning the entire chromosome with notable centromeric variation. d, Length of new sequences identified across samples, highlighting location in centromeric regions (left), repetitive regions (middle) and intergenic, intronic/UTR and exonic regions either inside or outside repetitive regions (right). LC, low complexity; LTR, long terminal repeats; SINE, short interspersed nuclear element; Unk, unknown. We checked the sequences of insertions identified from the alignments of the assemblies to CHM13 against a diverse set of highly curated calls of structural variations from HPRC8, HG002 (Ashkenazi Jews) and CN1 (Han Chinese)7, from which we excluded any regions identified with Flagger to be unreliable. This led to the identification of 42.2 Mb of new sequences across all the samples, ranging from 6.4 Mb for the Sudanese to 10.6 Mb for Qatari 1 (Fig. Of these sequences, 10–40% were in the centromeres, highlighting the relatively higher divergence and mutation rate in these regions26. By size, 86.2% of the new sequences are found in intergenic regions, while 12.6% are in intronic or untranslated regions (intronic/UTR) and 1.2% in exonic regions (Supplementary Fig. Also, 89.7% of the new sequences are found in repetitive regions, notably satellite (58.1%) and simple repeats (24.1%; Fig. New sequences outside repetitive regions are enriched for exonic and intronic/UTR (Fig. We also noticed most new sequences (79.3%) occur outside segmental duplications (Supplementary Fig. For those inside segmental duplications, nearly a quarter overlap with intronic/UTR and 3.9% overlap with exonic regions (Supplementary Fig. Consistent with the closer genetic distance to HG002 (ref. 27), the sequences from our assemblies, which were also absent from CHM13 and HPRC, have more shared sequences with HG002 than CN1 (Supplementary Fig. The new sequences are well spread across the chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. We annotated the assemblies with genes of various types based on the publicly available CHM13 annotation. The distribution of genes identified across the chromosomes was found to be proportionate and similar to CHM13 (Supplementary Fig. Stratifying per-gene category, the number of genes across the assemblies is relatively uniform and similar to CHM13 for all established 27 gene categories, except for rRNA genes known to vary in number of copies between individuals28 (Fig. Specifically, the assemblies show 97–100% coverage for the six largest gene categories in the genome namely protein coding, LncRNA, pseudogenes, miRNA, transcribed pseudogenes and snoRNA (Fig. The number of genes observed for sex chromosome was consistent with the sample sex (Supplementary Fig. Per participant, Qatari 1 and 2 haplotypes demonstrate exceptionally high coverage, exceeding 99% for protein-coding genes. b, Coverage for the largest gene categories. c, New alleles in HLA and KIR genes in the child assembly haplotypes, highlighting the number of mutations in the CDS relative to a reference dataset of 220 pre-annotated reference haplotypes. d, Phylogenetic tree based on neighbor-joining method for the HLA-DQB2 locus showing clustering pattern of the alleles in the child assemblies.

We annotated HLA and KIR genes in the assemblies using a recent whole-genome-assembly-based method and compared the annotated genes against a set of 220 pre-annotated assembly haplotypes, including HLA assemblies, HPRC, CPC, CHM13, CN-T2T and GRCh38 (ref. The ME child assemblies had alleles in 47 genes, all of which had one copy except C4B which had two copies (Supplementary Fig. The genes harbored 233 alleles, including previously reported alleles in the HLA-A locus, which are consistently found to be largely common or well documented in populations of ME ancestry30 (Supplementary Fig. Furthermore, amongst the 47 genes, we found 33 genes that contained 75 new alleles (that is absent from the Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD)) with intact coding DNA sequence (CDS) region (Extended Data Fig. These alleles, of which there are 17–30 per assembly (Extended Data Fig. 1b), are found in regions of reliable assembly as determined using Flagger. They include 11 unique alleles, each having one to seven mutations in CDS regions (Fig. In terms of impact on protein sequence, ten are new missense, five are known missense and ten are synonymous (Supplementary Fig. The DNA and protein sequence alignments highlighting these mutations are shown in Supplementary Fig. Phylogenetic trees show the known alleles in the study participants are spread over multiple diverged lineages while some of the new alleles are found to be closely clustered, pointing to potential common founder lineages (Fig. To gain insight into the genetic variation in the ME assemblies, we compared them against the widely used genome references GRCh38 and CHM13, whereby we performed assembly-based alignment and called single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels) and various types of structural variants (SVs). Assembly-based alignment relies on mapping assembled contigs against a given reference instead of individual reads in classical read-based alignment, and was shown previously to lead to better accuracy31. Consistent with this, using this approach, we observe more accurate calls than using read-based alignments (Supplementary Fig. Overall, there were an average of 6.6% more variants against CHM13 than GRCh38, the largest being shown for Sudanese (10.3%; Fig. This is most prominent for SV deletions which are 61.5–87.2% higher. The exception to this trend is for inversions, whereby, on average, they are 43.2% less against CHM13 than GRCh38. Comparing the assemblies, the Sudanese has 18.6% more SNVs and indels on average than those of other participants, whereas SV counts are more uniform (Supplementary Fig. We found that 1,177–1,568 deletions and 1,325–1,641 insertions across the six families were entirely absent from the HPRC dataset. Also, more than half of them (51–56%) fall in repetitive regions, notably simple repeats, while 19–22% overlap with segmental duplications (Fig. a, SV count against CHM13 and GRCh38 for each child assembly haplotype. b, Count of SV variants (deletions and insertions) in the family trios called against CHM13 and found to be absent from the HPRC dataset, highlighting their spread across intergenic, intronic/UTR and exonic regions (top), repetitive regions (middle) and segmental duplications (bottom). c, Box plot showing median counts of variants per MB relative to African segments in the same participants aggregated per family (n = 15), for various ancestries. d, Cumulative sizes of long and medium ROH of the ME assemblies and the Yoruba 1KG trio. e, Location and count of genes within the long ROH segments for chromosomes 6 and 12 of the Jordanian father. f, Cumulative number of genes (pLI > 0.9) over contigs per child assembly. g, Candidate disease-causing variants in the probands. Shown are the variants, impacted genes, ascertained phenotypes in the child participants and associated details. The comments column indicates whether the variant was identified with read-based calling. Exonic deletions are denoted by an asterisk on the bars. SD, segmental duplication; HPO, Human Phenotype Ontology; Au, autism; CRD, cystic renal dysplasia; DCS, duplicated collecting system; GD, gait disturbance; GI, glaucoma; GDD, global developmental delay; ID, intellectual disability; MRC, multiple renal cysts; S, seizure; T, tall stature; P, pathogenic; LP, likely pathogenic. Next, we overlaid the generic variants on local ancestry segments. The aggregated counts per ancestry were reflective of the global ancestry of individual participants, rather than showing specific enrichment (Supplementary Fig. When we plotted the number of variants per 1 Mb of ancestral segment as a function of chromosomal coordinate, we saw that the counts across segments fluctuated between ancestries, as illustrated for the near-complete chromosome 10 (Supplementary Fig. When we aggregated that, we observe 12–30% lower variant counts relative to African segments (Fig. 5c), in line with population distances (Supplementary Fig. In light of the background consanguinity known to characterize ME populations, we explored ROH in the assemblies, which we calculated from the assembly-based alignments to CHM13. We classified ROH to medium (1–3 Mb) and long (≥3 Mb), which respectively reflect distant and recent inbreeding32,33. ROH segments are found genome-wide up to nine per chromosome, with variable cumulative ROH per chromosome (Extended Data Fig. Cumulatively, the ME participants had an average 43.8 Mb medium ROH and 69.1 Mb long ROH, which is fivefold greater than a reference Yoruban trio (Fig. The father in the Jordanian trio exhibits the largest cumulative ROH (212.3 Mb), of which 174.6 Mb is of the long type which is remarkable given that he has not presented any clinical phenotypes. There is a high correlation between ROH segment size and gene content (Pearson correlation coefficient, R = 0.8, P < 10−4; Supplementary Fig. Various types of genes are found in these ROH segments, including protein coding, pseudogenes and LncRNA without any category being particularly enriched (Supplementary Fig. Notably, the Jordanian father, who is a healthy participant, harbors exceptionally long ROH segments on chromosomes 6 (52.9 Mb) and 12 (37.6 Mb), the longest amongst all participants, spanning 30% and 28% of the chromosomes and covering 794 and 620 genes, respectively (Fig. We confirmed these long ROHs by examining the alignments of HiFi reads against CHM13 which showed homozygous genotypes throughout the region and introduction of heterozygous sites at the ends (Extended Data Fig. We note that of the 537 ROH segments identified in the study participants, 72% (386) encompass at least one protein-coding gene with high probability of loss-intolerance (pLI) score >0.9 (ref. We performed a trio-based analysis to search for disease-causing variants that explain the disease phenotypes in the child participants (Methods). We examined the SNVs, indels and SV variants obtained for families against CHM13. Given that only the children are affected, we considered recessive and de novo modes of inheritance. We prioritized variants that were rare in population databases (allele frequency, AF < 0.01), including gnomAD35, 1KG36, HPRC8 and QGP phase 1 cohort14,37, have high predicted functional scores and whereby the proband conditions are consistent with gene phenotypes reported in ClinGen38, Gene2Phenotype (G2P) panel on Developmental Disorders39 and DECIPHER40. Overall, we shortlisted 23 candidate variants relevant to the various phenotypes across the six probands, comprising 16 deletions, 6 insertions and 1 SNV, each participant having between 1 and 8 variants (Fig. In terms of inheritance mode, 12 are recessive while 11 are de novo. Regarding their location, four are shown to impact exons, whereas the rest impact intronic regions and overlapping regulatory features, therefore providing strong candidates as disease-causing (Supplementary Table 2). Based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, two of the variants are classified as pathogenic and one as likely pathogenic, found in the well-established genes of NFIX (associated with Malan Overgrowth Syndrome) and TSC2 (associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex), in addition to ABO which is less known to be implicated in neurodevelopment. Furthermore, 20 variants were classified as variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in genes reported to have strong evidence of association in the literature (ACMG total score ≥ 0.45). These include 10 that we classified as high interest VUS (ACMG total score = 0.60–0.75; Supplementary Table 2), such as SOX5 (delayed speech and language development) and BRSK2 (neurodevelopmental disorders). Notably, in Qatari 1 proband who has global developmental delay, we identified a 234 bp Del in intron 5 of KIF1A, which encodes a motor protein essential for axonal transport of synaptic vesicle precursors. A de novo mutation in this gene has been previously reported to cause cerebellar atrophy and epilepsy in an Egyptian child from a consanguineous marriage41 and other variants in this gene have been classified by ClinGen and G2P to have a ‘definitive' association with autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. The largest shortlisted variant is a homozygous Del (2.2 kb) in the intronic region of GABRG1 in the Jordanian proband who has seizures and autism. Variants in GABRG1 are associated with seizures and global developmental delay42. This gene encodes the γ1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor and has been associated with epileptic encephalopathy under ‘limited' class on G2P. Therefore, our finding supports a more assertive classification for this gene. We observed that 50% of candidate variants we shortlisted using the assembly-based alignment approach were not called based on the classical approach of aligning long reads, either entirely or by calling the wrong zygosity (Fig. We checked that the assembly-based variants occurred in regions of high-quality assembly as indicated by Flagger. Furthermore, when we repeated the exercise of trio analysis based on variants obtained using the classical read-based approach, we shortlisted seven de novo variants for the six participants (Supplementary Table 3). We found that two of those were already detected using an assembly-based approach, including the SNV variant for NFIX, while the others were not valid de novo upon further examination of the read alignments, since they also appeared in the parental genomes as illustrated for the variants in TRPM3, AKT3 and KMD4B (Supplementary Fig. Notably, that became clearer when the alignments were done against closer references, as illustrated by aligning Syrian participants against Jordanian father or HG002 (Supplementary Fig. The assemblies generated in this study allow us to assess the impact of a ME genome reference. First, to illustrate the relationship between genetic distance to the genome reference and the number of called variants, we aligned test samples with diverse ancestries from 1KG and ME populations against each of the ME child assemblies. For each assembly-ancestry combination pair, we used two test samples per population as follows: one closest and one furthest from the assembly, as identified based on principal component analysis (PCA). A significant linear correlation was observed between the number of variants and the Euclidean distance to the test samples for all assemblies except the Sudanese (R = 0.18; Fig. a, Euclidean distance versus variant count for each of the child assemblies. The shape of the markers differentiates the samples with maximum and minimum distance from our assembly for a given ancestry. Regression lines and coefficients of the Pearson correlations are shown. Corresponding P values are <10−4 for all except Sudanese (P = 0.54), calculated using two-sided t test. b, Ratio of unmapped read pairs over mapped and number of singletons relative to MER1 in the replacement chromosomes for ME query samples (n = 15) for various reference genomes. Values were calculated per 1 Mb regions and averaged over chromosomes. c, Differences in variant counts per 1 Mb for ME query samples (n = 15) from various ME ancestries against various reference genomes relative to MER. Next, to specifically compare the performance of a ME reference relative to the published T2T references controlling for completeness, we examined the impact on read mappability and variant calling of SNVs and SVs from aligning 27 short-read test samples with diverse ME Arab ancestries encompassing PAR, GAR and WEP against GRCh38, CHM13, HG002 and MER, a hybrid assembly based on CHM13 in which we replaced six chromosomes with diverse T2T haplotypes from Qatari 1 (chromosomes 4 and 18), Jordanian (chromosomes 10 and 12), Syrian (chromosome 6) and Qatari 2 (chromosome 11), which we denote as MER1. In terms of read mappability against the six chromosomes, MER1 shows a subtle but consistent trend of improved metrics relative to CHM13, HG002 and CN1 in this order (Fig. The difference in the normalized ratio of unmapped reads pairs over mapped relative to MER1 is highest for CN1 (median = 0.22) and lowest for CHM13 (median = 0.06). The number of singletons follows a similar trend with CN1, showing 3.6-fold more singletons relative to MER1 than CHM13. On the other hand, the metrics show a prominent improvement relative to GRCh38 (Supplementary Fig. Regarding variant calls, more variants per MB relative to MER1 are obtained against other references, with HG002 being the closest. Respectively, GRCH38, CN1 and CHM13 show 7.1-, 2.3- and 1.3-fold more median variant counts in comparison to HG002 (Fig. With the increasing ability to produce high-quality genome assemblies at a larger scale, generating population genome references has become more compelling than ever. However, the challenge remains in the strategy for sampling diverse admixture. While the HPRC pangenome included many East Asian genomes, the CPC pangenome revealed substantial diversity outside HPRC4,5. ME populations, with their distinct genetic structures and history, require more refined sampling methods. Our findings show varied admixture patterns linked to geographical dispersal, even among populations sharing language and culture. Thus, future efforts to construct accurate population references must consider historical and anthropological factors, instead of solely relying on modern delineations of regions and territories. The use of parental information has long been considered the gold standard for phasing genome assemblies43; however, new methods relying on methylation, Hi-C and Strand-seq have substantially improved phasing quality for individual samples44,45,46. Nevertheless, in endogamous/consanguineous populations, parental phasing remains essential in resolving the extensive homozygosity. Trio datasets like the one presented here will help in developing population-specific recombination maps facilitating larger-scale phasing. Our assemblies are nearly complete compared to CHM13, revealing 7–11 Mb of new sequences per participant, consistent with previous reports47. Some regions, such as centromeres and acrocentric p-arms, are not necessarily missing; however, they are difficult to align due to their divergence and ectopic recombination. Ninety percent of new sequences are in repetitive intergenic regions and the remaining are enriched for gene elements. Gene coverage is high with some decrease for rRNA genes, known to have multiple copies28. We identified 75 new HLA/KIR alleles in the assemblies, including 11 with CDS mutations. Four alleles were unique to Sudanese ancestry, consistent with its greater African genetic divergence. We map these alleles' phylogenetic context, which will serve as a valuable addition to understanding HLA/KIR diversity and their role in immune-mediated processes across populations48. Soon, assembly-based methods are expected to replace read-based methods for alignment and variant calling, leading to higher accuracy49,50, especially when the query is divergent from the genome reference. This is highlighted by our comparison of DeepVariant (read based)51 and phased assembly variant caller (PAV) (assembly based)52. The ME assemblies exhibited 6.6% more variants against CHM13 than GRCh38, consistent with CHM13 having 8% more sequence than GRCh38 (ref. We observed fewer SV deletions and more inversions against GRCh38, reflecting known imbalances8 and misorientations in the latter9,53. Nearly half of the new SVs in ME genomes span intronic and exonic regions, with a balanced distribution between repetitive and non-repetitive regions, suggesting a broad biological impact. We show that assembly-based variant calling, especially with T2T references like CHM13, enhances variant detection and inheritance analysis in rare disease trios54. However, while this improves the identification of disease-causing variants, it may not immediately increase genetic diagnosis yield due to limited functional annotation, especially in non-coding regions55. Intronic variants are increasingly implicated in rare diseases56 but are often classified as VUS under current ACMG criteria due to the lack of algorithms scoring complex non-coding variants57. This makes functional validation a bottleneck for confirming many genetic diagnoses. As sequencing advances near-complete variant landscapes, large-scale genome annotation efforts—such as the IGVF consortium58—are urgently needed for systematic interpretation and prioritization. Phased genome assembly allows more accurate ROH calculation, essential when studying consanguineous populations. As expected, we observe high ROH levels in the ME trios, especially long ROH, indicative of recent inbreeding32,33. This includes extended ROH in healthy individuals, leading to the autozygosity of many genes, uncovering extensive benign variation. Also, it harbors recessive deleterious variants contributing to disease phenotypes16. While de novo variants are a major cause of developmental disorders59, recessive variants, as shown here, are relevant in consanguineous populations, and multiple variants can co-occur, explaining comorbidities and variable penetrance60. Finally, we demonstrated that using ME assemblies as references reduces variant calls and improves mappability compared to unmatched references, highlighting the need for population-specific genome references to capture relevant variations, including pathogenic ones. As more disease cohorts undergo long-read sequencing and de novo assembly, these data could enhance pangenome efforts with informative haplotypes as long as they lack gross chromosomal abnormalities. While there is a need for a universal pangenome reference cataloging global variation61, its wide adoption remains challenging. That is also compounded by the shift toward direct genome comparisons using multiple alignments. Nevertheless, integrating ME pangenomes and other regional datasets would greatly enrich the genomic and biomedical landscape. The study participants consist of six parent–child family trios (n = 18) from the local population in Qatar recruited at Sidra Medicine, whereby children were ascertained for neurodevelopmental disorders. Previously, three families (Sudanese, Jordanian and Qatari 2) had negative genetic diagnoses based on microarrays and selected panels. The families are from various nationalities from the greater ME region—Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Qatar (2X) and Afghanistan. Whole peripheral blood samples were collected from the individuals, stored in EDTA tubes at −80 °C and subsequently processed for DNA and RNA sequencing as described below. Written informed consent and assent were obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Sidra Medicine Ethics Committee. Whole-genome Illumina short-read sequencing was performed at Sidra Medicine. First, genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples on the QIAsymphony System (QIAGEN) using the DSP DNA Midi Kit, per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA quantity and quality were assessed using NanoDrop 8000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific); the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm wavelengths was used to check DNA purity. A fluorescence-based quantification was performed on FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices) using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA integrity was checked on LabChip GX (PerkinElmer). Next, 150 bp paired-end read libraries were constructed and sequencing was performed on a HiSeq X System at Sidra Medicine at 30× coverage. QC was done using FastQC62 and MultiQC63. All reads that had more than an average of 450 million unique paired-end reads were retained. 65) were used to calculate coverage and number of mapped reads. PacBio HiFi sequencing was performed at the University of Washington, as previously described66 with some modifications. Briefly, high-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from the flash frozen peripheral blood samples using the QIAGEN MagAttract HMW DNA Kit (67563). After quality and quantity checks (Agilent FEMTO Pulse, M5330AA and FP-1002-0275; Denovix, DS-11 FX; Thermo Fisher Scientific Q32854), DNA was sheared on Megaruptor 3 (Diagenode, B06010003 and E07010003) twice using settings 29/31 to obtain a peak size around 22 kb. SMRTbell library preparation with the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (PacBio, 100-938-900) and size selection on Sage Science PippinHT (HPE7510) were performed as previously described in ref. Next, sequencing was performed using 3–4 SMRT cells on the Sequel II platform with chemistry version 2.2, 30-h movie times and 2 h pre-extension (PacBio, 101-894-200), leading to coverage of 30–50× per sample. Data quality was evaluated using SMRTlink v.10.1 QC reports from which we used the awk v4.0.2 {print [field]} command to extract the fields relating to sequencing quality, read length distribution and coverage. CCS reads with QV ≥ 20 were retained for subsequent analysis. de novo genome assembly was conducted by running the trioHiFiasm pipeline23 (hifiasm -o sample.asm -t32 -1 pat.yak -2 mat.yak HiFisample.fq.gz), using the parental short reads to create k-mers generated using yak/0.1 (yak count -k31 -b37 -t threads -o output.parental_yak) to construct a pair of haplotype-resolved phased assemblies. The fasta files for the assembly pipeline was generated from gfa files using awk v4.0.2 (https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/). Various assembly quality metrics were calculated on the haploid assemblies using stats.sh script in BBmap (v38.69)67. Phasing quality was evaluated using Merqury v1.3 (ref. 24) by examining blob plots, switch error rates and phased blocks to ensure completeness, accuracy and reliability. The QV score was used to quantify phasing accuracy and completeness. Telomer count checks were made using seqtk telo68, confirming the presence of telomere repeats (TTAGGG) at chromosomal ends of the assemblies. HiFi read-based evaluation of the assemblies was performed by running the Flagger v0.3.3 pipeline following the standard workflow as previously described4. For each assembly, it classifies segments of the assembly sequence into five categories, namely Haploid (reliable), unknown, duplicated, collapsed and erroneous. Assembly-to-assembly alignment was conducted using Minimap2 (ref. To allow visualization with SafFire69, the paf files were converted to SafFire format using rustybam v0.1.31 (ref. The SafFire files were uploaded to an internally deployed SafFire server, which provided an interface to visualize the alignments of haplotypes to GRCh38 and CHM13 (v2.0). For the variant calling in ME assemblies relative to GRCh38 and CHM13, we used two approaches: One based on HiFi read alignments and the other on assembly-based alignments. 25) was used to generate the alignment and DeepVariant v1.5.0 (ref. 51) was used to call both SNVs and indels, while PBSV was used to call SVs71. For the second approach, PAV v2.3.3 (ref. 52) was used to do both the alignment and calling of SNVs, indels and SVs including insertions, deletions (≥50 bp) and inversions. For variant calling of various reference samples from the 1KG and QGP against the assemblies, Illumina short reads were aligned using BWA-MEM72 and DeepVariant v1.5.0 (ref. 51) was used to call SNVs and indels. Variants with the PASS filter were retained for downstream analysis. PCA was performed using SNVs from a dataset combining the 18 study participants, 2,504 samples from the 1KG phase 3 dataset36 and 6,216 samples from the QGP phase 1 (refs. 14,37) in addition to an internal diverse set of ME participants at Sidra Medicine (n = 1,693). For the published datasets, SNVs with the PASS filter were used. For the study participants, SNVs were obtained from the Illumina data by aligning to GRCh37 and calling the variants using the GATK best practice workflow73, retaining only SNVs with the PASS filter. The combined dataset was generated using BCFtools isec v1.17 (ref. 64) and contained 21.3 million SNPs. We applied a minor allele frequency (MAF) filter with a 0.01 threshold, resulting in 7.9 million variants from which principal components were calculated using PLINK v2.00a2LM 64-bit Intel (7 January 2019)74. 75) was used to assign global and local ancestry for the genomes of each study participant based on VCF file containing Illumina-derived SNPs and indels, using as reference a diverse panel from the 1KG and QGP phase 1 cohort which consists of 176 representative individuals identified as having a dominant ancestral fraction >90% for eight distinct ancestral fractions14. This was derived from Admixture analysis of 6,216 samples from QGP and 2,504 samples from 1KG14, ensuring diversity encompasses various continental populations including various ME groups. Output from RFMix consisted of ancestry estimates for chromosomal painting as well as global ancestry estimates (.Q file). RFMix requires phased genotypes, therefore, these were generated using EAGLE v2.4.1 (ref. 76), which was run with three iterations and by providing genetic map and default parameters. Insertions from PAV alignment for the assemblies against CHM13 (2.0) were collapsed per participant using truvari77 (truvari collapse -r 500 -p 0.95 -P 0.95 -s 50 -S 100000). Unique sequences were identified by comparing with the cohort of 47 samples from HPRC for which SVs were previously called8 using truvari (truvari bench -r 1000 -C 1000 -O 0.8 -p 0.8 -P 0.0 -s 50 -S 15 --sizemax 100000). An 80% reciprocal overlap was used. In addition, insertions from various participants were also collapsed into a unique set of sequences using the same process starting from collapsed insertions per participant. Subsequently, the resulting sequences were checked similarly for overlap with HG002 (v. 1.0.1) and CN1. We used bedtools v2.30 (ref. 78) with default options including overlap threshold of 1 bp to intersect SVs with bed files obtained from the CHM13 public resource, namely genetic features (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/009/914/755/GCF_009914755.1_T2T-CHM13v2.0/GCF_009914755.1_T2T-CHM13v2.0_genomic.gtf.gz), repetitive regions (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/annotation/chm13v2.0_RepeatMasker_4.1.2p1.2022Apr14.bed), segmental duplications (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/annotation/chm13v2.0_SD.full.bed), centromeric and satellite repeats (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/annotation/chm13v2.0_censat_v2.1.bed). To annotate assemblies with known genes, we used Liftoff v1.6.3 (ref. 79), using NCBI Refseq GTF file for CHM13 (https://github.com/marbl/CHM13?tab=readme-ov-file) with default parameters. The pLI scores for individual genes were obtained from gnomAD35 (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads#v4-constraint). We used Immuannot to annotate the alleles of HLA and KIR genes per genome haplotype29. We typed the alleles of these genes using default options and extracted CDS mutations and CDS distance for new gene alleles. The results were compared with previously published annotations of 220 pre-annotated reference haplotypes, including HLA assemblies and those from HPRC, CPC, CHM13, CN-T2T and GRCh38.p14 downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/8372992. Phylogenetic trees were generated by first extracting the DNA sequences of each immune gene from the study assemblies using SAMtools v1.17 (ref. These sequences were combined with the publicly available reference sequences into a single FASTA file per gene. This was used as input to generate a multiple-sequence alignment and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using Clustal Omega80. The trees were plotted using TreeViewer81. Sequences were retrieved from the IPD48. Alignment figures were generated using Jalview82. Allele frequencies for HLA-A alleles were obtained from the CIWD catalog v3.0 (ref. ROH segments were identified per participant using Automap v1.2 (ref. 83) using default parameters and variant calls from PAV for the assemblies against CHM13 as input. GTF file was also provided as input, which resulted in the annotation of ROH segments using genes. A selection of ROH regions was visually verified using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)84. Using SNVs, indels and SVs produced from the trios called against CHM13, we perform trio-based analysis for each family following the workflow of Exomiser v14 (ref. 85), which itself does not support the CHM13 reference. This method combines variant prioritization and phenotypic concordance86. Given that the disease symptoms affect the children only, we considered the modes of inheritance of recessive and de novo. First, we shortlisted variants that met each mode of inheritance and then did a lift over to GRCh38 coordinates followed by running annotation using Jannovar87 and annotSV v3.4.2 (ref. 88) to retrieve various functional scores and allele frequencies from various public databases including allele frequencies from various public databases including gnomAD v4.0 (ref. 35), dbVar and 1KG36, to which we appended allele frequencies from Qatar Genome Project Phase 1 (refs. For the SV annotation with annotSV v3.4.2 (ref. 88), we adopted minimum 80% reciprocal overlap to account for breakpoint imprecision. We selected variants with AF < 0.01 in various population databases and have genotype–phenotype association P vaue of <0.05 and a gene combined score and genotype–phenotype score of >0.8. Further filtering was performed based on variants with a high functional consequence. Finally, we cross-checked in ClinGen38, DECIPHER38 and Gene2Phenotype39 to confirm the relevance of the link obtained to the proband's condition. We checked that variants were in regions flagged as reliable by Flagger v0.3.3 (ref. We performed variant classification for SNVs and Indels based on the guidelines recommended by ACMG89, and for SVs based on the joint recommendations by ACMG and ClinGen90 and as implemented in Franklin (https://franklin.genoox.com/clinical-db/home). For the latter, we classified variants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic and VUS if they have total ACMG scores ≥ 0.99, 0.90–0.98 and −0.89 to 0.89, respectively. To assess read mappability against various genome references, we selected 27 representative samples with diverse ME Arab ancestries encompassing PAR, GAR and WEP for which Illumina reads (30×) were mapped against each reference using DRAGEN91. Metrics of the ratio of unmapped read pairs over mapped, percentage of properly paired reads and number of singletons were calculated based on values obtained from the output of DRAGEN and were tabulated to generate the various plots. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are typical of those used in the field of study. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Pearson correlation with two-sided significance was calculated. The tools and packages used for the processing and analysis of data in this study have been reported in the Methods and Study summary, with the specific versions allowing the reproducibility of the results. In all box plots in this study, the boxes indicate the middle 50% of the data, while whiskers indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range. The lower quartiles are dark shaded and the upper ones are light shaded. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Nature Human Behaviour (2025)Cite this article Metrics details Research from high-income countries has found negative outcomes associated with physical punishment. Yet, the extent to which such research evidence generalizes to children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely unknown. The objective of the current pre-registered study (PROSPERO: CRD42022347346) was to conduct a meta-analysis of the associations between childhood physical punishment and individual outcomes in LMICs. We identified eligible articles by searching for keywords related to physical punishment in six languages across 11 databases, with search periods from April to August 2021 and June to July 2024. This process yielded 5,072 unique records, of which 189 studies, comprising 1,490 unique effect sizes and representing 92 LMICs, met our inclusion criteria. Findings from random-effects multilevel meta-analyses indicated that physical punishment was associated with detrimental outcomes, including mental health problems, worse parent–child relationships, substance use, impaired social–emotional development, negative academic outcomes and heightened externalizing behaviour problems, among others. Despite some variation by contextual and study-level characteristics, all subgroup estimates were consistent in direction. Sensitivity checks indicated that these findings were not typical of other non-violent methods of discipline but were specific to physical punishment and psychological aggression. The analysis confirmed that physical punishment is associated with detrimental outcomes for individuals in LMICs. Additional research is needed to inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and interventions to prevent the physical punishment of children and adolescents worldwide.
