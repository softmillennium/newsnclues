                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal, took to X on Monday to lambaste President Donald Trump's tariffs, calling them a "structural, permanent tax on the American consumer." He also said Trump appears to be the "most high tax American President in generations." "Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things," Kimbal Musk wrote on social network X, one the companies in his brother's extensive portfolio. The younger Musk owns a restaurant chain called The Kitchen, is a board member at Tesla, and former director at SpaceX and Chipotle. He has also co-founded and invested in other food and tech startups, including Square Roots, an indoor farming company, and Nova Sky Stories, a creator of drone light shows that he bought from Intel. Elon Musk is a top adviser to Trump, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an effort to drastically cut federal spending, largely through layoffs, and consolidate or eliminate agencies and regulations. However, his relationship with some key figures in the Trump administration has been showing signs of strain in recent days as the president's sweeping tariffs have led to a dramatic selloff in stocks, including for Tesla, which is down 42% this year and just wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022. Over the weekend, Elon Musk took aim at Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, disparaging his qualifications in a post on X. Musk also said that Navarro hasn't built "s--t." Navarro told CNBC on Monday that Musk is, "not a car manufacturer" but rather a "car assembler," dependent on parts from Japan, China and Taiwan. Tesla was seeking a more moderate approach to trade and tariffs in a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative. According to Federal Election Commission filings, Kimbal Musk this year has contributed funds to the Libertarian National Committee and Libertarian Party of Connecticut. Last year, while his brother became the biggest financial backer and promoter of Trump, Kimbal donated to Unite America PAC, a group that markets itself as a "a philanthropic venture fund that invests in nonpartisan election reform to foster a more representative and functional government."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that many business leaders believe the United States economy is already in a significant downturn. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York. "One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already," Fink added. The asset management executive also said that he thinks the tariff policies of President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation and make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, as the central bank often does during recessions. "This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that. I'm much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that's going to bring rates up much higher than they are today," Fink said. BlackRock as a firm held more than $11 trillion in assets as of the end of 2024, spread across public and private investments. Join us at the New York Stock Exchange!Uncertain markets?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs. Trump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden. U.S. Steel shares spiked about 9% in reaction to the decision. Restaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending. Investors pulled back across restaurant segments, from fast food to full-service dining. Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs. "Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk," Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday. U.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say. The industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. "The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be the reality six months from now," Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said. "We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers," TD Cowen said. A large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC — 69% — said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump's sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week. And more than half of them said they expect that the downturn will come this year. "Disappointingly stupid and illogical," another CEO said of the tariffs. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy. Those non-tariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a "small first start." Tech stocks wobbled after Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans. Trump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News. Trump's golf rounds in Florida are like "going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery," the official said. Trump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports. Trump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the "reciprocal" duties unveiled at the White House last week. Trump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand. China's action came "despite my warning" that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs "will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set," Trump wrote. Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" Two Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Union President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU. "Let's take that deal," Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen's offer. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., replied in a tweet, writing, "Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee." "At some point you have to take YES for an answer," Johnson wrote. U.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump's latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella. Billionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. "will face ruin for years to come" if the Trump administration does not immediately "change course" on its tariff policies. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come," he wrote. The White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days. "Fake news," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council. Trump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, "Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening." "President Trump is not going to bend," Bartiromo said in the video. Trump writes that it's "not sustainable" for the U.S. to "lose $1.9 trillion on trade" in a post just now on Truth Social. Trump's post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can't lose money on trade "and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations." Lutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News. "It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap," Lutnick said. People who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November's election — and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market. CNBC's All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters. And of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock. Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk's swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO's trade views and those of the Trump administration. Navarro told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro "ain't built s---." It's no big deal," Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk's comments. Navarro praised Musk's work with DOGE on slashing government spending. However, he then took a swipe at the billionaire. Navarro noted that parts of the Tesla cars assembled at its Texas plant are from overseas. "What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis," he said. "Countries from all over the World are talking to us," Trump wrote on Truth Social, and "tough but fair parameters are being set." Trump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and "he is sending a top team to negotiate." They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs," Trump says in the post, adding, "it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!" Europe will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariffs. "Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing. "So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners." Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump's plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all. "Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won't take long," Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "So don't tell me that America doesn't have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff," he said. A CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump's tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing. Dimon addresses the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, which has become closely read. "Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, there are some – or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects," Dimon writes. "Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," he adds. Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash. His remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should "get over" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week. Over the weekend, Musk publicly criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro. Musk's comments were at odds with Trump's hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports. Trump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months. Ackman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being "indifferent" to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it. "It was unfair of me to lash out at @howardlutnick," writes Ackman. "I don't think he is pursuing his self interest. It is not an easy job and we don't know how the sausage was made." The new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald. He profits when our economy implodes," Ackman wrote Sunday night. Trump is touting the steep drop in oil prices — driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession — as a policy win. ), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place," Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post. "This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus! "They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!" Trump also blames America's past leaders for "allowing this" to happen. Trump has two significant public events on his schedule today. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate. One in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump's tariff policies.

Traders rushed to buy protection against dollar swings, pushing the cost of hedging to the highest level since Donald Trump's election last November.

The cost of one-week option contracts tied to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed for the third day in a row, and the eighth time in the last nine trading sessions, suggesting traders are positioning for more volatility ahead. The one-month hedge also rose. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a wide-ranging letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he saw "stagflation" dangers slowing the economy as the stock market dropped in response to President Donald Trump's trade wars. "Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in the 58-page letter, which was released Monday and addressed various topics, including immigration and the state of civil discourse. Dimon said he expected rising costs to create a "tug-of-war" over the direction of interest rates, with long-term borrowing costs ultimately heading higher. He even referenced "stagflation," a term popularized before the turn of the century to describe an unpleasant cocktail of high inflation, high unemployment, and tepid economic growth. "This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates," he wrote. Dimon stopped short of saying the economy is headed for a recession. Following a two-day stock sell-off last week, the dreaded R-word has been on everyone's lips. He also suggested that the stock market pain may not be over. "No matter how you measure it, equity valuations are still well above their historical averages," he said, adding: "Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing. The letter also touched on what he deemed "common sense" solutions to the nation's problems, including tightening security at the border and doing away with special interests, or what he called "selfishness on the part of our citizens and elected officials." Some Wall Street watchers have long suspected that the billionaire banker — a regular pontificator on world events — has harbored ambitions to seek public office, though he said last year that he would not seek a position in the Trump administration. Indeed, he said that Americans are "meaner to each other" and that "a little more kindness and understanding would go a long way." Dimon added: "I am a firm believer that we should constantly talk with each other, air our views, hold each other accountable and try to respect all sides of an argument." He said social media algorithms had amplified the problem. JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion in profit in 2024 and has since called employees back to the office five days a week, a mandate that has led some employees to explore their options, including unionization. Last year, the bank also earned a record $58.5 billion in net income, up from $49.6 billion the year before, it said in its earnings filings. The firm's stock is up about 6% over the past year, trading as of early April at about $210 a share.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla fans are still waiting for a new Roadster — and now two ex-Tesla employees are launching an EV startup that could steal Elon Musk's thunder. Musk promised the updated Tesla Roadster would be "the fastest production car ever made, period" when he unveiled it in 2017, but eight years later, the $200,000 rocket-boosted EV is nowhere to be seen, leaving some reservations holders with a serious case of buyers regret. Daniel Davey and fellow Tesla veteran Mark Tapscott are looking to fill that void. The two electric car enthusiasts founded British EV startup Longbow in 2023 along with Jenny Keisu, the former CEO of electric boat maker X Shore, and are now looking to disrupt their former employer with a range of lightweight electric sports cars. Longbow's first vehicle will be the Speedster, a limited-production £84,995 ($112,000) open-top sports car that the company describes as a "statement of intent," with deliveries beginning next year. That will be followed by the Roadster, a £64,995 ($85,500) production vehicle that serves as a nod to Elon Musk's infamously delayed supercar. On the day, people were paying deposits by credit card there and then for $250,000. Tapscott says he joined Tesla after being wowed by the original Roadster. After contacting Musk and former Apple exec George Blankenship, he was tasked with selling the first two Model S vehicles in the UK. "I was driving up and down the country, showing those cars to everybody, charging at whatever pub or hotel you could stop off at," said Tapscott, who worked for Tesla for seven years. The two Tesla veterans went on to work with a whos-who of EV companies, including Lucid, Hyundai, and Chinese automakers like BYD. Davey, who returned to Tesla in 2018 to launch the Model 3 in Europe ("Elon was sleeping on the sofa, no one else at the company had any sleep," was how he described that period), told BI that harnessing their wealth of experience would be key to avoiding the fate of other failed EV startups. "We have done this multiple times, and all our peers who could do this are moving their way up to Vice President/Senior VP level and working in VCs because they're not crazy enough to apply that knowledge at the beginning again," he said. After a boom in the early 2020s, the past few years have seen numerous once-promising EV startups collapse as electric vehicle sales growth has slowed and funding has dried up. Meanwhile, legacy automakers have also sought to launch increasingly affordable, mass-market electric offerings as they look to boost adoption and sales. That makes it an unusual time to launch a mid-range electric sportscar — but Longbow's cofounders believe the lack of competition gives the startup an opening. "It's a scandal that no one else is focusing on this segment," said Davey. You have the best margins, and there is no competition," he added. Rather than choosing to build the majority of components in-house — a process that has seen other startups like Tesla and Rivian face an EV "valley of death" as production has scaled up before profits — Longbow plans to buy most of its components off the shelf from outside suppliers. Davey and Tapscott argue that will allow the startup to be more flexible, improve margins, and take advantage of an EV supply chain that is far more developed than when Tesla began building the first Roadster. Although Longbow is making an effort to prioritize local suppliers in the UK, some of its supply chain will likely include Chinese EV tech. "A lot of components come from China, where it's appropriate, especially [battery] cells, right? "But we really want to lean into and support the local supply chain," he said, adding that Longbow expects to finalize its supply chain nine months before deliveries begin in late 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For weeks, the stars of "The White Lotus" have been tight-lipped about viewers' most burning question: Who dies? That question was answered in the season three finale of the HBO hit, which aired on Sunday night — and some of the show's stars are finally getting to air their real feelings about their characters' fates. Arguably no character has a more tragic arc in season three than Walton Goggins' long-suffering Rick. Rick arrives at the resort for a vacation with his younger girlfriend, Chelsea, but he's also there on a revenge mission against the man he believes killed his father. In episodes seven and eight, he finally finds brief moments of absolution and lightness — moments of joy that are cut short when both he and Chelsea are killed off in the show's finale. With the heaviest of hearts… To me, ours was a love story. It was only ever a love story, hindered by unresolved, childhood trauma," Goggins wrote. In the depths of our despair there is always beauty around us. If we can sit with our pain, just sit with it… not react… not be defined by it…It's there… the love the world is constantly giving in any given moment is there," he continued. Goggins thanked the show's creator, Mike White, writing, "Thank you Mike White for your imagination, your tender heart, for the privilege of giving us the opportunity to tell it." He also thanked Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea, and Sam Rockwell, his scene mate and longtime friend. Season three featured both big names in Hollywood and some newcomers. Among the industry vets featured in this season are Parker Posey, Michelle Monaghan, and Jason Isaacs. Goggins' Instagram post after the finale aired drew reactions from fans, many of whom expressed love for the two ill-fated characters — and from at least one of his costars, Patrick Schwarzenegger.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies. In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a "free hall pass" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures. "Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance," said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill. The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days. The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days. Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider. For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, "likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks," the analysts wrote. Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning. "Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on April 2 — and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering. Here's what big names in business and economics have been saying: Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs "run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters." He said the Business Roundtable "supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners" but called on him to introduce "additional reasonable exemptions" and a "transparent, predictable exclusion process." "Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. "These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs," Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's "Peston" program. Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: "I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. "So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don't all live at the average! Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the "Liberation Day" label was "Orwellian doublespeak." "Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be — ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world," he said on X. "He's gone full-on crazy," Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter. "If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them," Krugman added. "March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth," wrote Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column. "Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings)," he added. "Tthe United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries," said Jared Bernstein, the US's former chief economist, in his newsletter. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners." "First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices — as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points — and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2," he added. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else," said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky. "If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth," said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, on BlueSky. "Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built," she added. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance," Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC. "I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%," said Gross, who's also known as "Bond King." Gross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to "catching a falling knife." "The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. "Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising," Blitz wrote. Jim O'Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the "sensible" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services. He said this would be "very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in." "It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves." "Just had a journalist ask me to explain "Liberation Day," Stephanie Kelton, the author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. "I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets." "This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. "One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed." "We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth," she said in a statement on Thursday. She said Trump's move "will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate." The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations. "While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected," Powell said at a conference for business journalists. "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth." "We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said." Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs, which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes "no economic sense." "The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc," Corinth wrote. "But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold." In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could "hit imminently and extend until next year" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario," he predicted. "The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy," he added. "I think what the announcement on Wednesday showed is that the decision of the administration, not surprisingly, was to follow President Trump's instincts, not the instincts of his more moderate advisors, to go all in," Setser said on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs." "The risks of a particularly severe recession are real, because if these tariffs remain in place on a persistent basis, you would see a drag on US economic activity worth about 1% to 1.5% of growth," he said. "Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this week's events is the ability of one person to completely remake American trade policy. A situation in which the occupant of the White House can make such momentous changes on his own, unchecked, reflects serious political decay in American politics." "It's painful to see a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated," Sowell said. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on X that the US's global economic war against the world risks destroying confidence in America as a trading partner and investment destination. Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square, suggested a 90-day time-out to negotiate and resolve "unfair asymmetric tariff deals." "If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," wrote Ackman. Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their probability for a US recession from 35% to 45% on a sharp tightening in financial conditions, overseas consumer boycotts, and a spike in policy uncertainty that will depress capital spending. The forecast is based on their assumption that the effective tariff rate rises by 15 percentage points — which is less than what has been announced. If most of the tariffs take effect on Wednesday, that would raise the effective tariff rate by 20 percentage points. In that case, the analysts expect a recession, they wrote.</p>

Good morning, this is Chiranjivi Chakraborty, an equities reporter in Mumbai. A bruising start to the week awaits traders as global markets continue to reel from the impact of President Trump's tariffs on global growth. While India has indicated that it does not plan to retaliate against Trump's levies, the knock-on impact from a slowing global economy and a potential US recession will keep volatility high.</p>
