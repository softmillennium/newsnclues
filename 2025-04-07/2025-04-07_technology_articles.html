                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Meta exec on Monday denied a rumor that the company trained its new AI models to present well on specific benchmarks while concealing the models' weaknesses. The executive, Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said in a post on X that it's “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” In AI benchmarks, test sets are collections of data used to evaluate the performance of a model after it's been trained. Training on a test set could misleadingly inflate a model's benchmark scores, making the model appear more capable than it actually is. Over the weekend, an unsubstantiated rumor that Meta artificially boosted its new models' benchmark results began circulating on X and Reddit. Reports that Maverick and Scout perform poorly on certain tasks fueled the rumor, as did Meta's decision to use an experimental, unreleased version of Maverick to achieve better scores on the benchmark LM Arena. “Since we dropped the models as soon as they were ready, we expect it'll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in,” Al-Dahle said. “We'll keep working through our bug fixes and onboarding partners.” Meta exec denies the company artificially boosted Llama 4's benchmark scores Former teen model co-created app Frich to help Gen Z be more realistic about finances Apple pulls Binance, Kraken, other crypto apps from India App Store</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. But the GeForce RTX 5090D, a variant exclusive to China, is highly coveted in that market. Galax has expanded its Boomstar series by launching two new custom GeForce RTX 5090D models for gamers in China. A noteworthy feature of these two models is the quick-release shroud. Rather than securing the shroud to the graphics card using conventional screws, Galax has implemented a magnetic attachment system, utilizing magnets at several points to ensure the shroud remains securely in place. This is an interesting idea, particularly with regard to maintenance, as it allows for tool-free removal. Galax has a history of utilizing magnets in its graphics cards. The Boomstar series, renowned for its anime-inspired theme, previously featured detachable front and back panels to allow for user customization. The notion of providing detachable components on a graphics card can be traced back several years, with manufacturers such as Sapphire and XFX having offered graphics cards equipped with swappable cooling fans in the past. The most recent iteration from Galax takes things a bit further. The power subdelivery system consists of a 16+6+7-phase design. Galax sells the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna in standard and overclocked variants. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Wedbush cut its price target for Apple stock by $75, down to $250 per share. He also cited CEO Elon Musk's politics, which has created a brand crisis for the automaker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And Trump's new threat isn't exactly calming anyone's nerves. “If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote. Trump introduced a new 34% tariff on Chinese goods on April 2 during his bizarre “Liberation Day” announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House. If Trump does go through with his threat, it would seem the total tariff would amount to 104%, though it's not entirely clear yet if that's indeed the ceiling. When the president made his tariffs announcement last week, complete with a now-infamous chart, market analysts and journalists were left confused about what the numbers he was displaying actually meant. In reality, the White House was using an equation that made absolutely no sense. Australia, for example, imports more from the U.S. than it exports but still got hit with a 10% tariff on all goods it exports to Americans. Trump did give some breadcrumbs of hope that his tariffs on other nations outside China were up for negotiation, according to his latest Truth Social post. Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump concluded in his Truth Social post. The markets have been swinging wildly on Monday, first plunging at the open but then recovering briefly after a tweet from someone named Walter Bloomberg on X. Bloomberg has no affiliation with Bloomberg News but many people follow the account because it often tweets breaking news from the wire services. Erik Wasson, a reporter for Bloomberg News, even tweeted Monday that people shouldn't rely on that Walter Bloomberg account, writing “He doesn't work for us and is not authorized by Bloomberg.” Walter Bloomberg tweeted that the White House was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs, apparently because Trump advisor Kevin Hassett had given a Fox News interview two hours earlier where he'd been asked about the possibility of just such a reprieve. KILMEADE: Would Trump consider a 90 days pause in tariffs? HASSETT: I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide … even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP Trump is imposing these global tariffs because he says trade deficits are an “emergency.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, introduced a bill last week to claw back some of that power. And as of Monday, the bill has seven Republican sponsors, according to NBC News. But even if the bill passes the Senate, it seems unlikely to come to a vote in the House, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, has shown no signs that he will betray Trump by taking back any of the powers originally given to Congress. And it's almost entirely the fault of one guy if you don't count the Republicans who have enabled this stupidity. Trump is playing chicken with the global economy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is bringing multimodal search to AI Mode, its Google Search experiment that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic. AI Mode can understand the entire scene in an image, including how objects relate to each other, as well as their materials, colors, shapes, and arrangement, according to Google. Using a technique called “query fan-out,” AI Mode asks multiple questions about both the image and the objects shown in it, providing more detailed information than a traditional Google search. For example, you could snap a photo of your bookshelf and enter the query: “If I enjoyed these, what are some similar books that are highly rated?” AI Mode will identify each book and then provide a list of recommended books with links to learn more about and/or purchase them. AI Mode also lets you ask follow-up questions to narrow down your search, such as “I'm looking for a quick read, which one of these recommendations is the shortest?” Launched last month, AI Mode looks to take on popular services like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health officials have reported a second local death from the resurgent virus, now marking the third overall U.S. death connected to measles this year. The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reported the second death late Saturday night, though it actually occurred Thursday. The person (since identified as eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand) died from “measles pulmonary failure,” according to doctors at University Medical Center Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas. On Sunday, RFK Jr. attended Hildebrand's funeral, and he has continued to both tout the benefits of vaccination as well as unsupported medical treatments for measles. As of early April, 481 measles cases have been documented in Texas, dating back to mid-January, while 56 people have been hospitalized. Much like the first fatal case reported in Texas last month, Hildebrand was unvaccinated and had no pre-existing health conditions. New Mexico officials reported the death of an adult with measles last month as well, though it's not yet confirmed whether the viral disease was to blame. Overall, more than 600 cases of measles have been reported in the U.S. Outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly Kansas are connected to each other, and have largely occurred among unvaccinated Mennonite communities in rural regions. There have also been isolated, travel-related cases in over a dozen other states. Cod Liver Oil and a Whole Lot of Other Nonsense Doctors have occasionally turned to steroids for serious and relevant measles complications, such as brain swelling, but there isn't strong-enough evidence supporting its standard use. A 2023 study, for instance, failed to find that steroids were associated with better outcomes during a 2017 measles outbreak in Italy (thankfully, they weren't associated with worse outcomes). Antibiotics can be used to treat secondary bacterial infections that could emerge from measles, but they can't directly treat viral infections. RFK Jr.'s Vitamin A Fix for Measles Is Hurting Kids in Texas Previously, RFK Jr. has claimed that cod liver oil—rich in vitamin A—can be an effective measles treatment as well. But there's no rationale for its use in the U.S., since very few Americans suffer from vitamin A deficiency. While Kennedy may finally have found a vaccine that he can support, his other medical advice has and could very well endanger more children suffering from measles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since President Donald Trump mandated that remote and partially remote federal workers all must return to their offices, thousands of employees across the country have been figuring out how to navigate new commutes, seating arrangements, and a lack of supplies as basic as toilet paper and legal pads while still getting their work done. One effect of all this, many federal employees tell WIRED, is that they are traveling long distances to spend all of their time in virtual meetings. “I don't directly work with anyone in the office that I am going into,” one employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development tells WIRED. “So I show up and sit on [Microsoft] Teams calls.” A Treasury employee says they spend most of their time at the office on video calls as well, “because of people working at other sites … and that's hard when working from a cubicle. I definitely get less done because of the distractions.” At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one employee says that the focus on the return-to-office mandate has meant a lot of chaos for people who actually need to do their jobs in person. “Some teams and groups aren't even on the same campuses because space was so limited. Outlets like CNN and Reuters reported on the initial confusion and disarray caused by forcing tens of thousands of employees back to the office all at once, but weeks later, employees say the situation is getting worse. Though Trump and Musk have claimed the mandate would result in huge productivity increases and financial savings, more than 30 federal employees at 17 federal agencies tell WIRED the return-to-office order has resulted in widespread chaos, plummeting productivity, and significantly reduced services to the public. WIRED granted employees anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, which some say are affecting their physical and mental health—and nearly all say are resulting in a lower quality of work and worse public services. Multiple government employees claim that there isn't enough space in federal offices, or necessary equipment, to make their return worthwhile. “I have lots of meetings every day, so I would have to go elsewhere to find some privacy, along with everyone else,” a DHS employee tells WIRED. Now, employees are not assigned office spaces until they arrive at work each day. My productivity has drastically decreased.” The offices are also so “gross,” the employee says, that they bring their own cleaning products to work. Weeks after returning to the office, a Social Security Agency (SSA) employee claims there isn't enough furniture for everyone. An employee at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says he was ordered to return to his office on March 10, despite being hired for a fully remote position in 2022. Tech issues have plagued the return of many federal employees. The USDA employee claims that the internet connection at his new office is “far worse than it is at home. “We are getting hammered with RTO tickets,” says another source at the USDA, describing the number of employees making requests for equipment to do their jobs in-office. “We do not have the IT infrastructure to support this massive RTO mandate.” “All the money we saved on decommissioning equipment, saving on having contractors run cabling, enterprise hardware savings, will all be gone,” the USDA source says. “This RTO will not only bring work completion down for people now having to commute and people are going to work exactly their eight hours and not any time over. Many cannot get on LAN, and the Wi-Fi keeps going down,” one IRS employee tells WIRED. Another SSA employee says that they were told to “ration paper.” “Supplies are limited because no one has purchasing authority,” the Treasury employee tells WIRED. “It's a running joke that we bring our own pens and paper. Employees say the return-to-office mandate has also negatively impacted their productivity. “My whole team had been, probably to a fault, working long hours on quick turnaround projects,” a source at the Army Futures Command, which operates under the DOD, tells WIRED. “We were able to do a lot of this at home after dinner in the evening, because we've all got kids and family obligations. Some federal employees say the return-to-office mandates are having a negative impact on their health. “With no car, I am walking a mile to the train, and from the station to the office on concrete and metal, limping along, using elevators when I can,” they say, adding, “While I can ask for Reasonable Accommodations, our DEI offices were gutted, so despite being directed to apply through the proper channels, there's no one there to process them.” In the weeks since they've returned to the office, nothing has improved. “I'm not sleeping well, I can't have access to chairs and desks and monitors at proper heights to make me more comfortable,” they say. A USDA employee says that returning to an office has aggravated their long-dormant carpel tunnel symptoms. “I got an old wooden desk that is not intended to be a workplace,” the employee tells WIRED. My carpel tunnel has not been an issue for about 25 years now.” A Treasury employee says that people on her team have had to quit due to stress stemming from the return-to-office mandate and the uncertainty of what's next. “Getting fired would mean so much more than just losing a paycheck.” Some employees say these fears, combined with the poor working conditions, are impacting their mental health as well. “I'm just going through a depressive episode in part because of the nonstop uncertainty and stress,” says an employee at the DOD. “Even the hardcore military bros in my agency are feeling grim about everything that's happening.” A USDA employee told WIRED that they are now dealing with severe depression due to these mandates and general fear.

These days, rolling your own cipher is, quite rightly, considered a red flag! Cryptography is such an esoteric and deep field that it's easy for a fairly smart but inexperience engineer to misjudge the security of a particular implementation or usage of a cryptographic primitive. As I just wrote in another comment on this page, Microsoft Outlook 2003 used CRC32 to "hash" the personal folder (.PST) passwords. Since CRC32 isn't a cryptographic hash, it was trivial to generate a collision and access someone else's Outlook personal folder.

The @USGSA IT team just saved $1M per year by converting 14,000 magnetic tapes (70 yr old technology for information storage) to permanent modern digital records.April 4, 2025 Hopefully, no official installed at DOGE or GSA assumed that because magnetic tape has been around for such a long time, it is outdated and, therefore, a prime target for replacement with new and improved storage tech. Recently, we reported that the tech behind tape storage, the Linear Tape-Open (LTO) standard, carries on with a robust development roadmap that continues to deliver higher densities. A year earlier, we reported on research that claimed tape storage remained cheaper and less polluting than HDDs or SSDs. As with many choices in tech, be it a decision about your display, processor, or GPU, there remains a diverse choice in storage media because one size doesn't fit all. Though we have fingernail-sized micro-SD cards that can store 1TB now and consumer SSDs that can transfer data at over 14 GB/s, older magnetic storage media like HDDs and tape remain on the menu. That's because they still have particular strengths or a sweet spot balance of features. In the case of the 14,000 magnetic tapes that have been consigned to history by the government, Community Notes attached to the DOGE post reference articles about why tape is still popular for backups in organizations of all sizes and will still be around for “decades to come.” In brief, tape storage remains in favor for multiple reasons, but most importantly due to the format's huge capacity, long-term development roadmap that continues to evolve, known durability (30 years estimated), low energy consumption, TCO, and suitability for cold storage. We also wonder whether the DOGE-celebrated $1M per year change away from tape will stick. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And that new system comes with a hefty price—$450—which could go up even more due to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced last week. Trump's tariffs sent the stock market into free fall; prices on many products are about to go up, and companies in the tech sector will be turned on their heads. Part of the company's business strategy, to this point, had been “to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories,” Bowser says. “That also applied to the early stages of tariffs,” he says. An additional price hike on the console would be problematic for Nintendo. Games have not been spared from high price tags either; Mario Kart World will cost $80. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a tech demo masquerading as a game that explains the ins and outs of the Switch 2, will be an experience people have to pay for. (Notably, this got a huge laugh from the crowd present.) Two former Nintendo public relations managers, Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis, have broken down the criticism around the pricing on their YouTube channel, as well as criticized how news about the price was presented to fans. “Obviously it was intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places,” Yang said, lambasting the decision to leave consumers to get answers themselves. In the past, Nintendo products, including the original Switch, have been hard to find due to problems like chip shortages or global pandemics, but the company has taken efforts to “make sure that consumers can find a console when they're ready to buy the console," Bowser says. They'll also need to get a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a year and to have clocked at least 50 hours of gameplay. Console sales will be limited to one per person. That's why some of the gates, if you will, have been a part of the preorder process.” Other retailers, Bowser says, have their own systems to thwart scalpers. The Switch 2 will soon move into global events, including those that are open to the public, ahead of its June launch. Bowser says that the company hopes to show its audience that “this is the next generation of platform” from Nintendo. The Switch 2 “obviously takes what you know and love so much from the Switch and then adds a lot of powerful features,” he says. If tariffs force Nintendo's hand, the company may find it harder to win over players than ever before. However, it's unlikely Nintendo will face that dilemma alone. In an interview with IGN last Friday, ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn said that if people believe only the Switch 2 will be affected, “then we aren't taking it seriously. The Switch 2 may yet be a bellwether for what's to come. WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It puts social features found on platforms like Discord directly onto the console in a way Nintendo's platforms have yet to do. Gaming is more social than most people give it credit for. After moving online, people were finally able to broaden their social circles to anyone who enjoyed their hobby, and not just whoever lived nearby; apps like Twitch and Discord have made this even easier. While typically, gamers chatting are playing together, GameChat does not require you to play the same games or even play a game at all in order to chat. In some ways, the feature almost acts as an advertisement. People can watch their friends play games they themselves don't own, and then, if they're in a Family Group, borrow them via the system's newly announced virtual game cards. “There's layers to GameChat that I think are really exciting,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser tells WIRED. “One of the things that for us is really important is that we watch and see how people engage in GameChat.” But online communities in gaming can be notoriously noxious. Any lobby or platform with open communication will, inevitably, become a vector for harassment and inappropriate imagery. Online games and platforms like Roblox, which are popular with young users, have massive problems with predators and pedophiles on the platform. GameChat activates voice chat with the system's C button and allows for video use with a USB-C camera—features that could enable a great deal of abuse if left unchecked. During a roundtable discussion with Nintendo's hardware team in New York City last week, Switch 2's director Takuhiro Dohta and producer Kouichi Kawamoto talked about how they designed the system with safety considerations in mind. Roblox has installed similar safety features as part of overhauled parental controls. “You won't find yourself in a situation where you'll be placed in a chat with strangers.” Players will be able to import their friend lists from the Switch, though it may take some “fine tuning” to figure out who's up for chatting, he said. “Ultimately, if something does happen or if someone is chatting with someone you don't want to chat with, there is also a report feature,” Kawamoto added.

While this is a fun experiment with tangible benefits, remember that modding your GPU's vBIOS will likely void any warranty and carries a number of risks, like bricking your GPU. In addition, with some overclocking and tuning, it is reported that the user managed to beat a stock RX 9070 XT. As might be expected, some minor instabilities were observed. AMD's ULPS (Ultra Low Power State) not working was one such issue. Both Nvidia and AMD have tightened restrictions on vBIOS modifications in recent years. Such modding is especially tricky with Nvidia's hardware, owing to a vBIOS signature check that started with the Maxwell generation, primarily to prevent fraud and scams. With previous AMD GPU generations like Vega and RDNA 1, the firm used the same underlying chip for its top two GPUs, differentiating them mainly through disabled hardware shaders and software-locked clock speeds. The software aspect of earlier gen limitations could be overcome by flashing the vBIOS, allowing many Vega 56 cards to perform like Vega 64s, while bringing RX 5700 performance up to RX 5700 XT levels. However, since the missing shaders are likely fused off on the hardware level, they cannot be re-enabled through software. Likewise, keep an eye on your core, memory, and VRM temperatures as you'd be pushing over 300W across a board that's likely not designed with that figure in mind.
