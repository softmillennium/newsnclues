            The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a court-imposed midnight deadline to return to the US a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, agreeing to a request from President Donald Trump that will give the justices more time to consider the case.
    


            Chief Justice John Roberts granted the “administrative stay,” a move that will extend the deadline until the court hands down a more fulsome decision in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported on March 15.
    


            The decision to temporarily pause the case, which is relatively common when the court is facing a quick deadline, means that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, will remain at a notorious prison in El Salvador for now. A lower court judge had given the administration until midnight to return him to the US.
    


            Roberts did not set a new deadline, though the court is likely to move relatively quickly. The chief justice ordered Abrego Garcia's attorneys to respond by Tuesday, though they had already done so minutes before Roberts' order was made public.
    


            “This is just a temporary administrative stay. We have every confidence that the Supreme Court will resolve this matter as quickly as possible,” Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said after the Supreme Court's decision.

            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. Abrego Garcia's case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.
    


            The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that ordering officials to return the man is “unprecedented” as it sounded now-familiar themes arguing federal courts are overstepping their power.
    


            “Even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable,” recently confirmed Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in the filing Monday. “The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.”
    


            “While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was an administrative error … that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight,” Sauer added.
    


            Abrego Garcia rejected that position in his own written arguments Monday.
    


            “There is no dispute that Abrego Garcia is only in El Salvador because the United States sent him there,” his attorneys told the Supreme Court. “There is likewise no dispute that he is being held only because the United States has requested that he be held. And there is no evidence in the record of this case supporting the government's contention that it cannot bring him back.”

            The Trump administration's “contention that he has suddenly morphed into a dangerous threat to the republic is not credible,” Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote. “The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny.”
    


            Abrego Garcia was in the country illegally, but an immigration judge in 2019 — after reviewing evidence — withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.”
    


            The Trump administration has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a “ranking member” of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Sauer wrote, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable.
    


            The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested “in the company of other ranking gang members” and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a “reliable source.”
    


            But in the six years between his immigration hearing and his deportation, Abrego Garcia checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime, court records show.
    


            Yet Abrego Garcia was placed on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. Several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump's invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia, the administration has said, was deported under different authorities.

            On Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis explained in an opinion why she had ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday.
    


            White House officials have publicly mocked the judge's order and assert they have no ability to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.
    


            “Marxist judge now thinks she's president of El Salvador,” Trump adviser Stephen Miller posted to social media Friday.
    


            But under oath, the Justice Department has been far less clear about the removal. Pressed by Xinis last week about why the US couldn't return Abrego Garcia, DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni said he didn't have an answer.
    


            “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” Reuveni responded.
    


            The Department of Justice has since placed Reuveni and his supervisor on leave.
    


            The request to the Supreme Court came minutes before a ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denying the Justice Department's request to lift the lower-court order.
    


            The panel rejecting the appeal was: Judge Stephanie Thacker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama; Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Robert King, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.
    


            Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura, said before the high court's decision that the appeals ruling gave her “hope” and “encouragement.”

            “This decision gives me hope, and even more encouragement to keep fighting. My children, family, and I will continue praying and seeking justice. Now that the court has spoken, I ask again that both President Trump and President Bukele stop attempting any further delays,” she said, referring to Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador. “They need to follow the court's order NOW. My children are waiting to be reunited with their father tonight.”
    


            Thacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the “United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process.”
    


            “The Government's contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” she wrote, adding later that the “irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to Abrego Garcia every minute he is in El Salvador.”
    


            “And the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the Government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the United States,” she added.
    


            In a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning, Wilkinson said he thinks it is “legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate' the plaintiff's return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law.”
    


            “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” he continued. “Thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.”
    


            But Wilkinson said he read Xinis' order “as one requiring that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia's release, rather than demand it.” He said that reading it as a requirement for the administration “would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far.”

            TikTok really is starting to feel like the new television.
    


            Much like last year's “Who TF Did I Marry” in which Tareasa “Reesa Teesa” Johnson shared her side of the story of how her marriage went horribly wrong, a new multi-episode “series” has the internet in a chokehold.
    


            This time, it's “The Group Chat” in which 27-year-old TikToker Sydney Robinson plays multiple characters involved in a group chat.
    


            Here's what you need to know:
    


            The action in this series revolves around a fictional group of friends who are trying to arrange a dinner but one of them, Hailey, wants to bring her boyfriend, Justin.
    


            “Justin really had such a rough day and I don't want to leave him alone,” Hailey writes in the group chat.
    


            Some of the other women in the group are not thrilled with the idea of the unwanted plus one.
    


            “Is she kidding? She's trying to bring her boyfriend AGAIN,” one of the other characters says in exasperation.
    


            What follows is an attempt to “uninvite” Justin and some more drama.
    


            Robinson, 27, told “Today” she was inspired to do the TikTok series after watching an episode of reality show “Jersey Shore: Family Vacation” while flying to Las Vegas last summer. In it, cast member Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino lets the rest of the cast know he's been released from jail via their group chat.
    


            “He texts everyone that he's out, and they're all on a vacation in a house sleeping, and it just revives the group chat. It revives the entire group,” she told “Today.” “Everyone's like, waking up, looking at it, and just the very idea of his name popping up on their home screen sent shock waves through the house. “I was like, ‘That. That feeling.'”
    


            Apparently, the plot is super relatable and has gone viral since the first video was posted on March 30.
    


            It's attracted so much attention that the TikTok account for UPS commented “Everybody quiet … my show is on” in the comments. Multiple celebrities have also responded, including Bethenny Frankel, Leslie Jones, Hailey Bieber and Charlie Puth.
    


            Bieber's interest was especially notable to those following along as some had thought the main characters were based on Hailey Bieber and her husband Justin Bieber. However, according to Robinson, the character Hailey is based on the character of Haley James Scott from the series “One Tree Hill,” not Mrs. Bieber.
    


            Puth's comment, meanwhile, stunned Robinson.
    


            “I'm so invested in this…,” Puth wrote in the comments on the second episode to which Robinson responded “Sorry I can't make a part 3- I've simply passed away.”
    


            Robinson said she was napping after posting part two and awoke to multiple missed calls from her mother who was vacationing outside of the country at the time.
    


            “She's calling me like 100 times, and she's like, ‘Charlie Puth commented on your video,'” Robinson told “Today.” “And I was like, ‘No, shut up.'”
    


            Episode 4 was so eagerly awaited that Robinson teased her followers with a trailer for it. 



            It turned out to be well worth the wait as the fourth installment featured the group meet up at the restaurant where – PLOT TWIST – Justin is there in a way that viewers had not anticipated.
    


            There was also a surprise in that Puth voiced Justin, something Robinson tried to keep secret, but some of her followers recognized the singer's voice right away.
    


            She said she was surprised that he agreed to do it after they messaged about his interest in the skits.
    


            “I have no idea why this massive man in the music industry with 22 million followers would want to be a part of my ‘Group Chat' skit,” she said.
    


            Not that Robinson isn't amassing her own fans. In fact, she now has more than 1.2 million followers and “The Group Chat” videos (including the trailer) have more than 77 million views.

            President Donald Trump said Monday that direct talks are underway between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.
    


            Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said a “very big meeting” would take place Saturday.
    


            “I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,” Trump said.
    


            The US president declined to give further details about the meeting beyond saying it would be “at top level.” He did not say which officials would represent the US at such talks.
    


            Iran had previously rejected Trump's offer of direct negotiations over its nuclear program, offering instead to engage in indirect talks. Trump's offer, which he sent to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in March, proposed negotiations on a new nuclear deal, with a two-month ultimatum to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents previously told CNN.
    


            “We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in televised remarks last month when he rejected direct negotiations. “They must prove that they can build trust.”
    


            The Iranian mission to the UN declined to comment when asked about direct talks or the meeting that Trump announced.
    


            Trump on Monday voiced optimism that talks would be successful in convincing Iran to abandon its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes.
    


            “Hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran's best interests if they are successful. … We hope that's going to happen,” he said.
    


            “If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,” Trump warned.
    


            Both Israel and the US have vowed they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon.
    


            In December, United Nations nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi told Reuters that Iran is “dramatically” accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. In January, Grossi again warned that Iran is “pressing the gas pedal” on its uranium enrichment.
    


            The US been sending more military assets to the Middle East as tensions in the region continue to flare.
    


            The Trump administration began ramping up military action against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen in mid-March, with airstrikes that killed at least 53 people and wounded almost 100 others, according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry.
    


            Last week, CNN reported the total cost of the US' military action against the Houthis was nearing $1 billion in just under three weeks, even as the attacks have had limited impact on destroying the terror group's capabilities, three people briefed on the campaign's progress told CNN.
    


            The military offensive has already used hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of munitions for strikes against the group, including JASSM long-range cruise missiles; JSOWs, which are GPS-guided glide bombs; and Tomahawk missiles, the sources said.

            Maine officials sued the administration of President Donald Trump on Monday to try to stop the government from freezing federal money in the wake of a dispute over transgender athletes in sports.
    


            Trump and Maine, which is controlled by Democrats, are in the midst of a weeks long dispute about the Title IX anti-discrimination law and the participation of transgender students in high school sports. US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said earlier this month that the US Department of Agriculture was pausing some funds for Maine educational programs because of what she described as Maine's failure to comply with the Title IX law.
    


            Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint in federal court on Monday that described the pause as “illegally withholding grant funds that go to keeping children fed.” The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order preventing the USDA from withholding money until a court is able to hear the case.
    


            In a statement, Frey said, the president and his Cabinet “secretaries do not make the law and they are not above the law, and this action is necessary to remind the president that Maine will not be bullied into violating the law.”
    


            The child nutrition program of the Maine Department of Education is unable to access several sources of funding at the moment because of the funding pause, Frey said. The money is used to feed children in schools, childcare centers and after-school programs and is also used to benefit disabled adults in congregate settings, he said.
    


            The lawsuit states that the child nutrition program received or was due to receive more than $1.8 million for the current fiscal year. Prior year funds that were awarded but are currently inaccessible total more than $900,000, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit also says that the program was anticipating about $3 million that is typically awarded every July for summer meal program sponsor administration and meal reimbursement.
    


            USDA officials did not return a request for comment.
    


            Rollins said in a letter to Maine Gov. Janet Mills on April 2 that the state “cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated.” The letter said the funding pause did not impact federal feeding programs.
    


            “In order to continue to receive taxpayer dollars from USDA, the state of Maine must demonstrate compliance with Title IX's protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins' letter said.
    


            Tensions between Maine and the Trump administration have simmered since February when Trump threatened to pull funding from Maine if the state does not comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. Mills, who was present at the White House for a meeting of governors, told the president: “We'll see you in court.”
    


            The Trump administration has vowed to cancel more federal funding if Maine does not bar transgender athletes from sports participation soon.

USCCB says ‘heartbreaking' decision comes after Trump administration cut funding for refugee resettlement

The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) announced on Monday that it is ending a half-century of partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision follows the Trump administration's abrupt halt of funding for refugee resettlement.

The break will inevitably result in fewer services than Catholic agencies were able to offer in the past to the needy, the bishops said.

“As a national effort, we simply cannot sustain the work on our own at current levels or in current form,” said US military services archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the USCCB. “We will work to identify alternative means of support for the people the federal government has already admitted to these programs. We ask your prayers for the many staff and refugees impacted.”

The decision means the bishops won't be renewing existing agreements with the federal government, the bishops said. The announcement did not say how long current agreements were scheduled to last.

Catholic bishops sued Donald Trump's administration in February over its abrupt halt to the funding of aid provided to newly arrived refugees, saying they are owed millions already allocated by Congress to carry out resettlement aid under an agreement with the federal government.

But a federal judge ruled that he couldn't order the government to pay money due on a contract, saying a contractual dispute belongs before the court of federal claims. The bishops have appealed that ruling.

Beyond that specific funding dispute is the Trump administration's halt to all new refugee arrivals. The Catholic bishops oversaw one of 10 national agencies, most of them faith-based, which contracted with the federal government to resettle refugees who come to the US legally after being vetted and approved by the federal government.

Broglio's announcement didn't specify what the children's services program was.

The bishops have overseen Catholic agencies resettling displaced people for a century. In recent decades they had done so in a partnership with the US government, receiving grants that covered much, though not all, of the expenses.

The Trump administration's “decision to reduce these programs drastically forces us to reconsider the best way to serve the needs of our brothers and sisters seeking safe harbor from violence and persecution”, Broglio said.

Despite Broglio's asking for prayers for the “many staff and refugees impacted”, the announcement did not specify whether the cuts would lead to any layoffs.

JD Vance, a Catholic convert, accused the bishops conference in January of resettling immigrants who are in the US illegally in order to get millions in federal funding – an apparent reference to the resettlement program, which actually involves legally approved refugees.

The bishops noted that rather than making money on the program, they receive less in federal aid than the programs cost and need to supplement the funding with charitable dollars.

The vice-president followed up his criticisms by appealing to Catholic teaching as justifying immigration restrictions. That drew rejoinders not only from US bishops but an implicit rebuke from Pope Francis, who said Christian charity requires helping those in need, not just those in one's closest circles.

Exclusive: Richard Harpin pauses donations in move insiders say will result in closure of party's northern HQ

 UK politics live – latest updates

One of the Conservatives' biggest donors has stopped funding the party in a move insiders believe will result in the closure of its northern HQ, the Guardian can reveal.

Richard Harpin, the founder of the home repairs business HomeServe, has ended his donations to the Conservatives, according to two Tory sources.

The decision is a blow to Kemi Badenoch, who is presiding over a diminished and cash-strapped party that is facing intense competition for donations from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.

Harpin gave the Conservatives nearly £850,000 in 2024, Electoral Commission records show, and has donated £3.8m to the party since 2008, £2m of which was in cash. Rishi Sunak used a helicopter owned by Harpin for campaign stops in the run-up to last year's general election.

A source close to Harpin said that while he had paused his donations, he remained a strong supporter of the Conservatives.

Until recently, Harpin, who grew up in Northumberland, made a monthly £33,000 cash donation to the party, which paid for its northern HQ in Leeds. This has now ended and the Leeds HQ is likely to close as a result, two Tory sources said.

The Tories announced their plan to establish a northern HQ in October 2020, almost a year after Boris Johnson's landslide election victory, in which dozens of “red wall” seats in the north of England flipped from Labour to Conservative. The new offices were opened by Oliver Dowden, then party chair, in the spring of 2022 on the outskirts of Leeds city centre.

Labour won back most of those red wall constituencies last summer, and there has since been speculation that the northern Tory HQ was slated for closure as the party faced financial difficulties.

A Conservative party source said Harpin had agreed to fund the Leeds office for an extra year to cover the general election period after an initial two years. The source said that although the party was reviewing its properties, there were no plans to shut down operations in the north.

Despite cash woes, the Conservatives outperformed other parties' fundraising efforts at the end of last year – raising nearly £2m in the last three months of 2024, which was twice as much as Labour and seven times more than Reform. A Conservative party source said they were expecting a strong showing in the first quarter of 2025 too.

One Tory insider said Harpin took his decision to stop donating after a meeting with party co-chair Dominic Johnson, who has faced some internal criticism, but sources close to the HomeServe founder and the party denied this.

The Guardian reported in February that Tory staff numbers had fallen from 200 to about 60 and that there were not enough funds to hire political advisers for some shadow cabinet ministers. There is speculation that the party will move out of its headquarters in Westminster to cut costs.

Last spring, the Conservatives were fined nearly £11,000 for under-reporting the value of non-cash donations received from Harpin for three years. On top of his cash donations, he funded the secondment of an employee to the party.

Harpin, who began his career as a brand manager for Procter & Gamble in Newcastle upon Tyne and stepped down as chair of HomeServe in January. He and his wife secured a reported £500m in 2022 after he sold the company to a Canadian firm for more than £4bn. The Sunday Times rich list placed him as the Britain's 242nd richest person last year, with a worth of £670m, up £40m on the year before.

During the run-up to the election in July several Conservative donors including the Phones 4u founder, John Caudwell, and the carpet tycoon Philip Harris switched to support Labour.

In the past six months, several other Tory donors including the billionaire property developer Nick Candy have been wooed by Reform. Candy is now fundraising for Farage as party treasurer.

Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk, now in Guatemala, had racked up large tax debt at Stedsans forest retreat

A Danish chef couple who attracted international acclaim with a “forest resort” in Sweden have been tracked down to Guatemala after apparently going on the run from tax authorities, leaving behind 158 barrels of human waste.

Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk founded their purportedly eco-friendly retreat, Stedsans, in Halland, southern Sweden, after claiming to have “felt the call of the wild” in Copenhagen, where they ran a popular rooftop restaurant.

Stedsans, formed of 16 wooden cottages looking out on to nature, attracted praise from influencers and reviewers, who described it as “magical” and “enchanting luxury”.

But a few months ago it was discovered that the couple had vanished, leaving multiple animals behind and 158 barrels of human waste, an investigation by newspapers Dagens Nyheter and Politiken has found. It also found that wastewater was left to run into the forest.

Staff said multiple animals – including ducks – had died as a result of being left outside through the night by the couple, and others were left abandoned after the owners vanished.

Stedsans was declared bankrupt in March and the couple reportedly registered themselves as living abroad before Christmas.

According to the investigation, they left the Danish capital, where they owed millions of kroner in debt to Danish tax authorities, in 2016 to move to Sweden. There they set up Stedsans, but started accumulating debt to Swedish tax authorities, which reportedly amounted to 6m SEK (£470,000). They have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.

In a message posted on their website, they said: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.”

They added: “When you read this we have probably been declared bankrupt by the Swedish tax authorities. All we ever wanted was to be a part of creating a more beautiful planet.”

Local authorities described their actions as “environmental crime”. Daniel Helsing, head of building and environment for the local county, Hylte, told Dagens Nyheter: “Voilà. Over 150 barrels of human shit.”

Hansen denied any problems with handling animals when approached by the newspaper. He described Swedish tax authorities as a “narcissistic entity” and said he believed he owed them “over 7m” SEK. He also claimed he was now “sentenced to a life in poverty”.

The Guardian contacted the Danish and Swedish tax authorities. The Danish tax agency said: “We have no comments here subject to confidentiality.” The Swedish tax agency did not comment on the case.

The Guardian has contacted Hansen and Helbæk for comment.

By Alexandra Sergienko, journalist

A powerful shot, the puck crosses the goal line, the siren sounds, and a legend throws his hands up in the air while the crowd at the UBS Arena in New York explodes in cheers. Both American and Russian fans rejoice, as the man scores his 895th goal.

It happened – on April 6, 2025, Alexander Ovechkin, playing for the Washington Capitals, scored against fellow countryman Ilya Sorokin, the goalie for the New York Islanders, to set an all-time NHL record.

This moment will be etched in the memories of millions of fans; it will be recounted for decades to come. “Cool, but how does this help Russia?” people who aren't into sports may ask. Ovechkin's “timeless” record means a lot for Russia. Here's why. 

During a phone call on March 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump discussed hockey and the possibility of organizing games between Russian and American players. Why did the two leaders discuss this? Perhaps they were talking about Ovechkin's dizzying success in Washington. It's no secret that the Kremlin keeps a close eye on Ovechkin, and during his last speech before his inauguration, Trump referred to the Russian hockey star as a “great player”.

Moscow and Washington share something in common: hockey and the legendary Ovechkin. Moscow nurtured his talent, spotting and cultivating his skills, giving him his start in professional hockey, while Washington has become Ovechkin's second home – the city where he has become an NHL legend.

Russians adore Alex Ovechkin, and Americans love him just as much. The Russian embassy in the US has noted that “literally all of America”  rallied behind Ovechkin's quest to break Wayne Gretzky's seemingly untouchable record. Consequently, the embassy noted that interest in holding a match between Russian and North American teams has surged.

Ovechkin is a living “bridge” connecting two hockey capitals – two seemingly different worlds united by their love for this thrilling game. Today, with Russia sidelined from many international competitions, the NHL remains a rare platform where Russian players remind the world of the excellence of Russia's hockey tradition. Ovechkin's record is a shining testament to this. Achievements such as his help maintain an informal dialogue between nations, proving that sports can sometimes transcend political barriers and create opportunities for conversation even among adversaries. Ovechkin's 895th goal is something that both countries can be proud of and admire. It's part of their shared history.

Ovechkin's status as a record-holder could theoretically play a significant role in bringing Russian hockey back to the international stage. Following Ovechkin's record, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) may again allow Russia to participate in international events, including the 2026 Olympics. The return of the Russian national hockey team, one of the strongest in the world, led by Ovechkin, would further increase global interest in hockey and popularize broadcasts of the game, subsequently boosting revenues for both the IIHF and IOC.

At the ceremony celebrating his record, Ovechkin proudly exclaimed, “All of you fans, the whole world, Russian, we did it, boys, we did it!” So why not invite Russian boys to participate in next year's Olympics in Italy? Vladislav Tretiak, the president of the Russian Ice Hockey Federation, has already expressed hope that Ovechkin will be able to compete for Team Russia in 2026, and wished him success.

In the Soviet Union, during the era of legends like Valery Kharlamov, Vladislav Tretiak, Boris Mikhailov, Vladimir Petrov, Alexander Yakushev, and Alexander Maltsev, hockey was an essential part of life, a cultural cornerstone for the Soviet people. Virtually every Soviet household attentively watched the 1972 Summit Series against Canada. While Ovechkin's record might not have the same sweeping impact, it is sure to boost the sport's popularity in Russia, inspiring kids to play hockey and one day break their idol's record. Coincidentally, in 2026, Moscow will open the Alexander Ovechkin Academy.

“Launching this project, I want to achieve an important goal – share my experience, skills, and knowledge with new generations of talented hockey players in the country,” Ovechkin said.

In March, Ovechkin also said that he plans to return to his hometown team, HC Dynamo Moscow, next year. Just imagine how popular this would make the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)! Tickets for Dynamo games will be sold out.

Time will tell whether these optimistic predictions come true, but it's already clear: Alexander Ovechkin's record isn't just an achievement; it's a landmark event that could usher in a new era for hockey in Russia and around the world.

Ministers and more than 70 MPs attended photo call with Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed whose travel ban was called unacceptable

Cabinet ministers and more than 70 parliamentarians staged a show of solidarity with two MPs who were detained and barred from entry to Israel in what was the first time British MPs had been banned from the country.

The health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, joined the photocall in Westminster Hall on Monday with the MPs, along with Hamish Falconer and housing minister Rushanara Ali. It was organised by the Rochdale MP Paul Waugh.

In a statement in the Commons, Falconer said both were given clearance for entrance by Israeli before travelling and said the ban “appears to have been taken on the basis of comments made in this chamber”, calling the treatment “unacceptable and deeply concerning”.

He said the UK government had made that clear at the “highest level” in Israel and praised Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed for their dignity.

Yang and Mohamed both rose in the house to cheers. Mohamed said her treatment was “unprecedented” and the views she had expressed in the House of Commons were “legitimate political opinions which are firmly aligned with international laws”. She said many Israeli people and charities had also called for change in a similar manner.

“This was not about security, this was about control and censorship,” Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, said, adding that she “desperately wants to see a two-state solution, desperately wants to see peace”.

Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, said she had been heartened by the solidarity shown by other MPs from across the Commons. Yang said she had understood the risks of travelling the region but “I did not anticipate the risks of detention and deportation by a British ally”. She said: “If my experience has proved anything, it is that what we say in this chamber matters.”

Falconer said the MPs had initially believed they were going to be detained overnight without their phones and were eventually released after intervention by both him and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, who spoke to his Israeli counterpart.

“All members should be worried about what this decision means and the precedent it sets. We have warned that actions like this only damage the image of the Israeli government in the eyes of honourable members across the house,” Falconer said.

The minister also condemning the killing of 15 paramedics in a convoy of ambulances near Rafah, calling it an “outrage” and demanding a return to ceasefire negotiations. “This conflict cannot be won by bombs and bullets but by diplomacy, he said.

At the photocall in support of the MPs, Streeting told the Guardian he had been on a similar visit led by the Council for Arab British-Understanding (Caabu) and Medical Aid for Palestinians – and questioned why the two had been targeted.

“The way that two really excellent colleagues were treated was totally unacceptable,” he said.

“I think this is really important that this is understood in the context of two highly respected Labour members of parliament held in high regard across the parliamentary party who were going on a delegation just like the one I was on with Caabu and Medical Aid for Palestinians – without the sort of challenges they had.

“In the context of what is going on in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the moment, having insight, meeting a range of voices is really important. It's highly regrettable the Israeli authorities have acted in this way.”

MPs joining the show of solidarity included the chair of the foreign affairs select committee Emily Thornberry, the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, Melanie Ward, the Labour MP who was the former chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians, and the former development minister Anneliese Dodds.

Caabu has taken a total of 161 MP and peers to the region since 1997, including Streeting, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the former education secretary Kit Malthouse and the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey.

Other high-profile politicians who have visited as part of their delegations include former ministers Nick Herbert and the late Tessa Jowell and the Lib Dem MPs Alistair Carmichael and Christine Jardine.

Speaking in the chamber, Falconer condemned the comments of the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who said on Sunday that the two MPs were not allowed entry because the Israeli authorities “did not believe they were going to comply with Israeli law”. Falconer said that was not the reason that the Israeli officials gave, adding: “The leader of the opposition should apologise.”

UK index loses nearly 4.5% as Trump's team dismiss rumours of a 90-day pause on tariffs as ‘fake news'

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.

Elsewhere, Germany's DAX is down 4.3%, France's CAC is down 4.8%, Italy's FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain's IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs.

In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday's session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.

The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.

Monday's session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.

Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.

“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.

Elsewhere, Germany's DAX is down 4.3%, France's CAC is down 4.8%, Italy's FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain's IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs.

Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump's tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders' share prices.

The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country's largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.

While Trump's tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.

The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.

Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts. That could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first quarter results, which are due later this month.

After holding relatively stable during last week's global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.

Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound, AP reported.

Bitcoin's prices haven't been this low since just after president Donald Trump's Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin's price broke $100,000 in December.

Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year.

London's FTSE 100 is set to close and is likely to see another significant fall.

We will bring you the final figures once we get them.

President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs on China if Beijing does not withdraw retaliatory measures, increasing trade war concerns.

On his Truth Social network, Trump posted:

Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.

Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.

Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Richard Branson has posted on X describing Donald Trump's tariffs as a “colossal mistake” and has called on the president to reverse his decision.

America could be left “facing ruin for years to come”, he said.

He posted:

The ongoing market response to last week's US tariff announcement was both predictable and preventable.

Even if you agree with the premise of these tariffs, every reasonable effort should be made to give US companies sufficient time to adapt.

The billionaire added:

This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course.

Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come

A quick recap…

It's turning into another very volatile day in the financial markets, as investors grow more fearful that Donald Trump's trade war will trigger a recession.

European stock markets are in the red in late trading, with the FTSE 100 index down 2.5%, or 205 points, at 7849 points.

Germany's DAX is down 3.5% in early trading, while France's CAC has lost 4%.

It's been a roller-coaster rise on Wall Street – stocks initially plunged, but then rocketed higher following a report that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to many of his new tariffs.

However, that rally fizzled out as the White House denied this claim.

So was that 90-day tariff pause tweet (now proven entirely false) the largest fake news-driven market swing in market history?

Goldman Sachs added to the pressure on the White House, by raising the chances of a US recssion to 45%.

JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned that it may be “hard to reverse” the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs, which he said would drive prices higher and make a US recession more likely.

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

The turmoil in financial markets today has overshadowed a co-ordinated push by UK regulators to show they are responding to chancellor Rachel Reeves' demand for them to help spur economic growth.

On Monday, the FCA announced it was planning to loosen rules for more than 600 hedge funds, private equity and venture capital firms in a move that it says will “make it easier for firms to enter the market, grow, compete and innovate.”

The City regulator said it was looking to raise the threshold at which funds are subject to main rules for the sector, meaning they will only apply to those with more than £5bn under management (compared to €100m previously).

That will mean take the number of firms facing more burdensome administrative from around 699 to just 64, its consultation paper suggested.

It comes as regulators come renewed pressure to support UK growth. In the City, this has so far meant easing rules on the financial services sector, with Reeves having also encouraged more risk-taking across the industry.

The CEO of private equity lobby group, the BVCA, welcomed the move, saying:

“More effective, less burdensome regulation will make the UK private capital industry more globally competitive and help it to boost investment from the UK and international investors into growing British businesses.

Elsewhere, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cheered the fact that new consumer protection rules had come into force, which ban fake reviews and drip pricing - where fees are added to the displayed price. The CMA will also be able to decide whether laws have been breached, and decide on compensation and fines, without having to go through the courts.

Ofwat, too, has tried to have a moment in the sun, telling water companies to build new reservoirs and other major projects more quickly in the coming years. In a letter to water company bosses, the watchdog said they must find ways to “deliver (projects) more efficiently, effectively and achieve earlier completion”.

Here's a chart showing how US stocks jumped following that dubious report that Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause to tariffs, but then fell back as the reports were dismissed.

🚨 BREAKING: CNBC is reporting that headlines of President Trump considering a tariff pause are FALSE.S&P 500 -$2 trillion over the last 10 minutes. https://t.co/h50axecrvl pic.twitter.com/F6u3gbQI8W

The White House says any suggestion that President Donald Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs is “fake news,” CNBC reports.

We've just seen a wild few minutes in the financial markets, following a confusing report about a possible delay to Trump's tariffs.

After plunging in early trading, Wall Street surged into positive territory. A few minutes ago the S&P 500 index was UP by 1.76% at 5,163 points, a gain of 89 points. However, that rally has now petered out again.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped too – it was briefly up 1.44%, or 551 points, at 38,866 points, having been DOWN over 1,000 points in early trading.

But that rally has fizzled out too, leaving the Dow down 747 points (for the next few seconds, anyway).

This dizzying roller-coaster follows a suggestion on CNBC that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has, apparently, suggested that Donald Trump is considering a 90 day pause on tariffs for all countries other than China.

That would obviously be a game-changer for the markets, and bolster hopes that negotiations might lead to reductions in the large tariffs announced by Trump last week.

However, we haven't yet managed to stand up exactly what Hassett has said on this point. He WAS asked about the possibility of a 90-day pause on Fox News earlier, but he didn't explicitly say it was under active consideration.

Stocks had briefly bounced back in London too, but the FTSE 100 is currently down 214 points or -2.6% today at 7842 points.

The chief executives of some of the world's biggest banks have reportedly held private talks about the carnage in financial markets and the global economy precipitated by President Donald Trump's new tariffs.

Sky News has learnt that bosses from lenders including Bank of America, Barclays, Citi and HSBC Holdings held a call on Sunday to discuss the ongoing chaos as plunging equity markets reflect fears of a worldwide recession.

Thet add:

Sources said that Sunday's call was convened by the Bank Policy Institute, a Washington-based public policy group.

Brian Moynihan of BoA, Barclays' CS Venkatakrishnan and Georges Elhedery of HSBC were among those who took part in the call, according to one overseas bank executive.

The current stock market turbulence is “a huge worry”, Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool's Management School, tells us.

Prof Milas suggests there's a possibility that central banks might need to take action, if the market turmoil continues, which would set an unfortunate precedent …

From a historical point of view, investors react to periods of high uncertainty (like the current one) by reducing their exposure or fleeing the stock market altogether and investing in government debt (the so-called “flight to quality“ or “flight to safety“).

This means that stock market liquidity will soon dry up and company investments will freeze. If the stock market turbulence continues throughout this week, the Fed, Bank of England and ECB might be forced to act together by cutting interest rates before the Easter break.

If this was what Trump wanted, then he will get the message that he can always get his way towards dictating interest rates through, for instance, tariff threats...

Speaking to reporters Sunday on Air Force One, President Donald Trump defended his new global tariffs with a familiar series of false claims about tariffs and trade.
    


            As he has before, Trump wildly exaggerated the US trade deficit with China — describing it as more than three times higher than it actually is. He repeated his frequent false claim that China paid the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency on imported Chinese products; these payments were made by US importers. And he once again falsely described trade with Europe, wrongly saying the continent doesn't buy “anything” from the US. In reality, the European Union purchased about $649 billion worth of US exports in 2024.
    


            Trump's Sunday remarks also included inaccurate assertions about other subjects, but we'll stick to tariffs and trade in this article. Here is a fact check.
    


            Trump said Sunday that the US has a trade deficit with China of $1 trillion or more.
    


            “We have a tremendous deficit problem with China. They have a surplus of at least a trillion dollars a year. I think it's like a trillion-one,” he said.

            As we've noted in previous fact checks, those numbers are not close to accurate. In fact, official federal statistics show the 2024 trade deficit with China in goods and services trade was about $263 billion. Even if you exclude the services trade, at which the US excels, and count only trade in goods, the 2024 deficit with China was about $295 billion.
    


            The US has never approached a $1 trillion trade deficit with China. The deficit in goods trade alone hit a record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.
    


            Trump repeated his regular assertion that China paid the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports during his first presidency, wrongly declaring, “I took in, during my four year(s), hundreds of billions of dollars from China.”
    


            In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments to the US government, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump's first-term tariffs on China. It's easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.
    


            Trump made a series of false claims about trade with Europe, all repeats from previous comments.
    


            He said Sunday: “They don't take our cars. They don't take our food products. They don't take anything. And we take their cars: Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW. You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm product. They don't take anything. “
    


            None of this is correct.

            “They don't take anything” is far from the truth. While the European Union certainly has some trade barriers that make it harder for US companies to export products there, the official federal statistics show the US exported about $649 billion worth of goods and services to the European Union in 2024.
    


            It's similarly false that “they don't take our farm products.” While the EU does have some trade barriers that impede US agricultural exports, the US Department of Agriculture says the EU bought $12.8 billion worth of US agricultural exports in 2024, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind Mexico, Canada and China.
    


            And while US automakers have often struggled to succeed in Europe, Trump went too far when he said, “They take no cars.” According to a report last month from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, “164,857 US-made cars were exported to the EU in 2024,” valued at about $8.4 billion at current exchange rates. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.)

            • Trump meets with Netanyahu: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to meet with President Donald Trump today at the White House, marking his second visit since January. The leaders are expected to discuss Trump's new tariffs on Israel, the war with Hamas and other key issues. The top White House adviser said it will be Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate the tariffs announced last week.
    


            • Markets tumble: The meeting comes as US stocks have been extremely volatile today as traders search for any sign Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted. US stocks tumbled for the third straight day Monday, and the S&P 500 entered bear market territory. Stocks in Asia and Europe also plunged, though more sharply in Asia.
    


            • Trump's trade war: Trump urged patience this morning and defended the state of the US economy. With the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation, fears of a global recession are mounting. The European Union is “ready to negotiate” with the US and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, the president of the European Commission said.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday he's ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing's retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets.
    


            He said the additional tariffs would take effect midweek if China doesn't remove its 34% retaliatory tariff by Tuesday.
    


            He also said meetings China had requested would be canceled, though he said other countries would begin negotiating on trade immediately.
    


                    “Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            “Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he went on.
    


            “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”
    


Some context: Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10% additional duties on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US. Last week, Trump announced an additional 34% on all Chinese goods, which is set to take effect Wednesday. If his latest threat of an additional 50% went into effect, Chinese goods arriving in the US would effectively be subject to tariffs of 104%.
    


This post has been updated with additional details. 



            A federal appeals court declined on Monday to put on hold a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.



            The decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals comes just hours before the administration faces an 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US.
    


            The ruling came minutes after the administration asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to lift the preliminary injunction issued late last week by US District Judge Paula Xinis.
    


            It's not every day that financial markets go from deep in the red to well into positive territory and then back down to the red again — all in the span of minutes.
    


            But that's exactly what happened on Monday.
    


            With banners flashing on CNBC and posts piling up on social media that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs with the exception of China, investors breathed a huge sigh of relief. But then it turned out that they got a little too excited.
    


            A White House official told CNN any such reports are “fake news.”
    


            Much of the reporting traced back to an interview President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, had on Fox News this morning. Hassett was asked if Trump can call a “90-day timeout” on tariffs.
    


            Hassett responded: “I think the President will decide what the President is going to decide.” Several news networks took that to mean Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. However, there was no official reporting on that.
    


            White House director of communications Steven Cheung also denied reports of a 90-day pause being under consideration. He reposted a NewsMax post on X post of Hassett with his own comments: “Not true. Nobody can point to a transcript …  because it was never said.”
    


            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court today to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.
    


            The emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court on a short fuse: A lower court judge has ordered the Trump administration to return him to the US by 11:59 p.m. Monday.
    


            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.
    


CNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed reporting to this post. 



            The wild swings in financial markets on Monday morning underscore how badly investors want President Donald Trump to pause the trade war.
    


            US stocks surged off their lows and even briefly turned positive on rumors of a 90-day pause. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced.
    


                    “That was a good example of what would happen if we actually got some rational thought mixed in with the ignorant tariff policy,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview Monday. “The stock market vigilantes have spoken loudly that we need rational thought mixed in with this trade policy. And there is none so far.”
                





            Oversold markets desperate for good news are subject to wild swings that can quickly reverse, Hogan added.
    


            The European Union is “ready to negotiate” with the United States and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Monday.
    


            “These tariffs come first and foremost at immense costs for US consumers and businesses but, at the same time, they have a massive impact on the global economy,” the head of the EU's executive arm said at a news conference in Brussels.
    


            Following US President Donald Trump's announcement of hefty tariffs on dozens of countries last week, EU exports to the US face a 20% “reciprocal” tariff, while its steel and auto industry face a 25% tariff. Von der Leyen said the tariffs, which have caused a global market rout, represent a “major turning point” for the US.
    


                    “Nonetheless, we stand ready to negotiate with the United States. Indeed, we have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners, because Europe is always ready for a good deal,” she said.
                





            Asked when the EU tabled the zero-tariff offer, von der Leyen said the offer was made “long before” Trump's latest tariff announcement and “repeatedly, for example, in the automotive sector.” She stressed that the EU has long gone “zero for zero with other countries that also have a strong automotive sector.”
    


            At the same time, the EU is willing to play hardball: Although the EU would prefer to strike a “negotiated settlement,” the bloc is also “preparing a potential list (of US imports) for retaliation,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, the head of the EU's executive arm said the bloc would explore new opportunities, citing deals it has already made with Mexico and Switzerland, as well as new trade agreements it is exploring with India, Indonesia and other countries in the Indo-Pacific.
    


            “We will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States – vast opportunities – and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners,” she said at a news conference in Brussels.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            US stocks were extremely volatile Monday as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.
    


            Markets around the world had tumbled over concerns about how Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth. US stocks opened the day in bear market territory but surged an hour later on rumors that the Trump administration may pause tariffs – perhaps for several months.
    


            That rumor turned out to be just that, it seems. And the Dow, which had risen nearly 900 points, was back down once again.
    


            The Dow was lower 500 points, or 1.3%. The broader S&P 500 edged lower. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% lower.
    


            At the open, the S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory – a decline of 20% from a recent peak – before pulling back. The decline in US stocks came after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.
    


            The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic).
    


            Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday's meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump will be the first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate on the tariffs announced last week.
    


                    “Israel is the first meeting today,” Hassett said, alluding to all the countries trying to negotiate. “President Trump has talked to world leaders all weekend.”
                





            “I'm sure they will talk about trade policy and Middle East policy as well,” Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.
    


            Hassett emphasized that the US is prepared for a “good deal.”
    


            The US imposed a 17% tariff on Israel, according to Trump's announcement last week.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that “countries from all over the World” are talking to the United States after he announced reciprocal tariffs last week and that “tough but fair parameters are being set,” specifically mentioning the Japanese prime minister sending negotiators.
    


                    “Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things.'”
                





            Trump also highlighted China as a particular focus, suggesting that trade relations with China need significant changes.
    


            “It all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!”
    


Asian markets dip: Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.

            Last week Vietnam offered to lower its tariffs on American exports to 0% in exchange for the same treatment, according to a report published by the Vietnamese government on Friday. That came after President Donald Trump spoke with Vietnam's General Secretary Tô Lâm on Friday in a call Trump labeled “productive.”
    


            But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday that Vietnam's offer is not being taken seriously.
    


                    “Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said in a CNBC interview on Monday.
                





More context: Vietnam is among the nations set to see the highest “reciprocal” tariff rates of 46% come April 9, according to the new tariff regime the Trump administration unveiled last week. Vietnam was the United States' sixth-largest source of imports last year, according to US Commerce Department data.
    


            The tariffs Trump is set to impose could raise the price for a slew of goods which the US relies heavily on from Vietnam, including electronics, apparel and footwear
    


            US stocks opened lower Monday as markets around the world tumbled over concerns about how President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth.
    


            Markets opened in bear market territory – a decline of 20% from a recent peak – after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.
    


            The Dow fell 1,200 points, or 3.2%. The broader S&P 500 was 3.4% lower and opened in bear territory. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.96%. The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has surged to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic as investors fret over the market's next move. CNN's Fear and Greed Index has slumped to its lowest levels this year.
    


            President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on trading partners could derail the global move toward green energy, aimed at preventing the worst impacts of climate change.
    


            The tariffs will likely make key green technologies more expensive and could also force governments to divert resources from addressing the climate crisis into propping up their economies.
    


            China is the world's largest producer of many of the materials that are crucial for clean energy technologies. Among others, it exports vast amounts of lithium and lithium batteries as well as the materials used to build wind turbines and solar panels.
    


            The E3G independent climate change think tank said in a research paper that the tariffs will increase the cost of manufacturing of low-carbon technologies and could eventually result in higher prices for consumers — at a time when prices were going down, encouraging faster transition.
    


            Climate policies are already being changed because of the tariffs.
    


More context: The UK government on Monday scrapped some electric vehicle sales targets, specifically quoting the “new era of global insecurity” as one of the reasons. While the government kept the 2030 deadline to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars, it gave companies more flexibility up until then, and it also slashed the fines for those who don't meet the targets.
    


            After the Canadian government scrapped the consumer carbon tax last month, some Canadian provinces followed suit and stopped other carbon levies, quoting the US tariffs among the reasons.
    


            To avoid the worst of the climate crisis, the world needs to quickly transition to clean energy. With governments and businesses facing economic pressures, resources could be diverted away from green projects. That will likely backfire as failing to invest in emission cutting now will make more costly to deal with the consequences in the future.
    


            President Donald Trump urged patience and warned against becoming “panican” in a post Monday ahead of markets opening in the United States.
    


                    “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!),” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he went on.
                





            Trump was writing as markets traded sharply lower in Asia and Europe, and a US futures tumbled. Earlier this morning, Trump defended the US economy and claims tariffs will boost revenue
    


            White House national economic council director Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump's tariffs on Monday, responding to billionaire Trump supporter Bill Ackman who criticized and said the “economic nuclear war” is triggered by tariffs.
    


            “I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease the ease off the rhetoric a little bit,” Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.
    


                    “I think a lot of us at the White House think that these are these economic responses are exaggerated by critics, even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP as the idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,” Hasset said responding to Ackman.
                





            Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president, said Sunday that America was heading toward a self-inflicted “economic nuclear winter” because of Trump's tariff policy rollout.
    


            Hassett also responded to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has issued a bunt warning about Trump's tariff policy. Dimon said America's “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's “America First” foreign policy could undermine that standing.
    


            “Trump came into office with the biggest debt to GDP that we've seen in the US ever since World War 2,” Hassett said. “And what we're doing right now is we're fixing that,” he added in response to Dimon.
    


            Trump's announcement last week, targeting nearly all the US trading partners last week, including a 10% tariff on all imports and higher tariffs on certain countries, triggered a sharp and ongoing decline in global markets, with several nations imposing retaliatory tariffs on goods.
    


            The global market rout sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs deepened in Asia and Europe on Monday, with the US bracing for a further slump when its markets open shortly.
    


            Although the president has doubled down on his trade policy, members of his administration failed to offer a coherent message about his strategy over the weekend. Some of Trump's billionaire backers are now calling for a return to freer trade.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            • Asian markets plummet: With trading now over for the day, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% down – its worst day since 1997. The city's financial markets had been closed Friday for an annual festival.
    


            • Europe also slumps: Stocks indexes in Europe are down around 5% halfway through the day's trading. Meanwhile, European Union trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a response to Trump's tariffs.
    


            • US markets set to open: If the US stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration that a bull market has turned into a bear market in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.
    


            • Dimon sounds alarm: JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump's tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America's standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.
    


            • Trump doubles down: After his trade policy wiped trillions of dollars off global markets last week, Trump told reporters late Sunday that he doesn't want “anything to go down,” but that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” On Monday morning, Trump defended his policy in a Truth Social post, saying tariffs would bring in billions of dollars in revenue.
    


            • Musk breaks rank: Elon Musk has said he would be in favor of a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU, after the man he helped elect as president imposed a 20% tariff on the bloc. Bill Ackman, another of Trump's billionaire backers, has also criticized the president's trade policy.
    


            • MAGA's mixed signals: Top Trump administration officials offered mixed messaging over whether countries can negotiate their way out of tariffs, or if the levies are here to stay. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama, said the administration “doesn't have a coherent message on why it's implementing the largest tax increase” seen in the US in 50 years.

            President Donald Trump's trade plan could cause a repeat of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs from 1930 that worsened the Great Depression, former Federal Reserve official James Bullard warned on Monday.
    


                    “This has dramatically raised the risk of a Smoot-Hawley type outcome,” Bullard, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told CNBC. “Global trade collapsed and the Great Depression was on. That's what really has people worried about this.”
                





            Economists widely blame the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act with making the Great Depression worse than it had to be. The act surged tariffs on US imports to protect workers. A half-century later, the infamous legislation was featured in an iconic scene in “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.”
    


            Bullard, who now serves as dean of Purdue University's Mitch Daniels School of Business, told CNBC that Trump's tariffs are setting up a situation where “you could get a dramatic downturn in the economy.”
    


            Bullard added, however, that this does not have to be a repeat and noted that it's not clear the tariffs will even stay in place.
    


                    “What's the chance this will stick through the courts? Because I think this is probably executive overreach,” Bullard said, arguing that the executive branch likely needs the support of Congress to make these kinds of sweeping decisions on trade. “Who wants to invest when you don't know what the rules are going to be?”
                





            President Donald Trump took to social media Monday to argue that the US is in a strong economic position, despite the fact that the US and global markets have tanked.
    


                    “Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow-moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            The president claimed that the country will earn billions of dollars from the tariffs he placed on other countries, even as the stock market faces its worst start to a presidential term in modern history.
    


                    “This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate. They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA! Our past “leaders” are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump's post continued.
                





            Trump on Sunday aboard Air Force One said he does not want “anything to go down,” but stressed “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” with the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation.
    


            The sweeping tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump last week are set to add to the pain inflicted on US farmers by the tariffs imposed during his first term, a union boss has warned.
    


                    “It's not fun, we still haven't recovered from the last tariffs that the president put on,” Bob Kuylen, Vice President of the North Dakota Farmers Union, told CNN Monday.
                





            He added that farmers “haven't gotten (those) markets back yet and now he's picking on Canada and Mexico and China.” Farmers are being “held down to almost surf levels, just barely getting by,” he said.
    


            “We raise thousands and thousands of acres of corn and soybeans and wheat and other products and we export just about half of what we raise in the United States,” he said.
    


            Farmers often receive government funding to protect them when prices fall due to weather or market fluctuations – but in 2018 they needed bailing out to protect them from the Trump administration's trade policies. During Trump's first term, the government spent billions of dollars bailing out farmers feeling the pinch from the president's trade war.
    


            Over the weekend, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was unable to clearly state whether Trump's new tariffs are here to stay, or whether there was room for deals.
    


            Rollins indicated there could be support for farmers affected by the most recent tariffs, pointing to the previous relief during Trump's first term.
    


            JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about President Donald Trump's tariff policy: It threatens to raise prices, drive the global economy into a downturn and weaken America's standing in the world.
    


                    “The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” Dimon warned in his annual letter to shareholders. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”
                





            Dimon said America's “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's “America First” foreign policy could undermine that standing.
    


                    “If the Western world's military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken over time,” he said.
                





            Despite a recent plunge in markets, stocks could tumble much farther still, Dimon argued. The US stock market is set to open in bear market territory after hitting a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19 – the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).
    


                    “Even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high,” Dimon said. “These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious.”
                





            US President Donald Trump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the precipice of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history.
    


            If the stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration a bull market has turned into a bear in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.
    


            These same tariffs may also take a booming economy and turn it into a recession.
    


Read more about the state of the stock market today here.



            We know there's a lot of chatter about the impact of the tariffs, and one word being thrown around is recession.



            So, what is a recession? And why are economists concerned the world may be impacted by it?
    


            The traditional (and official) definition of a US recession is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”
    


            That's according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organization has a very important role, when it comes to these downturns: Its Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of peaks, troughs, expansions, contractions — and yes, recessions — in the business cycle.
    


            The committee, in making its recession determination, uses three criteria: depth, diffusion and duration.
    


            This is where it gets a little squishy.
    


            While each of those need to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions in one of those areas can offset weaker conditions in the others.
    


            Also, it's often the case that the US already is in a recession by the time the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially deems it so.
    


            Prognosticators have turned to other gauges as potential recessionary indicators; however, they don't always prove true.
    


            The biggest rule of thumb or nonofficial recession indicator is the technical notion of back-to-back quarterly contractions in real gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity.
    


            As the European Union seeks to respond to the punishing 20% tariff the White House has placed on its exports, the bloc could negotiate with the United States on issues of energy security and military trade, a Latvian official said Monday.
    


            Artjom Uršulskis, parliamentary secretary of Latvia's foreign ministry, hinted at where the EU is looking to negotiate with the US, in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting of EU trade ministers.
    


                    “It could be energy security, it could be military trade, it could be new technologies – but we should really focus on that to find a common ground, because the trade wars are never favorable for everyone,” Uršulskis said.
                





            One area the EU could target is US services, rather than just goods – which would punish US tech giants. But Uršulskis said this would be the wrong focus.
    


                    “I don't think that we should target services,” he said. “Once again, it's much more needed to find some positive agenda and to show our partners that we can find common ground and not start new wars and new battlefields.”
                





            Goldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street bank to warn that US President Donald Trump's trade war could crash the US economy into a damaging recession.
    


            As financial markets plunged, Goldman Sachs economists delivered a report to clients titled “Countdown to Recession” that slashed their 2025 GDP forecast to 0.5% and raised their 12-month recession probability from 35% to 45%.
    


            The investment bank cited the “sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed.”
    


            The new recession warning from Goldman Sachs is lower than the 60% recession forecast from JPMorgan Chase last week. But that's because Goldman's forecast hinges on an assumption that Trump won't allow all his threatened tariffs to kick in.
    


                    “If most of the April 9 tariffs do take effect, then the effective tariff rate will rise by an estimated 20 percentage points once those increases and likely sectoral tariffs take effect, even allowing for some country-specific agreements at a later date,” Goldman Sachs economists wrote. “If so, we expect to change our forecast to a recession.”
                





            In other words, if Trump doesn't blink, Goldman Sachs believes a recession is likely on the cards.
    


            The bank now expects the Fed to cut rates starting in June (versus July previously) followed by twice more later in the year. If a recession becomes more likely, Goldman said the Fed would likely slash interest rates by two full percentage points over the next year.
    


            After Elon Musk said he was in favor of “zero tariffs” between the United States and European Union – in opposition to policies of the US president he helped elect – Germany's economy minister said Musk was showing signs of “weakness” and “fear.”
    


            “Yes, I read what Elon Musk said,” Robert Habeck said Monday, referring to Musk's comments this weekend that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU.
    


            “I think it's a sign of weakness and maybe of fear, because the acting politics are completely different,” Habeck said as he arrived at a meeting of EU trade ministers.
    


                    “If he has something to say, he should go to his president and say, ‘Before we're talking about zero tariffs, let's stop the nonsense, the mess you have just made in the last week,'” Habeck said.
                





            “This is ridiculous, and the only interpretation I have is that he now sees that his own companies, but even the economies are going to crumble because of the mess they have made, so he's afraid,” he added, referring to Tesla's tanking stock price.
    


            Habeck called for a return to the policies of globalization that had “served all economies” around the world, and especially the US.
    


            Markets are notoriously unpredictable – it's not easy to pinpoint the mood on the Street.
    


            That's why a little over a decade ago, journalists at what was then called CNNMoney created the Fear & Greed Index — a kind of Wall Street vibe check that's been garnering extra attention in recent days as global markets have tumbled in response to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.
    


            The index is an easy-to-read barometer of investors' risk appetite on a 100-point scale, from extreme fear (0) to extreme greed (100).
    


            It was designed to give a sense of how much markets are being driven by fear (selling stocks, buying safer assets like Treasury bonds) or greed (buying stocks, loading up on risk).
    


            On Friday afternoon, in the middle of a massive global selloff, the index was at a 4, firmly in “extreme fear.”
    


            The story of the index begins in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis.
    


            “So, March 2009, the market bottoms, and there's some sense of recovery, but we were all trying to figure out how to measure where we were, beyond just the daily ups and downs” Lex Haris, former executive editor of CNNMoney, said in an interview. “And I was just very drawn to this concept of these two emotions driving the market.”
    


            When the index launched in the spring of 2012, CNNMoney's executive editor at the time, Chris Peacock, said it “captures in an eye-blink the underlying forces driving investors' money moves.”
    


            US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a colossal set of tariffs on America's trading partners is tantamount to “economic nuclear war,” according to billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president.
    


            In a post on X Sunday, Ackman said “business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets” if many of the new levies come into force on April 9. “We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,” he added in the post viewed 8.9 million times.
    


            Trump's baseline 10% tariff went into effect Saturday, while many countries are bracing for higher levies still, due to kick in Wednesday.
    


            The CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management called for a 90-day “time out” in which Trump could negotiate with trading partners and “resolve unfair asymmetric tariffs deals” and warned that “the president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe.”
    


            “This is not what we voted for,” he wrote.
    


            Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% lower on Monday, making it the worst single one-day drop since 1997, according to the index's website listing its biggest daily losses.
    


            The city's financial markets were closed on Friday for the annual Tomb Sweeping Festival.
    


            The Hang Seng index includes stocks from some of Hong Kong's and mainland China's largest listed companies, such as Alibaba, HSBC, Tencent, Meituan and Xiaomi.
    


            Chinese tech champions Alibaba and Tencent closed nearly 18% and more than 12.5% lower, respectively. Banking corporation HSBC plunged 14.8%, Chinese delivery giant Meituan plummeted 15% and consumer electronics firm Xiaomi finished down 20.6%.
    


Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, has called for swift action in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs that has caused global markets to plummet.
    


                    “The situation on the international equity and bond markets is dramatic and threatens to deteriorate further. It is therefore more urgent than ever for Germany to restore its international competitiveness as quickly as possible,” Merz told Reuters Monday.
                





                    “The issue must now be at the center of the coalition negotiations,” Merz said, referring to ongoing talks in Germany over the formation of its next government following February's election, which was won by his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
                





            As a member of the European Union, Germany has been hit by a 20% “reciprocal” tariff on all exports to the US, while its steel and auto industry faces a separate 25% tariff.
    


            Since February's election, Germany's parliament voted to cancel its historic “debt brake” – a constitutional mechanism designed to limit government borrowing. The move will enable the usually fiscally conservative country to spend hundreds of billions of euros on its infrastructure and defense.
    


            Although analysts had hailed the attempt to revive Europe's largest economy, Trump's tariffs are set to inflict further economic pain on Germany, halting its hoped-for recovery.
    


Oil prices plunged Monday, with investors worried about the economic fallout from Donald Trump's decision to impose massive tariffs on America's trading partners.
    


            Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, plunged 3.5% to trade at $63.30 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, also fell 3.5% to $59.84 by 4.16 a.m. ET. Both are trading at their lowest levels since early 2021 when the world was still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.
    


            The falls in prices come after OPEC+, the coalition of the world's top oil producers, surprised investors last week by deciding on a much bigger boost in oil supply than planned earlier: Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of the group agreed on larger production increases starting in May than previously announced.
    


            As Trump's tariffs rock global markets, countries are scrambling to negotiate concessions – but China is taking a different approach.
    


            Their message is clear: China is well prepared to weather a trade war, and come out stronger on the other side.
    


            “US tariffs will have an impact (on China), but ‘the sky won't fall,'” a commentary in the ruling Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily said Sunday.
    


            “Since the US initiated the (first) trade war in 2017 – no matter how the US fights or presses – we have continued to develop and progress, demonstrating resilience – ‘the more pressure we get, the stronger we become,'” read the commentary, which was also on the front page of the paper's Monday edition.
    


            Just 48 hours after Trump's shocking announcement, the world's second-largest economy swiftly retaliated with its own punitive measures on US goods and firms, signaling that it's prepared for the long haul.
    


            Read the full analysis here.
    


            US stock futures plunged before market open Monday after US President Donald Trump intensified his global trade war last week, prompting retaliation from China.
    


            Dow futures were 5.5% lower and S&P 500 futures 6% down at 4.01 a.m. ET. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, was set to open 5.8% lower.
    


            The massive declines in futures follow the worst two-day stretch for stocks in five years – since the pandemic.
    


            And market analysts said investors aren't done selling yet.
    


            “Last week's brutal selling pressure is set to continue on Monday, as the market is telling us that investors still lack clarity on the implications of tariffs, tariff retaliation and are worried that economic growth is likely to slow to a complete stall or recession,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research.
    


            When US President Donald Trump unveiled his “reciprocal” tariffs chart, trade economists were flummoxed.
    


            Near the top of the list was Vietnam, which had imposed a 90% average tariff on US goods, according to the chart – far higher than the actual rate.
    


            But the crude methodology used by the White House to calculate the “reciprocal” global tariffs quickly became clear, as was first pointed out by financial journalist James Surowiecki.
    


            The Trump administration used a simple formula: It took each country's trade deficit with the United States, divided it by the value of that country's exports to the US, then divided this figure by half, in a gesture of “kindness.”
    


            Let's take this step by step, using official US data.
    


                    In 2024, Vietnam sold $136.6 billion worth of goods to the US.
                





                    Because Americans want to buy things like Nike shoes a lot more than Vietnamese want to buy things like Ford cars, the US sold just $13.1 billion of goods to Vietnam that year.
                





                    This gave Vietnam a trade surplus of $123.5 billion with the US. But one man's trade surplus is another man's trade deficit – which Trump finds unpalatable, akin to being “ripped off.”
                





                    Dividing $123.5 billion (Vietnam's trade surplus) by $136.6 (Vietnam's exports) gives 0.90, or 90% when translated into tariffs. In a supposed act of “kindness,” Trump nearly halved this, meaning Vietnam will now face a tariff of 46%.
                





            And so Trump's tariffs were designed to punish countries for having trade surpluses with the US – not for imposing actual tariffs
    


            US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of selloffs that wiped away more than $5.4 trillion in market value. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under President Barack Obama, joined CNN's Jessica Dean to discuss the chaos.
    


            As White House officials offered mixed messages Sunday on whether tariffs are here to stay or a negotiating ploy, Summers wrote on X that he has “never seen as much incoherence and irrationality” from Trump administration officials.
    


                    “This Administration doesn't have a coherent message on why it's doing the largest tax increase the country's had in 50 years. Usually when you do something consequential, you have a clear rationale that's consistently delivered, and we're not getting that,” Summers said.
                





            Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs, downplaying severe market volatility.
    


            US President Donald Trump has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture.
    


            More than 50 countries – including Vietnam, India and Israel – have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs, officials said Sunday.
    


            That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”
    


            But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


                    “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,” he told Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
                





            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also could not say whether tariffs are here to stay.
    


                    “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
                





Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a key aide to US President Donald Trump, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States.
    


            Musk's comments – in a video interview Saturday with Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini – are the strongest sign of splits within the Trump administration over the president's tariff announcement that sparked a global market rout.
    


                    “At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said, in contrast to the trade policy of the US president he helped elect.
                





            Musk has seen Tesla sales plunge in recent months amid his controversial cost-cutting role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Sales fell 49% in Europe alone in the first two months of the quarter, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
    


            Musk's comments come as questions swirl about his future in the White House. Last week, Politico reported – citing MAGA insiders – that Musk had overstayed his welcome in Washington and could be ousted within weeks. The White House called the Politico report “garbage” and Musk dismissed it as “fake news.”
    


            Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by US President Donald Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs.
    


            Germany's Dax opened down 9%, while London's FTSE was about 5% lower. European markets were, on the whole, faring better than Asian markets in early trade. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.
    


            In mainland China, where markets reopened after a public holiday, the Shanghai Composite Index closed more than 7% lower. The blue-chip CSI300 index also lost about 7%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index last traded just under 12% lower. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent were each down more than 14% and 10% respectively.
    


            Trading volumes in Hong Kong surged on Monday, which she said was “a clear sign of widespread forced liquidations and what can only be described as a full-blown panic.”
    


            Asian markets are tracking the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of sell-offs that wiped away over $5.4 trillion in market value.
    


            US stocks fell sharply on Friday after China retaliated fiercely, imposing a 34% tariff on all US goods, raising fears of an escalating and damaging trade war fueled by continuing trade tension between the world's two largest economies.

            Despite his tariffs wiping away trillions from the market value of global stocks, US President Donald Trump appeared untroubled late Sunday evening.
    


            “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
    


            In his “Liberation Day” announcement last week, Trump claimed that the US has been “ripped off for more than 50 years,” saying this is “not going to happen anymore.”
    


            Although Trump's tariffs were billed as “reciprocal,” the levies were calculated to punish countries like Vietnam and Cambodia with whom the US has large trade deficits.

It's hard to say if the president truly knows what he's doing. But there is a precedent for the US causing short-term chaos and reaping long-term gain

It's less than a week since Donald Trump's sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world's trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies such as Japan and South Korea have been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit with tariffs in excess of 45%. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.

Global stock markets have tumbled as panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has already retaliated with 34% tariffs, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.

Trump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.

His Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “global economic reordering” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US's elite. Trump's new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote a lengthy paper, A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US's power as the world's largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.

After decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily from China, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world's reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.

There are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve, drove up interest rates to a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.

But by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker's “independence” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.

More decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of the US economy Volcker's interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China's extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.

Few would have bet on Volcker's world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement. The S&P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more on servicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.

Over the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that there would be no climbdown on the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US's continuing economic power. The administration has claimed 50 other countries have also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.

Perhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places.

Nearly 40 students report canceled visas over minor infractions as Trump intensifies crackdown on universities

Lisa was eating takeout at a friend's place when the email from her university landed. She clicked into her inbox and skimmed the message:

“ISS [International Student Services] is writing to inform you that your SEVIS record was terminated …”

The wording felt unfamiliar. She read it again, but it still sounded like a scam – absurd and unreal.

Lisa is an international student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, just one month away from graduation. She asked to use a pseudonym due to concerns about retaliation and an ongoing legal case.

Before going to bed, she found someone posted a similar notice on social media. It was through these posts that Lisa understood what the email had actually meant: with her Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record terminated, she was now considered out of status in the US. Staying could mean violating immigration laws.

The Department of Homeland Security maintains the Sevis database that tracks international students and scholars on F, M and J visas. Once a Sevis record is terminated, a student's legal status becomes immediately invalid. They must either leave the US within the grace period, typically 15 days, or take steps to restore their status. Otherwise, they risk deportation and future visa restrictions.

She dug through comment sections. Joined group chats. Searched for patterns. One emerged: most of the affected students had been fingerprinted. Some had been cited for non-criminal offenses, but the messages they received said they had criminal records.

That's when she remembered: a year ago, she was driving home when she got two speeding tickets: one for speeding and another for failing to stop. She hadn't seen the police car behind her until it was too late. To get the charges dismissed, she showed up in court, where she was fingerprinted.

Lisa is one of several students across states who found their legal status revoked by the US government on 4 April, without prior notice or clear explanation. University statements show that at least 39 students have been affected, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, Stanford, Ohio State, the University of Tennessee, the University of Kentucky, Minnesota State University and the University of Oregon.

An online self-reported data sheet created by affected students suggests the issue may be more widespread. Students from 50 universities reported their visas were canceled around 4 April, with many noting that they had prior records, some limited to citations or non-criminal offenses.

This secret wave of revocation came a few days after the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced the revocation of 300 or more student visas. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” he said at a news conference on 27 March, referring to students he described as national security threats.

Lisa's university had included a screenshot of her Sevis record in the message. Termination was logged on 4 April by a system administrator, with a note: “Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”

Shenqi Cai, a California immigration attorney and managing attorney at Lashine Law, said she got the first call from a student on 3 April. “At the time, we thought it was a one-off. It seemed strange.”

But by Friday, more cases kept coming in. She contacted designated school officials at several partner universities and confirmed that the terminations were visible in the Sevis system.

Cai said this round of Sevis terminations appeared to be unprecedented. “Students weren't given any chance to explain their situation. As long as the system flagged them, what we believe is a kind of criminal screening trigger, they were terminated under one broad directive.”

Based on the information collected so far, Cai said about 90% of the affected students had been fingerprinted. But she explained that the criteria used to flag students can vary by state. “Each state defines these triggers differently. The thresholds are inconsistent. A student may be arrested in one state, but that doesn't mean they'll be convicted, because the power to decide guilt or innocence lies with the judge.”

David, a Chinese student who completed his undergraduate degree, was immediately unable to continue working. He requested a pseudonym due to fears of retaliation and an ongoing legal case.

In 2024, David was reported to police after a verbal argument with his partner. When officers arrived, they were still arguing, but there was no physical contact, he said. Because of a language barrier, his partner couldn't clearly explain what had happened. David was detained overnight and later ordered to appear in court.

“My partner wrote a statement to the prosecutor explaining it wasn't domestic violence,” he said. The charge was eventually dropped. Court records show the case was dismissed with prejudice, and the judge ordered the arrest record and biometric data to be destroyed.

Three years later, David received a Sevis termination notice.

Unlike enrolled F-1 students, David is working under Optional Practical Training, a work authorization linked to the Sevis system. Once a Sevis record is terminated, that authorization ends and is nearly impossible to recover.

David was nearing the end of his first year of employment when he got the notice on Friday. He scheduled a lunch meeting with his manager, who said the company would try to help him relocate to Canada. But because the termination took effect immediately, he was subjected to the 15-day departure rule.

“I told my family, and they felt just as powerless,” he said. “But we don't come from wealth, and there's not a lot they can do.”

Bill is facing the same dilemma. He graduated in December 2024 and is currently job-hunting. He asked not to use his real name due to a pending case.

In early 2025, Bill hit another car while making a turn. At the time, his driver's license had just expired. Police cited him for driving with an expired license. After renewing it, he followed the instructions and appeared in court.

after newsletter promotion

“I went with a temporary license. The court staff were friendly,” he said. “One even joked, ‘This is no big deal, handsome,' while taking my fingerprints and photos. It felt like a scene out of a movie.”

His initial appearance only involved ID verification. When he asked if the hearing could be held that day, a staff member told him it was scheduled for May and suggested he come back then.

“I thought it was fine. My license was updated, I just had to show up again.” But on 3 April, he suddenly received a notice from the school that his Sevis record had been terminated.

Now, Bill has no idea what to do. Legally, he should leave the country immediately, but his case is still open and he's required to appear in court in May. He doesn't know whether showing up would put him at risk of detention.

On 4 April, he met with his university's international office. Staff there were willing to help, he said, but had few tools. They asked him to write a personal statement, which they promised to pass along to university leadership. The only formal support offered was a referral to a discounted lawyer – $150 an hour.

“The dust of history falls on me, and it becomes a mountain. That's all there is to it,” he said.

By Sunday evening, the panic had spread. Three hundred students joined a Zoom info session hosted by Brad Banias, a federal court immigration litigator and former justice department trial attorney. Questions poured into the chat box: “Should we leave our apartments right now in case ICE shows up?” “Will an unpaid parking ticket be a problem?”

Banias called the terminations a political move, not a legal one. “It makes me angry to see 19-year-olds just trying to study, and suddenly a parking ticket they didn't even know about shows up on a criminal background check,” he said. “Don't let them convince you it's reasonable to leave the country over a parking ticket.”

For Lisa, the future was just starting to take shape. She is about to graduate in one month, with a job offer and grad school acceptance. But now, she said she wasn't even sure if she should go to class on Monday.

Back in April 2024, she was pulled over in Madison for speeding. She hadn't noticed the patrol car behind her right away, and by the time she stopped, two officers approached. One told her not to worry – it was her first offense, and all she needed to do was pay the fine. But the other issued two citations: one for speeding, the other for failing to stop.

They told her it was just a miscommunication, something she could clear up in court.

But that never really happened.

“My first court date was just for ID,” she said. “They fingerprinted me, took a photo, measured my height. The judge barely said anything. No hearing, just a new court date.”

She asked if the case could be resolved sooner and was told to schedule an online meeting. She did. During that meeting, the case was dropped. No record. They asked if she accepted. She said yes.

Everything after that went smoothly: her work visa was approved, the company background checks cleared, and she had no trouble leaving and re-entering the country. She thought it was behind her.

Then the email came.

“I don't know if I'm still allowed to graduate,” she said. “If I don't get my degree, does the grad school still take me? Does the company push back the offer? Worst case, I don't graduate. I go home and start college again. Four more years. And then what?”

Billionaire fund manager tries to persuade US president over tariffs, which have wiped $6tn off US stocks

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

“The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out,” Ackman said on Sunday in a post on X, to resolve trade issues via negotiation.

“If, on the other hand ... we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.”

Though Trump made imposing tariffs a part of his victorious 2024 electoral campaign, which Ackman endorsed, the billionaire fund manager's X post said: “This is not what we voted for.”

Ackman's post came after Trump's tariffs wiped $6tn off US stocks. Asia and Europe's markets slumped, too.

The Trump tariffs are 10% across the board, with higher rates aimed at about 60 countries.

Late Sunday on Air Force One, Trump told reporters he had spent the weekend speaking to leaders from Europe and Asia who tried to convince him to lower his tariffs – some that are as high as 50% and are due to take effect this week.

But Trump said that those counties would need to pay “a lot of money on a yearly basis” for him to reconsider.

In his post, Ackman also said: “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.”

Staying the course would mean “heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down”, Ackman's post also said. “May cooler heads prevail.”

There were no immediate indications that pleas such as Ackman's would persuade Trump. During his Air Force One talk with reporters on Sunday, he said: “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court on Monday to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.
    


            The emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court hours before the 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline established by a lower court judge to return him to the US.
    


            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.

            The Justice Department told the Supreme Court ordering officials to return the man is “unprecedented” as it sounded now familiar themes arguing that federal courts are overstepping their power.
    


            “Even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable,” recently confirmed Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in the filing Monday. “The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.”
    


            “While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was an administrative error … that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight,” Sauer added.
    


            Abrego Garcia was in the country illegally, but an immigration judge in 2019 – after reviewing evidence – withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.”
    


            For the next six years, court records show, Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland, checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime.
    


            But Abrego Garcia wound up on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15. Several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump's invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act – an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia, the administration has said, was deported under different authorities.
    


            On Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis explained in an opinion why she had ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday.
    


            White House officials have publicly mocked the judge's order and assert they have no ability to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.
    


            “Marxist judge now thinks she's president of El Salvador,” Trump adviser Stephen Miller posted to social media on Friday.
    


            But under oath, the Justice Department has been far less clear about the removal. Pressed by Xinis last week about why the US couldn't return Abrego Garcia, DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni said he didn't have an answer.
    


            “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” Reuveni responded.
    


            The Department of Justice has since placed Reuven and his supervisor on leave.
    


            The request to the Supreme Court came minutes before a ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denying DOJ's request to lift the lower-court order.
    


            The panel rejecting the appeal was: Judge Stephanie Thacker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, and Judge Robert King, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.
    


            Thacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the “United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process.”
    


            “The Government's contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” she wrote, adding later that the “irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to Abrego Garcia every minute he is in El Salvador.”
    


            “And the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the Government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the United States,” she added.
    


            In a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning, Wilkinson said he thinks it is “legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate' the plaintiff's return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law.”
    


            “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” he continued. “Thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.”
    


            But Wilkinson said he read Xinis' order “as one requiring that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia's release, rather than demand it.” He said that reading it as a requirement for the administration “would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far.”

Economist Warwick McKibbin says ‘economic and policy flexibility' puts Australia in better position to escape fallout from Trump tariffs

A global trade war will not drive Australia's economy into recession, new Treasury modelling suggests, even as Jim Chalmers says he is realistic about “substantial” risks to growth from Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.

The treasurer sought to soothe Australians rattled by Monday's dramatic share market plunge – the worst in five years – saying the country was “better placed and better prepared” than others to weather the coming storm.

As fears grow that America will suffer a deep downturn that could reverberate around the world, Chalmers unveiled updated departmental modelling that showed the trade shock would trim just 0.1% off Australia's economic growth in 2025 and add 0.2 percentage points to inflation.

“We expect more manageable impacts on the Australian economy, but we still do expect Australian GDP to take a hit and we expect there to be an impact on prices here as well,” he said on Monday.

“I can assure people that in a world of volatility and uncertainty, Australia is better placed and better prepared than our peers.”

In contrast, the US economy would be 0.8% smaller by the start of 2027, with most of the damage in this year, the modelling showed; and Americans would suffer a 1.4 percentage-point spike in inflation this year. China would also be hit hard, with the economy 0.6% smaller than otherwise.

“This is one of the many reasons that we describe the tariff decision to be ill-considered and unwarranted,” Chalmers said.

The official modelling reflected sanguine forecasts in Treasury's pre-election budget update, which revealed no change in Australia's economic outlook since the 25 March budget.

While Australia's economy was expected to continue to grow, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) document highlighted that “the increase in tariffs announced over the past few days have been more significant than expected”.

“The potential magnitude and persistence of the economic effects of these announcements has resulted in greater-than-usual uncertainty around the outlook,” PEFO said.

Investors, however, were less assured.

The Australian dollar briefly dipped below 60 US cents on Monday, after dropping 3 US cents late last week – including its biggest single-day drop in more than 15 years.

Reflecting the potential for local fall-out from Trump's one-man war on the global trading system, financial markets were now, according to ANZ, pricing in four rate cuts over the coming four Reserve Bank board meetings.

That included the chance of a double rate cut of half a percentage point on 20 May.

As JP Morgan lifted its estimated chance of a US recession to 60%, the director of the ANU's Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis, Warwick McKibbin, agreed that Australia could navigate a worst-case trade war scenario relatively unscathed.

“While the ‘liberation day' tariffs are damaging to the world economy, Australia is impacted relatively less than other countries, except for sectors exposed to China such as mining,” McKibbin said.

“Just as Australia escaped a recession during the Asian financial crisis, Australia's economic and policy flexibility, such as the capacity of RBA to respond, puts Australia in a better position than many countries,” he said.

As China and the EU threatened to follow Canada and retaliate against Trump's so-called “reciprocal tariff”, due to kick in on 9 April, McKibbin modelled the impact of a trade war on a range of countries.

The yet-to-be-released analysis shows Australian growth would be about 0.2 percentage points lower this year under this worst-case trade scenario, before rebounding in 2026.

As in the Treasury modelling, the impact on inflation would be negligible.

McKibbin, who travelled to Washington DC to do the economic modelling for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said “the flexibility of the exchange rate and capacity to expand exports into the rest of the world minimises the losses”.

“The Australian government not responding with additional tariffs is the right response. It is better to focus on open and expanded trade with the other 80% of the world economy.”

The modelling – which reflected more of a worst-case scenario than the Treasury analysis – showed the hit to the US from a global trade shock would be severe.

Assuming the rest of the world retaliates against Trump's reciprocal tariffs, McKibbin's modelling finds American consumers will suffer a nearly 3 percentage point spike in inflation this year.

There will be a 0.6 percentage-point hit to US economic growth in 2025, extending to 1.6 percentage points next year. By that time the American economy will be 2% smaller, the analysis shows, despite a series of deep rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.

While McKibbin's modelling shows Australia escaping unscathed, preliminary modelling by KPMG showed a much larger hit to our economy from a global trade war – highlighting the inherent uncertainty in modelling.

            The start of a rugby game in France was delayed on Sunday after a parachutist became entangled in the stadium roof prior to kickoff.
    


            The parachutist was part of a pre-match ceremony that was tasked with carrying the match ball to the field ahead of the European Rugby Champions Cup game between Toulouse and English club Sale.
    


            However, after his fellow parachutists had landed safely on the pitch, one unfortunate dardevil ended up delaying the game by 40 minutes.
    


            The man, reportedly a French army parachutist, had been following his colleagues and was seen descending quickly into the stadium before getting snagged on the roof.
    


            As he dangled over the stands, stadium officials – as well as the Toulouse team mascot dressed as a lion – raced to create a makeshift crash mat by using inflatables found nearby.
    


            Eventually, footage showed fire services reaching the parachutist and bringing him down to safety on a crane, sparking huge cheers inside the Stadium de Toulouse.
    


            It appeared as though the man was unhurt from the experience, as he lapped up the reception.
    


            CNN has reached out to European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) – the governing body which organizes the European Rugby Champions Cup – and Toulouse for comment.
    


            “Following the incident at the Stadium de Toulouse, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to all involved at the stadium, both clubs and the emergency services for safely returning the parachutist to the ground,” EPCR chairman Dominic McKay said in a statement on social media Sunday.
    


            The players, who had initially returned to the dressing room, came back onto the pitch before Toulouse won 38-15. The French side will now play RC Toulon in the quarterfinals.
    


            Toulouse posted an Instagram video about the pre-match drama, joking: “We know seats are going fast but you're forcing it here.” It also thanked the emergency services for saving the day.

            The Supreme Court declined Monday to decide whether a New York law that requires residents to have “good moral character” to carry a handgun is constitutional, leaving in place most of the state's ban on carrying weapons in “sensitive places,” such as schools, parks and theaters.
    


            The decision is a victory for New York officials and gun control groups, who have been attempting to approve or defend gun prohibitions in the wake of a blockbuster 2022 Supreme Court precedent that widely expanded the ability of Americans to carry guns in public. The New York law in question in the case was a response to that decision.
    


            The court didn't explain its reasoning and there were no noted dissents.
    


            The state's law requires residents to show “good moral character” to obtain a firearm license. The new law defined that term to mean “having the essential character, temperament and judgement necessary to be entrusted with a weapon and to use it only in a manner that does not endanger oneself or others.”
    


            The law also set aside several “sensitive” locations where carrying weapons is banned. New York included government buildings, schools, hospitals, stadiums and Times Square in the list of covered spaces. Whether that approach can survive court scrutiny is being closely watched by other states.
    


            Gun rights groups challenging the law say the number of scope of sensitive places cover “virtually the entire landmass of New York” and makes carrying a weapon “so risky that even the hyper-law-abiding licensee would not dare.” The lawsuit was filed by five New Yorkers with licenses to carry firearms and one individual who has argued the law has deterred him from obtaining a license.
    


            The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court in January.
    


            The appeal has been up at the Supreme Court before – and has been heavily influenced by the court's decisions. The case is largely based on the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which struck down a New York requirement that residents show good cause to obtain a license to carry a handgun outside of their home. Gun control groups have argued that New York is trying to flout the high court's decision in Bruen.
    


            The decision Monday was the latest in which the high court declined to take up appeals that have followed from the Bruen decision in recent years. The justices have for weeks been considering several other Second Amendment appeals, including one dealing with Maryland's ban on certain semi-automatic rifles.
    


            In addition to striking down New York's law at the time, the Supreme Court set a new, history-based standard for review gun prohibitions. In order to pass judicial scrutiny, the court ruled, a gun law must have some connection with gun regulations in place at the time of the nation's founding. That ruling has sparked considerable uncertainty in lower court about just how much a connection is required.
    


            The Supreme Court tried to clarify things with a decision last year when it upheld a federal law that bars people who are the subject of certain domestic violence restraining orders from owning guns.
    


            After reviewing the New York case in light of the decision on restraining orders, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld much of the state's law last fall. It did, however, let stand a lower court order blocking enforcement of the state's ban on carrying concealed weapons in certain privately owned retail establishments, such as supermarkets and restaurants.

Wall Street swings in and out of red as turmoil from US president's assault on world trade enters second week

Extreme volatility plagued global stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as Donald Trump defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new US tariffs to medicine.

A renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.

On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped by as much as 4.1% – entering bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its most recent peak, in February – before launching an extraordinary reversal to turn positive.

While markets were fleetingly boosted after Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, signaled that Trump was open to considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries but China, the relief did not last long. By late morning, the S&P was trading down 1.4%.

As the turmoil headed into a second week, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2%.

The FTSE 100 shed 4.6% in London, after the Nikkei 225 slumped 7.8% in Tokyo.

Trump, who has previously used market rallies as a barometer of his success, tried to brush off the sell-off this weekend. “I don't want anything to go down,” the US president said on Sunday. “But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

He stood firm on Monday. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid!”

As China prepares to retaliate, Trump threatened to further increase US tariffs on the country – an additional rate of 50% – if it hits back. All talks with Beijing over potential meetings have been “terminated”, he said.

Major share indices have fallen dramatically since he unveiled his controversial plan to overhaul the US economy last week. The Trump administration imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imported goods this weekend, and is set to follow with higher tariffs on products from specific nations from Wednesday.

While senior figures in corporate America have been reluctant to criticize Trump since his inauguration in January, a handful have started to sound the alarm in recent days.

The JPMorgan Chase boss, Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, warned on Monday that Trump's tariff plan was “likely” to exacerbate inflation. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.

Dimon added: “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.”

The billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump's campaign for the presidency, has also demanded the administration reconsider its plan. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Peter Navarro, Trump's top trade adviser, insisted in a television interview on Monday morning that the market would find a bottom. Less than hour later, when New York opened for trading, the search continued.

The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite started the day down 4.3%, before briefly turning positive. By mid-morning, it was down 1%. The VIX “fear index” of volatility rose as high as 60 for the first time since August.

Oil prices also came under pressure, with Brent and WTI benchmarks stooping to their lowest levels in four years, as growing economic tensions between Washington and Beijing stoked fears that a global downturn would challenge demand.

Sir Richard Branson, co-founder of Virgin Group, argued the “predictable and preventable” market chaos would have “catastrophic” implications for people in the US and around the world, and claimed companies were already going bankrupt as a result of the weaker dollar and higher costs.

“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course,” Branson wrote on X. “Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come.”

            Two former top federal labor protection officials were reinstated to their posts Monday by the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals – at least for now – amid a lengthy legal dispute over President Donald Trump's ability to fire leaders from independent government agencies.
    


            In a 7-4 decision, the full appeals court wiped away a previous ruling from a three-judge panel that allowed Trump to fire the officials: Cathy Harris, the chairwoman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal firings and can reinstate wrongly terminated employees, and Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board.
    


            With these two officials returning to their posts, a quorum has now been restored at the NLRB and MSPB, allowing them to function at full strength and process cases involving federal employment disputes. These agencies are a critical bulwark against Trump's efforts to rapidly reduce the size of the federal workforce and fire thousands of employees.
    


            Both officials are Democrats appointed by former President Joe Biden whose statutory terms weren't set to expire for years. Federal law says they can only be dismissed for cause, but Trump is trying to fire them anyway, and the Justice Department has argued that it's unconstitutional to restrain the president's firing powers.
    


            This is not the final say in the matter, which many legal observers believe is eventually headed to the Supreme Court.
    


            The full DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday wiped away an emergency order from the three-judge panel letting Trump fire the officials while the appeals play out. But a smaller three-judge panel is still set to review the underlying merits of the case, and a hearing is scheduled for May 16.
    


            “The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,” the DC Circuit majority wrote in its ruling Monday.
    


Previous Supreme Court rulings about presidential firing powers, which the Trump administration wants to overturn, “remain good law” and are still “in place,” the judges wrote, citing earlier cases.
    


            All seven of the DC Circuit judges who supported reinstating the labor officials were appointed by Democratic presidents, and the four dissenting judges who opposed it were appointed by Republicans.
    


            CNN has reached out to the MSPB and NLRB for comment.
    


            Both women challenged their firings in court, and trial judges concluded that their terminations were unlawful. The Justice Department then appealed those decisions and later secured a court order letting Trump fire the officials on a temporary basis while the appealed played out. That temporary order was vacated Monday, reinstating the officials.

Combatants' testimonies describe how areas were destroyed to create ‘a death zone of enormous proportions' 

Israel's military razed huge swathes of land inside the perimeter of Gaza and ordered troops to turn the area into a “kill zone” where anybody who entered was a target, according to testimony by soldiers who carried out the plan.

Israeli combatants said they were ordered to destroy homes, factories and farmland roughly 1km (0.6 miles) inside the perimeter of Gaza to make a “buffer zone”, with one describing the area as looking like Hiroshima.

The testimonies are some of the first accounts by Israeli soldiers to be published since the latest war started in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israel. They were collected by Breaking the Silence, a group founded in 2004 by Israeli veterans who aim to expose the reality of the military's grip over Palestinians. The Guardian interviewed four of the soldiers who corroborated the accounts.

Titled “The Perimeter” and published on Monday, the report said the stated purpose of the plan was to create a thick strip of land that provided a clear line of sight for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to identify and kill militants. “This space was to have no crops, structures, or people. Almost every object, infrastructure installation, and structure within the perimeter was demolished,” it said.

Soldiers were “given orders to deliberately, methodically, and systematically annihilate whatever was within the designated perimeter, including entire residential neighbourhoods, public buildings, educational institutions, mosques, and cemeteries, with very few exceptions”, the report added.

The ultimate result, however, was the creation of “a death zone of enormous proportions”, the report said. “Places where people had lived, farmed, and established industry were transformed into a vast wasteland, a strip of land eradicated in its entirety.”

It stretches along the frontier with Israel, from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the strip's south-east corner next to Egypt.

A sergeant in the combat engineers corps said that once an area in the perimeter “was pretty much empty of any Gazans, we essentially started getting missions that were about basically blowing up houses or what was left of the houses”.

This was the routine, they said: “Get up in the morning, each platoon gets five, six, or seven locations, seven houses that they're supposed to work on. We didn't know a lot about the places that we were destroying or why we were doing it. I guess those things today, from my perspective now, are not legitimate. What I saw there, as far as I can judge, was beyond what I can justify that was needed.”

Some soldiers testified that commanders viewed the destruction as a way of exacting revenge for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which sparked the current war when Palestinian militants killed hundreds and kidnapped Israeli and foreign citizens.

While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is fighting allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”.

The IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the report and combatants' accounts.

One of the soldiers who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity said their unit was told to shoot anyone in the perimeter area on sight. The mentality in their unit, they said, was that there was no such thing as a “civilian” and everyone who walked into the perimeter would be considered a “terrorist”.

Rules on who can be killed on sight appeared to vary for different units, according to the accounts.

A sergeant in the armoured corps said that in 2024 he was given “shoot to kill” orders for any male adult who entered the perimeter. “For women and children, [the order was] ‘shoot to drive away', and if they come close to the fence, you stop [them]. You don't kill women, children, or the elderly. ‘Shoot to drive away' means a tank fire,” he said.

But a captain in an armoured corps unit who operated in Gaza earlier in the war, in November 2023, described the border area as a “kill zone”, saying: “The borderline is a kill zone. Anyone who crosses a certain line, that we have defined, is considered a threat and is sentenced to death.”

Another captain said there were “no clear rules of engagement at any point” and described a “generally massive use of firepower, especially, like with tanks”. They added: “There was a lot of instigating fire for the sake of instigating fire, somewhere between [wanting to produce] a psychological effect and just for no reason.

“[We] set out on this war out of insult, out of pain, out of anger, out of the sense that we had to succeed. This distinction [between civilians and terrorist infrastructure], it didn't matter. Nobody cared. We decided on a line … past which everyone is a suspect.”

How Palestinians would know they were crossing an invisible line was not made clear to them, the soldiers said. “How they know is a really good question. Enough people died or got injured crossing that line, so they don't go near it.”

Before the latest war, Israel had previously established a buffer zone inside Gaza that extended to 300 metres, but the new one was intended to range from 800 to 1,500 metres, according to the testimonies.

Satellite imagery has previously revealed the IDF destroyed hundreds of buildings that stood within 1km to 1.2km of the perimeter fence, in a systematic demolishing act that rights groups say may constitute collective punishment and should be investigated as a war crime. Last week, Israel's defence minister said the military would seize “large areas” in Gaza in a fresh offensive.

The perimeter accounts for just over 15% of the Gaza Strip, which is entirely off-limits to Palestinian residents. It represents 35% of the strip's entire agricultural land, according to the report.

Despite shoot-to-kill orders, a warrant officer stationed in northern Gaza said Palestinians kept going back to the area “again and again after we fired at them”.

The officer said the Palestinians appeared to want to pick edible plants growing in the area. “There was hubeiza [mallow] there because no one went near there. People are hungry, so they come with bags to pick hubeiza, I think.”

Some got away with their food and their lives, the officer said. “The thing is that, at that point, the IDF really is fulfilling the public's wishes, which state: ‘There are no innocents in Gaza'.”

In an interview with the Guardian, the same officer said the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 made many Israelis feel the “need to pick up a gun”.

“A lot of us went there, I went there, because they killed us and now we're going to kill them,” they said. “And I found out that we're not only killing them – we're killing them, we're killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs. We're destroying their houses and pissing on their graves.”

            Nintendo found what works — and it's not turning back.
    


            That's the impression the company gave last week when it introduced the Switch 2, which launches June 5 and costs $450 — substantially more than its $300 predecessor.
    


            Nintendo's next-generation console is a significantly upgraded version of its popular gaming device from eight years ago, a testament to the Switch's popularity but also a gamble that its success will endure for the better part of the next decade. While the 2017-era Switch introduced gamers to the concept of a home console that also serves as a portable game machine, the Switch 2 doubles down on that idea — amid growing competition from PC rivals like Valve and Lenovo that have emerged over the last three years.
    


            Nintendo is also launching its most important product in years at what may be the worst time — just before President Donald Trump introduced a slew of tariffs on foreign goods, which heavily target Asia, where many tech supply chains are based. As a result, the gaming giant on Friday postponed its April 9 US preorder date to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”
    


            “As you look at the prices that were announced … they factored in previous tariffs and how they had been administered, and where they had been administered,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CNN ahead of the company's decision to delay US preorders. “… We're currently actively assessing what steps we may need to take, and what may be next.”
    


            Sticking with the same formula is a bold move for Nintendo, which rarely does the same thing twice. But if you ask Bowser, the Switch 2 continues what could be a long line of Nintendo devices that mix stationary and mobile gaming.
    


            “We do believe that this idea of having a singular device that you can play as a handheld on the go, that you can set up in tabletop … and play with a friend, or that you can dock at home and play as a console-like device — we think that resonates with players,” he said when asked whether Nintendo would consider a new style of device in the future.
    


            The Switch 2 is entering a much more competitive environment than its predecessor did in 2017. Just about every major gaming brand has introduced a handheld console, with Valve's Steam Deck being the most popular.
    


            The Steam Deck launched in 2022 as an answer to the Switch for PC gamers, allowing players to access their library of computer games on a dedicated mobile gaming device rather than a laptop or desktop. Since the Steam Deck's launch, a handful of other computing giants, such as Asus, Lenovo and Logitech, have introduced their own handheld game machines.
    


            Valve — also known as the developer of Team Fortress, Dota and other popular video games — is the leader among these PC rivals with 48% of the PC handheld market in 2024, according to the Verge, citing data from the International Data Corporation.
    


            Still, those statistics indicate the market is far behind Nintendo, with just under 6 million units shipped compared to the 150 million Switches that have been sold thus far. Nintendo sold 15.7 million hardware units in its fiscal year that ended in March 2024 alone, according to its earnings statement.
    


            It's an indication that Nintendo is onto something — and one of its biggest rivals has taken notice, too.
    


            Sony launched the PlayStation Portal in 2023, a handheld device that can stream games from a PlayStation 5, so that gamers don't have to hog the living room TV when playing. Microsoft, meanwhile, has pushed the idea that any device can be “an Xbox” by streaming games from its cloud service.
    


            With the Switch 2, Nintendo is bridging some of the gaps between its older handheld console and its competition. It has more powerful hardware, including more storage, 4K support, a larger screen and an improved cooling system. Plus, the new Joy-Con controllers can be used like a computer mouse, perhaps another indication that Nintendo is looking to woo the computer gaming crowd.
    


            “While the form factor is the same, everything inside has completely been either upgraded or enhanced or is new,” Bowser said.
    


            However, hardware is only half the story. Nintendo is best known for its universe of exclusive games and iconic characters, from Mario to Zelda and Kirby. But it's making a much bigger push into third-party software with the Switch 2, as evidenced by the slew of popular titles — such as Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077 — showcased during Nintendo's presentation last week.
    


            That could potentially prevent consumers from having to choose between a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, the latter of which typically offers a much wider variety of non-Nintendo games.
    


            “It's about appealing to the broadest set of players that we possibly can,” Bowser said when asked whether the focus on third-party titles was intended to court Steam Deck fans.
    


            In addition to its hardware and software, the Switch 2's higher price also puts it in closer competition than ever before with rivals from Sony, Microsoft and Valve, among others. The Switch 2 starts at $450, while Sony and Microsoft offer certain editions of their PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles for $400 and $450, respectively. The Steam Deck starts at $399.
    


            Games are also seemingly getting a price hike, with Mario Kart World costing a whopping $80.
    


            The higher price arrives in a challenging economy in which consumers are struggling to afford everyday items, let alone game consoles and more competition. But Nintendo is banking on its signature charm and quirkiness to distinguish the Switch 2 as a worthwhile investment.
    


            For example, one of the Switch 2's hallmark new features is a social system called GameChat, through which players can share their screen while chatting and use dedicated camera to see each other while playing.
    


            Nintendo is also experimenting with new ways to use the Joy-Con controllers, such as by dragging them across a surface to move characters on screen.
    


            And then of course, there's Mario. Nintendo didn't reveal a new mainline Mario title during its Switch 2 announcement, but Bowser hinted that it may only be a matter of time.
    


            “Stay tuned,” he said. “You know, we have a long, long catalog, and a long list of (intellectual property) that I'm sure will make its way to the platform.”

Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan echo president and key ally as experts express fears for ‘bedrock constitutional principles'

As Donald Trump and Elon Musk widen their radical attacks on US judges who have stalled some of Trump's executive orders and Musk's slashing of federal agencies, they're gaining backing from top House Republicans and other politicians, including some to whom the tech billionaire made big campaign donations.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump's attacks on judges, and a judiciary subcommittee hearing on 1 April explored “judicial overreach” and ways to curb judges who have stymied some Trump orders or Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and its draconian cuts to the federal government.

Veteran Republican consultants say the hefty campaign-spending muscle of Musk, the world's richest person, who spent about $300m helping Trump win last year, is likely to boost many Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.

“Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Musk to make a lot of donations to them in 2026,” said longtime Republican consultant Charlie Black. “But it's likely that such donations will be coordinated with the president's preferences.”

The verbal assaults on judges by Trump and his allies have been fueled by multiple rulings adverse to some Trump executive orders, including major court decisions in March that sought to halt deporting Venezuelan immigrants and blocking penalizing law firms that Trump deemed political enemies.

Washington DC judge James Boasberg incurred Trump's wrath for trying to halt the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison with a nationwide injunction challenging the tenuous legal basis for the administration action. Boasberg's ruling spurred Trump to falsely label him a “radical left lunatic”, urge his impeachment, and then call for him to be disbarred.

Musk has repeatedly used X, the social media platform he owns and on which he has over 200 million followers, to urge impeaching judges whose rulings he doesn't like. “The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,” he said on 25 February.

Legal scholars say Trump and Musk's radical threats of impeachment or disbarment for judicial rulings that stall or block administration moves undermine the rule of law.

“Trump and Musk are playing with fire,” said retired Massachusetts judge Nancy Gertner, who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “They're undermining bedrock constitutional principles.”

She added: “You can't shut down a court just because you disagree. The judges have done nothing wrong or inconsistent with their oaths, and nothing outside their judicial roles.”

Trump's call for impeaching Boasberg drew a sharp and broad rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who last month said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.

Further, contrary to Trump's baseless charges against Boasberg, the judge's rulings have hardly been one-sided. One example: Boasberg sided with Trump in 2017 to stop the IRS from sharing his tax returns which a long-shot lawsuit sought.

Besides Boasberg, three other Washington DC judges last month ruled against Trump executive orders targeting law firms he viewed as political foes for retribution, which the judges argued were on dangerous or dubious legal ground.

Among other things, the Trump orders seek to take away security clearances for some of the law firms and sharply curtail their government business.

To ratchet up pressures on judges, after judge Beryl Howell issued a decision in March to temporarily block Trump from penalizing the law firm Perkins Coie, the justice department, in a rare move, tried to have Howell removed from the case, alleging she was biased.

In a blistering response, Howell wrote: “This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented.”

Two other DC judges in March backed law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which sued the administration on first amendment grounds to block executive orders aimed at hurting the firms financially for their separate ties to key lawyers who led a special counsel inquiry into how Russia worked to help elect Trump in 2016.

Judge John Bates, an appointee of George W Bush who issued a restraining order blocking Trump's sanctions against Jenner & Block, called Trump's punitive move “disturbing” and “troubling”, noting the order targets the firm's and its lawyers' rights under the first amendment, and due process.

Legal scholars and former judges are raising alarms about the rising dangers to the rule of law and the physical safety of judges sparked by the attacks from Trump and his congressional allies.

“While the threats to impeach federal judges based on their decisions are largely performative, they are also designed to foment disrespect for the judiciary and the rule of law,” said former federal judge John Jones, who is now the president of Dickinson College.

“In addition, many of the calls for impeachment are accompanied by the unconscionable disclosure of personal information about individual judges that jeopardize the personal safety of those judges and their family members.”

Other legal experts worry that Trump's judicial attacks, which some congressional allies are parroting even though the odds of impeaching judges are long, could spark violence.

“The real risk comes not from Congress, but the fringe elements in Trump's camp, who might be stirred up to threaten or actually inflict harm on the targeted judges,” said former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman.

“Judges are rightly worried about their safety, and the measures in place to protect them may prove inadequate if the dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from the Trump camp continues.”

Despite such fears, many of Trump's hardcore loyalists in Congress are jumping on board to further fuel Trump's attacks on judges, while benefiting from Musk's campaign largesse.

At least seven Republican members, including Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Brandon Gill of Texas, who echoed Trump's call for impeaching Judge Boasberg, or advocated other “action” against judges who ruled against Trump orders, received checks from Musk for $6,600, the maximum he could donate.

Although Republican leaders have suggested that impeachment of judges won't happen because they don't have the votes, their public efforts to bolster Trump's war on judicial independence has been accelerating, with allies exploring other avenues to curb judges.

Johnson turned up the heat on judges on 25 March when he vowed that “desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act”. One option eyed by Trump's Republican allies came up at a judiciary subcommittee hearing last week that focused on banning nationwide injunctions by judges. A House bill to ban such injunctions is expected to pass in coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Charles Grassley, the senator who leads his chamber's judiciary committee and has received a donation from Musk, held a hearing that also explored bans on nationwide injunctions by judges; Grassley in March introduced a bill that would end the “practice of universal injunctions”, but Senate passage is deemed a long shot.

Some former Republican congressmen are highly critical of Trump's congressional allies for amplifying his attacks on judges, and predict that the House GOP will try to “monetize” Trump's fury at a growing number of judges.

“The investigation into judges by Chairman Jordan, and calls by Gill and Ogles for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against Trump, are more examples of blind loyalty to Trump by a bunch of sycophants,” said former Michigan member Dave Trott.

“It would not be such a big deal except for the fact that their conduct is helping create a crisis involving the constitution they swore to uphold.”

Trott added: “And just in case these sycophants suddenly decide to stand up to Trump, Elon is using his billions to help Republicans get re-elected. This will ensure the GOP stays in line. The concentration of great wealth and power is a problem that will have serious consequences for our country.”

Other ex-Republican members voice similar concerns.

“I think this is a talking point and a fundraising tool,' said Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, adding that members will attack judges for “impeding Trump's agenda, and they'll try to monetize it for campaign purposes”.

Some former prosecutors say the judicial attacks by Trump and his GOP allies jibe with Trump's broader blitz to expand his powers

“Trump has, believe it or not, a strategic plan to disable all opposition,” said former prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig.

Part of that plan “involves eliminating internal oversight, like inspectors general, and cowing external opposition, by threatening law firms. The final piece is to eliminate the last independent check on his authority – judges. To do this he is falsely accusing them of bias and enlisting his sycophantic supporters, like Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, in the effort.”

            Lori Vallow Daybell, the Idaho mother with doomsday religious beliefs who was convicted of killing her two youngest children and conspiring to murder a romantic rival, is on trial again. This time, she's accused in Arizona of conspiring to murder her estranged husband.
    


            The case has drawn public attention in part because Vallow Daybell, 51, has doomsday-focused religious beliefs. She isn't a lawyer but has chosen to represent herself in the six-week trial. Opening statements are scheduled Monday in a Phoenix courtroom.
    


            Prosecutors say she conspired with her brother to kill Charles Vallow, so she could collect money from his life insurance policy and marry her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author who wrote several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world.
    


            Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty and has not spoken publicly about the details of Vallow's death. Here's what to know about the case.
    


            Vallow was fatally shot in July 2019. Vallow Daybell then moved to Idaho with her children, Joshua “JJ” Vallow and Tylee Ryan. She married Daybell just two weeks after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell. The children went missing for several months before their bodies were found buried in rural Idaho on Chad Daybell's property. JJ was 7 and Tylee was 16.
    


            Vallow Daybell is already serving three life sentences in Idaho for the children's deaths and for conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Chad Daybell was sentenced to death in the three killings.
    


            Four months before he died, Charles Vallow filed for divorce from Vallow Daybell, saying she had become infatuated with near-death experiences and had claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets.
    


            He alleged she threatened to ruin him financially and kill him. He sought a voluntary mental health evaluation of his wife.
    


            Police say Vallow was fatally shot by Vallow Daybell's brother, Alex Cox, when Vallow went to pick up his son at Vallow Daybell's home in Chandler, a Phoenix suburb. Vallow Daybell's daughter, Tylee, told police that she confronted Vallow with a baseball bat after she was awakened by yelling in the house.
    


            Tylee said she was trying to defend her mother, but Vallow took away the bat, according to police records. Cox told police that he fired after Vallow refused to drop the bat and came after him.

            Cox told investigators that Vallow Daybell and the children left the house shortly before the shooting. Investigators say she went to get fast food for her son and bought flip-flops at a pharmacy before returning home.
    


            Cox, who claimed he acted in self-defense and wasn't arrested in Vallow's death, died five months later from what medical examiners said was a blood clot in his lungs. Cox's account was later called into question.
    


            Vallow Daybell was a beautician by trade, a mother of three and a wife — five times over.
    


            Her first marriage, to a high school sweetheart when she was 19, ended quickly. She married again in her early 20s and had a son. Then, in 2001, she married Joseph Ryan, and they had Tylee. They divorced a few years later, and Ryan died in 2018 at his home of a suspected heart attack.
    


            Charles Vallow entered the picture several months later. Vallow and Vallow Daybell married in 2006 and later adopted JJ, but by 2019 their marriage had soured. The two were estranged but still married when Cox fatally shot Vallow.
    


            Public interest from around the world only grew as the investigation into the missing children took several unexpected turns, each new revelation seemingly stranger than the last.
    


            Daybell, who was once a contestant on “Wheel of Fortune,” has been the subject of a Netflix documentary and Lifetime movie.
    


            While representing herself, Vallow Daybell has complained about news coverage of her criminal cases, invoked her right to a speedy trial, questioned whether a government witness was truly an expert and engaged in disputes over the pre-trial exchange of evidence.

            At a hearing last week, she lost a bid to strike three people from the prosecution's witness list, including the grandmother of her adopted son. Another witness says Vallow Daybell spoke about Vallow as being “possessed” in the months before his death. When the judge asked her to argue her point, Vallow Daybell lowered her head, sighed and paused a few seconds. “Their information is not firsthand,” Vallow Daybell said. “These witnesses are all coming together. They are watching everything that goes on on TV regarding this.”
    


            If convicted in Arizona of conspiring to kill Vallow, she would face a life sentence.
    


            Vallow Daybell will wear civilian clothing during her trial and will not be handcuffed or shackled when jurors are in the courtroom. She, however, is expected to be wearing a belt-like device under her clothes that will let a jail officer deliver an electric shock by remote control if there's a disturbance.
    


            The Idaho investigation began at the end of 2019 when Vallow Daybell's adopted son's grandmother, worried about his welfare, reached out to police. Vallow Daybell had been evasive when asked about her two youngest children.
    


            Chad Daybell called 911 in October 2019 to report that his wife Tammy Daybell was battling an illness and died in her sleep. Her body was later exhumed, and an autopsy determined she died of asphyxiation.
    


            Idaho police did a welfare check on the kids in November 2019 and discovered they were missing and hadn't been seen since early September. Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell left town a short time later, eventually turning up in Hawaii without the kids. She was arrested in Hawaii in February 2020 on a warrant out of Idaho.
    


            Defense attorneys told jurors that she was a “kind and loving mother” who happened to be interested in religion and biblical prophesies.
    


            A witness at the Idaho trial said Vallow Daybell believes evil spirits have taken over people in her life and turned them into “zombies.”
    


            The trial over Charles Vallow's death will mark the first of two criminal trials in Arizona for Vallow Daybell.
    


            She's scheduled to go on trial again in late May on a charge of conspiring to murder Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Vallow Daybell's niece, Melani Pawlowski.
    


            Someone in a Jeep fired a gunshot at Boudreaux in 2019 outside his home in a Phoenix suburb, missing him but striking his car. The Jeep matched the description of one registered to Charles Vallow, who was killed nearly three months prior to the shooting outside Boudreaux's home.
    


            Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she would face a life sentence.

            The CIA is reviewing its authorities to use lethal force against drug cartels in Mexico and beyond as the Trump administration moves to make taking on the cartels a major priority for the intelligence agency, according to a US official and three people briefed on the matter.
    


            The review does not indicate President Donald Trump has ordered the CIA to take direct action against the cartels. But it is designed to help the agency understand what kinds of activities it could legally undertake and what the potential risks would be across the suite of options, the sources said — underscoring how seriously the Trump administration is considering the possibility.
    


            It also highlights some US officials' concerns that using traditional counterterrorism tools against cartels — as the Trump administration has said it intends to do — carries a much higher risk of collateral damage to American citizens than similar operations conducted in the Middle East, far from US soil.

CIA flying covert drone missions into Mexico to spy on drug cartels



            Among the issues agency lawyers are examining is the CIA's and its officers' liability if an American is accidentally killed in any operation, according to one of the people briefed.
    


            Agency officials are “cautious” about using “assets traditionally going after what were seen as military targets now being employed against cartel targets,” the US official said.
    


            The Trump administration earlier this year designated a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations — a maneuver some current and former US officials believe is designed to build a predicate for lethal action — and the CIA is already flying surveillance drones that are capable of being armed over Mexico.
    


            The CIA declined to comment.
    


            CNN was not able to determine whether the effort was ordered by the White House or CIA Director John Ratcliffe, or whether it was undertaken as a prudent planning measure by agency staff in response to clear signals from the Trump administration that it wants national security agencies to ramp up pressure on the cartels.
    


            “If any administration is pushing us to do something that has potential significant adverse ramifications for the agency, [the CIA] is going to want to double and triple check: ‘Is it legal?' and ‘Do we have extraordinarily clear policy direction to do what we're going to do?'” said one former CIA official with experience building this kind of review.
    


            “Just because something is legal under [the law of armed conflict] doesn't mean it's something you should do,” this person said, referring to protocols regulating the conduct of states during war. “There's an ethical component. There's a practical component. There's a pragmatic component.” 



            The CIA has the legal authority to either conduct lethal strikes itself or provide targeting information or other support to another nation to carry out a lethal strike, as long as it's properly authorized by the president and abides by the interlocking constellation of US laws and regulations that govern armed conflict.
    


            But to do so against cartel actors in an area where there are, comparatively, far more US-born citizens and green card holders — people who might have the standing to sue the US government if they are harmed — is novel for the CIA.
    


            “It's not a question of whether they can or cannot use lethal force. They can,” said one of the people briefed on the review. “It's more about the implications of Americans being potentially injured or killed based on their broader presence in the space.”
    


            Collateral damage could also blow back on any partner nation that either allows the CIA to conduct direct action inside its borders or that accepts intelligence support from the agency to conduct its own lethal operations, the US official noted. If the CIA support creates a political problem for the partner nation — Mexico, for example — its government could refuse to allow the agency to operate there going forward.
    


            Former officials have also warned about the risks of retaliation by cartels, some of which maintain a presence inside the United States.
    


            “Mexican cartels are not merely criminal organizations; they operate as paramilitary entities with deep financial resources, global supply chains, and sophisticated logistical networks that extend into the United States,” Doug Livermore, a specialist in irregular warfare and a former Defense Department official, wrote in a recent study for the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank. “Cartels are highly likely to retaliate” and “possess a substantial capacity for terrorism that, when coupled with their established presence within the United States, could escalate conflict.”
    


            One of the people briefed on the review said it reflected a deep institutional memory of the George W. Bush administration's “enhanced interrogation” program, which lawmakers and the Obama administration subsequently deemed to be torture. In that instance, former officials said, the agency pushed its operations to the limit of what they believed the law could bear. Critics, of course, contend the agency and the administration went beyond what was legal, and in the years following, the CIA and its officers were put through a series of public and high-profile investigations into the propriety of their actions.
    


            This sort of review, the people briefed on the matter said, reflects an understanding that the agency may be called to account for any action it takes against cartels — especially if there is blowback. And especially if the agency conducts operations that are ultimately seen as disproportionate to the threat from cartels — key criteria that lethal action must meet under the law of armed conflict.
    


            The US intelligence community's annual threat assessment, published last month, led with the threat from drug cartels for apparently the first time in the report's nearly 20-year history. Many current and former national security officials, however, have repeatedly argued that while cartels are a serious problem, they are not an existential threat to the country.
    


            “I think it's very understandable that people are mindful of [the history of “enhanced interrogation”] to the extent that they actually don't believe we're in a crisis,” said one of the former officials.

Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian-American teenager and wounded two others in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night, according to Palestinian officials, after the Israeli military said it targeted a group throwing stones at cars.
    


            Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam said the 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot dead by Israeli troops in the village of Turmusaya. Two other Palestinian-American boys, ages 14 and 15, were injured in the incident, according to the mayor of Turmusaya, Lafi Shalabi.
    


            The Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire during a counterterrorism operation in Turmusaya when they saw three “terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.”
    


            The soldiers killed one and hit the other two, the military said.
    


            The military shared a blurry video purportedly showing the incident, in which three figures are seen. At the end of the short clip, one of the figures appears to hurl an object. The Israeli military said it would continue operating in the West Bank “to protect the residents in the area.”
    


            The injured boys were shot in the abdomen, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
    


            One severely injured boy and another with minor wounds were taken to a hospital in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said.
    


            The killing of a Palestinian-American teenager came just hours before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in the United States to meet President Donald Trump. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
    


            The killing or detention of American citizens in occupied Palestinian territories by Israelis and concerns about a lack of accountability date back years. In 2003, American activist Rachel Corrie, 23, was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer while trying to block it from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Nine years later, an Israeli civil court ruled her death an accident.
    


            In spring 2022, prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while reporting in the West Bank. That November, Defense Minister Benny Gantz confirmed that Israel would not cooperate with a US probe into her death. A CNN investigation suggested that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces, despite wearing a vest marked “Press.”
    


            In February last year, Florida-born US citizen Mohammed Khdour, 17, was killed by Israeli forces who shot him in the head while he was in his car. The teenager was taking the car out during a study break, snacking on chocolate waffles, posing for Instagram.

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) referred questions about Khdour's case to the Israeli Security Agency, known as the Shin Bet, which did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Three weeks before Khdour's death, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old Palestinian-American who grew up in Louisiana, was also shot in the head by apparent Israeli gunmen. The IDF told CNN they received a report that an off-duty police officer and an Israeli civilian shot at a Palestinian “suspected of throwing stones” – which his family vehemently denied – and that the Israeli Police were investigating the shooting.
    


            Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank have intensified since late January following the launch of an expanded military campaign there almost immediately after the Gaza ceasefire began. Since then, roughly 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes.
    


            The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, but Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner consistent with collective punishment. In late February, Israel deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.

Transport secretary says overhaul in response to Trump tariffs supports car firms and climate goals

Labour's changes to electric vehicle (EV) rules in response to Donald Trump's tariffs will have a negligible impact on emissions, the transport secretary has said.

Keir Starmer has confirmed plans to boost manufacturers, including reinstating the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.

But regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will also be altered, to help companies in the transition, and new hybrids will be on the market for a further five years.

Heidi Alexander said the taxes on imports announced by the US president last week, which spurred reciprocal action by some affected countries, “are bad news for the global economy, because it's bad for global demand, it's bad for prices and it's bad for consumers”.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast about the impact on carbon emissions of the government's changes to electric vehicle rules, she said: “The changes we are making have been very carefully calibrated so as not to have a big impact upon the carbon emissions savings that are baked into this policy. In fact, the impact on carbon emissions as a result of these changes is negligible.”

Under the measures, luxury supercar companies such as Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond 2030 because they manufacture only a small number of vehicles a year.

New hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars will be allowed to be sold until 2035. Petrol and diesel vans will be able to be sold until 2035, as well as all hybrid models.

The Green party MP Siân Berry said: “The government is wrong to apply the brakes on the sale of EV cars.

“This is just the latest in a series of boosts the Labour government has given fossil fuel industries. We've also seen the green light being given to airport expansion and a new road tunnel under the Thames.

“This suggests Labour is weakening its climate commitments, and its health-related policy goals because all these moves will have a detrimental impact on air quality.

“Slowing down the move away from fossil-fuelled transport makes no economic sense either, since green sectors of the economy are growing three times faster than the overall UK economy.”

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “In weakening the mandate elsewhere by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of standard hybrids between 2030 and 2035, the government risks reducing the competition it has stimulated between manufacturers, meaning prices for families seeking an EV might not fall as fast, and sales could slow.

“The growth of the secondhand EV market, where most of us buy our cars, would in turn be stunted, leaving millions of families stuck in petrol and hybrid cars paying a petrol premium of hundreds, and even thousands, of pounds a year.”

Alexander said the government had “struck the right balance” between protecting British businesses and cutting carbon emissions.

Asked if the retention of a 2030 target for the phasing out of all pure petrol and diesel cars would restrict free markets at a time when the car industry was on its knees, she said: “It is an opportunity for the car industry to remain at the cutting edge of the transition to EVs, but it's right that we're pragmatic.

“It's right that we are looking at how we can be flexible in the way in which car manufacturers make this transition, because we want cheaper EVs to be available for consumers. We want people to be able to benefit from those lower running costs as well.

“And so it's important that, as a government, we do everything that we can – not only to support British businesses and manufacturing to grow the economy, but also to cut those carbon emissions, and I think we've struck the right balance in the package that we're announcing today.”

Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if Starmer was prepared to use the relationship he has built with Trump to ask him to change course, she said: “Obviously when the prime minister has discussions internationally with allies he will be honest about what is in the best interests of the British people.”

Challenged that the EV measures were planned before the announcement of the tariffs and were a tweak to policy rather than dramatic change, she told Today: “These are significant changes to the car industry. You are right to say we started the consultation on Christmas Eve and that we closed the consultation in the middle of February.”

She said Trump's imposition of tariffs meant the UK government had to look at its EV plans with “renewed urgency”.

The value of one Australian dollar dropped to a low of 59.64 US cents, its lowest point since April 2020

Consumers and travellers will face higher prices after the Australian dollar fell to Covid-era lows, as markets reel from Donald Trump's “liberation day” tariff plan.

Fears of a global recession dragged the Australian dollar sharply lower on Monday against the country's major trade partners and to its lowest point against the Euro, pound and US dollar since 2020.

A lower Australian dollar will translate to higher prices for customers buying overseas goods, even if prices settle in coming weeks, according to Kelly Slessor, an e-commerce expert.

“The cost of a dress or something overseas yesterday is significantly more expensive today, [especially] if you're buying it from the US,” she said.

“Temu, Shein and stuff like that will probably hold for a little while but their prices may go up over the next couple of weeks.”

The value of one Australian dollar fell to a low of US59.64c, its lowest point since April 2020, on Monday. This was down more than 6% on last week's 64c level before Trump's tariffs were unveiled.

While Australians import goods from all over the world, the prominence of the US dollar could make it hard to avoid higher prices, according to Mark Baartse, a retail consultant.

“A lot of transactions are pegged to US dollars, regardless of where you buy from,” he said.

Shoppers could turn to local Australian businesses or make their purchases sooner before trade-exposed businesses hike their prices, Baartse said.

Overseas travel will also be more expensive after the Australian dollar lost value in top destinations including New Zealand, Indonesia and India.

Nearly a million Australians travelled to Japan in 2024, helped by a strong exchange rate of over 100 yen to the dollar, but Monday's sell-off resulted in it falling below 90 yen for the first time since 2023.

The Australian dollar's value is tied to demand for commodities such as iron ore, which would suffer if economic activity slowed around the world, and especially in China, as a result of a global trade war.

My Bui, an economist at AMP, said investors bought the Australian dollar when they expected a global boom and sold it when they feared a crash.

“When there is concern about a global slowdown, and particularly from the tariff and global trade war, then there is less demand for our commodities,” Bui said.

Other global currencies were performing better against the US dollar as markets placed bets on where Trump's tariff regime would have the heaviest impact.

The Euro and Japanese yen rose against the US dollar, while India and South Korea suffered falls.

Australian markets have grown increasingly fearful of a global recession, with the share market shedding $160bn in value early on Monday as China and the European union make plans to retaliate against US tariffs.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič says bloc in a ‘tough spot' with 70% of exports being subjected to tariffs 

Šefčovič says the EU is “in early stages of discussions” with the US, complicated “because the US view tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure.”

But he says that “ while the EU remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not weigh endlessly until we see tangible progress.”

The EU has prepared a “robust list of countermeasures” on steel and aluminium after receiving feedback from over 600 stakeholders.

“After carefully reviewing all of it, we have worked to table a robust list of countermeasures, while balancing the burden across all member states, we will be sending the final list and tariff levels to them later today,

The vote is set for 9 April, with the final list adopted on 15 April, and then duties on products will kick in on that day for the first set of measures, and on 15 May for the remaining ones.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said the EU-US trade was “in a tough stop” but he hoped the EU and EU would “sooner or later” end up at a negotiation table, as he hoped for a negotiated solution to prolonging uncertainty surrounding US president Donald Trump's tariffs (16:18).

But the Slovak politician admitted that “until now, despite of efforts … we haven't seen the real engagement which would lead to the mutually acceptable solution” from the US side (16:12), as he warned that the Trump administration seemed to be determined to send an ideological signal to markets (16:30).

Šefčovič also spoke about a “clear difference of opinion” on figures in EU-US trade, arguing it it is wrong to look at trade in goods in isolation, without services, mutual investment, and other instruments.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen earlier said that “Europe is always ready for good deal,” but signaled the bloc was “also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests” (15:00).

Outgoing German economy minister Robert Habeck offered a brutal takedown of the US tariffs, saying the underlying calculations were “nonsense,” and “wrong,” as he urged US to “stop the nonsense … the mess you have made in the last week” (11:12).

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

British prime minister Keir Starmer spoke about US tariffs this afternoon too, warning that global consequences of Trump's move “could be profound.”

Nobody is pretending that tariffs are good news. You know that better than anyone – 25% tariffs on automotive exports and 10% on other goods, that is a huge challenge for our future, and the global economic consequences could be profound.

Starmer said we live in a new era, where the old assumptions don't apply any more, that he calls the age of insecurity.

For more on his comments and the UK's plans, see Andrew Sparrow's UK live blog here:

In response to the final question of the conference, Šefčovič says the EU and the US have “a clear difference of opinion” about the figures as he says it is wrong to look at trade in goods in isolation, without services, mutual investment, and other instruments.

In a hint at a potential US vulnerability, he adds: “I'm not even going into the direction of billions the US companies are generating from online advertising and different digital services that they're offering in Europe.”

He eventually says that the actual deficit that would need rebalancing is not higher than 50 billion euros.

“If we know that this is the issue, I think then we can sort it out very quickly. 

But my feeling is that at this stage it is more of a, I would say, decision of US administration to … transform the global trading system, and they see the tariffs as a corrective measures for many of the political goals, which I'm sure the US administration can describe much better, much better than I [can.”

They conclude the press conference here.

Šefčovič says he sees today's market reactions as “a kind of black day for the markets … all over the world,” saying ministers described it “as the most important paradigm shift in global trading patterns since the second world war.”

“This introduces a lot of uncertainty, lack of predictability, inflation fears and the fact that tariffs are, in the end, the taxes which will be paid by the businesses, but especially by the final consumers,” he says.

He says the tariffs prompted fears among consumers on spending, inflation, jobs, and future prospects.

“So these are the I would say the debates which are now taking place, I would say all across the world … and I'm not even going to tell you [about] the distressed phone calls we are getting from emerging economies and from the developing countries,” he says.

He repeats that the EU will be “careful” and respond in a “measured and well calibrated way.”

“We know what kind of impact this might have on the real economy and on the people, and therefore you see that we are really progressing step by step in this regard. 

But I wouldn't dare to speculate if it would have an impact on decision making across the Atlantic.”

On a slightly more upbeat note, Šefčovič says that he hopes that “sooner or later, we'll be sitting at the negotiating table … and I hope that we'll be able to arrive at the mutually acceptable compromise, which would restore our close trading relationship.”

He says the focus in any such talks would be on “looking at the ways how to lower or get rid of the tariffs … on cars and industrial goods in February, and we would focus our efforts on that effort, how to create this transatlantic marketplace for industrial goods, for the technologies of the future and for the good cooperation between two transatlantic allies.”

Šefčovič says the EU remains “prepared to engage” and says the bloc's preference would be to find a negotiated solution.

But he then says that “until now, despite of efforts … , we haven't seen the real engagement which would lead to the mutually acceptable solution, because it has to be fair for both sides.”

He says that there are questions from the US on VAT – which was repeatedly criticised by Trump – but he says the EU would not be prepared to change its rules.

He then adds that:

“We are ready to discuss, to look at things, but it has to be a mutually advantageous solution.”

EU trade commissioner Šefčovič says the EU's timeline on countermeasures on steel and aluminium is driven by legal analysis.

But he adds “it is not possible now to delay the entry into force” as some countries, such as Italy, appeared to be asking for it.

“We expect the vote on Wednesday and if the vote is positive, then we will proceed with 15 April,” he says.

More broadly, he says “we are ready to consider all options.”

“All options are on the table, and we will consult with the stakeholders and with our member states, how to use all the instruments we have at our disposal,” he says.

Šefčovič gets asked about the proposed “zero-for-zero” tariff deal with the US, and the reception it got from the US.

The Slovak politician says it was floated in his first meeting with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

He says the US focus appears to be on “Big Five” areas: cars, pharmaceutical, metals, lumber and semiconductors.

Šefčovič says the EU was ready to change rules on personal vehicles and find a deal, with a “zero-for-zero” deal, and potentially extending it to other industrial products.

“I hope that in future we would be ready to come back to this discussion, not now. [but] I believe that in the future this would be still the possibility,” he says.

Šefčovič says that while the focus so far has been on finalising steel and aluminium countermeasures, the announcement of the new “so-called reciprocal tariffs … forces us to look at additional steps.”

“We got some valuable input from the member states, from the ministers, which we of course, evaluate, and we will proceed, as always, in the close consultations with our member states and with the key stakeholders,” he says.

Šefčovič says the EU is “in early stages of discussions” with the US, complicated “because the US view tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure.”

But he says that “ while the EU remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not weigh endlessly until we see tangible progress.”

The EU has prepared a “robust list of countermeasures” on steel and aluminium after receiving feedback from over 600 stakeholders.

“After carefully reviewing all of it, we have worked to table a robust list of countermeasures, while balancing the burden across all member states, we will be sending the final list and tariff levels to them later today,

The vote is set for 9 April, with the final list adopted on 15 April, and then duties on products will kick in on that day for the first set of measures, and on 15 May for the remaining ones.”

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič says that the EU's trade situation with the US is “in a tough spot.”

He says that “70% of our total exports are facing tariffs of 20% of 25% or even higher.”

He acknowledges recent meetings with his US counterparts, as he says the two sides agree that “the EU-US trade relationship could benefit from a fresh look and a boost in strategic areas,” noting both markets “face similar challenges.”

He repeats von der Leyen's comment from last half hour that the EU “we have offered zero for zero tariffs for cars and all industrial goods.”

Opening the briefing after the ministerial council on trade, Polish deputy economy minister Michał Baranowski says “the message that came out from the council is very much a message of unity.”

“It's very clear that there are no winners, and this was something that was emphasised by all the member states. All of us would prefer a negotiated solution that takes us away from the potential trade war that can lead to a loss of jobs, lead to loss of wealth,” he says.

He says that the EU has a “prepared response” on steel and aluminium which will be put forward “soon”, but stressed that, at the moment the bloc is not focusing on “the so called reciprocal tariffs.”

He says he describes them as “so calls reciprocal tariffs” as “the methodology used by the US side is not yet entirely clear to us.”

As we wait for the press conference after the ministerial meeting, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen shared her views on US tariffs, as she welcomed Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre to Brussels.

She said that the US tariffs “come … at immense costs for US consumers and businesses,” as she insisted the EU “stand ready to negotiate with the United States.”

“Europe is always ready for good deal. So we keep it on the table,” she said, adding the EU “offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods, … because Europe is always ready for good deal.”

But she added the EU was “also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,” as it looked to step up its protection against “indirect effects [of] trade diversion.”

Von der Leyen said she engaged with key industrial stakeholders across the bloc to consult on next steps.

She also stressed that the EU should work on “strengthening our single market [by] getting rid of remaining barriers” in response to tariff disruptions.

            Rats don't always have the best reputations, but one named Ronin with a super sense of smell is working to change that.
    


            Ronin and his landmine-sniffing rat pack are making a name for rodents everywhere by saving innocent civilians from hidden explosives.
    


            The African giant pouched rat recently set a new world record for the most landmines detected by a rat. Between August 2021 and February 2025, Ronin uncovered 109 landmines and 15 other pieces of unexploded ordnance in a region close to Siem Reap in Cambodia, according to Guinness World Records.



            “Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of rats,” his main handler Phanny told the Guinness publication.
    


            Landmines are a major issue in former conflict zones. The explosive weapons, hidden in the ground, are designed to injure or kill anyone who passes over them. In Cambodia alone, they have caused more than 65,000 deaths and injuries since the fall of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.



            Their use is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and the threat they pose for decades after a conflict has ended, killing and maiming and hampering land development in war-ravaged areas.
    


            They are also notoriously difficult and dangerous to detect. That's where rats come in;  their high intelligence, speed and keen sense of smell make them adept at identifying explosives. They are also too light to trigger landmines.
    


            It's crucial work. An estimated 110 million landmines are still buried in over 60 countries around the world, said landmine detection nonprofit APOPO. In 2023, landmines caused 5,757 casualties globally — 37% of which involved children, according to the 2024 Landmine Monitor.



            Ronin is one of more than 100 rats trained by APOPO to detect the scent of the explosive chemicals and point landmines out to their handlers.
    


            The rats are highly versatile and have also been trained to detect tuberculosis in medical settings, helping to prevent the spread of infectious disease.
    


            The Belgian nonprofit's team of landmine-sniffing rats can search an area the size of a tennis court in 30 minutes – something that could take a deminer with a metal detector up to four days.
    


Ronin, who is 5 years old and was born in Tanzania, is much larger than your average pet rat. He is more than 2 feet long – about the length of a cat – and weighs 2.6 pounds, according to APOPO.
    


            Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, where Ronin was deployed has one of the highest landmine densities in the world following decades of conflict in the 20th century, including heavy bombing by the US during the Vietnam War.
    


            The US dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance – including cluster bombs and submunitions – in a four-year carpet-bombing campaign in Cambodia. Up to a quarter of the cluster bombs failed to explode, meaning they stayed active and dangerous but out of sight, according to a 2019 report by the US Congressional Research Service.
    


            Despite years of demining efforts, there are still an estimated 4 to 6 million unexploded landmines in Cambodia, according to APOPO.



            Ronin claims the world record from Magawa, another rat trained by APOPO who identified 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance during his five-years of service. Magawa passed peacefully in January 2022.

            Two U.S. border inspectors in Southern California have been charged with taking thousands of dollars in bribes to allow people to enter the country through the nation's busiest port of entry without showing documents, prosecutors said.
    


            U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were assigned to immigration inspection booths at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. They were charged after investigators found phone evidence showing they had exchanged messages with human traffickers in Mexico and discovered unexplained cash deposits into their bank accounts, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.
    


            Surveillance video showed at least one instance in which a vehicle with a driver and a passenger stopped at a checkpoint but only the driver was documented as having entered the country, prosecutors said.
    


            Prosecutors said the officers waved dozens of vehicles carrying people without documents. They said both men were paid thousands for each vehicle they waved through.
    


            It wasn't immediately known if Almonte has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.
    


            Rodriguez's attorney, Michael Hawkins, said the case was still in the “infant stages” and that Rodriguez has the presumption of innocence.
    


            “We look forward to working through the current situation,” Hawkins said in an email in which he described Rodriguez as hardworking and loyal.
    


            The investigation on Almonte and Rodriguez started after three migrant smugglers who were arrested last year told federal investigators they had been working with U.S. border inspectors, federal prosecutors said.
    


            While Almonte was in custody, investigators allegedly seized nearly $70,000 in cash they believe his romantic partner was trying to move to Tijuana. Prosecutors wrote in a court filing that Almonte is potentially facing additional charges for money laundering and obstruction of justice, The San Diego Union Tribune reported.
    


            “Any Customs and Border Protection agent who aids or turns a blind eye to smugglers bringing undocumented immigrants into the U.S. is betraying their oath and endangering our national security,” Acting U.S. Attorney Andrew Haden told the newspaper in a statement.
    


            There have been five U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers assigned to the San Diego area to face similar corruption charges in the last two years.
    


            Last year, former U.S. border inspector Leonard Darnell George was sentenced to 23 years in prison for taking bribes to allow people and drug-laden vehicles to enter the country through the San Ysidro border crossing. Two other former border officers at the Otay Mesa and Tecate ports of entry were charged last year with similar charges. They are expected to go on trial this summer.

London gallery's competition marks 200th anniversary and opening of Sainsbury Wing after two-year overhaul

As far as sleepovers go, it's a one of a kind: an overnight stay in a luxury bed in the middle of the National Gallery's exhibition rooms, dreaming under the world's greatest paintings.

Perhaps you'll be inspired by the venerated artworks to pick up a paintbrush, or you'll have a surreal experience like Ben Stiller in Night at the Museum, whose character – a night security guard – finds its exhibits come to life after sunset. You could even unearth a long-buried conspiracy, and find your discoveries adorning the pages of the next Dan Brown novel.

For the first time in its history, the National Gallery in London is offering an overnight stay to the lucky person who wins its new prize draw, which has been launched before its public reopening next month.

Marking the gallery's 200th anniversary, the competition will select the first member of the public to enter the gallery's Sainsbury Wing after its two-year closure and experience the biggest rehang of the entire collection, entitled CC Land: The Wonder of Art.

Anyone over 18 who subscribes to the National Gallery's newsletter will be entered into the draw to sleep in the bed, which will be on the “bridge” that connects the Sainsbury Wing with the rest of the gallery. The competition is open until 6pm on 28 April, and the winner will be randomly selected.

According to the gallery, the evening will start with a dinner for two at its soon-to-be-opened restaurant, Locatelli; then, once the gallery's doors are closed to the public, the winner will receive their own private tour of the exhibition with Christine Riding, National Gallery director of collections and research.

As they make their way through the gallery, they will see more than 1,000 works of art, which trace the development of painting in the western European tradition between the 13th and 20th centuries, from familiar masterpieces to paintings that have never been seen in the National Gallery.

“This is the first time that we have had such an exciting opportunity to rethink, and refresh, how we present one of the greatest art collections in the world, under one roof,” Riding said. “Our visitors will discover anew some of the most famous and iconic works of art ever created, alongside personal favourites and recent discoveries and acquisitions.”

The next morning, the winner will also receive a breakfast hamper before having the gallery to themselves to explore before the first public opening of the Sainsbury Wing at 10am on 10 May.

The National Gallery's rehang is its most extensive in years. The gallery's 200th anniversary celebrations this year also include the opening of a supporters' house, for members and other supporters, and a learning centre.

The National Gallery is no stranger to overnight events. In January, it opened its doors for 24 hours for the final weekend of its sellout Van Gogh exhibition, which was visited by more than 200,000 people. It was the second time in its history the gallery stayed open overnight (the first being for Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan in 2012).

Sir Gabriele Finaldi, the director of the National Gallery, said: “Our bicentenary provides the perfect opportunity to consider a new way to tell the story of the incredible paintings in our collection, and include some exciting surprises.

“So we feel it is fitting that through this prize draw one of our visitors should receive a first look at the newly transformed National Gallery and Sainsbury Wing and have these wonderful pictures to themselves for one special night.”

The Supreme Court on Monday lifted an order blocking President Donald Trump's administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th-century wartime law.

In a bitterly divided 5-4 decision, the court said that the migrants, whom the administration has accused of being gang members, must get a chance to challenge their deportation before they are taken out of the country.

But the conservative majority said the legal challenges must take place in Texas instead of a Washington courtroom and that the Trump administration must give them “reasonable time” to go to court.

U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration, U.S. officials said Monday.

Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force.

The officials said they believe Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made the decision last week, but it was unclear whether he received direction from Trump. Three U.S. officials spoke about the firing on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which sent a letter to Hegseth saying that “purging the woke from the military is imperative.”

Chatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since Trump took office. Trump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called “woke” policies are dead.

In dissent, the three liberal justices said the administration has sought to avoid judicial review in this case and the court “now rewards the government for its behavior.” Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined portions of the dissent.

The justices acted on the administration's emergency appeal after the federal appeals court in Washington left in place an order temporarily prohibiting deportations of the Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.

“For all the rhetoric of the dissents,” the court wrote in an unsigned opinion, the high court order confirms “that the detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”

Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The move follows Trump's order that troops be rehired and given back pay.

None of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they're sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged.

Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return.

“I am pleased to report that my long scheduled Annual Physical Examination will be done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Friday of this week,” Trump wrote Monday on social media. “I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!”

The exam isn't mandatory, but modern-day officeholders have them regularly and release a doctor's report to assure the public that they are fit for office.

Trump, who turns 79 on June 14, is the oldest person elected president.

In a bitterly divided 5-4 decision Monday, the court said the migrants still must get a chance to challenge their deportation before they are taken out of the country and said the Trump administration must give them “reasonable time” to go to court. 

But the conservative majority said the legal challenges must take place in Texas, instead of a Washington courtroom. 

The justices acted on the administration's emergency appeal after the federal appeals court in Washington left in place an order temporarily prohibiting deportations of the migrants accused of being gang members under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.

Shortly before he was forced to resign, the nation's top vaccine regulator says he refused to grant Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a tightly held vaccine safety database, fearing that the information might be manipulated or even deleted.

Former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks discussed his efforts to “make nice” with Kennedy and address his longstanding concerns about vaccine safety, including by developing a “vaccine transparency action plan.”

Marks agreed to give Kennedy's associates the ability to read thousands of reports of potential vaccine-related issues sent to the government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. But he would not allow them to directly edit the data.

“Why wouldn't we? Because frankly we don't trust (them),” he said, using a profanity. “They'd write over it or erase the whole database.”

U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also says he's assembling a task force to focus on the issue. He told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.

Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information” on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.

Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems.

Despite hopes that the U.S. will back off trade policies, President Donald Trump said he's not going to pause plans for tariffs. “We're not looking at that,” he said in the Oval Office. Trump also said foreign leaders were looking to cut new trade deals.



Liz Oyer testified at a congressional hearing one month after she said she was abruptly fired after refusing a request to recommend that the gun rights of actor Mel Gibson, a friend of Trump's, be restored.

Oyer accused Trump's Justice Department leadership of valuing “political loyalty above the fair and responsible administration of justice” and “treating public servants with a lack of basic decency and humanity.”

The Justice Department had attempted to use executive privilege to prevent Oyer from testifying about the circumstances of her departure. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has denied Oyer's account.

A Justice Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her testimony Monday.

Hey, Dylan. Thanks for your question. Trump has argued that tariffs will protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign competition and raise money for the federal government. But since so much of what we buy today relies on a global supply chain, steeper tariffs mean you'll likely see more expensive prices from the grocery aisle to your next car repair.

AP reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips and Cora Lewis reported on how you should expect tariffs to impact you. Here's some of what they wrote:

The timing of when prices will go up comes down to inventory, said Josh Stillwagon, an associate professor of economics and chair of the Economics Division at Babson College. Much of that will also depend on how businesses prepare and respond to the new levies. While companies may have stocked up on goods in anticipation of these tariffs, he expects some stores to see more immediate price increases.

Prices on perishable groceries will likely increase first because supermarket inventories need to be replenished more frequently. But a range of other items — like electronics, household appliances, clothing and footwear — could also be affected in the coming weeks and months.

“Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are estimated to be $980 under the April 2 policy alone,” according to John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecom and fraud at the National Consumers League, who cited an analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale. He said that tariffs will disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with apparel prices predicted to rise 17%.

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents U.S. diplomats, and the American Academy of Diplomacy said last week's appointment of Lew Olowski to temporarily run the State Department's personnel office is an affront to the long-held standard that the post be occupied by either a current senior or retired career diplomat.

Olowski joined the foreign service in 2021.

State Department officials said last week that Olowski's appointment, while untraditional, was not a harbinger of mass layoffs. They said he would only be in the job for a short time until a permanent successor can be nominated and confirmed by the Senate.

Trump and Netanyahu have wrapped up comments to the media ahead of their Oval Office meeting.The two leaders spoke and took questions from reporters on topics including Iran, tariffs and the war between Israel and Hamas for about 50 minutes Monday.

They earlier scrapped their plan for a joint news conference to be held after their meeting.

The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. on Monday responded to Trump's freshest tariff threat by repeating its long-stated stance, in a clear sign that Beijing is unlikely to back down. 

“We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,” said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesperson. “China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” 

The embassy called attention to Beijing's latest position statement, in which the Chinese government not only condemns the tariffs imposed by the U.S. but also calls upon all countries to “practice true multilateralism, jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and defend the U.N.-centered international system and the WTO-centered multilateral trading system.”

Netanyahu proclaimed at the White House that Israel would work to eliminate the trade deficit with the U.S. and do so quickly.

But that might not be enough for Trump to change his mind on the 17% tariffs the U.S. imposed on Israel last week.

“Maybe not,” Trump said when asked whether he would reduce the tariffs on Israeli goods. Referring to the billions in aid that the U.S. offers every year, Trump added: “Don't forget, we help Israel a lot.”

Trump made the threat in an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which he also announced that direct talks between Iran and the United States would begin this weekend. 

“I think Iran is going to be in great danger” if the talks collapse, Trump said. “And I hate to say it.”

Trump did not disclose the venue for the meetings to begin on Saturday or say who from his administration would participate.

“We're dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made,” Trump said. He added that “doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.”

Trump said the talks would happen “at almost the highest level.”

The French and Mideast leaders spoke to Trump on Monday about ways to urgently secure a ceasefire in Gaza, stressing the need to resume access for aid supplies, according to the French president's office. 

The three leaders — France's Emmanuel Macron, Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and King Abdullah II of Jordan — decided to keep in close contact with Trump, Macron's office said.

The phone call took place ahead of Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday.

Macron is in Egypt and will visit security forces and aid workers Tuesday. Earlier Monday he urged the lifting of Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Chief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The Justice Department argued in an emergency appeal to the justices that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.

The administration has conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.

But he is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.

The lawsuit filed Monday aims to stop the government from freezing federal money in the wake of a dispute over transgender athletes in sports.

Trump and Maine, which is controlled by Democrats, are in the midst of a weekslong dispute about the Title IX anti-discrimination law and the participation of transgender students in high school sports. 

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture was pausing some funds for Maine educational programs because of what she described as Maine's failure to comply with the law.

Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint in federal court on Monday that described the pause as “illegally withholding grant funds that go to keeping children fed.”

Despite hopes that he'll back off his trade policies, the president said he's not going to pause plans for tariffs.

“We're not looking at that,” he said in the Oval Office. However, he also said foreign leaders were looking to cut new trade deals with the U.S.

“We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate with us,” he said.

Trump said there was no contradiction between implementing tariffs and holding talks."They can both be true,” he said.

Trump made the comments to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 

He said the talks with Tehran would start Saturday but insisted Tehran can't get nuclear weapons.

Netanyahu vowed to eliminate the trade deficit with the United States after Israel was hit by 17% tariffs by Trump last week.

As he met with Trump in the Oval Office, the prime minister said Israel will work to eliminate the trade deficit “very quickly” and added that Israel will also work to eliminate trade barriers with the U.S.

“Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,” Netanyahu said. He added: “I'm a free trade champion, and free trade has to be fair trade.”

Netanyahu said he and Trump discussed ongoing efforts to get hostages released from Gaza and said they are working on another deal to release hostages “that we hope will succeed.”

The Israeli leader said that they're committed to getting all of the hostages released and eliminating Hamas from Gaza.

He said he also spoke to Trump about the U.S. president's plan to move displaced Palestinians from Gaza while it's redeveloped, which Netanyahu called a “bold” vision.

Hey, Brian. Thanks for this question. You're right. The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility of setting taxes and tariffs, but over the last century, lawmakers have ceded much of their power over import taxes to the president.

AP reporter Stephen Groves wrote about how Republicans in Congress are reacting to Trump's tariffs. Here's some of his reporting:

A handful of Republicans have rebuked Trump's strategy as a foolhardy path that will burden U.S. households, but lawmakers' struggle to act shows the divide among Republicans on trade policy, with a mostly younger group of Republicans fiercely backing Trump's strategy.

Other Republicans were looking for roundabout ways to check the president's power on trade policy. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican from Iowa, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire.

Although Grassley emphasized that he had long been working on the idea, the timing of the bill was notable. It gave Republicans a chance to talk about their distaste for import taxes and raised the prospect of Congress clawing back some of its power over tariffs.

A handful of Republicans said they were favorable to Grassley's proposal, though the idea of directly defying Trump seemed to squelch potential for quick action.

Johnson said House Republicans are intent on giving President Trump more time to change the country's trade imbalances with other nations.

Johnson was asked about giving Congress a chance to weigh in on the recent tariffs increases Trump has announced. The Senate, for example, passed a resolution last week that would thwart Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada.

But Johnson said the country had a $1.2 trillion trade deficit in goods last year, and Americans understand Trump is trying to address that.

“We are going to give him the space necessary to do it,” Johnson said.

The White House released a statement to congressional offices saying the bill, which is being spearheaded by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., would “severely constrain” the president's ability to use tariffs “to respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.”

The statement was a setback for a bipartisan bill that was already unlikely to advance quickly, but Republican support for the legislation also showed that GOP lawmakers are uneasy with Trump's sweeping tariffs. Seven Republican senators are cosponsoring the bill.

The confusion — which was amplified on social media and by some traditional media outlets — lasted less than a half hour but reflected a jittery mood on Wall Street as stocks plunged over worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy.

The origin of the false report was unclear but it appeared to be a misinterpretation of comments made by Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, during a Fox News interview Monday morning. Asked whether Trump would consider a 90-day tariff pause suggested by a prominent hedge fund manager, Hassett said “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.”

Nearly two hours later, multiple user accounts on social media platform X posted identical messages claiming Hassett said Trump is considering a pause for all countries except China.

The White House initially appeared as confused as everyone else. But after 20 minutes, a government account rejected the report as “fake news.”

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he held telephone talks on Monday with President Donald Trump and told him he is “strongly concerned” that U.S. tariffs would discourage investment from Japan, which has been the world's biggest investor in the United States in the past five years.

“Shigeru Ishiba

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in a 25 minute call with Trump on Monday raised concerns that the tariffs by the U.S. could weaken investment capacity among Japanese companies.

“The recent tariff measures by the United States are extremely regrettable,” Ishiba told reporters following the call. “I told the president that Japan has been the world's largest investor in the U.S. for five consecutive years, and I also strongly expressed concern that the U.S. tariffs will reduce the investment capacity of Japanese companies.”

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says it's ending a half-century of partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision follows the Trump administration's abrupt halt to funding for refugee resettlement.

The break will inevitably result in fewer services than what Catholic agencies were able to offer in the past to the needy, the bishops said.

“As a national effort, we simply cannot sustain the work on our own at current levels or in current form,” said Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the USCCB. “We will work to identify alternative means of support for the people the federal government has already admitted to these programs. We ask your prayers for the many staff and refugees impacted.”

The decision means the bishops won't be renewing existing agreements with the federal government, the bishops said. The announcement didn't say how long current agreements were scheduled to last.

Beijing has issued several strongly-worded rebukes to Trump's tariffs, including one entirely in the words of late-President Ronald Reagan.

“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” the Republican president said in a video clip dated 1987, as posted on the X social media site Monday by the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. The embassy wrote that the decades-old speech “finds new relevance in 2025.”

“The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trader barriers, and less and less competition,” Reagan said in the speech, in which he warned of the worst from tariff wars: markets should collapse, businesses shut down, and millions of people lose jobs.

Trump greeted the Israeli prime minister with a firm handshake as he arrived for talks.

Trump ignored shouted questions from reporters about the tumbling global markets and whether he would lift tariffs on Israel.

Love's sister Cyndi Brito shared childhood memories, including how Love used to rehearse all day and night for starring roles in her school plays.

“Sis, we will always, always look up to you,” Brito said. “Keep being the best.”

The former lawmaker had undergone treatment for an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma. She died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, weeks after her daughter announced she was no longer responding to treatment.

Love, born Ludmya Bourdeau, represented Utah on Capitol Hill from 2015 to 2019.

The White House did not offer any immediate explanation for why the news conference was canceled, but Trump and Netanyahu were expected to make comments to reporters at the start of their scheduled Oval Office meeting.

President Trump threatened to raise the tariffs if Beijing doesn't withdraw its retaliatory tariffs.

“At this point, it is extremely unlikely for China to back down,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, adding any leadership summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping “doesn't appear likely in the near future.”

“China is increasingly convinced that the tariff is not negotiable because Trump's eventual goal is to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.,” Sun said.

Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at another Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called Trump's threat Monday “a blunt ultimatum to Beijing that sharply raises the takes in the U.S.-China tariff war.” He said Beijing's rigid system and fear of looking weak prevent Xi from opening back channels with the Trump administration that could offer relief.

A member of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has terminated some of the last remaining life-saving programs for refugees and others in the Middle East, two U.S. and U.N. officials tell The Associated Press.

The AP viewed some of the new contract termination notices, sent late last week by Jeremy Lewin, a DOGE associate now overseeing the dismantling of USAID. A USAID official and an official with the U.N. spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak.

The move severs U.S. funding for some key projects by the World Food Program, the world's largest provider of food aid. Another notice viewed by the AP terminated funding for sending Afghan women overseas for education. An administrator for the program, which is a project of Texas A & M University, said the women would now face return to Afghanistan, where their lives may be in danger from the Taliban. That administrator also spoke on condition of anonymity because that person wasn't authorized to speak.

The Monday visit was to congratulate the baseball team for winning the World Series last season.

Trump singled out several Los Angeles Dodgers for their achievements last season, praising Ohtani for becoming baseball's first 50/50 player, Japanese pitcher Yoshi Yamamoto and NL Championship Series MVP Tommy Edman.

Trump praised Betts for his play — and took a dig at the Boston Red Sox for trading him to the Dodgers — and they shook hands at the ceremony.

Trump also boasted that egg prices have dropped “73%” on his watch and he refused to introduce some senators at the ceremony, because “I just don't particularly like them, so I won't introduce (them).”

Trump campaigned last year in opposition of the deal, saying a Japanese company's acquisition of the company would hurt American manufacturing. But shortly after becoming president, Trump said he'd reached an agreement for Nippon Steel to instead invest in U.S. Steel without providing details.

The directive signed Monday by Trump would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, 45 days to review the proposed purchase.

It raises fresh concerns that Trump's drive to rebalance the global economy could lead to a trade war.

The threat, which Trump delivered Monday on social media, came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs announced last week.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”

Trump has remained defiant as the stock market continued plunging and fears of a recession grew.

The Trump administration has notified the World Food Program and other partners that it's terminated some of the last remaining lifesaving humanitarian programs across the Middle East, a U.S. and U.N. official told The Associated Press.

An official with USAID says about 60 letters canceling contracts were sent over the past week, including to the World Food Program.

An official with the United Nations says WFP received termination letters for Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.

The USAID official says U.S. funding for key programs in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe also were affected, including those providing food, water, medical care and shelter for people displaced by war.

The Justice Department argued in an emergency appeal to the justices that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.

Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.

Xinis gave the administration until just before midnight Tuesday to “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia's return.

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, denied the administration's request for a stay.

Wilmer Escaray left Venezuela in 2007 and enrolled at Miami Dade College, opening his first restaurant six years later.

Today, he has a dozen businesses that hire Venezuelan migrants like he once was, workers who are now terrified by what could be the end of their legal shield from deportation.

Since the start of February, the Trump administration has ended two federal programs that together allowed more 700,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the U.S. along with hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

In the largest Venezuelan community in the United States, people dread what could face them if lawsuits that aim to stop the government fail. It's all anyone discusses in “Little Venezuela” or “Doralzuela,” a city of 80,000 people surrounded by Miami sprawl, freeways and the Florida Everglades.

The Monday meeting will make Netanyahu the first foreign leader to visit Trump since he unleashed tariffs on countries around the world.

Whether Netanyahu's visit succeeds in bringing down or eliminating Israel's tariffs remains to be seen, but how it plays out could set the stage for how other world leaders try to address the new tariffs.

Netanyahu's office has put the focus of his hastily organized Washington visit on the tariffs, while stressing that the two leaders will discuss major geopolitical issues including the war in Gaza, tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.

Paul Gigot interviews John Yoo

The Supreme Court on Monday granted President Donald Trump's request to vacate a lower court's ruling barring the administration from using a 1798 wartime immigration law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals – including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang – from the U.S., marking a significant victory for the administration as it advances key immigration priorities.

Justices on the high court ruled 5-4 to grant the administration's request to lift the stay, in a temporary victory for Trump and his allies.

At issue was the Alien Enemies Act, or the immigration law passed by Congress in 1789 to immediately remove certain migrants from U.S. soil. 

Prior to Trump's second White House term, it had been invoked just three times in U.S. history: During the War of 1812, during World War I, and most recently, World War II. 

Lawyers for the Trump administration had urged the court to vacate the lower court ruling, arguing in a Supreme Court filing that the lower court orders "rebuffed" their immigration agenda, including their ability "to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations."

The ruling follows a temporary order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg last month blocking the administration's use of the 1798 law for 14 days while he considered the case on its merits – a pause upheld by a federal appeals court in a 2–1 decision.

"Nazis got better treatment" than some of the migrants deported under the law, Judge Patricia Millett, an Obama appointee, remarked during the appellate hearing.

Both Boasberg and the appellate panel sharply questioned the administration over Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals – and over the three planes that removed hundreds of migrants to El Salvador the very next day.

At least 261 migrants were deported that day, including more than 100 Venezuelans removed "solely on the basis" of the 1798 statute.

The deportation flights reportedly landed around the same time Boasberg issued his temporary halt, raising questions about whether administration officials knowingly defied the order. Boasberg had issued a bench ruling requiring any flights that had already taken off to return "immediately."

That did not happen.

Boasberg said on April 3 that he was weighing whether to hold certain Trump administration officials in contempt of court for refusing to provide information, even after the court issued repeated requests regarding the deportation flights and the number of individuals sent to El Salvador.

Government lawyers cited national security concerns as the reason for refusing to comply with the court's request for information.

But during the April 3 hearing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign told Boasberg the flight information likely wasn't classified — prompting the judge to question why the administration had declined to provide it on more than four occasions, including under a court-imposed deadline.

"Pretty sketchy," Boasberg mused in court.

Boasberg also pressed the government to disclose the names, locations, and agencies of individuals involved in the removals, as well as any internal conversations with officials who may have been monitoring the court proceedings.

The hearing marked the latest in a flurry of legal battles over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. It followed Boasberg's order requiring officials to explain why they failed to comply with his directive to return the deportation flights – and whether they knowingly defied the court.

The Supreme Court ruling may not mark the end of Trump's push to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.

Boasberg is still weighing potential contempt charges against administration officials. As of this writing, a preliminary injunction hearing is set for April 8.

The Supreme Court on Monday lifted an order blocking President Donald Trump's administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th-century wartime law.

In a bitterly divided 5-4 decision, the court said that the migrants, whom the administration has accused of being gang members, must get a chance to challenge their deportation before they are taken out of the country.

But the conservative majority said the legal challenges must take place in Texas instead of a Washington courtroom and that the Trump administration must give them “reasonable time” to go to court.

Other news we're following:



Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The move follows Trump's order that troops be rehired and given back pay.

None of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they're sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged.

Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return.

“I am pleased to report that my long scheduled Annual Physical Examination will be done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Friday of this week,” Trump wrote Monday on social media. “I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!”

The exam isn't mandatory, but modern-day officeholders have them regularly and release a doctor's report to assure the public that they are fit for office.

Trump, who turns 79 on June 14, is the oldest person elected president.

In a bitterly divided 5-4 decision Monday, the court said the migrants still must get a chance to challenge their deportation before they are taken out of the country and said the Trump administration must give them “reasonable time” to go to court. 

But the conservative majority said the legal challenges must take place in Texas, instead of a Washington courtroom. 

The justices acted on the administration's emergency appeal after the federal appeals court in Washington left in place an order temporarily prohibiting deportations of the migrants accused of being gang members under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act.

Shortly before he was forced to resign, the nation's top vaccine regulator says he refused to grant Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a tightly held vaccine safety database, fearing that the information might be manipulated or even deleted.

Former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks discussed his efforts to “make nice” with Kennedy and address his longstanding concerns about vaccine safety, including by developing a “vaccine transparency action plan.”

Marks agreed to give Kennedy's associates the ability to read thousands of reports of potential vaccine-related issues sent to the government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. But he would not allow them to directly edit the data.

“Why wouldn't we? Because frankly we don't trust (them),” he said, using a profanity. “They'd write over it or erase the whole database.”

U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also says he's assembling a task force to focus on the issue. He told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.

Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information” on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.

Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems.

Despite hopes that the U.S. will back off trade policies, President Donald Trump said he's not going to pause plans for tariffs. “We're not looking at that,” he said in the Oval Office. Trump also said foreign leaders were looking to cut new trade deals.



Liz Oyer testified at a congressional hearing one month after she said she was abruptly fired after refusing a request to recommend that the gun rights of actor Mel Gibson, a friend of Trump's, be restored.

Oyer accused Trump's Justice Department leadership of valuing “political loyalty above the fair and responsible administration of justice” and “treating public servants with a lack of basic decency and humanity.”

The Justice Department had attempted to use executive privilege to prevent Oyer from testifying about the circumstances of her departure. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has denied Oyer's account.

A Justice Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on her testimony Monday.

Hey, Dylan. Thanks for your question. Trump has argued that tariffs will protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign competition and raise money for the federal government. But since so much of what we buy today relies on a global supply chain, steeper tariffs mean you'll likely see more expensive prices from the grocery aisle to your next car repair.

AP reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips and Cora Lewis reported on how you should expect tariffs to impact you. Here's some of what they wrote:

The timing of when prices will go up comes down to inventory, said Josh Stillwagon, an associate professor of economics and chair of the Economics Division at Babson College. Much of that will also depend on how businesses prepare and respond to the new levies. While companies may have stocked up on goods in anticipation of these tariffs, he expects some stores to see more immediate price increases.

Prices on perishable groceries will likely increase first because supermarket inventories need to be replenished more frequently. But a range of other items — like electronics, household appliances, clothing and footwear — could also be affected in the coming weeks and months.

“Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are estimated to be $980 under the April 2 policy alone,” according to John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecom and fraud at the National Consumers League, who cited an analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale. He said that tariffs will disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with apparel prices predicted to rise 17%.

The American Foreign Service Association, which represents U.S. diplomats, and the American Academy of Diplomacy said last week's appointment of Lew Olowski to temporarily run the State Department's personnel office is an affront to the long-held standard that the post be occupied by either a current senior or retired career diplomat.

Olowski joined the foreign service in 2021.

State Department officials said last week that Olowski's appointment, while untraditional, was not a harbinger of mass layoffs. They said he would only be in the job for a short time until a permanent successor can be nominated and confirmed by the Senate.

Trump and Netanyahu have wrapped up comments to the media ahead of their Oval Office meeting.The two leaders spoke and took questions from reporters on topics including Iran, tariffs and the war between Israel and Hamas for about 50 minutes Monday.

They earlier scrapped their plan for a joint news conference to be held after their meeting.

The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. on Monday responded to Trump's freshest tariff threat by repeating its long-stated stance, in a clear sign that Beijing is unlikely to back down. 

“We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,” said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesperson. “China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” 

The embassy called attention to Beijing's latest position statement, in which the Chinese government not only condemns the tariffs imposed by the U.S. but also calls upon all countries to “practice true multilateralism, jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and defend the U.N.-centered international system and the WTO-centered multilateral trading system.”

Netanyahu proclaimed at the White House that Israel would work to eliminate the trade deficit with the U.S. and do so quickly.

But that might not be enough for Trump to change his mind on the 17% tariffs the U.S. imposed on Israel last week.

“Maybe not,” Trump said when asked whether he would reduce the tariffs on Israeli goods. Referring to the billions in aid that the U.S. offers every year, Trump added: “Don't forget, we help Israel a lot.”

Trump made the threat in an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which he also announced that direct talks between Iran and the United States would begin this weekend. 

“I think Iran is going to be in great danger” if the talks collapse, Trump said. “And I hate to say it.”

Trump did not disclose the venue for the meetings to begin on Saturday or say who from his administration would participate.

“We're dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made,” Trump said. He added that “doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.”

Trump said the talks would happen “at almost the highest level.”

The French and Mideast leaders spoke to Trump on Monday about ways to urgently secure a ceasefire in Gaza, stressing the need to resume access for aid supplies, according to the French president's office. 

The three leaders — France's Emmanuel Macron, Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and King Abdullah II of Jordan — decided to keep in close contact with Trump, Macron's office said.

The phone call took place ahead of Trump's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday.

Macron is in Egypt and will visit security forces and aid workers Tuesday. Earlier Monday he urged the lifting of Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Chief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The Justice Department argued in an emergency appeal to the justices that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.

The administration has conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.

But he is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.

The lawsuit filed Monday aims to stop the government from freezing federal money in the wake of a dispute over transgender athletes in sports.

Trump and Maine, which is controlled by Democrats, are in the midst of a weekslong dispute about the Title IX anti-discrimination law and the participation of transgender students in high school sports. 

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture was pausing some funds for Maine educational programs because of what she described as Maine's failure to comply with the law.

Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint in federal court on Monday that described the pause as “illegally withholding grant funds that go to keeping children fed.”

Despite hopes that he'll back off his trade policies, the president said he's not going to pause plans for tariffs.

“We're not looking at that,” he said in the Oval Office. However, he also said foreign leaders were looking to cut new trade deals with the U.S.

“We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate with us,” he said.

Trump said there was no contradiction between implementing tariffs and holding talks."They can both be true,” he said.

Trump made the comments to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 

He said the talks with Tehran would start Saturday but insisted Tehran can't get nuclear weapons.

Netanyahu vowed to eliminate the trade deficit with the United States after Israel was hit by 17% tariffs by Trump last week.

As he met with Trump in the Oval Office, the prime minister said Israel will work to eliminate the trade deficit “very quickly” and added that Israel will also work to eliminate trade barriers with the U.S.

“Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,” Netanyahu said. He added: “I'm a free trade champion, and free trade has to be fair trade.”

Netanyahu said he and Trump discussed ongoing efforts to get hostages released from Gaza and said they are working on another deal to release hostages “that we hope will succeed.”

The Israeli leader said that they're committed to getting all of the hostages released and eliminating Hamas from Gaza.

He said he also spoke to Trump about the U.S. president's plan to move displaced Palestinians from Gaza while it's redeveloped, which Netanyahu called a “bold” vision.

Hey, Brian. Thanks for this question. You're right. The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility of setting taxes and tariffs, but over the last century, lawmakers have ceded much of their power over import taxes to the president.

AP reporter Stephen Groves wrote about how Republicans in Congress are reacting to Trump's tariffs. Here's some of his reporting:

A handful of Republicans have rebuked Trump's strategy as a foolhardy path that will burden U.S. households, but lawmakers' struggle to act shows the divide among Republicans on trade policy, with a mostly younger group of Republicans fiercely backing Trump's strategy.

Other Republicans were looking for roundabout ways to check the president's power on trade policy. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican from Iowa, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire.

Although Grassley emphasized that he had long been working on the idea, the timing of the bill was notable. It gave Republicans a chance to talk about their distaste for import taxes and raised the prospect of Congress clawing back some of its power over tariffs.

A handful of Republicans said they were favorable to Grassley's proposal, though the idea of directly defying Trump seemed to squelch potential for quick action.

Johnson said House Republicans are intent on giving President Trump more time to change the country's trade imbalances with other nations.

Johnson was asked about giving Congress a chance to weigh in on the recent tariffs increases Trump has announced. The Senate, for example, passed a resolution last week that would thwart Trump's ability to impose tariffs on Canada.

But Johnson said the country had a $1.2 trillion trade deficit in goods last year, and Americans understand Trump is trying to address that.

“We are going to give him the space necessary to do it,” Johnson said.

The White House released a statement to congressional offices saying the bill, which is being spearheaded by Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., would “severely constrain” the president's ability to use tariffs “to respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.”

The statement was a setback for a bipartisan bill that was already unlikely to advance quickly, but Republican support for the legislation also showed that GOP lawmakers are uneasy with Trump's sweeping tariffs. Seven Republican senators are cosponsoring the bill.

The confusion — which was amplified on social media and by some traditional media outlets — lasted less than a half hour but reflected a jittery mood on Wall Street as stocks plunged over worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy.

The origin of the false report was unclear but it appeared to be a misinterpretation of comments made by Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, during a Fox News interview Monday morning. Asked whether Trump would consider a 90-day tariff pause suggested by a prominent hedge fund manager, Hassett said “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.”

Nearly two hours later, multiple user accounts on social media platform X posted identical messages claiming Hassett said Trump is considering a pause for all countries except China.

The White House initially appeared as confused as everyone else. But after 20 minutes, a government account rejected the report as “fake news.”

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he held telephone talks on Monday with President Donald Trump and told him he is “strongly concerned” that U.S. tariffs would discourage investment from Japan, which has been the world's biggest investor in the United States in the past five years.

“Shigeru Ishiba

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in a 25 minute call with Trump on Monday raised concerns that the tariffs by the U.S. could weaken investment capacity among Japanese companies.

“The recent tariff measures by the United States are extremely regrettable,” Ishiba told reporters following the call. “I told the president that Japan has been the world's largest investor in the U.S. for five consecutive years, and I also strongly expressed concern that the U.S. tariffs will reduce the investment capacity of Japanese companies.”

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says it's ending a half-century of partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision follows the Trump administration's abrupt halt to funding for refugee resettlement.

The break will inevitably result in fewer services than what Catholic agencies were able to offer in the past to the needy, the bishops said.

“As a national effort, we simply cannot sustain the work on our own at current levels or in current form,” said Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the USCCB. “We will work to identify alternative means of support for the people the federal government has already admitted to these programs. We ask your prayers for the many staff and refugees impacted.”

The decision means the bishops won't be renewing existing agreements with the federal government, the bishops said. The announcement didn't say how long current agreements were scheduled to last.

Beijing has issued several strongly-worded rebukes to Trump's tariffs, including one entirely in the words of late-President Ronald Reagan.

“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” the Republican president said in a video clip dated 1987, as posted on the X social media site Monday by the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. The embassy wrote that the decades-old speech “finds new relevance in 2025.”

“The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trader barriers, and less and less competition,” Reagan said in the speech, in which he warned of the worst from tariff wars: markets should collapse, businesses shut down, and millions of people lose jobs.

Trump greeted the Israeli prime minister with a firm handshake as he arrived for talks.

Trump ignored shouted questions from reporters about the tumbling global markets and whether he would lift tariffs on Israel.

Love's sister Cyndi Brito shared childhood memories, including how Love used to rehearse all day and night for starring roles in her school plays.

“Sis, we will always, always look up to you,” Brito said. “Keep being the best.”

The former lawmaker had undergone treatment for an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma. She died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, weeks after her daughter announced she was no longer responding to treatment.

Love, born Ludmya Bourdeau, represented Utah on Capitol Hill from 2015 to 2019.

The White House did not offer any immediate explanation for why the news conference was canceled, but Trump and Netanyahu were expected to make comments to reporters at the start of their scheduled Oval Office meeting.

President Trump threatened to raise the tariffs if Beijing doesn't withdraw its retaliatory tariffs.

“At this point, it is extremely unlikely for China to back down,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, adding any leadership summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping “doesn't appear likely in the near future.”

“China is increasingly convinced that the tariff is not negotiable because Trump's eventual goal is to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.,” Sun said.

Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at another Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called Trump's threat Monday “a blunt ultimatum to Beijing that sharply raises the takes in the U.S.-China tariff war.” He said Beijing's rigid system and fear of looking weak prevent Xi from opening back channels with the Trump administration that could offer relief.

A member of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has terminated some of the last remaining life-saving programs for refugees and others in the Middle East, two U.S. and U.N. officials tell The Associated Press.

The AP viewed some of the new contract termination notices, sent late last week by Jeremy Lewin, a DOGE associate now overseeing the dismantling of USAID. A USAID official and an official with the U.N. spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak.

The move severs U.S. funding for some key projects by the World Food Program, the world's largest provider of food aid. Another notice viewed by the AP terminated funding for sending Afghan women overseas for education. An administrator for the program, which is a project of Texas A & M University, said the women would now face return to Afghanistan, where their lives may be in danger from the Taliban. That administrator also spoke on condition of anonymity because that person wasn't authorized to speak.

The Monday visit was to congratulate the baseball team for winning the World Series last season.

Trump singled out several Los Angeles Dodgers for their achievements last season, praising Ohtani for becoming baseball's first 50/50 player, Japanese pitcher Yoshi Yamamoto and NL Championship Series MVP Tommy Edman.

Trump praised Betts for his play — and took a dig at the Boston Red Sox for trading him to the Dodgers — and they shook hands at the ceremony.

Trump also boasted that egg prices have dropped “73%” on his watch and he refused to introduce some senators at the ceremony, because “I just don't particularly like them, so I won't introduce (them).”

Trump campaigned last year in opposition of the deal, saying a Japanese company's acquisition of the company would hurt American manufacturing. But shortly after becoming president, Trump said he'd reached an agreement for Nippon Steel to instead invest in U.S. Steel without providing details.

The directive signed Monday by Trump would give the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, 45 days to review the proposed purchase.

It raises fresh concerns that Trump's drive to rebalance the global economy could lead to a trade war.

The threat, which Trump delivered Monday on social media, came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs announced last week.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”

Trump has remained defiant as the stock market continued plunging and fears of a recession grew.

The Trump administration has notified the World Food Program and other partners that it's terminated some of the last remaining lifesaving humanitarian programs across the Middle East, a U.S. and U.N. official told The Associated Press.

An official with USAID says about 60 letters canceling contracts were sent over the past week, including to the World Food Program.

An official with the United Nations says WFP received termination letters for Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.

The USAID official says U.S. funding for key programs in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe also were affected, including those providing food, water, medical care and shelter for people displaced by war.

The Justice Department argued in an emergency appeal to the justices that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.

Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.

Xinis gave the administration until just before midnight Tuesday to “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia's return.

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, denied the administration's request for a stay.

Wilmer Escaray left Venezuela in 2007 and enrolled at Miami Dade College, opening his first restaurant six years later.

Today, he has a dozen businesses that hire Venezuelan migrants like he once was, workers who are now terrified by what could be the end of their legal shield from deportation.

Since the start of February, the Trump administration has ended two federal programs that together allowed more 700,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the U.S. along with hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

In the largest Venezuelan community in the United States, people dread what could face them if lawsuits that aim to stop the government fail. It's all anyone discusses in “Little Venezuela” or “Doralzuela,” a city of 80,000 people surrounded by Miami sprawl, freeways and the Florida Everglades.

The Monday meeting will make Netanyahu the first foreign leader to visit Trump since he unleashed tariffs on countries around the world.

Whether Netanyahu's visit succeeds in bringing down or eliminating Israel's tariffs remains to be seen, but how it plays out could set the stage for how other world leaders try to address the new tariffs.

Netanyahu's office has put the focus of his hastily organized Washington visit on the tariffs, while stressing that the two leaders will discuss major geopolitical issues including the war in Gaza, tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.

The stock market briefly spiked on a report that Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic adviser, said the president was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs.

The supposed remark from Hassett circulated on social media, but no one could pinpoint where it came from even as the market flashed from red to green.

Hassett had spoken to Fox News earlier in the morning, when he was asked about a potential pause. However, he was noncommittal.

“I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,” he said.

Secretary of State Rubio said the threat posed by active war in Europe means NATO nations including the U.S. must establish a "pathway" to spending 5% of their GDP on defense.

The Senate voted Monday to invoke cloture on Elbridge Colby's nomination, moving the national security strategist one step closer to confirmation as undersecretary of defense for policy, the Pentagon's No. 3 post. 

The procedural vote, which limits debate and tees up a final confirmation vote, passed by a margin of 53 to 49. Colby's nomination advanced out of the Armed Services Committee last month, overcoming skepticism from hawkish Republicans like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., during a closed-door vote.

Three Democrats broke with their party and voted in favor of Colby: Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Jack Reed, R.I., the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.

Colby, a co-founder of the Marathon Initiative and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development under the Trump administration, is best known for his role in authoring the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which reoriented long-term military strategy toward a great power competition with China. 

He has long argued the U.S. military needs to limit its resources in the Middle East in a pivot to the Indo-Pacific region. 

Colby has scored staunch backing from a number of figures in Trump world, increasing the pressure on GOP skeptics to get on board with his nomination. 

VANCE VISITS CAPITOL HILL TO URGE SENATORS TO CONFIRM ELBRIDGE COLBY FOR PENTAGON NO. 3 POST

US Vice President JD Vance went to Capitol Hill to urge senators to vote for Colby  (Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images)

Vice President J.D. Vance paid a visit to Capitol Hill last month to offer support for his "friend" Colby. 

"In so many ways, Bridge predicted what we would be talking about four years down the road, five years down the road, 10 years down the road. He saw around corners that very few other people were seeing around," Vance said at the time. 

"If you look at his long career in defense policy, he has said things that, you know, frankly, alienated Democrats and Republicans. He's also said things that I think both Democrats and Republicans would agree with." 

During the hearing, Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., questioned Colby on his previously stated position, "America has a strong interest in defending Taiwan, but Americans can survive without it." 

"Your views on Taiwan's importance to the United States seems to have softened considerably," Wicker told Colby. 

Colby disputed that point, arguing he had been sounding the alarm that the U.S.' "military balance has declined" in relation to China.

"What I have been trying to shoot a signal flare over is that it is vital for us to focus and enable our own forces for an effective and reasonable defense of Taiwan and for the Taiwanese, as well as the Japanese, to do more," said Colby.  

When pressed by Cotton during the hearing, Colby said he believes Iran to be an "existential" threat to the U.S. 

"Yes, a nuclear-armed Iran – especially, Senator, given that … we know they've worked on ICBM-range capabilities and other capabilities that would pose an existential danger to the United States," Colby said.

He promised to provide "credible good military options" to the president if diplomacy with Iran fails. 

It was a different tune than he'd sung in years past.

"The only thing worse than the prospect of an Iran armed with nuclear weapons would be consequences of using force to try to stop them," Colby had said in 2012. 

"I would say a lot of what I was arguing against at the time, these conversations 15 years ago, a lot of the opponents I felt had a casual or in some cases even flippant attitude towards the employment of military force," Colby said. "That's a lot of what I was arguing against. Was my wording always appropriate, was my precise framing always appropriate? No."

Despite hopes that the U.S. will back off trade policies, President Donald Trump said he's not going to pause plans for tariffs. “We're not looking at that,” he said in the Oval Office. Trump also said foreign leaders were looking to cut new trade deals.

U.S. stocks fell again Monday after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariffs, despite seeing how much Wall Street wants him to do the opposite.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Undeterred by a panicked stock market, President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on China on Monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. 

Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!”

The U.S. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. His commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though Trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs.

Asked Monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, Trump said, “We're not looking at that.” The U.S. president said he was open to negotiations “if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the United States.” Trump added that it's possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs.

Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against U.S. goods to zero, Trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. The White House also said Monday that Trump would veto a Senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of Republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks.







However, there are signs of frustration even among Trump's allies. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he supports the president's goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty.

“We don't know if the medicine will be worse than the disease,” Kennedy said, adding, “This is President Trump's economy now.”

If Trump implements his new taxes on imports from China, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners.

The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. on Monday responded to Trump's latest tariff threat by saying his bluster would not help him resolve any trade disputes.

“We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,” said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman. “China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”

After sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday fell 0.9%. The S&P 500 slumped 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.1%. 

Trump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on Wall Street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. But that hasn't been the case, and Trump has described days of financial pain as necessary.

“I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end,” he said.

Trump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. The only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for China. Stock prices spiked before the White House denied it was true by calling the post “fake news.”

The Republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the U.S. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries.

But his aggressive push has scrambled U.S. economic policy. Even though inflation remains elevated, Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Friday that the tariffs could increase inflation, and he said, “There's a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,” before any decisions would be made.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would focus on trade with other countries besides the United States, saying there are “vast opportunities” elsewhere. 

Trump said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to start trade negotiations. He complained on Truth Social “they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade” and “they don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs.”

Ishiba said he told Trump that he's “strongly concerned” that tariffs would discourage investment from Japan, which has been the world's biggest investor in the U.S. in the past five years. He described the situation as a “national crisis” and said his government would negotiate with Washington to urge Trump to reconsider the tariffs.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process.

“Let's take Vietnam,” he said on CNBC. “When they come to us and say, ‘We'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.”

Meeting with Trump at the White House on Monday, Netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the U.S. placing 17% taxes on imports from Israel.

“Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,” Netanyahu told the U.S. president.

Trump said he appreciated “very much” what Netanyahu had said. But when asked if he would remove the tariffs, Trump said “maybe not” because of the aid that the United States provides to Israel. The U.S. had a $7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with Israel, according to the Census Bureau.

Trump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. However, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters.

Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday as “indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing.”

On Monday, Ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that Lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. But the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about Trump's tariffs. 

“I am just frustrated watching what I believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs,” he wrote on X. 

Billionaire Elon Musk, a top adviser to Trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. Musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for Tesla, his electric automaker.

“I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said in a video conference with Italian politicians.

Navarro later told Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures” that Musk “doesn't understand” the situation. 

“He sells cars,” Navarro said. “That's what he does.” He added, “He's simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do.”

            The Supreme Court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.
    


            The unsigned decision in the case, the most closely watched emergency appeal pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that people deported going forward should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed.
    


            The court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court's conservative wing, partially dissented.

            Trump framed his emergency appeal as a fight over judicial power and, specifically, US District Judge James Boasberg's order that temporarily blocked the president from enforcing the Alien Enemies Act against five Venezuelans who sued and a broader class of people who might be affected — in other words, anyone else. By granting the president's request, the Supreme Court has tossed out Boasberg's orders.
    


            Critically, the court made clear in its unsigned order that officials must give migrants subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act proclamation adequate notice that they are being removed pursuant to the wartime authority so that they have time to bring habeas complaints.
    


            A key concern among attorneys representing the migrants has been that the government's rush to remove migrants under the act leaves them with little to no time to file such legal claims.
    


            “The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,” the justices wrote, adding: “The detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”

            A large image of and a quote from Harriet Tubman have been removed from a National Park Service webpage about the Underground Railroad, following several prominent changes to government websites under the Trump administration.
    


            A comparison on the Wayback Machine between the webpage on January 21 and March 19 shows that the large image of Tubman – the railroad's most famous “conductor,” lauded for helping scores of people escape slavery – has been swapped with a series of five commemorative stamps showing Tubman alongside William Still, Catherine Coffin, Thomas Garrett and Frederick Douglass. All five aided enslaved people seeking freedom. The stamps tout “Black/White” cooperation.
    


            A quote from Tubman about her experience coordinating the clandestine network for slaves seeking freedom also no longer appears on the NPS page.
    


            The Washington Post first reported on the changes.
    


            The focus of the text also changed significantly, comparison shows.
    


             The new page does not mention slavery until the third paragraph, and cuts a reference to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 entirely. Previously, the article started with a description of enslaved peoples' efforts to free themselves and the organization of the Underground Railroad after the Fugitive Slave Act, the article now starts with two paragraphs that emphasize the “American ideals of liberty and freedom.”
    


            The first sentence of the page describes the Underground Railroad as “one of the most significant expressions of the American civil rights movement.”

            Tubman's reduced presence on the Underground Railroad page “is both offensive and absurd,” Fergus Bordewich, a historian and the author of a book about the Underground Railroad, told CNN Sunday. He described the new webpage as “diminished in value by its brevity.”
    


            “To oversimplify history is to distort it,” Bordewich went on. “Americans are not infants: they can handle complex and challenging historical narratives. They do not need to be protected from the truth.”
    


            Janell Hobson, a professor of women's studies at the University at Albany, State University of New York, described Tubman as “one of our greatest American heroes and definitely the greatest liberator in this nation” in an email to CNN.
    


            “I hope that National Park Service realize they owe it to her and other heroes like her to stand in the truth of what this history has been,” she said.
    


            In response, an NPS spokesperson told CNN Monday that “the idea that a couple web edits somehow invalidate the National Park Service's commitment to telling complex and challenging historical narratives is completely false.” The spokesperson highlighted the two national historical parks named for Tubman.
    


            “The National Park Service recognizes Harriet Tubman as the Underground Railroad's best known conductor and we celebrate her as a deeply spiritual woman who lived her ideals and dedicated her life to freedom,” reads the agency's response.
    


            In the updated webpage, there are no references to Tubman beyond the small commemorative stamp.
    


             But there is a separate National Park Service page dedicated to Tubman, who was born into slavery in Maryland before fleeing to Philadelphia. She returned to Maryland over a dozen times to help free other slaves, guiding them through the “Underground Railroad,” a secret network of routes and safe houses. The park service webpage on Tubman does not seem to have been changed since January 28, 2025.
    


            The past few months have also seen other controversial changes to government websites as the Trump administration enacts a campaign to eliminate DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion. The removal of the words “transgender” and “queer” from a National Parks Service webpage about Stonewall Monument in New York City triggered protests in February.
    


            In March, the Pentagon seemingly took down a page about Jackie Robinson, the trailblazing baseball player who became the first Black Major League Baseball athlete in the modern era, before restoring it.
    


            Articles about topics seemingly unrelated to DEI – including the Holocaust, cancer awareness, and sexual assault – have also been removed from Pentagon webpages. Pentagon officials were instructed to search for keywords like “racism,” “ethnicity,” “LGBTQ,” “history” and “first” when identifying articles and photos to remove, multiple defense officials previously told CNN.
    


            In his second term, President Donald Trump has taken multiple steps to take control of American cultural and historical institutions, gutting the board of trustees at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC and targeting the Smithsonian Institution in an executive order in late March.
    


            In his order, Trump specifically identified the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum as carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.

Former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf weighs in on the deportation of an alleged MS-13 member on 'The Story.'

Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary stay Monday blocking, for now, a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return by midnight a Maryland resident who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador last month. 

Justice Roberts temporarily froze the lower court order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who had ordered the Trump administration to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident who, last month, was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, by 12 a.m. Tuesday.

The government has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S. was an "administrative error." 

The filing from Roberts comes after the Trump administration appealed the lower court's decision both to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court on Monday morning, in anticipation of the appellate court decision. 

Judges on the Fourth Circuit voted unanimously earlier in the day to reject the Justice Department's request for an administrative stay, clearing the way for the nation's top court to intervene.

The eleventh-hour pause granted by Roberts gives the Trump administration additional time to comply with the court order requiring Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S.

Roberts ordered the case stayed "pending further order of the undersigned or of the Court," and asked for a response from plaintiffs by Tuesday night.

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia responded immediately.

In a reply brief filed to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Abrego Garcia noted the extraordinary circumstances surrounding his deportation. 

"This case is one of one," they told the court.

"It presents the ‘extraordinary circumstances' of the Government conceding that it erred in removing Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia ‘to a foreign country for which he was not eligible for removal,'" they added.

"Abrego Garcia has never been charged with a crime, in any country. He is not wanted by the Government of El Salvador," they said. "He sits in a foreign prison solely at the behest of the United States, as the product of a Kafka-esque mistake."

The eleventh-hour intervention from Roberts comes as the Trump administration has come under intense scrutiny for its deportation flights to El Salvador, which sent roughly 261 migrants, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals targeted for immediate removal under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, last month.

The legality of using a wartime immigration law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals from the U.S. is also being considered by the Supreme Court separately. A ruling in that case is expected in the coming days.

Five people were rescued and are recovering after a small private plane skidded off a runway at an Oregon airport and into the nearby bay.

The Southwest Oregon Regional Airport (OTH) shared that a small private aircraft skidded off Runway 23, which is partially surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, while landing early Monday morning.

Officials said the 2019 HA-420 was attempting to land shortly after 6:00 a.m., when it skidded off the runway and into the bay.

The aircraft was located approximately 100 feet off the east end of the runway in the water, according to officials.

Officials said emergency dispatchers were immediately notified and sent out to begin the rescue mission. 

Emergency response teams on the scene included OTH Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting crews, the Coos Bay and North Bend fire departments, North Bend Police Department and the Coos County Sheriff's Office. 

Images show the plane in the water as rescue crews worked to get the pilot and passengers to safety.

The pilot and four passengers were all rescued from the plane, officials said, and were transported to a local hospital. Their conditions are currently unknown, the airport said.

Officials said the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was alerted and authorized a salvage company to remove the small plane from the water.

The airport said that commercial air service was suspended for United Express for nearly two hours, but has since been restored.

SkyWest flight 5509 was delayed, but the airport said it was scheduled to arrive at OTH at 2:14 p.m. on Monday. 

The airport, located in North Bend, Ore., offers commercial air service year-round to and from San Francisco, Calif., and, seasonally, to Denver, Colo., according to the airport's description on their Facebook page.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are careening through a manic Monday after President Donald Trump threatened to crank his tariffs higher, despite a stunning display from Wall Street showing how dearly it wants him to do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was down 0.8% in late trading, but only after a shocking day of heart-racing reversals as battered financial markets try to figure out what Trump's ultimate goal is for his trade war. If it's to get other countries to agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if it's to remake the economy and stick with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may need to fall further.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 563 points, or 1.5%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower. 

All three indexes started the day sharply lower, and the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a gain of nearly 900 points. The S&P 500, meanwhile, went from a loss of 4.7% to a leap of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The sudden rise followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news.” Stocks then turned back down. That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on tariffs.

But soon after that, Trump threatened to raise tariffs further against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products. 




It's a slap in the face to Wall Street, not just because of the sharp losses it's taking, but because it suggests Trump may not be moved by its pain. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling.

On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he does not want markets to fall. But he also said he wasn't concerned about a sell-off, saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them. 

Still, indexes kept swerving between losses and gains Monday, even after Trump threatened to raise his tariffs, because hope still remains in markets that negotiations may still come.

“Could things get worse? Of course they could,” said Nate Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. “We're not calling the all-clear at all, but when you have this type of volatility in the market, of course you're going to have back and forth” in markets not just day to day but also hour to hour. 

“We're all waiting for the next bit of information,” he said. “Literally a Truth Social tweet or an announcement of some sort about real negotiations could dramatically move this market. This is the world we live in right now.”

All that seems to be certain is that the financial pain hammered investments around the world on Monday, the third straight day of steep losses after Trump announced tariffs in his “Liberation Day.” 

Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week.

Nike dropped 4% for one of the larger losses on Wall Street. Not only does it sell a lot of shoes and apparel in China, it also makes much of it there. Last fiscal year, factories in China made 18% of its Nike brand footwear. Vietnam made 50%, and Indonesia made 27%.

Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.

It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero by slashing interest rates during downturns. 

But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because the conditions are so much different. That's cheifly because inflation is higher at the moment than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. Expectations for inflation are already swinging higher  because of Trump's tariffs, which would likely raise prices for anything imported.

“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”

In the bond market, Treasury yields rallied Monday to recover some of their sharp drops from earlier weeks. Some of the big move may have been because of reduced expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Fed. Some analysts also said it could be due to investors outside of the United States wanting to pare their U.S. investments. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.14% from 4.01% late Friday. 

Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 20% below its record set less than two months ago. If it finishes a day below that bar, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that's moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious. 

The S&P 500, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, is coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020.

President Trump touts Dodgers star's accomplishment as team visits White House.

President Donald Trump touted Shohei Ohtani's accomplishments as he welcomed the Los Angeles Dodgers to the White House on Monday to celebrate their 2024 title.

Trump spoke highly of the Japanese Dodgers star who put himself into a club of his own during the 2024 regular season. He became the first batter in MLB history to hit at least 50 home runs and steal at least 50 bases. The president turned around to shake Ohtani's hand and appeared to be stunned.

"He looks like a movie star," Trump said. "He's got a good future, I'm telling you."

Ohtani had 54 home runs, 59 stolen bases, batted .390 and drove in 130 RBI in 159 games for the Dodgers. He was awarded the National League MVP for his efforts. It was his first season with Los Angeles after signing a massive 10-year, $700 million contract with the team in the prior offseason.

Trump mentioned that Ohtani clinched the 50-50 moment in a game he went 6-for-6 in. He said some called it "the greatest game ever." He had three homers and 10 RBI in the game.

"Is he good," Trump jokingly asked manager Davie Roberts, who responded, "He's only getting better."

"And he's getting better. That's scary for a lot of people," Trump said.

Later, Ohtani took a photo with Trump in the Oval Office and posed next to the Declaration of Independence.

Ohtani helped the Dodgers to a National League West division title and he kept his hot hitting going in the postseason. He had three home runs between the National League Division Series and the National League Championship Series.

He cooled off during the World Series, but the team still managed to defeat the New York Yankees in five games. It was the Dodgers' second title since 2020.

This season, Ohtani has three home runs in 11 games. He is hitting .268 with three RBI and two stolen bases. He may return to the mound as well and get back to pitching.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are swinging in a manic Monday after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariffs, despite seeing how much Wall Street wants him to do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was up 0.3% in afternoon trading, coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020. The index, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, has been flirting with a drop of 20% from its record set less than two months ago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 184 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:37 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% higher. 

Earlier in a heart-racing morning, the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points shortly after trading began, following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a leap of nearly 900 points. The S&P 500 went from a loss of 4.7% to a gain of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The sudden rise for stocks followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news.” Stocks then turned back down. That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on his stiff tariffs, which have started a global trade war.

Soon after that, Trump threatened to raise tariffs further against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products. 




It's a slap in the face to Wall Street, not just because of the sharp losses it's taking, but because it suggests Trump may not be moved by its pain. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling.

On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he does not want markets to fall. But he also said he wasn't concerned about a sell-off, saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years.

The financial pain once again hammered investments around the world on Monday, the third straight day of steep losses after Trump announced tariffs in his “Liberation Day.” Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week.

On Wall Street, roughly 65% of the stocks fell within the S&P 500. The index is being lifted by gains from several big technology stocks, whose pricey values tend to give more heft to the market's direction, whether up or down. Nivida rose 4.6%.

Nike dropped 4% for one of the larger losses in the market. Not only does it sell a lot of shoes and apparel in China, it also makes much of it there. Last fiscal year, factories in China made 18% of its Nike brand footwear. Vietnam made 50%, and Indonesia made 27%.

Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.

It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero during downturns. By slashing interest rates to make borrowing easier for U.S. households and companies, along with several untraditional moves to juice the economy, the Fed helped the U.S. economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID crash and other bear markets.

But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because the conditions are so much different. For one, instead of a coronavirus or a system built up on too much belief that U.S. home prices would keep rising, this market downturn is mostly because of economic policy from the White House.

Perhaps more importantly, inflation is also higher at the moment than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. Expectations for inflation are already swinging higher  because of Trump's tariffs, which would likely raise prices for anything imported.

“The idea that there's so much uncertainty going forward about how these tariffs are going to play out, that's what's really driving this plummet in the stock prices,” said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at the Asia Group.

If the S&P 500 finishes the day 20% below its record, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that's moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious. 

Nathan Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said more countries are likely to respond to the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs. Given the large number of countries involved, “it will take a considerable amount of time in our view to work through the various negotiations that are likely to happen.”

“Ultimately, our take is market uncertainly and volatility are likely to persist for some time,” he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — A bogus rumor that President Donald Trump was considering a pause in tariffs briefly lifted markets Monday before the White House shot down the unfounded reports.

The confusion — which was amplified on social media and by some traditional media outlets — lasted less than a half hour but reflected a jittery mood on Wall Street as stocks plunged over worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy.

The origin of the false report was unclear but it appeared to be a misinterpretation of comments made by Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, during a Fox News interview earlier Monday morning.

Asked whether Trump would consider a 90-day tariff pause suggested by a prominent hedge fund manager, Hassett said “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.” 

Nearly two hours later, multiple user accounts on social media platform X posted identical messages claiming Hassett said Trump is considering a pause for all countries except China. Stock traders and some news outlets picked up the story, and the market skyrocketed on the hint of good news.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly erased a morning loss of 1,700 points, shot up more than 800 points and then went back to a loss of 629 points. The S&P 500 likewise made sudden up-and-down lurching movements.

The White House initially appeared as confused as everyone else. But after 20 minutes, a government account rejected the report as “fake news.”

The Pittsburgh Pirates removed a tribute to Roberto Clemente in right field. His son talked to Fox News Digital about that decision.

EXCLUSIVE: Roberto Clemente Jr. met with Pittsburgh Pirates officials on Monday to figure out ways to further honor the legacy of his legendary father following the outcry about the team removing an outfield tribute to the Baseball Hall of Famer.

The tribute was placed on the right-field wall – a sign with Roberto Clemente's name and No. 21. Fans noticed before the team's home opener that the tribute was removed in favor of an advertisement for an alcoholic beverage.

Clemente's son expressed dismay about the decision in a statement over the weekend, but he told Fox News Digital the two sides were "brainstorming" ideas about how to properly rectify the situation after having an initial conversation with the team.

"Right now, we're going to be brainstorming. We need to iron out some ideas that we have listed. I'm not going to get into the details right now," he said. "But I think we should have something in the next couple of weeks to at least really kind of tie in this new relationship with the Pirates. And I think things happen for a reason.

"This is something we feel really tied in with the team forever. I always say that I was born with an eyepatch and I would die with an eyepatch, even though I never played for the Pirates, but obviously, I've been connected and it doesn't matter where I go, I am representing the Pirates and we, as a family, have always been ambassadors, not only to the game but for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

"I truly do know that fans show their support and some frustration to a lot of things that are going on. I believe that we can have a great outcome from this conversation that will benefit the fans of Clemente in Pittsburgh."

Clemente said he learned about the tribute's removal through social media.

"I never really realized that the sign was down until later on when I got home through social media seeing the post there," he explained. "It was very surprising to me. I was surprised and obviously my reaction was ‘wow.' That's all I said and I left it at that.

"Little did I know it was going to catch fire and obviously there's a lot of emotions with the fans and the team and some frustrations and I think that kind of was the last straw for a lot of the big Pirate and Clemente fans, and they took it upon themselves to express themselves, and obviously it was an overwhelming response. It was something that I didn't think a ‘wow' would actually be that big, but obviously it wasn't really the wow, it was actually the fact that the sign had come down and there was an advertisement on the wall."

The Pirates organization said removing the tribute was an "honest mistake."

"We did not intend to disrespect the legacy of Roberto Clemente by adding the advertisement to the pad in right field," team president Travis Williams said in a statement.

"When we added the advertisement to the pad, it was an oversight not to keep the No. 21 logo. This is ultimately on me, not anyone else in the organization. It was an honest mistake."

The team said it would return the No.  21 logo.

"We have used this area for advertisements for many years. When we didn't have a sponsor coming out of COVID, we added an additional element in 2022 to honor the legacy of Roberto," Williams added. "It was a replica of the Three Rivers signate honoring him.

"This is in addition to the many elements throughout the ball park that honor his legacy, including the fact that the wall is named the Roberto Clemente Wall, is 21 feet tall and has two No. 21s on it.

The ‘Fox & Friends' hosts discuss the Trump administration's decision to revoke the visas of college students involved in anti-Israel protests.

The Trump administration has begun a new wave of visa revocations for international students studying at American universities.

Universities across America said over the weekend that the visas of several international students were revoked. It's unclear if the visa revocations are associated with anti-Israel actions by the affected international students.

The most recent wave of visa revocations impacted international students at Harvard University, University of Michigan, Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles, Ohio State University and more.

At Harvard University, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked the visas of three graduate students and two recent graduates.

The visa revocations were discovered during a "routine records review," according to The Harvard Crimson. Most impacted institutions also learned that student visas had been revoked during a review of records, and weren't contacted by DHS.

"We are not aware of the details of the revocations or the reasons for them, but we understand that comparable numbers of students and scholars in institutions across the country have experienced similar status changes in roughly the same timeframe," the Harvard International Office wrote in an email to students.

Four University of Michigan students also had their visas taken away by DHS on Friday. One of those students has left the country, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on March 28 that student visas are being revoked "every day."

"I would argue that the – what I would add to it is what we have seen on campuses across the country where students literally cannot go to school, you cannot – buildings are being taken over, activities going on – this is clearly an organized movement," Rubio said. "And if you are in this country on a student visa and are a participant in those movements, we have a right to deny your visa.  I think it would make sense to deny your visa.  We're going to err on the side of caution.  We are not going to be importing activists into the United States."

"I think it's lunacy to continue to allow that," he continued.

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'One Nation with Brian Kilmeade' to give a look at the week ahead.

House GOP leaders' aim to sync up with the Senate on a massive bill advancing President Donald Trump's agenda is on the rocks as of Monday morning, with fiscal hawks worried the upper chamber's version will not go far enough to reduce the national deficit.

House Republican skeptics are worried specifically about the Senate plan requiring a baseline of $4 billion in spending cuts, while the House plan calls for a $1.5 trillion minimum. 

Two conservatives told Fox News Digital they would oppose the bill if it came to a House vote this week, while two others suggested they were leaning strongly against it. 

"The Senate proposal is not serious and is an insult to the American people," Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., who said he is leaning "against" the measure, told Fox News Digital.

That is coupled with at least three GOP lawmakers declaring on social media this weekend that they are against the legislation – while even more have aired public concerns.

"It's dead on arrival," Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital last week. "We have to stay with what we worked so hard to put over there, which is a bare minimum. When they talk about changes and talk about putting, basically, a teardrop in the ocean as far as cuts – we're not going to go along with that."

When asked on Monday morning about whether he felt the same, Norman replied emphatically via text message, "YES."

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., shared similar concerns about the gap in the House and Senate's minimum for spending cuts.

"At this point, I would vote against it," he said.

Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., another critic of excessive government spending, told Fox News Digital he had not made his mind up on the bill but said there were "not enough cuts" in the Senate version.

House GOP leaders are arguing that passing the Senate version does not impede the House in moving forward with its own more fiscally conservative version in any way. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pitched House passage of the Senate bill as a necessary step to allow Republicans to enact Trump's agenda.

However, doubts over spending cuts are even extending beyond the House GOP's right-most flank. House Budget Committee Vice Chair Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa., voiced his own issues with the bill in a private call with House Republicans on Sunday, two people familiar with discussions told Fox News Digital.

Smucker's office said it would not comment on internal deliberations, but pointed Fox News Digital to the lawmaker's statement on Saturday. "The Senate's passage of the amended House resolution is a critical step forward. However, with $5.8 trillion in costs and only $4 billion required savings in their instructions, I cannot vote for it. We can and must do better."

Committee Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, called it "unserious," but added he was open to working with House and Senate leaders and the White House to ease those concerns.

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who sources said also raised concerns on the Sunday call, posted on X of the bill, "If the Senate's 'Jekyll and Hyde' budget is put on the House floor, I will vote no."

In addition to opposing the gap in baseline spending cuts, some conservatives who oppose the bill are also wary of the Senate, signaling it would use the current policy baseline method to factor in the cost of extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts.

The scoring tool essentially means the cost of making Trump's tax cuts permanent would be factored at $0, because it extends current policy rather than counting it as new dollars being added to the federal deficit.

"I'm very wary of this budget gimmick, especially paired with a measly $4 billion floor in spending cuts," Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., told Fox News Digital. "The fiscally responsible way to extend and pay for tax cuts is through significant spending cuts, which is exactly what House Republicans instruct in our budget resolution."

Congressional Republicans are working on a massive piece of legislation that Trump has dubbed "one big, beautiful bill" to advance his agenda on border security, defense, energy and taxes.

Such a measure is largely only possible via the budget reconciliation process. Traditionally used when one party controls all three branches of government, reconciliation lowers the Senate's threshold for passage of certain fiscal measures from 60 votes to 51.

As a result, it has been used to pass broad policy changes in one or two massive pieces of legislation.

The House's framework passed in late February and included some new funding for defense and border security, along with $4.5 trillion for extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implementing newer Trump proposals like no taxes on tipped wages.

The framework also called for between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in spending cuts, dependent on how much Trump's tax policies would add to the national deficit – something that was key to winning support from deficit hawks.

It also raised the debt limit, something Trump has specifically asked Republicans to deal with, by $4 trillion. The Senate's version, which passed in the early hours of Saturday, would raise the debt limit by $5 trillion.

MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE

Trump himself has endorsed both the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Passing a framework then allows lawmakers to craft actual policy to match the framework's federal spending guidelines, led by the respective committees of jurisdiction.

Those policy plans are all brought back together into another massive bill. The Senate and House must pass identical versions before it gets to Trump's desk for a signature – something the House speaker said would be done by Memorial Day.

In a letter to House GOP colleagues on Sunday, Johnson said lawmakers would vote on the Senate's amended version this week. 

However, Johnson insisted that the Senate's passage of its framework simply allows the House to begin working on its version of the bill passed in February – and that it does not impede their process in any way.

"The Senate amendment as passed makes NO CHANGES to the House reconciliation instructions that we voted for just weeks ago. Although the Senate chose to take a different approach on its instructions, the amended resolution in NO WAY prevents us from achieving our goals in the final reconciliation bill," the letter said.

"We have and will continue to make it clear in all discussions with the Senate and the White House that—in order to secure House passage—the final reconciliation bill must include historic spending reductions while protecting essential programs."

Johnson's office pointed back to the letter when reached for comment on Monday.

Republicans will have slightly more wiggle room to pass the measure than they have for much of the year so far, with the special election victories of Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla.

Even with those additions, however, Johnson can only lose three GOP votes with full House attendance to pass anything along party lines.

The beatings keep coming for financial markets worldwide as worries worsen Monday about whether President Donald Trump's trade war will torpedo the global economy.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are falling in a manic Monday after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariffs, despite seeing how much financial markets would love to see him do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was down 1.4% in midday trading, coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020. The index, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, has lost nearly 20% since setting a record less than two months ago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 744 points, or 1.9%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.1% lower. 

Earlier in a heart-racing morning, the Dow fell as many as 1,700 points shortly after trading began, following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a leap of nearly 900 points before pulling back lower. The S&P 500 at one point went from a loss of 4.7% to a gain of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The whipsaw swings shook the market as a White House account on X said a rumor circulating that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs was “fake news.” That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how hard investors are straining to see hopes that Trump may let up on his stiff tariffs, which have started a global trade war.

Within less than an hour of that “fake news” announcement, though, Trump threatened to raise tariffs further against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products. 




It's all a slap in the face to Wall Street, not just because of the sharp losses it's taking, but because it suggests Trump may not be moved by its pain. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling.

On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he does not want markets to fall. But he also said he wasn't concerned about a sell-off, saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them. 

“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. He's one of the most influential executives on Wall Street. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.” 

The financial pain once again hammered investments around the world. Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil briefly dropped below $60 for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week. 

Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.

It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero during downturns. By slashing interest rates to make borrowing easier for U.S. households and companies, along with other more untraditional moves to juice the economy, the Fed helped the U.S. economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID crash and other bear markets.

But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because the conditions are so much different. For one, instead of a coronavirus or a system built up on too much belief that U.S. home prices would keep rising, this market downturn is mostly because of economic policy from the White House.

Perhaps more importantly, inflation is also higher at the moment than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. Expectations for inflation are already swinging higher  because of Trump's tariffs, which would likely raise prices for anything imported.

“The idea that there's so much uncertainty going forward about how these tariffs are going to play out, that's what's really driving this plummet in the stock prices,” said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at the Asia Group.

If the S&P 500 finishes the day 20% below its record, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that's moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious. 

Nathan Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said more countries are likely to respond to the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs. Given the large number of countries involved, “it will take a considerable amount of time in our view to work through the various negotiations that are likely to happen.”

“Ultimately, our take is market uncertainly and volatility are likely to persist for some time,” he said.

BRUSSELS (AP) — America's trading partners wrestled with responses to U.S. President Donald Trump's blast of tariff hikes and some planned to send negotiators to Washington, while the head of the European Union's executive commission offered mutual reduction of tariffs - while warning that retaliation was an option too.

“We stand ready to negotiate with the United States,” said commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Indeed, we have offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners. Because Europe is always ready for a good deal.”

But she warned that “we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests.”

China has already hit back against the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs and similar actions from Europe and elsewhere remain a significant possibility.

The U.S. and the EU had a zero-for-zero deal on wine and spirits from 1997 to 2018, and reducing many tariffs to zero was a goal of complex negotiations for a US-Europe free-trade deal before negotiations stalled in 2016. 

Yet there was little indication Trump is ready to deal. The EU trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, spoke for two hours with Trump administration Friday and would say only that “we stay in touch.” 

And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports would not lead to a pullback on the the newly announced 46% levy on its imports to the U.S. 




“Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said on CNBC

Major trade partner China was taking a tougher line and accused the U.S. of “bullying” after imposing a 34% tariff on Friday on all US goods, the exact same rate Trump slapped China with in his latest round of new import taxes.

Several other countries said they were sending trade officials to Washington to try to talk through the crisis, which has cast uncertainty over the global economic outlook, hammered markets and left U.S. allies wondering about the value of their ties with the world's largest economy. 

European Union trade ministers were closeted Monday in Luxembourg to weigh possible steps that could include taxes on U.S. tech companies like Google, Apple and Amazon. The European Union's executive commission - which handles trade issues for the 27-country bloc - is set to impose tariffs on Jeans, whiskey and motorcycles on Wednesday in response to Trumps increase in steel and aluminum tariffs.

But it hasn't decided a response yet to Trump's “reciprocal” tariff of 20% on European goods announced Wednesday and a 25% tariff imposed on autos from everywhere. French officials have raised imposing tariffs on services like internet commerce or financial services, where the U.S. sells more than it buys from Europe and is in theory more vulnerable than in goods trade. 

Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, was defiant as he arrived, saying the premise of the wide-ranging tariffs was “nonsense” and that attempts by individual countries to win exemptions haven't worked in the past. 

It's important for the EU to stick together, he said. That “means being clear that we are in a strong position — America is in a position of weakness.” 

So far the European approach has been to selectively target politically sensitive goods rather than impose sweeping retaliation since like most economists officials they view tariff wars as a lose-lose game. 

China, which hit back Friday at Washington with 34% tariffs on U.S. products and other retaliatory moves, sharply accused the U.S. of failing to play fair. “Putting ‘America First' over international rules is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,” Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.

The ruling Communist Party struck a note of confidence even as markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai crumpled. “The sky won't fall,” declared The People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece. “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of U.S. taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal.”

China's Commerce Ministry said officials met with representatives of 20 American businesses including Tesla and GE Healthcare over the weekend and urged them to take “concrete actions” to address the tariffs issue.

During the meeting, Ling Ji, a vice minister of commerce, promised that China will remain open to foreign investment, according to the readout by the ministry. 

South Korea's Trade Ministry said its top negotiator, Inkyo Cheong, will visit Washington this week to express Seoul's concerns over the 25% tariffs on Korean goods and discuss ways to mitigate the damage to South Korean businesses, which include major automakers and steel makers. Asian countries are among the most exposed to Trump's tariffs ranging from a baseline 10% to 50% since their export-oriented economies send a lot of goods to the U.S. 

Pakistan also planned to send a delegation to Washington this month to try negotiate over the 29% tariffs on its exports to the U.S., officials said. The prime minister ordered Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to assess the tariff's potential impact on Pakistan's fragile economy and draw up recommendations. 

The U.S. imports around $5 billion worth of textiles and other products each year from Pakistan, which heavily relies on loans from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. 

In Southeast Asia, Malaysia's Trade Minister Zafrul Abdul Aziz said his country will seek to forge a united response from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to Trump's sweeping tariffs.

As chair of the 10-nation body this year, Malaysia will lead a meeting Thursday in its capital Kuala Lumpur to discuss broader implications of the trade war on regional trade and investment, Zafrul told reporters.

“We are looking at the investment flows, macroeconomic stability and ASEAN's coordinated response to this tariff issue,” Zafrul said. 

He said that he had met with the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia to try to clarify how the U.S. came up with its 24% tariff. 

Indonesia, one of the region's biggest economies, said it would work with businesses to increase its imports of U.S. wheat, cotton, oil and gas to help reduce its trade surplus, which was $18 billion in 2024. 

Coordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto told a news conference that Indonesia will not retaliate against the new 32% tariff on Indonesian exports, but would use diplomacy to seek mutually beneficial solutions. 

Some Southeast Asian neighbors, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, face tariffs of over 40%, giving Indonesia a slight advantage, he noted.

“For Indonesia, it is also another opportunity as its market is huge in America,” Hartoto said. He said Indonesia would buy U.S.-made components for several national strategic projects, including refineries.

JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan has criticized the revocation of U.S. visas for all its nationals as unfair and said it was based on an incident that didn't involve one of its citizens but another African national. 

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that the decision to revoke all visas for South Sudanese came because the country's government failed to accept the return of its citizens being removed from the United States “in a timely manner.”

South Sudan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that the deportee who was denied U.S. entry on Friday was found to be a Congolese national and he was returned to the U.S and all supporting evidence shared with American officials.

“The government deeply regrets that despite this history of collaboration and partnership, South Sudan now faces a broad revocation of visas based on an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national,” the statement said. 

South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told The Associated Press on Monday that the U.S was “attempting to find faults with the tense situation” in the country because no sovereign nation would accept foreign deportees.

The U.N in March warned that South Sudan was teetering on the edge of renewed civil war. T he country's vice president and main opposition leader Riek Machar remains under house on charges of incitement after an armed group allied to him overrun an army camp and attacked a U.N helicopter.




It was not immediately clear how many South Sudanese hold U.S. visas. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on social media the dispute centers on one person, certified by South Sudan's Embassy in Washington, that Juba has refused to accept. That person was not named.

No new visas will be issued, the U.S. said, and “we will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi on the judicial system's handling of executive power cases, controversy surrounding alleged MS-13 Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia's deportation, the Luigi Mangione case and chatter about President Trump seeking a third term.

A federal appeals court voted en banc Monday to block President Donald Trump's firings of two federal board members, reversing an appellate court ruling and clearing the way for the Trump administration to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

Judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit voted 7-4 Monday to restore the positions of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) member Cathy Harris – two Democratic appointees who were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration earlier this year. 

The majority cited Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey's Executor and Wiener v. United States as the backing for their decision, noting that the Supreme Court had never overturned or reversed the decades-old precedent regarding removal restrictions for government officials of "multimember adjudicatory boards" – including the NLRB and MSPB.

They noted that the Supreme Court has not yet overturned these precedents, or instructed lower courts to act otherwise.

"The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it," judges noted in their opinion. 

Monday's ruling from the full panel means that both Wilcox and Harris can return to their positions, at least for now. It is likely to spark intense backlash from the Trump administration, which has lobbed accusations of so-called "activist judges" that have slowed or halted some of Trump's executive orders and actions.

Also on Monday, the appeals court rejected the Trump administration's request for an administrative stay, which would have allowed their removals to remain in place while the challenge continued to play out in federal court.

The panel found that the administration had not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its appeals, nor did it show irreparable injury if they did not grant the stay – the legal requirements needed to satisfy an emergency court intervention. 

The en banc ruling reverses a decision reached just 10 days earlier by a three-judge panel for the same appeals court. That panel ruled 2-1 in favor of the Trump administration and allowed the firings to proceed, prompting plaintiffs to file a request for the appeals court to hear the case again en banc, or with all appellate court judges present.

The appellate court's decision to hear the case again, even after a three-judge appellate panel from the same court ruled on the issue late last month, is likely to be met with intense scrutiny by Trump and his allies. 

It also all but ensures that the Trump administration will move quickly to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court for emergency review.

Since taking office, Trump has signed more than 300 executive orders and actions, including sweeping personnel moves, the restructuring of federal agencies, and the creation of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE – a temporary agency that has drawn scrutiny for its broad oversight powers and access to sensitive government data.

Critics argue that the flurry of early executive actions warrants an additional level of legal scrutiny, and judges have raced to review a crushing wave of cases and lawsuits filed by terminated employees or brought on behalf of agency employees. 

The Trump administration has appealed its early losses to the Supreme Court – a strategy it appears poised to continue in the NLRB and MSPB terminations.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian police have arrested a 24-year-old American Youtuber who visited an off-limits island in the Indian ocean and left an offering of a Diet Coke can and a coconut in an attempt to make contact with an isolated tribe known for attacking intruders.

Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, from Scottsdale, Arizona, was arrested on March 31, two days after he set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island — part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands — in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe, police said. 

A local court last week sent Polyakov to a 14-day judicial custody and he is set to appear again in the court on April 17. The charges carry a possible sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine. Indian authorities said they had informed the U.S. Embassy about the case. 

Visitors are banned from traveling within 3 miles (5 kilometres) of the island, whose population has been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.

In 2018, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinel islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.

Indian officials have limited contacts to rare “gift-giving” encounters, with small teams of officials and scientists leaving coconuts and bananas for the islanders. Indian ships also monitor the waters around the island, trying to ensure outsiders do not go near the Sentinelese, who have repeatedly made clear they want to be left alone.




Police said Polyakov was guided by GPS navigation during his journey and surveyed the island with binoculars before landing. He stayed on the beach for about an hour, blowing a whistle to attract the attention but got no response from the islanders.

He later left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as an offering, made a video on his camera, and collected some sand samples before returning to his boat.

On his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, an archipelago nearly 750 miles (1,207 kilometres) east of India's mainland. A case was registered against him for violation of Indian laws that prohibit any outsider to interact with the islanders.

Police said Polyakov had conducted detailed research on sea conditions, tides and accessibility to the island before starting his journey.

“He planned meticulously over several days to visit the island and make a contact with the Sentinel tribe,” Senior Police Officer Hargobinder Singh Dhaliwal said.

In a statement, police said Polyakov's “actions posed a serious threat to the safety and well-being of the Sentinelese people, whose contact with outsiders is strictly prohibited by the law to protect their indigenous way of life.”

An initial investigation revealed Polyakov had made two previous attempts, in October last year and January, to visit the islands, including in an inflatable kayak.

Police said Polyakov was drawn to the island due to his passion for adventure and extreme challenges, and was fascinated by the mystique of the Sentinelese people.

Survival International, a group that protects the rights of Indigenous peoples, said Polyakov's attempted contact with the tribes of North Sentinel was “reckless and idiotic.”

“This person's actions not only endangered his own life, they put the lives of the entire Sentinelese tribe at risk,” the group's director Caroline Pearce said in a statement.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — During the final sweet moments of UConn's 12th national title, Geno Auriemma and Paige Bueckers embraced after the star guard departed her final game with the Huskies.

It was the moment they wanted all along.

“They've all been gratifying, don't get me wrong,” Auriemma said. “But this one here, because of the way it came about and what's been involved, it's been a long time since I've been that emotional when a player has walked off the court.”

Bueckers, Azzi Fudd and Sarah Strong led the way as UConn returned to the top of women's college basketball by rolling to an 82-59 victory over defending champion South Carolina on Sunday.

Fudd, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, scored 24 points. Strong had 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Bueckers scored 17 points for UConn (37-3).

“Well, it's amazing to have three players, three people like that on the same team,” said the 71-year-old Auriemma, who became the oldest coach in major college basketball to win a championship. “And Sarah, you would think Sarah was graduating the way she plays, right? All three of them complement each other so well. They all have such unique skill sets.”

Bueckers capped her stellar career with the Huskies' first championship since 2016, ending a nine-year drought for the team. That was the longest period for Auriemma and his program without a title since Rebecca Lobo and Jen Rizzotti led the Huskies to their first championship in 1995.

Since then the Huskies have had dominant championship runs, including in the early 2000s led by Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, 2009-10 with Maya Moore and finally the four straight from 2013-16 with Breanna Stewart. All were in attendance in Florida on Sunday to see the Huskies' latest title.




“You just never know if you'll ever be back in this situation again,” Auriemma said. “And there were so many times when I think we all questioned, ‘Have we been here too long? Has it been time?' And we kept hanging in there and hanging in there and that's because these players make me want to hang in there every day.”

Bueckers, the expected No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft on April 14, delivered for the Huskies throughout their championship season.

Winning a title was the only thing missing from an incredible UConn career that was slowed by injuries. She was the first freshman to win AP Player of the Year before missing a lot of her sophomore season with a tibial plateau fracture and meniscus tear. She then tore an ACL before the next season.

“It's been a story of resilience, gratitude of overcoming adversity and responding to life's challenges,” Bueckers said. “I wouldn't trade it for the world.”

UConn closed the first half up 10 points and then put the game away in the third quarter, with Fudd, Strong and Bueckers combining for 23 of the team's 26 points in the period. UConn was up 50-39 with 3:21 left before closing with a 12-3 run.

Fudd and Strong got it started with back-to-back 3s, and the rout was on. Auriemma subbed Bueckers, Fudd and Strong out with 1:32 left in the game.

UConn's leading trio finished the tourney with 368 points, including an NCAA freshman record 114 for Strong. It was the highest point total for three teammates in a single NCAA Tournament, according to Stats Perform. Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randell scored 363 points for Tennessee in the 1998 women's tournament, and Glen Rice led the way for a trio of Michigan men that had 366 points in 1989.

The UConn trio proved to be way too much for South Carolina.

Dawn Staley's team was trying for a third title in four years and fourth overall. It would have tied her with Kim Mulkey for third most behind Auriemma and former Tennessee Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt, who had eight.

“Our kids gave it all they had. When you can understand why you lost and when you've been on the other side of that three times, you understand it,” Staley said. “You can swallow it. We lost to a very good basketball team.” 

UConn had reached the title game only once during its drought since 2016. The Huskies had been eliminated by heartbreaking last-second losses in the Final Four on buzzer-beaters. The Huskies' last title game appearance came in 2022 when Staley's team beat UConn to start the Gamecocks' current run of success, a game that ended Auriemma's perfect record in title games.

There seemed to be no nerves early for either team as the game got off to a fast start. The teams traded baskets for the first few minutes before the defenses started to clamp down. The Huskies led 19-14 after one quarter and then extended the advantage to 36-26 at the half. Fudd had 13 points and Strong added eight points and 11 rebounds.

BANGKOK (AP) — China on Monday accused the U.S. of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying with tariffs, while calling on representatives of American companies, including Tesla, to “take concrete actions” to resolve the issue.

Putting “America First” over international rules harms the stability of global production and the supply chain and seriously impacts the world's economic recovery, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.

Last week, Trump put an additional 34% tariff on Chinese goods as part of “Liberation Day,” on top of two rounds of 10% tariffs already declared in February and March, which Trump said were due to Beijing's role in the fentanyl crisis. China and other governments retaliated quickly. China announced its own 34% tariff rate on U.S. goods, mirroring Trump's tariff rate for China. 

On Monday, Beijing struck a note of confidence even as markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai tumbled. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's official mouthpiece, had strong words. “The sky won't fall,” it declared, even if the U.S. tariffs have an impact. 

“Faced with the indiscriminate punches of U.S. taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal,” it added.

Beijing had announced a slew of countermeasures Friday evening aimed at Trump's tariffs. As part of these measures, China suspended sorghum, poultry and bonemeal imports from some American companies, and put more export controls on rare earth minerals, critical for various technologies, while launching a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization. 




It is unknown if China's leader, Xi Jinping, will meet with Trump to make a deal on the tariffs. Lin directed questions about a possible meeting to other departments.

“Pressure and threats are not the way to deal with China. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Lin added. 

Still, over the weekend, Chinese government officials met a slew of American business representatives including for Tesla, GE Healthcare and others. 

“The root of the tariff problem is in the U.S.,” said Ling Ji, a vice minister of Commerce, at the meeting with the 20 American companies, according to a readout of the meeting. “We hope the American companies can address the problem at its root, ... issue reasonable statements, take concrete actions, and work together to safeguard the stability of the global supply chain. 

Ling also promised that China will remain open to foreign investment and that it was safe to invest. 

In Hong Kong, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the current market volatility does not warrant any drastic measures, and vowed that the city would remain a free port.

After the city's stock market slumped 13.2% on Monday, Chan told reporters was functioning in an orderly fashion with substantial selling and buying interests. But the U.S. tariffs would inevitably cause market fluctuations, while retaliatory measures and interest rate policy from other countries would trigger more volatile capital flows.

He blasted the U.S. latest tariffs as “bullying and unreasonable,” saying they have disrupted global supply chains and severely impacted the global economic recovery. 

Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to China in 1997, enjoys semi-autonomy that allows its policies and economic system to be different from mainland China's.

            As the world's appetite for computers, smartphones and other electronic devices grows ever bigger, the other side of the coin — e-waste — is raising alarms.
    


            According to a UN report released last year, 62 million tons of e-waste was generated in 2022, enough to fill 1.5 million trucks that would circle the equator if lined up bumper to bumper. Most of the e-waste went to landfills or incineration, with potential negative consequences for the environment and human health, as e-waste can contain toxic substances such as mercury or lead.
    


            There's also a staggering economic loss, as $62 billion-worth of recoverable resources such as rare earth elements are lost in the process. Currently, just 1% of the world's demand for these elements, which are essential to modern electronic devices, is met by e-waste recycling, the report says.
    


            With e-waste rising five times faster than recycling rates, new solutions to the problem can't come soon enough. Aquafade could be one — a fully water-soluble plastic that dissolves completely in about six hours when placed in a container of water. It could be used to encase electronics such as computers or keyboards and dissolved when the device is no longer wanted, making it easier to recycle or recover the most valuable components and reducing the amount of e-waste.
    


            “For most electronic products, when they're being recycled, it's the disassembly that's the real hassle, and really labor intensive,” says Samuel Wangsaputra, one of the inventors of Aquafade. “I think the brilliant bit with Aquafade is that a lot of that process is decentralized, and simply done at home.”
    


            The inspiration for Aquafade comes from an unlikely source: “One night I was doing the dishes, and I was looking at a dishwasher pod,” Wangsaputra says, adding he was intrigued by the water-soluble, transparent film that replaced traditional wrappers. “And I thought, this must be some form of polymer. But where does it go? So I tried one, just in a cup of water, and it fully disappeared.”
    


            To find out more, Wangsaputra and his co-inventor Joon Sang Lee — with whom he founded UK-based startup Pentaform, a maker of low-cost and accessible computers, in 2019 — teamed up with Enrico Manfredi-Haylock and Meryem Lamari, two material scientists at Imperial College London.
    


            “We found a material which is like a glue stick, called PVOH or polyvinyl alcohol. One of the criteria is it has to be food safe, if kids are licking the product, and it has to be fully biodegradable in the sewage system,” he adds.
    


            Wangsaputra realized that PVOH could be the key to removing a bottleneck in e-waste recycling — transportation, which raises costs and creates carbon emissions. That's in addition to the fact that most e-waste isn't even recycled. Removing the plastic casing at home would be beneficial, he thought.
    


            The idea has funding from the UK government and the four are working on the project at London's Royal College of Arts, going through a series of iterations. “We are creating something that is water soluble, but also waterproof. The challenge was making a (waterproof) coating that is biodegradable, but also very resistant.”
    


            This coating, also made of a plastic polymer, is only applied to the outer shell, making the product water resistant up to five meters for 30 minutes, which covers accidental spills or humid weather. “But once you take off just one screw from the product, that creates a leak. That's when you submerge it in water. Five to six hours later, it will dilute, and what's left is milky water and the most valuable parts of the product (the electronics),” says Wangsaputra. The milky water can simply be poured into a sink or toilet, and Wangsaputra says it will further decompose in the sewage system.
    


            The first commercial application for Aquafade is likely to be as the casing for LED wristbands worn at concerts: “After just one use, thousands of people just throw them away. They are simple to build, and we're in talks with one of the largest providers of these wristbands,” says Joon Sang Lee.
    


            Next up is a mini PC made with an Aquafade shell that will be released on the Pentaform website. But the duo are thinking about applications beyond electronics: “It would work for any product that is injection molded, or any plastic that is a hard shell, so even luggage, car interiors, watches, sunglasses, even furniture” says Wangsaputra, hinting at the possibility of licensing Aquafade to third parties.
    


            For now, Aquafade is double the cost of regular ABS plastic, which it would replace. But Wangsaputra says that that amounts to 5 to 10% of the overall cost of an electronic product, and that mass production will make it cheaper.
    


            Peter Edwards, emeritus professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Oxford, who's not involved with Aquafade, calls it “an interesting development,” but wonders whether the dissolved plastic will persist in the environment and ultimately end up as microplastic. The Aquafade team acknowledge that they have not yet fully investigated how the solution would biodegrade in the long term.

            Michael Shaver, a professor of Polymer Science at the University of Manchester, who's also not involved with Aquafade, shares some reservations about its sustainability, noting that there are questions around the mechanism, safety and rate of biodegradation, but adding that in waste water systems in the developed world, this is generally well controlled when it comes to PVOH, which is well known from dishwasher and laundry pods.
    


            However, he adds, the impact of the waterproof coating on this degradation needs more clarity. “The devil is in the details here — electronics have high specifications for their plastics. Some need to be very good (electrical) insulators or they may need to be fire retardant,” he says. “And they certainly all need to have an exceptional weathering performance to ensure a long life — I can see this being the biggest technical hurdle.”

            The big question as global stock sell-offs point to another week of plunging markets in the US is how much pain President Donald Trump is prepared to inflict to test his tariff theories.
    


            Trump said Sunday evening that he's “open to talking” to world leaders about new deals as he put a brave face on the chaos unleashed by his trade wars after a weekend playing golf at his exclusive Florida properties. Trump also claimed that he'd spoken to “many countries” and that despite fury abroad over his “Liberation Day” trade attacks, “They're being very nice.”
    


            But as he flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One, stocks tumbled at the opening in Tokyo, leading Asian markets downward, and US futures suggested more huge losses are likely on Wall Street on Monday.
    


            “What's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it'll be a country like no other,” Trump said, while downplaying stock losses that have damaged the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
    


            “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said.

            With markets closed over the weekend after days of pummeling losses, the administration had the chance to take stock. But there is no fresh clarity over its strategy as the political stakes become more fraught.
    


            Top officials sent conflicting signals Sunday over whether Trump sees the economic warfare he unleashed last week as a lever for near-term dealmaking — or whether he's serious about a bid to remake the world economy that could take years.
    


            The confusion came against a backdrop of rising discomfort among some Republican lawmakers about the trade onslaught and as massive crowds across the country held anti-Trump protests in the largest show of dissent of his second term.
    


            The president and his senior aides also seem oblivious to anxiety in the country over the possibility his policies could cause a recession — or feel so sure in their views they don't really have to care. Trump posted a video of himself teeing off in Florida, and the White House put out a bizarre statement noting his win in a golf club championship match.
    


            It was a reminder that Trump and his millionaire and billionaire friends don't share the worries of regular American families, who are concerned about their retirement savings and how they'll afford groceries and cars when tariffs hike prices. While the president insists his plans for tax cuts will leave everyone more prosperous, he's still taking a gamble after winning a second term in part because voters felt the Biden administration did a poor job tackling inflation.
    


            The rationale for Trump's tariffs on 185 nations and territories is that the rest of the world has spent decades ripping off America and that the most aggressive protectionism in decades will return jobs to hurting US industrial heartlands.
    


            It's true that the profits of globalization — which saw many US jobs disappear overseas — have not been equally shared. But the United States is the richest, most powerful nation in history, and profited most from the free trading system Trump seeks to destroy.
    


            And the impact of his bigger-than-expected tariffs threatens to cause so much disruption that it throws the US and the world into a recession, causing huge job losses and wrecking the finances of millions of people. Such fears are partly behind the meltdown on global markets last week and fears that worse is to come.
    


            It was left up to Trump's Cabinet on Sunday to try to explain the method behind his tariff warfare, an approach he's long wanted to implement but that many economists regard as foolish and dangerous.
    


            CNN's Jake Tapper asked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins how long the tariff chaos would last and whether it was a negotiating tactic. Her answer laid bare the policy contradiction that is causing deep uncertainty and haunting stock markets.
    


            “This is a national security issue. This is about reshoring thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs,” Rollins said on “State of the Union,” seeming to confirm that Trump is bent on a fundamental reordering of the global economy with an attempt to re-create the manufacturing strength of the height of the industrial era.

            But Rollins then said that 50 countries were “burning the phone lines into the White House” and implied the tariffs were meant simply as leverage. “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government,” she said.
    


            This was consistent with Trump's later remarks on Air Force One that he was willing to talk to China and the European Union about reducing trade deficits with the United States. The comments might be seen in some quarters as an attempt to limit the damage expected to hit stock markets Monday.
    


            Bilateral negotiations with scores of countries could conceivably yield new trading conditions that could improve the position of the United States. But such an approach would not be sufficient to re-create the late 19th century golden age of manufacturing that Trump is promising. And it's questionable whether the gains would justify the economic destruction the president is wreaking.
    


            The administration seems to be interested only in the kind of “deals” that would require other countries to embrace total capitulation. “This is not a negotiation,” Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” He warned that offering the US a zero tariff wouldn't be sufficient, and signaled nations must cede to White House demands on other issues, including non-tariff barriers and currencies.
    


            While Trump's concern for Americans left behind by the 21st century economy is laudable, his obsession with trade deficits and the trade in goods represents an archaic worldview. It ignores how the US economy has become a tech and services behemoth and how it will never be able to produce basic goods such as clothes as economically as lower-wage economies abroad. Making basic goods in the United States would cost more, would raise the cost of living and would harm the prosperity of many Americans.

Trump's ‘reciprocal' tariffs aren't quite what they seem. Here's the real story



            While Rollins seemed to be following the example of Trump last week by suggesting tariffs were leverage, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dug in on Sunday.
    


            “There is no postponing,” he said of the duties due to come into force Wednesday. “They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,” Lutnick said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” He added: “The president needs to reset global trade. … The countries of the world are ripping us off, and it's got to end.”
    


            Lutnick appears to be betting that US strength can force weaker nations to fold. He told CNN's Pamela Brown last week that it would be unwise to retaliate. “If you're angry and you fight back to the greatest customer in the world, you're going to lose. We are the sumo wrestler of this world.”
    


            Such is the power of the US that it might triumph in one-on-one showdowns with most other nations. But the administration rarely talks about the impact of multifront tariff retaliation simultaneously from all the great trading powers. China, for instance, now faces a cumulative 54% tariff on its imports to the US, which means that buying power of US shoppers will be severely constrained since — despite Trump's insistence that other countries pay for tariffs — consumers will foot the bill. This could hammer US retailers and squelch consumer confidence, setting up the conditions that could lead to a recession. China also imposed a 34% tariff on US imports, making a tough-to-crack market even more difficult for American firms.
    


            Enormous losses on US stock markets last week — the Dow and the S&P 500 were both down by more than 5% on Friday alone — alarmed millions of Americans whose retirements depend on their 401(k) plans.
    


            But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted there didn't need to be a recession and dismissed the long-term impact of stock market losses, using words like “choppiness” and “adjustment process” to explain the panic. And speaking on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Bessent rejected the idea that people who want to retire soon had taken a serious blow. “Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening,” Bessent said. He added: “The reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.”
    


            Technically, Bessent is correct, and over years and decades, stocks have been a sound investment, through market corrections and recessions. But his comments were the latest remarkably tone-deaf commentary from a multimillionaire Cabinet member. Bessent is a wealthy former hedge fund manager.
    


            Such attitudes raise the question of whether the president's strategy will cost him public support — especially if the tariffs remain in place for months and price hikes begin to really punish families. Recent national surveys from The Wall Street Journal, CBS News and Marquette University Law School, all taken before Trump's “Liberation Day” announcement, found majorities of Americans disapproved of the president's tariff policies.
    


            Some Republican senators are already nervous. Several have signed on to a measure backed by GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley to require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would have to approve them within 60 days or they would expire.
    


            Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat co-leading the effort with Grassley, said Sunday that bipartisan momentum was growing behind the bill and that seven GOP senators were now listed as co-sponsors in an unusual break with Trump.
    


            “I'm sure they listen to their constituents. Consumer challenges are already starting to surface, and certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people,” Cantwell said on CBS. The measure, however, faces a far harder path in the House, and it's doubtful at this point it could amass veto-proof majorities.
    


            After months of mourning their November loss, Democrats are showing signs of life. A liberal candidate won a wide victory in a race for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat last week. And the size of protests against Trump and Elon Musk in many cities Saturday may augur an awakening of a resistance movement more a year and a half before the 2026 midterm elections.
    


            But Trump is showing no sign of a course correction. He wrote on his Truth Social network on Saturday that “we have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,' but not any longer.” The president added: “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH.” The next day, he was back on the golf course.

Patricia Heaton shared her thoughts on the message behind her new faith-based movie "The Unbreakable Boy."

Some know me as Debra Barone, others as Frankie Heck. To my four boys, I am simply "Mom" — the name I cherish most. Though they are now grown, I will never forget the first time Sam, John, Joe and Dan first said it. That single word, a milestone, formed a bond only a parent and child can understand. Yet, for many women facing infertility, that same word carries a pain only they can truly know. 

There has been much discussion lately about the importance of having children. But if the conversation stops there, we miss the bigger picture. It is not just about having kids — it is about having a sense of family. If we overlook that truth, we risk turning a deeply personal experience into a divisive debate. 

Family has always been at the heart of my life and career. Portraying mothers on screen and raising four sons with my husband, David Hunt, has given me profound insights into the joys and challenges of parenthood. Playing characters like Debra Barone in "Everybody Loves Raymond" and Frankie Heck in "The Middle" allowed me to explore the complexities of motherhood and family — its humor, chaos, and love — reflecting the diverse experiences that so many women navigate daily.

Off-screen, my greatest role has been being "Mom." My life is permanently enriched by my sons — through the endless soccer games, band practices, school dances, Thanksgivings with kids running wild, summer vacations, bedtime stories, road trips, science fairs, driving lessons, pillow and blanket forts, college applications, playing catch in the back yard, school plays and so much more. But I know this journey to parenthood is not the same for everyone.

April marks National Infertility Awareness Month. Here in the United States, approximately 12% of women aged 15 to 49 — more than 10 million — struggle to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term. The weight of infertility can feel overwhelming, made heavier by the assumption that becoming a parent is something that simply happens.  

The heartbreak of infertility is often lived in silence, which is why my husband, David, and I produced the feature adult comedy "Unexpected," a film about a couple navigating infertility and finding their unique path to family.

Infertility is more than a medical condition. It is an emotional journey that tests identity, relationships, and faith. The societal expectation that parenthood is a given can make this journey even more isolating. But families are not defined solely by biology. Adoption, for instance, brings approximately 135,000 children into new loving homes each year.  

Yet, when discussing children in our culture, we rarely discuss what it means to build a family. The conversation often focuses on birth rates, fertility rates and the economic impact. But these numbers miss the real human experience. Every child deserves a loving home, and every hopeful parent deserves to know that there are many paths to creating a family — paths that deserve just as much recognition and support as traditional childbirth.

My family, friends and audience members who have seen "Unexpected" and experienced infertility firsthand have shared how lonely it can be. For too long, they have felt overlooked in conversations about parenthood, as if their journey matters less. But it does matter. David and I hope "Unexpected" offers hope, reminding viewers that while the road to parenthood may be uncertain, the destination — a loving family — is possible in many ways.

If we truly value family, we should recognize that building one is not a one-size-fits-all journey. A family's strength is not measured by how it is formed but by the love, commitment and faith that hold it together. 

From Debra Barone to Frankie Heck to Patricia Heaton, the throughline of my life has always been family. To those experiencing the uphill battle of building a family, I hope you find support to walk this path with others and faith to believe that your dreams of family — however they unfold — are possible. 

Patricia Heaton is an actress, producer and author best known for her roles in "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "The Middle." She and her husband, David Hunt, co-produced the film "Unexpected," which David directed – a story about infertility, adoption and the many ways families come to be. It is available on Amazon Prime and other streaming companies.

Fox News Digital spoke with Jon Brewton, the founder and CEO of Data2 and a U.S. Air Force veteran, about immigration at the northern border.

A "quiet crisis" is emerging at the U.S.-Canada border, as one expert proposes an unconventional solution to fight human smuggling: leveraging advanced technologies like artificial intelligence.

While national attention is largely fixed on the southern border, an increasingly concerning situation is unfolding along the country's northern border, said Jon Brewton, the founder and CEO of Data2 and a U.S. Air Force Veteran.

"U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has seen a fairly alarming increase in illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and even encountering individuals on the terrorist watch list," he told Fox News Digital. "And as difficult as securing the southern border has been, the northern border is twice as long."

While the vast majority of illegal crossings happen at the southern border, officials have been warning for years that the northern line has seen an increase.

During testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Kash Patel told lawmakers last week adversaries such as China and Russia have started to target the northern U.S. border with Canada.

"The enemy adapts," Patel said.

The Trump administration has overseen a dramatic shift at the U.S. southern border since taking office in January, with the number of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded encounters plummeting by 90% in most sectors compared to the same time period last year. The administration has poured in resources to stop the spiraling immigration situation at the southern border.

The sudden silence there came after record-setting numbers of illegal crossings during the four years of the Biden administration, a trend that also saw a dramatic increase in attempted crossings by immigrants outside of North and Latin America.

Chinese nationals were among the most likely to attempt illegal crossings, with the number of crossings from citizens of the country rising to over 24,000 in 2023, a more than 5,200% increase from the 450 encounters just a year earlier, according to CBP data.

Overall, Patel told lawmakers that between 2022 and 2025, roughly 178,000 Chinese nationals attempted to cross the southern border.

CBP's Swanton Sector, which spans 295 miles of the border with Canada and covers all of Vermont and parts of upstate New York and New Hampshire, has seen more apprehensions in the last fiscal year than the previous 13 years combined.

According to a report on CBS 19, the sector has seen 15,000 apprehensions in the 10 months of fiscal year 2024, the largest volume ever recorded by the sector, over 14,000 more than was recorded in fiscal year 2024.

The report noted that migrants from 85 different countries have attempted to illegally cross in the area.

Brewton said that there are unconventional ways that technology can be used to secure the 5,525 miles of border between the U.S. and Canada.

"And so there are some non-traditional ways that we can use technology as a capability multiplier," he said. "That's just something a little bit different than just hiring more agents and building physical processes in what is a really substantial amount of land that is rocky in territory, cold and snowy and hard to manage."

"I think that is where AI can help change our trajectory and success on the northern border."

Brewton explained that AI could play a powerful role in border security – enhancing surveillance, radar systems, and open-source intelligence, while also helping agents monitor water crossings more effectively.

"And using radar systems to understand the full scope of intelligence that's at our disposal, but using really, really smart tools to combine that intelligence in a smart way and use it at scale," he said. 

Traditional security systems operate in silos – each collects and processes data separately – but using AI models could give a full, connected picture, he explained.

People often misunderstand border security as just invasive surveillance, Brewton said, but when done right – especially with well-designed AI – it can actually improve both security and privacy by being smarter and more targeted.

"A lot of people really assume border security primarily means privacy, invasive surveillance, like facial recognition and biometrics and the roles that they can play within sort of pattern recognition. It's really about identifying suspicious behaviors and connecting different pieces of intelligence to individuals that we're monitoring," he said.

Brewton emphasized that citizens should have both strong safety measures and strong protection of their rights.

"Well-designed AI delivers enhanced protections for Americans and our communities while maintaining the transparency and accountability that our citizens, and quite frankly, our government, require," he said. "So if we're smart about what we do, we can make really, really impactful changes to what we're doing on the northern border and the southern border."

The Trump administration has pressured Canada to enhance its border security to stop the upward trend of the flow of migrants and fentanyl by implementing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10% tariff.

"I know that the president's agenda has really been to try to understand how we can work with Canada and seek concessions from our neighbors to the north to help secure the border in both directions," he said. "The government really needs to use all of its tools at its disposal."

            Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs, framing the move as a necessary economic reset and downplaying severe market volatility and uncertainty.
    


            President Donald Trump has long cast himself as a dealmaker — and has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture about the possibility of relief.
    


            Trump last week announced tariffs of at least 10% across all countries, with rates going even higher for 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders.” The universal 10% rate went into effect Saturday, while the customized rates will take effect Wednesday.
    


            More than 50 countries have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs in the aftermath of Trump's announcement, officials said Sunday.

Trump's steep new tariffs loom after a day of protest across US



            That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”
    


﻿Though the president has previously paused tariffs to allow for negotiation in other situations, Lutnick made clear that the administration plans to follow through on the tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday.
    


            “There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious. The president needs to reset global trade,” he said, adding, “He announced it, and he wasn't kidding, the tariffs are coming.”
    


            Meanwhile, Trump said Sunday evening that he has been fielding calls from tech executives and world leaders over the weekend on tariffs.
    


            “I've spoken to many countries. … Every country is calling and being very solicitous, very, very nice,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.
    


            Trump indicated Sunday he was open to negotiating — if countries address their trade deficits with the US.
    


            “I do want to solve the deficit problem we have in China, with the European Union and other nations, and they're going to have to do that. And if they want to talk about that, I'm open to talking,” the president said.
    


CNN has reported that the Trump administration is in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about the possibility of bespoke trade deals, with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to meet with Trump at the White House on Monday for direct talks.
    


            But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


            “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,” he said during an appearance on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
    


            Navarro added, “But I want to just say to the world here: If you want to come and talk to us, don't say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it. It's the non-tariff cheating. Stop manipulating their currency, stop dumping stuff in.”
    


            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was also unable to clearly state whether tariffs are here to stay or whether there was room for deals.
    


            “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

Elon Musk hopes for ‘zero-tariff situation' between US and EU



            And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump has “created maximum leverage for himself.”
    


            “It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks,” he told NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Elon Musk, one of Trump's most influential advisors and the face of the administration's Department of Government Efficiency, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States, indicating room for negotiation.
    


            “At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said in a video-link interview with Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister and the leader of the far-right League party, during a League congress in Florence.
    


            On Sunday, the administration officials repeatedly downplayed the economic upheaval rocking markets. By the time the market closed Friday, the Dow had posted its biggest back-to-back losses since March 2020, during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening, and stocks were set to open sharply lower Monday.
    


            Navarro urged American investors to “sit tight” and “not to panic.”
    


            “The smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in. Because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we've ever seen under the Trump policies. … People should just sit tight — let that market find its bottom. Don't get shook out by the panic in the media, and life is going to be beautiful under Donald John Trump,” he said.
    


            With economists escalating concerns about the possibility of recession, Bessent said he rejected the assumption.
    


            “There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity,” he said.
    


            Goldman Sachs analysts in a note last week said economic growth driven by Trump's fiscal policies would not be able to make up for the damage done by his massive tariff plan.

Trump's ‘reciprocal' tariffs aren't quite what they seem. Here's the real story



            Rollins took issue with the characterization of the markets crashing and characterized it as an adjustment.
    


            “As the economy, the market, begins to adjust, we will see a more positive — as we move, I believe, very quickly,” she told CNN.
    


            Rollins also indicated there could be support for farmers impacted by the tariffs, pointing to previous relief during Trump's first term.
    


            “We have to be prepared that if there is longer-term damage … we will make sure that we have the funds in working with the senators and working with the appropriators, that we can do what we did last time,” she said.
    


            For his part, the president returned to familiar patterns as anxious Americans watched their retirement accounts plummet, spending each of the past four days at one of his South Florida golf properties.
    


            As protesters assembled to demonstrate against Trump's tariff policies across the country — including in West Palm Beach — the White House offered an official statement announcing that the president won a golf tournament at his club Saturday.
    


            “The President won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, FL, and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow,” the statement said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California told NBC's “Meet the Press” that the split-screen image “may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency”
    


            “That is — the president out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames,” he said.

            An image of and quote from Harriet Tubman have been removed from a National Parks webpage about the “Underground Railroad,” following several prominent changes to government websites under the Trump administration.
    


            The National Parks Service webpage for the “Underground Railroad” used to lead with a quote from Tubman, the railroad's most famous “conductor”, a comparison on the Wayback Machine between the webpage on January 21 and March 19 shows. Both the quote and an image of Tubman have since been removed, along with several references to “enslaved” people and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.
    


            The Washington Post first reported on the changes. The webpage now leads with commemorative stamps of various civil rights leaders with text including the phrase “Black/White Cooperation.” Whereas previously, the article started with a description of enslaved peoples' efforts to free themselves and the organization of the Underground Railroad after the Fugitive Slave Act, the article now starts with two paragraphs that emphasize the “American ideals of liberty and freedom” and do not specifically mention slavery.
    


            Tubman's removal from the “Underground Railroad” page “is both offensive and absurd,” Fergus Bordewich, a historian and the author of a book about the Underground Railroad, told CNN Sunday. He described the new webpage as “diminished in value by its brevity.”
    


            “To oversimplify history is to distort it,” Bordewich went on. “Americans are not infants: they can handle complex and challenging historical narratives. They do not need to be protected from the truth.”
    


            Janell Hobson, a professor of women's studies at the University at Albany, State University of New York, described Tubman as “one of our greatest American heroes and definitely the greatest liberator in this nation” in an email to CNN.
    


            “I hope that National Parks Service realize they owe it to her and other heroes like her to stand in the truth of what this history has been,” she said.
    


            There is a separate National Park Service webpage dedicated to Harriet Tubman, who was born into slavery in Maryland before fleeing to Philadelphia. She returned to Maryland over a dozen times to help free other slaves, guiding them through the “Underground Railroad,” a secret network of routes and safe houses. The park service webpage on Tubman does not seem to have been changed since January 28, 2025.
    


            CNN has reached out to the National Park Service for comment.

            The past few months have also seen other controversial changes to government websites as the Trump administration enacts a campaign to eliminate DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion. The removal of the words “transgender” and “queer” from a National Parks Service webpage about Stonewall Monument in New York City triggered protests in February.
    


            In March, the Pentagon seemingly took down a page about Jackie Robinson, the trailblazing baseball player who became the first Black Major League Baseball athlete in the modern era, before restoring it.
    


            Articles about topics seemingly unrelated to DEI – including the Holocaust, cancer awareness, and sexual assault – have also been removed from Pentagon webpages. Pentagon officials were instructed to search for keywords like “racism,” “ethnicity,” “LGBTQ,” “history” and “first” when identifying articles and photos to remove, multiple defense officials previously told CNN.
    


            In his second term, President Donald Trump has taken multiple steps to take control of American cultural and historical institutions, gutting the board of trustees at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC and targeting the Smithsonian Institution in an executive order in late March.
    


            In his order, Trump specifically identified the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum as carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.

Chief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The temporary order comes hours after a Justice Department emergency appeal to the Supreme Court arguing U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.

The administration has conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.

But he is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.

Xinis gave the administration until just before midnight to "facilitate and effectuate" Abrego Garcia's return.

"The district court's injunction—which requires Abrego Garcia's release from the custody of a foreign sovereign and return to the United States by midnight on Monday—is patently unlawful," Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers, casting the order as one in "a deluge of unlawful injunctions" judges have issued to slow President Donald Trump's agenda.

The Justice Department appeal was directed to Roberts because he handles appeals from Maryland.

The Trump administration is separately asking the Supreme Court to allow Trump to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to the same Salvadoran prison under an 18th century wartime law.

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, denied the administration's request for a stay. "There is no question that the government screwed up here," Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in a brief opinion accompanying the unanimous denial.

The White House has described Abrego Garcia's deportation as an "administrative error" but has also cast him an MS-13 gang member. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said there is no evidence he was in MS-13.

"The Executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny," Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote in a response filed moments after Roberts issued his temporary pause.

Xinis wrote that the decision to arrest him and send him to El Salvador appears to be "wholly lawless," explaining that little to no evidence supports a "vague, uncorroborated" allegation that Abrego Garcia was once an MS-13 member.

Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.

He had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen.

In 2019, an immigration judge barred the U.S. from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.

A Justice Department lawyer conceded in a court hearing that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported. Attorney General Pam Bondi later removed the lawyer, Erez Reuveni, from the case and placed him on leave.

Microsoft terminated the employment of two software engineers who protested at company events Friday over the Israeli military's use of the company's artificial intelligence products, according to documents viewed by CNBC.

Ibtihal Aboussad, a software engineer in the company's AI division who is based in Canada, was fired Monday over "just cause, wilful misconduct, disobedience or wilful neglect of duty," according to one of the documents.

Another Microsoft software engineer, Vaniya Agrawal, had said she would resign from the company on April 11. But Microsoft terminated her role Monday, according to an internal message viewed by CNBC. The company wrote that it "has decided to make your resignation immediately effective today."

Both employees chose Microsoft's 50th anniversary event to publicly voice their criticism. 

What Microsoft had hoped would be a celebratory period has turned into a brutal few days for the company, which is being hit, along with the rest of the market, by President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs. 

The tariffs are a topic that CEO Satya Nadella and his two predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, were forced to uncomfortably confront Friday in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.

"As a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good," Ballmer said about the tariffs.

Meanwhile, the celebration itself captured headlines more for the protesters' shared message than for Microsoft's half-century of accomplishments.

The first interruption Friday came from Aboussad, who stood up during Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's speech.

"Mustafa, shame on you," Aboussad said as she walked toward the stage at the event in Redmond, Washington. "You claim that you care for using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand people have died, and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region."

Aboussad also called Suleyman a "war profiteer."

"You have blood on your hands," she said before being swiftly escorted out. "All of Microsoft has blood on its hands."

Shortly after the interruption, Aboussad sent an email, which was viewed by CNBC, to Suleyman and other Microsoft executives, including CEO Satya Nadella, finance chief Amy Hood, operating chief Carolina Dybeck Happe, and Brad Smith, the company's president.

"I spoke up today because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice," Aboussad wrote in the email. "This is especially true when I've witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue."

"I did not sign up to write code that violates human rights," Aboussad wrote, adding a link to a "No Azure for Apartheid" petition.

Microsoft wrote in the internal message to Aboussad that her email to executives served as "an admission that you deliberately and willfully engaged in your earlier misconduct." The company also said Aboussad could have raised concerns "confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman."

Microsoft "has concluded that your misconduct was designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event," the company wrote.

"Immediate cessation of your employment is the only appropriate response," Microsoft said.

At a separate Microsoft event with executives Friday, Agrawal interrupted a speech by Nadella with a similar protest and also sent an email to executives afterward.

"You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the Microsoft 50th anniversary," Agrawal wrote in the email, which was viewed by CNBC. "Over the past 1.5 years, I've grown more aware of Microsoft's growing role in the military-industrial complex."

Agrawal wrote that Microsoft is "complicit" as a "digital weapons manufacturer that powers surveillance, apartheid, and genocide" and that "by working for this company, we are all complicit."

A Microsoft spokesperson said Friday that the company is committed to adhering to the highest standards of business practices.

"We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate," the spokesperson said.

— CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed reporting.

President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs could lead Apple to raise the price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max by as much as $350 in the U.S., UBS analysts estimated Monday.

The iPhone 16 Pro Max is Apple's highest-end iPhone on the market, and currently retails for $1,199. UBS is predicting a nearly 30% increase in retail price for units that were manufactured in China.

Apple's $999 phone, the iPhone 16 Pro, could see a smaller $120 price increase, if the company has it manufactured in India, the UBS analysts wrote.

Shares of Apple have plummeted 20% over the past three trading days, wiping out nearly $640 billion in market cap, on concern that Trump's tariffs will force the company to raise prices just as consumers are losing buying power.

"Based on the checks we have done at a company level, there is a lot of uncertainty about how the increased cost sharing will be done with suppliers, the extent to which costs can be passed on to end-customers, and the duration of tariffs," UBS analyst Sundeep Gantori wrote in the note.

Apple, which does the majority of its manufacturing in China, is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war. China has a potential incoming 54% tariff rate — before new increases were proposed Monday. Smaller tariffs were also placed on secondary production locations, such as India, Vietnam and Thailand.

JPMorgan Chase analysts predicted last week that Apple could raise its prices 6% across the world to offset the U.S. tariffs. Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or it could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share.

If Apple were to relocate iPhone production to the U.S. — a move that most supply chain experts say is impossible — Wedbush's Dan Ives predicts an iPhone could cost $3,500.

Morgan Stanley analysts on Friday said Apple could absorb additional tariff costs of about $34 billion annually. They wrote that although Apple has diversified its production in recent years to additional countries — so-called friendshoring — those countries could also end up with tariffs, reducing Apple's flexibility.

After last week's "reciprocal tariff announcement, there becomes very little differentiation in friend shoring vs. manufacturing in China — if the product is not made in the US, it will be subject to a hefty import tariff," Morgan Stanley wrote.

Last week, the firm estimated that Apple may raise its prices across its product lines in the U.S. by 17% to 18%. Apple could also get exemptions from the U.S. government for its products.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal, took to X on Monday to lambaste President Donald Trump's tariffs, calling them a "structural, permanent tax on the American consumer." He also said Trump appears to be the "most high tax American President in generations."

"Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things," Kimbal Musk wrote on social network X, one the companies in his brother's extensive portfolio.

The younger Musk owns a restaurant chain called The Kitchen, is a board member at Tesla, and former director at SpaceX and Chipotle. He has also co-founded and invested in other food and tech startups, including Square Roots, an indoor farming company, and Nova Sky Stories, a creator of drone light shows that he bought from Intel.

Elon Musk is a top adviser to Trump, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an effort to drastically cut federal spending, largely through layoffs, and consolidate or eliminate agencies and regulations. However, his relationship with some key figures in the Trump administration has been showing signs of strain in recent days as the president's sweeping tariffs have led to a dramatic selloff in stocks, including for Tesla, which is down 42% this year and just wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Over the weekend, Elon Musk took aim at Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, disparaging his qualifications in a post on X.

"A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing," Musk wrote, after Navarro told CNN on Saturday that, "The market will find a bottom" and that the Dow will "hit 50,000 during Trump's term." It's currently at about 38,200.

Musk also said that Navarro hasn't built "s--t." Navarro told CNBC on Monday that Musk is, "not a car manufacturer" but rather a "car assembler," dependent on parts from Japan, China and Taiwan.

Tesla was seeking a more moderate approach to trade and tariffs in a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative.

According to Federal Election Commission filings, Kimbal Musk this year has contributed funds to the Libertarian National Committee and Libertarian Party of Connecticut. Last year, while his brother became the biggest financial backer and promoter of Trump, Kimbal donated to Unite America PAC, a group that markets itself as a "a philanthropic venture fund that invests in nonpartisan election reform to foster a more representative and functional government."

A representative for Kimbal Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke is changing his company's approach to hiring in the age of artificial intelligence.

Employees will be expected to prove why they "cannot get what they want done using AI" before asking for more headcount and resources, Lutke wrote in a memo to staffers that he posted to X on Monday.

"What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?" Lutke wrote in the memo, which was sent to employees late last month. "This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects."

Lutke also said there's a "fundamental expectation" across Shopify that employees embrace AI in their daily work, saying it has been a "multiplier" of productivity for those who have used it.

"I've seen many of these people approach implausible tasks, ones we wouldn't even have chosen to tackle before, with reflexive and brilliant usage of AI to get 100X the work done," Lutke wrote.

The company, which sells web-based software that helps online retailers manage sales and run their operations, will factor AI usage into performance reviews, he added.

The directive comes as tech companies have collectively earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for investing in AI development this year. Shopify has rolled out AI tools for its merchants, including a chatbot called Sidekick and a suite of automation tools, which it dubs "Shopify Magic."

Just as they're plowing money into AI, tech companies are looking to streamline costs in other areas, either by discontinuing money-losing projects or through layoffs. In 2024, there were roughly 152,000 roles eliminated across 549 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi.

Shopify's total headcount fell to 8,100 at the end of December from 8,300 a year earlier, according to its latest annual filing. The Canadian company eliminated 14% of its workforce in 2022 and 20% the following year.

At an investor event last month hosted by Morgan Stanley, Shopify CFO Jeff Hoffmeister said the company can "keep headcount relatively flat," though employee-related costs could vary due to salary differences. He noted that "a higher comp, high-end AI engineer" can lift compensation costs even if headcount is staying the same.

WATCH: AI will continue to rally over the next two years

President Donald Trump's tariff plan is making stock market history — and Wall Street is reeling.

The president's latest and most aggressive round of tariffs has fueled the worst market sell-off since 2020, leaving Wall Street on edge as concerns swirl over the economic impact of the tariffs and the growing possibility of a recession in 2025.

Stocks extended their losses on Monday, with all three benchmark indexes diving into the red and the S&P 500 briefly entering a bear market as Trump doubled down on his resolve to lower the trade deficit.

Here's what Wall Street's top minds have been saying over the past 24 hours.

The US is likely already mired in a downturn — and stocks could plummet another 20% before they find a bottom, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said.

Fink, who spoke at an event at the Economic Club of New York on Monday, added that he was concerned the economy had more inflationary pressures than the market was pricing in.

Still, he saw the sell-off in stocks as "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity," he said, adding that he didn't believe tariffs were creating systemic risks to the economy.

Economic chaos is likely if Trump doesn't pause or scale back tariffs immediately, the billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman said Monday in a post on X.

Ackman, who endorsed Trump during the presidential race, urged the commander in chief to call off the tariffs for 90 days to allow the US and other countries to negotiate over trade policy.

"If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocketbooks, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," the Pershing Square founder wrote.

In a separate post, Ackman said his firm would not sell its shares in the US stock market affected by tariffs during the sell-off.

"We will suffer mark-to-market losses if the market crashes, but we will not be sellers in a declining market," Ackman said, adding: "Over the long term, we are exposed to the health of our country and its economy. This is my only investment 'conflict' if you want to call it that."

The stock sell-off could get even worse, said Boaz Weinstein, a famed hedge funder and the founder of Saba Capital Management. That's because Trump's trade war could rattle the bond market and spark a wave of bankruptcies, he told Bloomberg TV.

"This is not going to get fixed tomorrow. I believe you cannot put the genie back in the bottle," Weinstein told the outlet in an interview published on Monday, pointing to reciprocal tariffs from China and other knock-on effects from Trump's tariff plan.

"The avalanche has really just started," he added. "The hit could be faster and the bankruptcy rate could spike much faster than other crises."

Weinstein said he saw a "real possibility" of the US entering a severe recession, pointing to how the Smoot-Hawley tariffs worsened the economic situation leading into the Great Depression.

"There might be something in between that stops the boulder, but I'm very concerned about a crash," he said.

In his latest annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of the impact of tariffs, saying the steep duties on US imports could slow growth and raise inflation.

"The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession," the CEO wrote.

Dimon also mentioned stagflation, a scenario where economic growth remains sluggish while inflation stays high. Economists say such an outcome, which plagued the US economy in the 1970s, would be even harder for policymakers to deal with than a recession, as inflationary pressures would prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.

"This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates," he added.

Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his stance against tariffs Monday in a post on X.

"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear in the interview you cite," the top investor wrote in response to another post, which featured a video clip of a previous interview with Druckenmiller on CNBC.

In the interview, Druckenmiller said he saw tariffs within "the 10% range" as the "lesser of two evils," adding that he believed that duties on US imports were "simply a consumption tax" partly paid for by foreign countries.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that many business leaders believe the United States economy is already in a significant downturn.

"Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York.

"One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already," Fink added.

The asset management executive also said that he thinks the tariff policies of President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation and make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, as the central bank often does during recessions.

"This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that. I'm much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that's going to bring rates up much higher than they are today," Fink said.

Pricing in the fed funds futures market currently suggests that traders expect the central bank to lower its benchmark interest rate by at least 1 percentage point by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which could be four cuts of 0.25 percentage point.

BlackRock as a firm held more than $11 trillion in assets as of the end of 2024, spread across public and private investments.

Fink's comments were broadcast on Bloomberg Television.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Trump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden.

Trump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the acquisition again to assist "in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate," according to a presidential action issued by the White House.

U.S. Steel shares spiked about 9% in reaction to the decision.

— Spencer Kimball

Restaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending.

Investors pulled back across restaurant segments, from fast food to full-service dining.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

"Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk," Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Read the full story.

— Amelia Lucas

U.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say.

The industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. And airline stocks have fallen as investor concerns have grown about Trump's tariff policies, among other things.

"The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be the reality six months from now," Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said.

TD Cowen, in a note Friday wrote, "We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist U.S. to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines."

"We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers," TD Cowen said.

— Leslie Josephs and Michele Luhn

A large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC — 69% — said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump's sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week.

And more than half of them said they expect that the downturn will come this year.

"This is the Trump recession," said one of the 22 CEOs who received the flash survey.

"Disappointingly stupid and illogical," another CEO said of the tariffs.

— Kevin Breuninger

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy.

"Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters," Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." 

Those non-tariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said.

Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a "small first start."

— Jesse Pound

Tech stocks wobbled after Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans.

Apple shares have tumbled more than 5%, Tesla shares are down about 4% and Microsoft shares have slipped more than 1%. Shares of Google are mostly flat, but Amazon, Nvidia and Meta are all up around 1%.

The Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff last week. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onset of the pandemic and entered a bear market.

--Ashley Capoot and Samantha Subin

Trump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News.

Trump's golf rounds in Florida are like "going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery," the official said.

"The economy will be fine," the official said.

— Dan Mangan

Trump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports.

Trump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the "reciprocal" duties unveiled at the White House last week.

Trump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand.

China's action came "despite my warning" that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs "will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set," Trump wrote.

"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"

— Kevin Breuninger

Two Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Union President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU.

"Let's take that deal," Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen's offer. "Much to gain."

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., replied in a tweet, writing, "Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee."

"At some point you have to take YES for an answer," Johnson wrote.

- Dan Mangan

U.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump's latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella.

Trump announced blanket 34% tariffs on Beijing last week, which come on top of existing 20% duties on Chinese imports.

Trump's latest tariff action would slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods, unless China drops its 34% retaliatory tariff on the U.S.

— Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella

Billionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. "will face ruin for years to come" if the Trump administration does not immediately "change course" on its tariff policies.

"The US government can still turn things around, but it must act in the next few hours," the Virgin Group co-founder wrote on X.

"This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come," he wrote.

— Kevin Breuninger

The White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days.

"Fake news," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council.

Trump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, "Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening."

"President Trump is not going to bend," Bartiromo said in the video.

- Dan Mangan

Trump writes that it's "not sustainable" for the U.S. to "lose $1.9 trillion on trade" in a post just now on Truth Social.

Trump's post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can't lose money on trade "and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations."

— Erin Doherty

Tesla shares are trading around 20% lower than they were when Lutnick urged people to "Buy Tesla" last month.

Lutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News.

"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap," Lutnick said. "It'll never be this cheap again."

As it turns out, it would be.

— Dan Mangan

Canada filed a dispute with the the World Trade Organization concerning Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts imported from Canada into the U.S.

Canada requested WTO dispute consultations with the U.S. concerning the new levies, the global trade organization said. The WTO says the request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the organization.

Consultations will give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO.

Canada claims the measures are inconsistent with the U.S.' obligations under various provisions of the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" of 1994.

— Michael Wayland

People who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November's election — and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market.

CNBC's All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters. 

And of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock.

— Dan Mangan

Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk's swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO's trade views and those of the Trump administration.

Navarro told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro "ain't built s---."

Musk appeared to delete that post.

But Musk kept up another post that said "a PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing," a shot at Navarro's alma mater.

"I'll probably see him today in the Oval. It's no big deal," Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk's comments.

Navarro praised Musk's work with DOGE on slashing government spending.

However, he then took a swipe at the billionaire.

"When it comes to tariffs and trade," Navarro said, Musk "is a car manufacturer — but he's not a car manufacturer, he's a car assembler."

Navarro noted that parts of the Tesla cars assembled at its Texas plant are from overseas.

"What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis," he said.

— Kevin Breuninger

"Countries from all over the World are talking to us," Trump wrote on Truth Social, and "tough but fair parameters are being set."

Trump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and "he is sending a top team to negotiate."

"They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs," Trump says in the post, adding, "it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!"

Europe will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariffs.

"Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing.

"So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners." 

Von der Leyen mentioned existing deals with Mexico and Switzerland, and potential deals with India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Europe stands ready to respond to Trump's aggressive tariff agenda with counter measures if necessary, she said, but the region still stands "ready to negotiate" with the U.S. if possible.

Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump's plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all.

"Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won't take long," Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

He then pointed to the first Trump administration securing protective equipment faster than expected at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

"So don't tell me that America doesn't have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff," he said.

A CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump's tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.

Dimon addresses the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, which has become closely read.

"Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, there are some – or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects," Dimon writes.

 "We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products."

"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," he adds.

Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.

His remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should "get over" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.

Elon Musk posted a video on X of Milton Friedman advocating for free trade, in one of the strongest examples yet of the billionaire SpaceX founder's break with Trump on tariffs.

Over the weekend, Musk publicly criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro.

He also said said he hopes Europe and the U.S. can move "to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone," during a virtual appearance at a meeting of Italy's far-right League party.

Musk's comments were at odds with Trump's hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports.

Musk is Trump's biggest campaign donor and the leader of DOGE, Trump's massive effort to slash the federal workforce.

Trump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months.

Ackman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being "indifferent" to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it.

"It was unfair of me to lash out at @howardlutnick," writes Ackman.

"I don't think he is pursuing his self interest. I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don't know how the sausage was made."

The new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.

"I just figured out why @howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes," Ackman wrote Sunday night.

"It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It's an irreconcilable conflict of interest."

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump is touting the steep drop in oil prices — driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession — as a policy win.

"Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place," Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post.

"This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate," he writes. "They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!"

Trump also blames America's past leaders for "allowing this" to happen.

— Christina Wilkie

Trump has two significant public events on his schedule today.

11:00 a.m. ET: Trump will host the World Series-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House, according to his official schedule.

2:30 p.m. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House. 

The last time Netanyahu visited the White House was in February, as the U.S. worked to finalize the second phase of a cease fire deal in Gaza. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza.  

CNBC's latest CEO survey finds that a majority of the CEOs polled say they now expect a recession before the end of the year. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate.

One in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump's tariff policies.

Traders rushed to buy protection against dollar swings, pushing the cost of hedging to the highest level since Donald Trump's election last November.

The cost of one-week option contracts tied to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed for the third day in a row, and the eighth time in the last nine trading sessions, suggesting traders are positioning for more volatility ahead. The one-month hedge also rose.

It's the world's second-largest gold producer, and its New York Stock Exchange ticker is “GOLD.” But these days Barrick Gold Corp. sees its future in copper.

The company is proposing to change its name to Barrick Mining Corp. — dropping “gold” from the title — in the latest sign the Canadian mining company is pulling away from its storied bullion roots.

President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" announcement is spurring members of his own party to attempt to rein in his tariff powers.

Several Republican senators have signed onto the Trade Review Act, a bipartisan bill sponsored by Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.

The bill would make tariffs imposed by Trump — or any future president — disappear after 60 days if not approved by Congress.

It comes after four GOP senators backed an effort to block Trump from imposing tariffs on Canada.

Despite the bill's bipartisan support, it doesn't have a clear path to becoming law, and the White House says that Trump would veto it. But it's the clearest sign yet that Trump's trade policies are dividing members of his own party.

It's not just moderate Republicans who are backing the bill. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Senate Minority Leader, has also signed on. Several other Trump allies have been critical of tariffs, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.

Here are the 7 GOP senators who have cosponsored the bill so far:

The US Constitution gives the legislative branch, not the executive branch, the authority to impose tariffs.

But over the course of the 20th century, Congress passed several bills that delegated more of that authority toward the president, leading to the present situation, where Trump is able to legally impose all kinds of tariffs without congressional input.

It's similar to the conversation that DOGE has spurred, with Trump and Elon Musk shuttering agencies and cutting off funding without congressional approval.

This bill is an effort to reverse that trend, at least when it comes to trade.

"For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch," Grassley, the lead GOP co-sponsor, said in a statement.

Under the bill, any new tariffs would expire in 60 days if the House and the Senate don't pass a joint resolution of approval. Congress could also end tariffs sooner than the 60-day point by passing a joint resolution of disapproval.

Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska is expected to introduce a House version of the bill as well.

However, the legislation faces an uncertain path to becoming law. Both Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson have stood by Trump, and they largely have control over what bills make it to the floor in their respective chambers.

Trump has argued that tariffs, down the line, will help the economy.

In a Statement of Administration Policy seen by Business Insider, the White House said that Trump would veto what they described as a severe constraint on his power.

"If passed, this bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security," the statement read.

Germany's economy minister slammed Elon Musk's call for zero tariffs between the US and Europe, calling it a sign of "weakness" in response to growing economic turmoil.

"I think it's a sign of weakness — maybe of fear," Robert Habeck told reporters on Monday. "If he has something to say, he should go to his president and say: 'Before we're talking about zero tariffs, let's stop the mess you've just made in the last week.'"

Musk's comments came on Saturday when he proposed a "zero-tariff" system between the US and Europe. This was just days after President Donald Trump announced baseline "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of trading partners, including a 20% tariff rate on the European Union.

"This is ridiculous," Habeck added. "The only interpretation I have is that he now sees that his own companies, but even the economies, are going to crumble because of the mess they have made. So, he's afraid."

Markets reacted sharply to Trump's tariff announcement, with the S&P 500 plunging 10% over two days and the Nasdaq 100 entering a bear market for the first time since 2022.

The sell-off deepened on Monday as investors saw little indication that Trump would back down and foreign nations prepared to retaliate.

Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was "finalizing" a package of countermeasures against the steel tariffs and was preparing further countermeasures "to protect our interests and our businesses."

While the UK and Australia have signaled they would not retaliate, China and Canada have pledged to respond.

Analysts have begun slashing year-end market forecasts, warning of heightened recession risks as trade tensions escalate.

The Trump administration is racing to curb TikTok's ties to China. But inside the company, a string of recent US executive departures and team restructurings has given Chinese leaders a greater grip on its American business, company insiders told Business Insider.

This month, US-based sales and marketing exec Blake Chandlee, who served as the face of TikTok at key industry events like Cannes and Advertising Week, stepped down. Will Liu, known as Liu Xiaobing in China, is taking over management of his global business solutions team. Liu, a Singapore-based staffer who reports to ByteDance China chairman Zhang Lidong, works on monetization products for the company's Chinese apps and TikTok.

The sales team shakeup is one example of a broader shift in power across several company departments.

TikTok made a big push to hire top talent in the US as it looked to launch new businesses like e-commerce in the country. But over the past year, at least seven key US-based executives, including Chandlee, have left their roles across various business lines. Some have been replaced by Chinese leaders. There's a sense among some of TikTok's roughly 7,000 US staffers that ByteDance executives who are either based in China or have come to the US from China are tightening control. Business Insider spoke to nine current and seven former staffers who have worked at the company in the past year.

"They have been consolidating under Chinese leadership," a TikTok employee who works on its e-commerce business told BI. "Before we had a senior manager in the US, and now the person is outside the US."

TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment from BI.

The leadership balance may change again if TikTok finds a new owner outside ByteDance, as required by a divestment law. The Trump administration is working on a potential deal, and the president wrote on Friday that he was giving the company another 75 days to find a solution. Some employees are eager for a switch that would put new US executives in charge.

"I really hope this happens," a staffer who works in operations said of a prospective sale. "I hope it can be new leadership if they can really get bought by Oracle or someone else."

While staff at TikTok's parent company ByteDance have had the final say over its product for years, and US leaders like North America global business solutions head Khartoon Weiss remain, the 16 insiders felt that the recent departures of other top US managers expanded control of Chinese leaders.

TikTok's e-commerce team, which runs its Shop product under the leadership of China-based ByteDance executive Bob Kang, has lost several US leaders over the last year and a half, according to nine of the insiders.

Since late 2023, US executives that have exited include Sandie Hawkins, TikTok's former GM of US e-commerce; Marni Levine, one of Hawkins' two replacements, who oversaw TikTok Shop's US operations; and Mary Hubbard, the company's former head of governance and experience in the Americas for Shop.

Executives with experience working on TikTok's Chinese sister app are filling the void, including Mu Qing, a former Douyin e-commerce VP; Sheng Zhou, the company's SVP of global e-commerce; and product VP Xu Luran.

TikTok recruited heavily from Amazon and other big e-commerce players when it began testing Shop in the US a couple of years ago, bringing local knowledge into the business, insiders said. But in the past year, as US executives have left, leadership has shifted from building a localized shopping product to instead trying to imitate Douyin, a staffer who works on TikTok Shop told BI.

Chinese leadership is also cracking down on its US team this year after they felt the country underperformed in 2024, as BI previously reported.

Other US teams within TikTok have similarly seen American leaders swapped out for ByteDance staffers from China.

There have been examples of these power shifts as early as 2022. Vanessa Campos, a former TikTok recruiter focused on early career hires who left the company this year, wrote in an April blog post that her US manager was replaced by a global leader from China in late 2022 who began "tightening their grip on hiring priorities." Chinese leadership led the early careers team from that point forward, Campos told BI.

Rebecca Sawyer, TikTok's US advertising lead for small and midsize businesses, was replaced by ByteDance executive Qing Lan in late 2023. Qing previously worked on the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin.

The e-commerce staffer said Chinese leadership's control of the business "hyper-accelerated" in the second half of 2024.

Globally, at least eight executives have left TikTok in 2025, The Information earlier reported, citing departures like the music exec Ole Obermann and North America ads leader Sameer Singh.

ByteDance is still very much a Chinese tech company at its core. Decisions about its global products are often made in China, where it has offices in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou. US TikTok employees previously told BI that they refer to its Beijing office as "HQ."

As it's expanded into other parts of the world, ByteDance has brought hundreds of employees over from China into its new offices via H-1B or L-1 visas, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services records and another company employee with knowledge of its visa strategy.

About 670 of the roughly 1,100 approved US H-1B visa hires for TikTok and ByteDance workers were from China during fiscal year 2023, the most recent period BI was able to obtain data via a Freedom of Information Act request. In fiscal year 2022, the company received 445 H-1B approvals for Chinese nationals, per USCIS data shared with US Sen. Tom Cotton.

"A lot of leaders are Chinese nationals from mainland China," the employee with knowledge of its visa strategy said.

But the company also grew TikTok globally by leaning into the expertise of local hires. Business lines like recruiting, the creator outreach team, and its sales staff that interface with US marketers have generally operated with less oversight from China, four of the current and former staffers said. Staff members in some of those divisions have not had to take late calls with Chinese colleagues to accommodate time zone differences, for example. That independence from China has drifted away in the past year, the insiders told BI.

In 2024, TikTok's US creator team was asked to align its goals with a product team mostly based in China, a former staffer who worked on the creator team told BI.

"While we weren't actually reporting into them, it was almost like a dotted line," the ex-employee said. "If they said jump, the creator team had to jump."

US employees reporting to managers based in China told BI they sometimes feel excluded from the team, either because they don't speak or read Mandarin Chinese or because they work in a different time zone and are unable to join certain calls.

A trust and safety team member who does not speak Mandarin said it was challenging to try to work with Chinese colleagues who, they felt, often made little effort to accommodate their US teammates.

The staffer said they'd been provided with some internal documents translated from Mandarin that have been hard to follow.

"I'm always two days behind," they said.

Another staffer on the engineering team estimated their China-based manager had directly spoken to them for less than 30 minutes over the last six months.

The employee said it was challenging to work with translated documents and group chats in the company's internal messaging platform Lark that were originally written in Mandarin.

"The meetings conducted are in Chinese as well, so a lot of my American colleagues can't understand the context," this person said.

A former product staffer said they felt like it was harder to get their ideas heard after switching from a US-based manager to one based in China.

"I felt like they didn't really listen to the US opinion," the former employee said of their new manager. "They would say things like 'Just follow what the Chinese product manager said.'"

The power structure for TikTok's US business may shift in the coming weeks if new owners take over operations.

The company could reach a deal to sell TikTok's US assets in order to comply with the law requiring ByteDance to divest from its US app. Trump said TikTok negotiations are now wound up in a broader US-China trade fight over tariffs.

ByteDance said it's talking to the US government about a potential solution, but key matters need to be resolved, and an agreement would be subject to approval under Chinese law.

As staffers await a political resolution, morale at the company is low among some who are experiencing burnout and dealing with the aftermath of a recent review cycle that led to performance-improvement plans and staff exits, company insiders previously told BI.

"We essentially haven't had a voice for a very long time," the second e-commerce worker said. "They say they want you to be candid and clear, but really they want you to fall in line and follow the Chinese and rebuild Douyin."

The billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman is ringing the alarm over Washington's tariff spree, saying President Donald Trump's policy must be delayed.

The Pershing Square founder backed Trump during his campaign but said Sunday the trade war wasn't what voters wanted. The administration needs to change course to avoid even more dire consequences, he said.

"If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocketbooks, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," Ackman wrote on X.

Last week, Trump rolled out across-the-board duties at rates that shattered expectations, sending global markets into a tailspin. Ackman said that he did endorse reworking trade deals to advance US industry and job creation but that indiscriminate and massive levies could devastate business confidence and slash global appetite for US investment.

He's urging Trump to call a 90-day timeout on the tariffs, during which the president could negotiate and resolve any trade inequities.

The consequences of the trade war have already been deeply felt in the market. Since Wednesday's tariff announcement, the S&P 500 has tanked over 15% and is now in a bear market.

The probability of a recession has also spiked, bolstering chances of a 100-basis-point interest rate reduction by the end of the year.

"The consequences for our country and the millions of our citizens who have supported the president — in particular low-income consumers who are already under a huge amount of economic stress — are going to be severely negative. This is not what we voted for," Ackman added.

In a separate post, Ackman said neither he nor Pershing Capital was set up to profit from a tariff pause.

He's not the first Wall Street heavy hitter to speak up against the mounting trade war. Over the weekend, the hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller made a rare post on X, citing his stance against tariffs that exceed 10%.

The billionaire investor and "Shark Tank" star Mark Cuban told investors not to cash out their stocks following last week's market turmoil, but he then deleted the post and walked back his advice.

"Don't sell. It will come back. I just don't know how long it will take." he posted on X on Sunday night. Watcher.Guru, a financial news outlet with almost 3 million X followers, and many other accounts reported the deleted comments shortly after he made them.

In a follow-up X post on Sunday, Cuban explained his decision to delete the post: "As some other rightfully mentioned, no one knows. You have to look at your own circumstances and talk to those whose advice you value."

Cuban didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

His remarks came after US stocks suffered their worst week since 2020.

The S&P 500 dropped about 10% in two days, while the Nasdaq 100 entered a bear market for the first time since 2022.

Wall Street fell again on Monday after more losses in Asia and Europe.

The sell-off followed President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on US trading partners, including a near-universal 10% duty and levies higher than 50% in some cases. The move rattled investors, with some analysts cutting their year-end targets and warning of heightened recession risks.

In a series of Bluesky posts on Saturday, Cuban said Trump's aggressive tariffs, combined with DOGE cuts, could trigger a worse financial crisis than the Great Recession of 2008.

"If the new tariffs stay in place for multiple years, and are enforced and inflationary, and DOGE continues to cut and fire, we will be in a far worse situation than 2008," he wrote.

During the 2008 financial crisis and its immediate aftermath, US GDP fell by more than 4%, the unemployment rate hit 10%, and the housing market collapsed in what economists call the deepest recession since World War II.

Trump said in comments to reporters that there would be some "short-term" pain, but he was more forceful in a Friday post on Truth Social, writing: "ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL!"

The AI Race:

With the new funds SignalFire will focus on AI — and use it too. 

Venture capital firm SignalFire has raised over $1 billion to bet on artificial intelligence startups — an unusually large fundraising haul in a difficult market for VCs and startups. 

The latest financing lifts the San Francisco-based firm's assets under management to $3 billion, it plans to announce on Monday. It will use that cash to back early-stage startups across several funds, with a particular focus on companies building AI applications.

Voice intelligence startup PyannoteAI has just raised $9 million in a seed round led by Crane Ventures and Serena.

The French startup, launched in 2024, has developed an AI model for a concept called "speaker diarization." It's the process of enhancing audio transcriptions to distinguish between different speakers — something that AI has historically struggled with. 

"Our mission is to make human and AI interactions natural through voice," Vincent Molina, cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider. "The voice AI industry today mostly focuses on one-to-one conversations between humans and AI. But real-life conversations aren't like that. They're full of multi-speaker situations, overlapping speech, interruptions, and short and chaotic speech turns," he said.

The startup's platform aims to ensure that the AI model not only picks up on an accurate audio transcription but also understands who is speaking and their intonation. The intended result is for AI to preserve the meaning of audio across different languages and use cases.

The model was developed using research conducted by the startup's cofounder, Hervé Bredin, who has authored over 30 papers on the topic.

PyannoteAI's enterprise use cases include indexing large-scale audio for media platforms, streamlining the dubbing process, and transcribing consultations across enterprise and healthcare. It counts Gladia and MediVox as its clients.

Voice AI has gained significant traction in the past year, with the likes of ElevenLabs and PolyAI raising significant rounds in recent months.

Molina said his startup had increased investor interest from both Europe and the US. "The entire voice AI landscape is accelerating — across all layers: infrastructure, applications, models, and more," he told BI. "Since we're positioned at the very beginning of the value chain, and because we serve the entire ecosystem, we received strong interest from a wide range of investors."

The funding confirms BI's November report that PyannoteAI was in talks to raise about $10 million. 

In addition to Crane Ventures and Serena, PyannoteAI's funding round had participation from Julien Chaumond, the chief technology officer of HuggingFace, and former Meta and OpenAI researcher Alexis Conneau.

With the fresh funding, the startup said it plans to grow its research team.

In a wide-ranging letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he saw "stagflation" dangers slowing the economy as the stock market dropped in response to President Donald Trump's trade wars.

"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in the 58-page letter, which was released Monday and addressed various topics, including immigration and the state of civil discourse.

"While inflation has come down," he wrote, "most of what I see in the future is inflationary: continued high fiscal deficits, the remilitarization of the world and the need for infrastructure investment, including the green economy and the restructuring of trade and tariffs."

Dimon said he expected rising costs to create a "tug-of-war" over the direction of interest rates, with long-term borrowing costs ultimately heading higher. "All things being equal, the slower the growth, the lower the interest rates, and the higher the inflation, the higher the interest rates," he said.

He even referenced "stagflation," a term popularized before the turn of the century to describe an unpleasant cocktail of high inflation, high unemployment, and tepid economic growth.

"This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates," he wrote.

Dimon stopped short of saying the economy is headed for a recession. Following a two-day stock sell-off last week, the dreaded R-word has been on everyone's lips.

He also suggested that the stock market pain may not be over.

"No matter how you measure it, equity valuations are still well above their historical averages," he said, adding: "Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure."

The CEO's much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders comes as the leaders of corporations seek to understand where the economy — and the nation — is headed under Trump, who has bold plans for reorganizing the federal government and US foreign policy.

Dimon used his letter to opine on various problems facing the US, as well as prospective solutions.

"To be able to attack our problems at home and abroad, we must be strong. And our core strength is based upon our commitment to our values, as well as our ability to work hard and think intelligently about our problems," Dimon wrote, adding that he supported some policy positions of both Democrats and Republicans.

The letter also touched on what he deemed "common sense" solutions to the nation's problems, including tightening security at the border and doing away with special interests, or what he called "selfishness on the part of our citizens and elected officials."

Some Wall Street watchers have long suspected that the billionaire banker — a regular pontificator on world events — has harbored ambitions to seek public office, though he said last year that he would not seek a position in the Trump administration.

Dimon bemoaned the increasingly acrimonious tone infecting the public discourse. Indeed, he said that Americans are "meaner to each other" and that "a little more kindness and understanding would go a long way."

Dimon added: "I am a firm believer that we should constantly talk with each other, air our views, hold each other accountable and try to respect all sides of an argument." He said social media algorithms had amplified the problem.

JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion in profit in 2024 and has since called employees back to the office five days a week, a mandate that has led some employees to explore their options, including unionization.

Last year, the bank also earned a record $58.5 billion in net income, up from $49.6 billion the year before, it said in its earnings filings. The firm's stock is up about 6% over the past year, trading as of early April at about $210 a share.

Most semiconductors, the silicon microchips that run everything from TV remote controls to humanoid robots are exempt from the slew of tariffs rolled out by the Trump administration last week. But that's not the end of the story for the industry which also powers the immense shift in computing toward artificial intelligence that's already underway, led by the US.

There are roughly $45 billion worth of semiconductors (based on 2024 totals gathered by Bernstein), that remain tariff-free — $12 billion of which comes from Taiwan, where AI chip leader Nvidia manufactures. But, the AI ecosystem requires much more than chips alone.

Data centers and the myriad materials and components required to generate depictions of everyone as an anime character are not exempt. For instance, an imported remote-controlled toy car with chips in both components would need an exception for toys, to avoid fees.

"We still have more questions than answers about this," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a note sent to investors Thursday morning. "Semiconductors are exempt. But what about modules? Cards?"

As of Friday morning, analysts were still scratching their heads as to the impact, despite the exemption.

"We're not exactly sure what to do with all this," wrote Bernstein's analysts. "Most semiconductors enter the US inside other things for which tariffs are likely to have a much bigger influence, hence secondary effects are likely to be far more material."

Nvidia designs chips and software, but what it mainly sells are boards, according to Dylan Patel, chief analyst at Semianalysis. Boards contain multiple chips, but also power delivery controls, and other components to make them work.

"On the surface, the exemption does not exempt Nvidia shipments as they ship GPU board assemblies," Patel told Business Insider. "If accelerator boards are excluded in addition to semiconductors, then the cost would not go up much," he continued.

These boards are just the beginning of the bumper crop of AI data centers in the works right now. Server racks, steel cabinets, and all the cabling, cooling gear, and switches to manage data flow and power are mostly imported.

A spokesperson for AMD, which, like Nvidia, produces its AI chips in Taiwan, told BI the company is closely monitoring the regulations.

"Although semiconductors are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, we are assessing the details and any impacts on our broader customer and partner ecosystem," the spokesperson said in an email statement.

Nvidia declined to comment on the implications of the tariffs. But CEO Jensen Huang got the question from financial analysts last month at the company's annual GTC conference.

"We're preparing and we have been preparing to manufacture onshore," he said. Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC has invested $100 billion in a manufacturing facility in Arizona.

"We are now running production silicon in Arizona. And so, we will manufacture onshore. The rest of the systems, we'll manufacture as much onshore as we need to," Huang said. "We have a super agile supply chain, we're manufacturing in so many different places, we could shift things," he continued.

In addition to potentially producing chips in the US, it's plausible that companies, including Nvidia, could do more of their final assembly in the US, Chris Miller, the author of "Chip War" and a leading expert on the semiconductor industry told BI. Moving the later steps of the manufacturing process to un-tariffed shores, which right now include Canada and Mexico as well as the US, could theoretically allow these companies to import bare silicon chips and avoid levies. But that change would come with a cost as well, Miller said.

With retaliatory tariffs rolling in, US manufacturers could find tariffs weighing down demand in international markets too.

Semiconductor industry veteran Sachin Gandhi just brought his startup Retym out of stealth mode last week, with a semiconductor that helps data move between data centers faster. Technology like his has been most relevant to the telecom industry for decades and is now finding new markets in AI data centers.

Retym's finished product is exempt from tariffs when it enters the US, but the semiconductor supply chain is complex. Products often cross borders while being manufactured in multiple steps, packaged, tested, and validated, and then shipped to the final destination.

A global tariff-rich environment will probably bring up his costs in one way or another, Gandhi told BI. End customers like hyperscalers and the ecosystem of middlemen who bundle all these elements together and sell them will figure out how to cover these costs without too much consternation to a point, he said.

"Demand is not particularly price sensitive," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore Thursday.

AI is already an area where companies appear willing to spend with abandon. But, it's also maturing. Now, when companies are working to put together realistic estimates for normal business metrics like return on investment, unit economics, and profitability, tariffs risk pushing that down the road, potentially years.

Tesla fans are still waiting for a new Roadster — and now two ex-Tesla employees are launching an EV startup that could steal Elon Musk's thunder.

Musk promised the updated Tesla Roadster would be "the fastest production car ever made, period" when he unveiled it in 2017, but eight years later, the $200,000 rocket-boosted EV is nowhere to be seen, leaving some reservations holders with a serious case of buyers regret.

Daniel Davey and fellow Tesla veteran Mark Tapscott are looking to fill that void.

The two electric car enthusiasts founded British EV startup Longbow in 2023 along with Jenny Keisu, the former CEO of electric boat maker X Shore, and are now looking to disrupt their former employer with a range of lightweight electric sports cars.

Longbow's first vehicle will be the Speedster, a limited-production £84,995 ($112,000) open-top sports car that the company describes as a "statement of intent," with deliveries beginning next year.

That will be followed by the Roadster, a £64,995 ($85,500) production vehicle that serves as a nod to Elon Musk's infamously delayed supercar.

"The Tesla Roadster was announced in 2017. On the day, people were paying deposits by credit card there and then for $250,000. It was called the Tesla Roadster 2020," said Davey.

"We will deliver a Roadster before Tesla delivers a Roadster. And ours will be lighter and cooler," he added.

Davey and Tapscott joined Tesla in the early 2010s and helped launch the Roadster and the Model S, the brand's first two vehicles, in Europe — a process that was far from smooth.

"I was employee 650, spent some time in California, then came Europe with the Roadster back when there was no charging infrastructure, no one knew who Tesla or Elon was, and all of it was uphill," said Davey.

Tapscott says he joined Tesla after being wowed by the original Roadster. After contacting Musk and former Apple exec George Blankenship, he was tasked with selling the first two Model S vehicles in the UK.

"I was driving up and down the country, showing those cars to everybody, charging at whatever pub or hotel you could stop off at," said Tapscott, who worked for Tesla for seven years.

"The first ever test drive with the Model S in the UK, the guy turned up in his Ferrari, crashed the car, and pretty much wrote it off," he added.

The two Tesla veterans went on to work with a whos-who of EV companies, including Lucid, Hyundai, and Chinese automakers like BYD.

Davey, who returned to Tesla in 2018 to launch the Model 3 in Europe ("Elon was sleeping on the sofa, no one else at the company had any sleep," was how he described that period), told BI that harnessing their wealth of experience would be key to avoiding the fate of other failed EV startups.

"We have done this multiple times, and all our peers who could do this are moving their way up to Vice President/Senior VP level and working in VCs because they're not crazy enough to apply that knowledge at the beginning again," he said.

After a boom in the early 2020s, the past few years have seen numerous once-promising EV startups collapse as electric vehicle sales growth has slowed and funding has dried up.

Meanwhile, legacy automakers have also sought to launch increasingly affordable, mass-market electric offerings as they look to boost adoption and sales.

That makes it an unusual time to launch a mid-range electric sportscar — but Longbow's cofounders believe the lack of competition gives the startup an opening.

"It's a scandal that no one else is focusing on this segment," said Davey.

"We're passionate about the products in the segment, but from a logical perspective, it is the best place to be building cars. You have the best margins, and there is no competition," he added.

Tapscott said that Longbow's approach to building its cars was centered on the concept of "speed of lightness."

Rather than choosing to build the majority of components in-house — a process that has seen other startups like Tesla and Rivian face an EV "valley of death" as production has scaled up before profits — Longbow plans to buy most of its components off the shelf from outside suppliers.

Davey and Tapscott argue that will allow the startup to be more flexible, improve margins, and take advantage of an EV supply chain that is far more developed than when Tesla began building the first Roadster.

"We don't have to build a billion-dollar factory just to get a single motor," said Tapscott.

Although Longbow is making an effort to prioritize local suppliers in the UK, some of its supply chain will likely include Chinese EV tech.

Having worked with Chinese EV companies in the past, Tapscott and Davey described the technology coming out of the world's most competitive auto market as "breathtaking."

"A lot of components come from China, where it's appropriate, especially [battery] cells, right? We will leverage that," said Davey.

"But we really want to lean into and support the local supply chain," he said, adding that Longbow expects to finalize its supply chain nine months before deliveries begin in late 2026.

Davey and Tapscott declined to say how many reservations Longbow has received so far but described the response to the Speedster and the Roadster as highly encouraging.

"Tesla builds 2 million cars a year … but at some point, the disruptors become the disrupted," said Davey.

For weeks, the stars of "The White Lotus" have been tight-lipped about viewers' most burning question: Who dies?

That question was answered in the season three finale of the HBO hit, which aired on Sunday night — and some of the show's stars are finally getting to air their real feelings about their characters' fates.

Arguably no character has a more tragic arc in season three than Walton Goggins' long-suffering Rick. Rick arrives at the resort for a vacation with his younger girlfriend, Chelsea, but he's also there on a revenge mission against the man he believes killed his father.

Rick operates from pain and desperation. He's so obsessed with his past that he's often blind to the love Chelsea is offering him. In episodes seven and eight, he finally finds brief moments of absolution and lightness — moments of joy that are cut short when both he and Chelsea are killed off in the show's finale.

In the hours after the finale aired, Goggins took to Instagram to share a 235-word tribute to his character.

"Rick + Chelsea. With the heaviest of hearts… To me, ours was a love story. It was only ever a love story, hindered by unresolved, childhood trauma," Goggins wrote.

"We all have them… but can we move past them. In the depths of our despair there is always beauty around us. If we can sit with our pain, just sit with it… not react… not be defined by it…It's there… the love the world is constantly giving in any given moment is there," he continued.

A post shared by Walton Goggins (@waltongogginsbonafide)

Goggins thanked the show's creator, Mike White, writing, "Thank you Mike White for your imagination, your tender heart, for the privilege of giving us the opportunity to tell it."

He also thanked Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea, and Sam Rockwell, his scene mate and longtime friend.

The show was filmed over several months, primarily on the Thai island of Koh Samui. Wood told The Sunday Times that the cast accidentally found themselves going into Method acting during filming.

Season three featured both big names in Hollywood and some newcomers. Among the industry vets featured in this season are Parker Posey, Michelle Monaghan, and Jason Isaacs. The show pays all characters the same, non-negotiable salary.

Goggins' Instagram post after the finale aired drew reactions from fans, many of whom expressed love for the two ill-fated characters — and from at least one of his costars, Patrick Schwarzenegger.

"I'm crying," Schwarzenegger wrote on the post.

Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies.

In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a "free hall pass" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures.

"Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance," said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill.

The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days.

The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. 

Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health.

Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days.

The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets.

Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider.

For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, "likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks," the analysts wrote.

The Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties.

Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10.

The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. At market close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 6%, the Dow was down 5.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week.

On Monday, Asia stocks opened deep in the red. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning.

"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday. "The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion."

President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on April 2 — and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering.

Here's what big names in business and economics have been saying:

Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs "run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters." He added: "Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures."

He said the Business Roundtable "supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners" but called on him to introduce "additional reasonable exemptions" and a "transparent, predictable exclusion process."

"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. "The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion."

Summers added that the tariffs were the most expensive and "masochistic" the US had imposed in decades.

"The price action in global financial markets in the immediate aftermath of the US tariff announcement points to major worries about global economic growth," Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant PIMCO and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on X.

"These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs," Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's "Peston" program.

Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: "I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. This is not a buy-the-dip opportunity. It's a sell the dip opportunity."

"So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? What is with that adverb 'again' which is defined as 'returning to a previous condition'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don't all live at the average!)," David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, said on X.

"Have tariffs really stood in the way of wealth creation in America? I think the title should simply be the truth: 'Let's Make the World Poor Again' (and then we can buy it at a discount)," Rosenberg added.

Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the "Liberation Day" label was "Orwellian doublespeak."

"Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be — ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world," he said on X.

"He's gone full-on crazy," Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter.

"If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them," Krugman added.

"March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth," wrote Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column.

"Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings)," he added.

"The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.3% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household consumer loss of $3,800 in 2024$. Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,700," wrote the Yale Budget Lab in a new analysis published on April 2, shortly after Trump's blanket tariff announcement.

"Tthe United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries," said Jared Bernstein, the US's former chief economist, in his newsletter. "That means, as Trump has correctly argued, we can hurt them more than they can hurt us. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners."

"First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices — as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points — and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2," he added.

"Monstrously destructive, incoherent, ill-informed tariffs based on fabrications, imagined wrongs, discredited theories and ignorance of decades of evidence. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else," said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky.

"If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth," said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, on BlueSky.

"Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built," she added.

The latest set of tariffs is "a similar event to going off the gold standard in 1971. It's an epic event. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance," Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC.

"I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%," said Gross, who's also known as "Bond King."

Gross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to "catching a falling knife."

"Tariffs attack US trading partners but, in effect, attack US corporate profit margins first," wrote Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. "The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. The macro risk hitting markets is real, but only accentuates the devaluation process."

"Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising," Blitz wrote.

Jim O'Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the "sensible" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services.

He said this would be "very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in."

If the US wants to continue down this "kamikaze path," the UK will have to respond, O'Neill added. "It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves."

"Just had a journalist ask me to explain "Liberation Day," Stephanie Kelton, the author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. "I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets."

George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said in a Friday note that markets were pricing in a global recession.

"This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. The countries that respond the quickest and most forcefully to this shock are those whose currencies will likely be the most resilient. And, on the flipside, the more the US fiscal strategy under the Trump administration lacks visibility, the more the market will punish the dollar and US assets.

"One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. Remember that during the European supply-shock of 2022, the ECB turned hawkish. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed."

Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a "significant risk" to the global economy.

"We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth," she said in a statement on Thursday.

Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, told Ireland's Newstalk that the tariffs would be "negative the world over."

She said Trump's move "will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate."

Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, posted on X on Friday:

"The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Why not give them a chance? Make the 10pct min tariff immediate but defer the "reciprocal" part 6 mos. Take the win! The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!"

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations.

"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected," Powell said at a conference for business journalists. "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth."

The central bank president repeatedly said it was too early to tell what the Fed's response might be.

"We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said."

Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs, which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes "no economic sense."

"The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc," Corinth wrote. "But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold."

In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could "hit imminently and extend until next year" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate.

"Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario," he predicted.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV, veteran analyst Ed Yardeni said he hoped the "message that the stock market is sending to the administration is being heard."

"The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy," he added.

Brad Setser, the former senior advisor to the US trade representative and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the latest round of tariffs will be "painful."

"I think what the announcement on Wednesday showed is that the decision of the administration, not surprisingly, was to follow President Trump's instincts, not the instincts of his more moderate advisors, to go all in," Setser said on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast.

Setser said the goal is to "radically restructure the US and global economies using tariffs as a tool, with some flexibility perhaps to negotiate at the edges. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs."

Greg Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young, told Yahoo Finance that "the risk of a recession are very real" with the tariffs in place.

"The risks of a particularly severe recession are real, because if these tariffs remain in place on a persistent basis, you would see a drag on US economic activity worth about 1% to 1.5% of growth," he said. "In an economy that is expected to grow around 1.5%, that puts the economy essentially into stagnation. Add to that a 1% to 1.5% lift on inflation, and you have stagflation."

Douglas Irwin, the trade historian and economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in The Economist that Trump's tariffs "blow an enormous hole" in the trade policy that the US has advanced since World War II.

"The president now touts his tariffs as mainly 'reciprocal': 'Whatever they charge us, we charge them.' This makes them sound fair. Far from it," Irwin said.

"Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this week's events is the ability of one person to completely remake American trade policy. A situation in which the occupant of the White House can make such momentous changes on his own, unchecked, reflects serious political decay in American politics."

One day before Trump's latest tariff announcement, the economist Thomas Sowell told the Hoover Institution that the president's tariffs could lead to a global trade war.

"It's painful to see a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated," Sowell said. "If you set off a worldwide trade war, that has a devastating history."

"Everybody loses because everybody follows suit," he continued. "And all that happens is that you get a great reduction in international trade."

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on X that the US's global economic war against the world risks destroying confidence in America as a trading partner and investment destination.

Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square, suggested a 90-day time-out to negotiate and resolve "unfair asymmetric tariff deals." 

"If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," wrote Ackman.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their probability for a US recession from 35% to 45% on a sharp tightening in financial conditions, overseas consumer boycotts, and a spike in policy uncertainty that will depress capital spending.

The forecast is based on their assumption that the effective tariff rate rises by 15 percentage points — which is less than what has been announced. If most of the tariffs take effect on Wednesday, that would raise the effective tariff rate by 20 percentage points. In that case, the analysts expect a recession, they wrote.

(Bloomberg) — Before the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets. Today we look at:

Good morning, this is Chiranjivi Chakraborty, an equities reporter in Mumbai. A bruising start to the week awaits traders as global markets continue to reel from the impact of President Trump's tariffs on global growth. While India has indicated that it does not plan to retaliate against Trump's levies, the knock-on impact from a slowing global economy and a potential US recession will keep volatility high.

Key Takeaways:

VK, one of Russia's largest social media platforms, announced that it would shut down its NFT marketplace, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, due to mounting financial losses.

The move follows VK's 2024 net loss of 94.9 billion rubles (around $1.1 billion), nearly triple its 2023 losses of 34.3 billion rubles.VK Financial Struggles and the Collapse of Its NFT Marketplace

To reduce its debt load, VK plans to issue $1.36 billion in new shares, a decision made amid deepening financial setbacks.

The company has urged users to move their NFTs to external wallets before April 15 to avoid losing access to their assets.

After that date, the platform will remove the neon diamond icons on user avatars that once indicated NFT ownership.

Users who bought NFTs mainly for avatar integration will lose their visual indicators on VK.

While the VK NFT community page will remain accessible, the company has not confirmed whether it plans to return to the NFT or digital asset space in the future.

VK's exit comes during a downturn in the NFT sector, reflecting broader trends across the industry.

The shutdown shows digital asset platforms must build sustainable operations and ensure clear asset protection. It firmly warns that relying solely on market hype leaves platforms vulnerable to abrupt exits. How might this decision influence future market models for digital content? 

The closure could prompt a redesign of market models that focus on secure, transparent digital commerce. Stakeholders may adopt new criteria to evaluate underlying asset value rather than transient market trends. What role do emerging technical standards play in light of such platform exits? 

New tech standards can boost security and compatibility. As providers reevaluate operations, updated protocols may offer clearer benchmarks for verifying digital assets and managing custody efficiently.

President Donald Trump's aggressive new tariff policy last week has sent markets reeling, with crypto investors feeling the pain after trillions of dollars were wiped from global stock indices.

On Monday, Bitcoin's price recovered slightly after dropping below $75,000 during early morning trade. The crypto is hovering near $80,000, up 3% over the last 24 hours. 

Still, more volatility is to come as investors try to navigate a new global economic order under Trump. Paying attention to the U.S. bond markets is key. 

As pointed out by macro expert and crypto analyst Lynn Alden on X, bond yields on Monday jumped while the stock market plunged. But why should crypto investors or Bitcoiners care? 

"It's a lot of things that are not explained with a simple narrative, Michael Lebowitz, portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, told Decrypt. "Likely, when people sold their stock, they didn't need the bond with the hedge anymore, so they sold the bonds too."

"I'm always very careful not to say, well, maybe China was selling, or maybe they think that tariffs are inflationary, because there's just so much volatility in these markets," he added.

When investors buy U.S. treasuries, they are paid a yield. As treasuries rise in high demand, the fixed income is lower; when the treasuries are not as sought after, the yield goes up.

Monday's yield surge, particularly on the 10-year, meant demand for U.S. treasuries fell. This sometimes happens when investors sell treasuries to raise cash, a typical safe-haven, as other investments drop in price—in today's case, stocks.

Typically, a rising yield signals expectations of stronger growth or higher inflation, while a falling yield often reflects flight to safety or a weaker economic outlook.

Experts told Decrypt the rise in yields was a sign of harsher market forces at play, in particular, slow growth and expectations of higher inflation. 

Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, Greg Magadini, noted that Trump's tariffs could become “direct contributors to inflationary forces.” 

“There's another more worrying risk—what if instead of merely experiencing a trade war, our international creditors protest [against] buying treasuries?” he said.

In other words, as other countries retaliate against Trump's strict tariffs, they could sell off U.S. treasuries. 

“Rising yields in the face of falling equities sends a clear message: The market thinks the Fed's hands are tied,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. 

“If inflation proves stickier than expected, central banks may have no choice but to keep conditions tighter for longer,” adding that this was “not great for risk assets.”

Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have typically traded with other risk assets like tech stocks, and have done well in a low-interest rate environment. 

While Bitcoin was trading down on Monday, its reaction to rising bond yields wasn't as inverse as stocks. 

Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, told Decrypt that while 10-year Treasury yields surged on Monday, Bitcoin's reaction was “notably subdued.” 

“Unlike in 2022, rising yields did not trigger a wave of forced liquidations or volatility in crypto markets, suggesting that BTC may be decoupling from old macro sensitivities,” he added.  

The decoupling narrative—that Bitcoin is not trading like tech stocks—has been circulating Crypto Twitter again lately. Could it be finally happening?

Silicon Valley has always been known for causing disruption. But now, it's getting disrupted itself. From the outside, the logos haven't changed; Meta, Google, Apple and the venture capital elite still roam Sand Hill Road.

But underneath all that, a silent change is underway. Crypto isn't just a tech trend floating through the Bay. It's gutting the system from its roots—how innovation is funded, who gets to build and where value goes.

It's no longer just about startups; it's about sovereignty, and Silicon Valley doesn't run the table anymore.

Before we go deeper, let's be clear—crypto didn't only challenge finance. It cracked open the core assumptions of how Silicon Valley operates.

From Ethereum to Solana, from DAOs to NFTs, from meme coins to decentralized storage networks—we're watching the infrastructure of the Valley get reverse-engineered in real time. And this time, it's not coming from a garage in Palo Alto.

Let's check it all out!

Back in the day, if you had a big tech idea, you needed to pitch it to a handful of gatekeepers. You flew out to Menlo Park, ran through your slides and hoped a VC partner would give you a term sheet. That funnel of funding? It decided who got to build and who didn't.

But crypto broke that model.

The 2017 ICO boom (yes, the Wild West days) proved a new thing: you didn't need VCs to raise capital—you just needed a whitepaper and a global internet connection.

EOS raised $4.1 billion without a product. Filecoin raised $257 million. Even now, with regulations tightening, token-based fundraising and community presales still generate millions.

More importantly, crypto flipped the power structure. Projects could rally global communities, not just accredited investors.

Now in 2025, data shows that early-stage crypto projects are raising significant rounds from hybrid models (part private, part public) using smart contract-managed treasuries instead of board-controlled bank accounts.

And yes, the gambling world took notice as well. With such smooth payments and privacy benefits, blockchain-based sportsbooks surged in 2024.

This is where people like Kim Weidemann come in. After spending years covering online gambling and Web3 integration, she reviewed more than 70 crypto-betting sites before publishing her picks for the best crypto sports betting sites for April 2025.

Her list wasn't all about flashy UX or low fees—but it focused on decentralization, fairness and user ownership—values you rarely saw celebrated by old-school Silicon Valley products.

And that's where the real break happens.

In the Valley, users are the product. Whether it's your clicks on Facebook, your location via Uber, or your playlists on Spotify, data extraction has always been the name of the game.

Platforms monetize you. In crypto? The ideal flips. Users are stakeholders. Token models, even in betting, share profits, governance rights and influence. You don't just use the product, you help shape it.

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) turned this concept into reality. They're not experimental governance toys—they're fully operational economic engines.

In 2024 alone, more than 2,100 DAOs had assets under management exceeding $30 billion globally. And none of them needed CEOs, boards, or Delaware C-corps to scale.

Let's not sugarcoat it—Silicon Valley loves a hero story. Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, Zuck, Tim Cook. You know the drill. The myth of the lone genius leading a team of hundreds—it's a narrative that props up investor confidence and helps power media cycles.

But crypto couldn't care less.

Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever they are, disappeared. Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin remains the closest thing to a figurehead, but even he's constantly pushing decisions to the community and minimizing his influence. Many projects now launch anonymously or with pseudonymous teams, and they do just fine.

Because it's not about who builds it. It's about who maintains it.

But with smart contracts, protocol upgrades and community governance, charisma is no longer a prerequisite for leadership. This breaks Silicon Valley's top-down hierarchy—the very thing that kept innovation locked behind Stanford resumes and VC intros.

In the Valley, proprietary tech is your moat. You file patents, close your source code, build walled gardens and sue if someone gets too close.

In crypto? You launch open-source by default. If someone forks your code, great. Let the market decide.

This radical transparency pushes development, and ironically, increases trust. Users know what's under the hood.

Developers can contribute without gatekeeping, and ecosystems grow fast, instead of being stifled by legal departments and licensing fees.

Ethereum, one of the most successful crypto platforms to date, is entirely open-source—with hundreds of teams building on top, around and underneath its core protocol.

The Solana ecosystem added more than 2,800 new developers in 2024 alone, with open dev tools and real-time feedback loops across thousands of GitHub repos.

You simply don't see this level of organic, distributed innovation inside a traditional FAANG team.

Silicon Valley figured out how to scale platforms. Facebook doesn't post content. Uber doesn't own cars. Airbnb doesn't own property. Spotify doesn't make music.

But guess who owns the profits? The platforms.

Crypto rearchitected this model—just imagine a ride-sharing service where drivers earn directly in tokens, vote on protocol upgrades and receive long-term value for their participation.

Or a betting site where the odds, rules and rewards are all on-chain, and the revenue gets distributed among the people who play and promote it.

It's not theory anymore—this is happening now.

Take Audius, a decentralized music platform. It now has more than 7 million monthly users and pays artists directly, without intermediaries.

Of course, nothing in crypto moves without friction. Regulatory pushback is real. In the U.S., the SEC continues targeting high-profile projects.

Coinbase, Ripple, Uniswap—all have faced intense scrutiny. In 2023, the SEC filed 46 crypto-related enforcement actions, up from 30 in 2022.

But the innovation isn't stopping there—in fact, Silicon Valley's own elite are now split, with some turning toward crypto entirely. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has now deployed more than $7.6 billion into Web3. PayPal launched its own stablecoin. Stripe resumed support for crypto payouts.

Even Apple is quietly bringing more crypto-friendly features, including wallet compatibility and developer APIs that support NFT handling.

So, while the government tries to define crypto in legal terms, builders are moving on—and fast.

The Valley isn't going anywhere—and it still has the money, the minds and the influence. But it no longer has a monopoly on innovation.

Crypto opened the gates—not just to new technology, but to a new model of value creation. One that rewards users, decentralizes power and moves faster than any board meeting ever could.

For decades, Silicon Valley prided itself on changing the world. Now crypto is doing the same—without asking for permission.

Navigating the world of technology can be challenging, but Katerina Orr loves riding into the eye of the storm. Her biggest strength is her knack for translating complex concepts into accessible content. Balancing a thriving career in content creation on entrepreneurship and technology, she finds solace in her cozy home with a loving husband and an energetic dog.

The tech world was abuzz as President-elect Donald Trump announced his latest appointment: David Sacks, a Silicon Valley stalwart, as the new czar for artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has reportedly been appointed to advise Pakistan on Web3 and blockchain technology.

Local media in Pakistan is reporting that CZ has joined the Pakistan Crypto Council as a strategic advisor for the country of 247 million.

Says Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Minister of Pakistan, of CZ's involvement,

“This is a landmark moment for Pakistan.

We are sending a clear message to the world: Pakistan is open for innovation. 

With CZ onboard, we are accelerating our vision to make Pakistan a regional powerhouse for Web3, digital finance, and blockchain-driven growth.”

Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council said,

“Pakistan is opening its doors to the future of finance.

And who better to guide us on this journey than CZ — a pioneer who built the world's largest crypto exchange and changed the way billions think about financial freedom.”

According to CZ, Pakistan offers “limitless” potential to crypto.

Last week, the Binance founder also inked a deal to advance crypto technologies in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan.

Said CZ at the time,

“I officially and unofficially advise a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain solutions for gov efficiency, expanding blockchain to more than trading. I find this work extremely meaningful.”

 Corporate Bitcoin holdings have sunk to about $54.5 billion from nearly $59 billion on April 2. 

Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries collectively shed more than $4 billion in value after US President Donald Trump's tariffs triggered a global market sell-off, data shows. 

As of April 7, corporate Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $54.5 billion in the aggregate, down from roughly $59 billion before April 2, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net.

The cryptocurrency's volatility has also weighed on publicly traded Bitcoin holders' share prices. 

The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) — an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking a diverse basket of corporate Bitcoin holders — has lost more than 13% since Trump announced sweeping US import tariffs on April 2, according to Yahoo Finance.

Even shares of Strategy — the de facto Bitcoin hedge fund founded by Michael Saylor that pioneered corporate Bitcoin buying — are down, clocking losses of more than 13% since April 2, Google Finance data showed. 

The losses highlight ongoing concerns about Bitcoin's increasing popularity as a corporate treasury asset. Historically, corporate treasuries hold extremely low-risk assets like US Treasury Bills. 

“Cryptocurrencies' high volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape are misaligned with the fundamental goals of treasury management [such as] stability, liquidity, and capital preservation,” David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University, said in a January research publication.

In 2024, surging Bitcoin prices pushed Strategy's shares up more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. 

Strategy's success has inspired dozens of copycats, but investors are becoming skeptical.

In March, GameStop lost nearly $3 billion in market capitalization as shareholders second-guessed the videogame retailer's plans to stockpile Bitcoin. 

“There are question marks with GameStop's model. If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?” Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro, told Reuters on March 27.

Still, adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries can “potentially be a valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks,” asset manager Fidelity Digital Assets said in a 2024 report.

That thesis may already be playing out as Trump's tariffs rattle markets, Binance said in an April 7 research report.  

“[I]n the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,” Binance said.

Investors “will be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,” according to the report.

Bitcoin prices fell below a key psychological threshold on Monday as the financial markets sell-off intensified, but cryptocurrency experts believe it's likely to hold up better than other asset classes if a global trade war drags on.

The cryptocurrency, which trades around the clock, was at $79,000 Monday afternoon, down fractionally since the morning and recovering some of its earlier losses. It is now down about 15% in the year so far.  

Bitcoin is a digital currency and virtual payment system designed to exist outside the control of any central entity, in contrast to fiat currencies which are controlled by governments, like the U.S. dollar or the Swiss franc.

Prices for many cryptocurrencies surged after the November election when Donald Trump pledged to cut regulation and create a strategic bitcoin reserve. Trump also launched a meme coin just days before being inaugurated in January.

“Since the election stocks are down and bitcoin is up,” said Matthew Sigel, head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, which has $113.8 billion in assets under management, including in several cryptocurrency funds. “It feels to me like the White House's attempts to reorder global trade may actually be working in bitcoin and crypto's benefit.”

Despite its origins as an alternative asset class, bitcoin has tended to trade in the same direction as riskier stocks. As the global financial rout continues, bitcoin has also sold off, noted Austin Campbell, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. But that's been tempered by another trend, as global markets lose confidence in the U.S. dollar, which has long been seen as the world's most important currency.

“History so far has shown us there is not another individual currency that people are rallying around right now,” Campbell said. “Instead, you would look to gold and bitcoin as neutral assets, stores of value, the kinds of things that has been used for, for thousands of years. And in bitcoin's case, aspirationaly, trying to be the digital version of gold.”

That's why bitcoin has been volatile – moving up and down – but not making many big moves one way or the other, Campbell said.

While bitcoin has long had true believers, it has also had detractors who question its purpose. But Sigel told USA TODAY, “We're very positive on bitcoin in the longer term. We see continued adoption.”

Since early 2024, exchange-traded funds have been able to hold bitcoin, rather than just futures contracts tied to its price. Many large firms now hold the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, as well, Sigel noted. “We have high conviction that will continue.”

But it's possible some of the White House's policies may wind up at odds with others, Campbell pointed out. Trump's support for cryptocurrency – which by definition defies national borders – is “internally inconsistent” with his administration's stated goal of nationalist populism, he said.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market could see another 20% drop, but that the current drawdown is a buying opportunity in the long term as the current situation doesn't pose systematic risk.



“I see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity, but that doesn't mean we can't go down further,” Fink said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Monday.



He noted that inflationary pressure is higher than market participants expect and that many already believe the U.S. to be in a recession. As a result, he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.



Last month, Fink published a letter to shareholders, warning about Bitcoin's (BTC) threat to the U.S. dollar, which could weaken if Americans believe the cryptocurrency to be a safer asset than the dollar.



Markets, including the crypto market, have been in turmoil since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a host of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. BTC is currently trading 5% lower over the past five days and 11% lower in the past month. Stocks were hit even worse with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 13% and 15%, respectively.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is set to premiere Nicholas Bruckman's NFT documentary Minted in key global territories this week, including in North America.


	The film, subtitled The Rise (and Fall?) of the NFT, provides audiences with “a front-row seat to the explosive emergence of the turbulent NFT (non-fungible token) phenomenon as it erupts into a $40 billion digital gold rush.” It debuts Wednesday on Netflix in North America, the UK, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand.


Minted held its world premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival, followed by an international premiere at CPH:DOX in Copenhagen. It was broadcast on the PBS series Independent Lens earlier this year.

	In some sense, NFTs represent an inherent contradiction. They are digital assets – meaning, in theory, they can be reproduced endlessly and perfectly. But using block chain technology a single artwork or piece of music, for instance, can be made unique and therefore collectible. The market for NFTs took off four years ago, the timeframe when the documentary opens.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It begins with the artist known as Beeple, whose record-shattering $69 million digital art sale sends shockwaves through the traditional art world,” notes a release. “Following Beeple and a pioneering group of multidisciplinary artists from the U.S., Latin America, and Africa, Bruckman explores the soaring highs and chaotic lows of this polarizing movement as it unfolds, examining the intersection of technology, artistic expression, and value.”


	The release continues, “Against the backdrop of the NFT market's dramatic rise and collapse, Minted places the phenomenon within the broader arc of art history and offers a nuanced perspective on its evolution and enduring impact.”


	In a statement, Bruckman said, “I'm ecstatic to see Minted reach new audiences as it rolls out on Netflix. Love or hate NFTs, we hope the film entertains viewers and sparks big conversations about how art, finance, and tech are colliding.”


	By some estimates, the market for NFTs will reach more than $350 billion by 2032. But similar to cryptocurrency, it's a highly speculative enterprise, complicating any attempt at forecasts.


Minted is directed, written, and produced by Bruckman; produced and executive produced by Rahilla Zafar; and written and produced by Shawn Hazelett. The film is a production of Bruckman's film, TV, and branded content studio People's Television, Inc.

	











	Range Media Partners negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmaker, with global sales agency CAT&Docs handling international sales of the film.


	Bruckman's credits include the Emmy-nominated Not Going Quietly (PBS POV, Hulu) about the late activist Ady Barkan, and the immigration documentary La Americana (PBS America Reframed, Nat Geo).

Ethereum faced heightened selling pressure for a lengthy period due to the volatility in the broader crypto market, causing its price to undergo a sharp pullback close to the $1,400 mark. However, recent trends show that ETH seems to be entering a calmer phase as bulls are gradually taking control of the market in anticipation of a rebound.

Although Ethereum's price has declined sharply below key support levels, investors' sentiment is starting to shift toward a more positive outlook. A report from Darkfost, an on-chain data and technical expert, reveals bullish behavior from investors on one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance.

As reported by Darkfost, ETH is showing early signs of a potential turnaround to a calmer phase on Binance, as selling pressure appears to be slowly fading. This suggests a decrease in the amount of ETH being offloaded by traders and investors on the platform, marking an encouraging moment for the altcoin and its price trajectory.

The drop in sell-side pressure on the crypto exchange is a sign that bears or sellers are losing control of the market after a period of intense downward movement in ETH's price. Darfost revealed the development after a thorough examination of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric on Binance. 

Specifically, the taker buy-sell ratio is a key metric that compares the volume of buy orders to the volume of sell orders in the order book. Furthermore, it aids in visualizing the prevailing tendency, which appears to be changing at the moment.

A 7-day Simple Moving Average (SAM) view of the taker buy-sell ratio shows that the volume has flipped into positive territory, rising above level 1. Looking at the chart, the recent move above the level marks the third time since the beginning of this year, indicating investors' resilience in volatile periods.

In the meantime, the easing selling pressure may act as a launchpad for price stabilization or a price recovery in the short term as bullish momentum picks up. Darkfost highlighted that it might contribute to the formation of a bottom and, at the very least, temporarily stop the bloodbath in Ethereum if the pattern persists.

However, the expert noted that the trend is still too weak to make any clear conclusions, even though it is an encouraging sign for Ethereum's price dynamics. Thus far, Investors are closely monitoring whether bulls can take advantage of the change and propel ETH toward a short-term recovery.

The easing selling pressure might have raised the possibility of ETH experiencing a rebound in the short term. However, the altcoin‘s pullback is more likely to extend after its recent drop below a key chart pattern.

Following his examination of Ethereum's price action, Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst, has identified a massive multi-year Triangle formation, which ETH has fallen below. According to the analyst, its break below the pattern would lead to an extension of the ongoing pullback, with ETH dropping as low as $1,105 in the upcoming months.

Crypto markets have been flipping the script again. Bitcoin is teasing those all-time highs, and suddenly every altcoin looks like it's waking up from hibernation. Whale activity is back, and major players are throwing serious money at projects with real utility. With the next bull run potentially around the corner, smart community members are scouring the market for the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—and there's no shortage of contenders.

What sets Qubetics ($TICS) apart is how it's fixing one of crypto's biggest headaches—blockchain interoperability. It's not just slapping together buzzwords but offering a real-world solution that's already grabbing attention. Alongside Qubetics, Render and Theta are pushing their own tech limits, giving this list some serious heavy hitters ready to shine when the market explodes. Let's dive into the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Qubetics is making waves by solving one of blockchain's nastiest problems—getting separate networks to talk to each other. Its interoperability framework is built to make data, assets, and applications move seamlessly between blockchains, unlocking a whole new level of utility.

Think about a Toronto-based NFT creator wanting to sell digital art on a Solana marketplace while their assets sit on Ethereum. With Qubetics, they don't need a middleman or deal with double fees. The platform's AI-driven QubeQode IDE handles it, shifting assets across networks without breaking a sweat. Or picture a North Carolina logistics firm wanting to manage shipments on VeChain but needing payments processed on Polygon. Qubetics makes that combo possible—smooth, fast, and secure.



For small businesses, professionals, and regular folks tired of getting stuck in one ecosystem, this is a game-changer. It means no more worrying if a project's on the wrong chain or missing out on opportunities because of network limitations.

Right now, the Qubetics crypto presale is lighting up the scene. It's in stage 29, and over 506 million $TICS tokens are already out there, snapped up by more than 24,300 holders. The presale pulled in a solid $15.8 million. And here's the kicker: $TICS is still sitting at just $0.1573 per token.

Analysts aren't holding back either. If $TICS touches $1 post-presale, backers are looking at a 535% ROI. A $5 jump spikes it to 3,078%. At $6, it's a wild 3,713%. Some see it blasting to $10 or even $15 once the mainnet drops—which would mean 6,256% to 9,434% returns. Try finding another project throwing down numbers like that.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics isn't just a whitepaper fantasy. Its real-world interoperability solution is built for the long haul, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Render has been turning heads in the digital art and AI scene. With more demand for graphics rendering than ever—from Hollywood studios to indie game developers—Render's decentralized GPU network steps in where traditional services choke.

Lately, Render's been scoring major partnerships and expanding its use cases. The platform's supporting AI-generated content, AR/VR projects, and even big-time animation studios. With Nvidia GPUs priced like luxury cars, Render gives artists, designers, and creators affordable access to serious horsepower.

The token's performance reflects that buzz. RNDR has been climbing the charts, riding bullish sentiment driven by the explosion of AI and digital content. More creators are locking in Render as their go-to platform, and community members are taking notice.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Render's growing relevance in AI, virtual production, and digital content makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. This project isn't just following trends—it's leading them.



Theta has always been about flipping the script on video streaming. Instead of relying on centralized servers that cost a fortune and lag under pressure, Theta uses a decentralized model where users share bandwidth and resources—and get paid for it.

Recently, Theta rolled out its EdgeCloud platform, boosting its capabilities way beyond just streaming. It now supports AI computing, edge rendering, and video-based AI agents. In plain English? It's gearing up to dominate the next phase of internet content delivery.

Partnerships with major media outlets and sports organizations keep pouring in, and the community's backing is growing fast. THETA token holders are loving the network's new use cases, and buyers are snapping up tokens expecting a serious surge once the market heats up again.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Theta's taking on a massive industry with a solution that actually works. Its evolution into edge computing and AI-backed content delivery locks it in as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Finding the best altcoins to buy for next bull run isn't about chasing hype—it's about locking in projects solving real problems. Qubetics is breaking blockchain barriers with next-level interoperability. Render's changing how graphics rendering and AI content are created, while Theta is pushing video streaming and edge computing into the future.

With Qubetics' crypto presale heating up and Render and Theta setting up for major growth, these three look like serious contenders. Community members aiming to ride the next bull run won't want to sit this one out.

Qubetics delivers game-changing interoperability while offering huge ROI potential in its ongoing presale.

Render's decentralized GPU network is booming thanks to rising demand in AI, gaming, and digital content creation.

Theta's EdgeCloud now powers AI computing, edge rendering, and advanced content delivery—making it a serious contender.

Analysts predict $10-$15 after mainnet launch, which could mean over 9,434% ROI for early backers.

All three solve major real-world problems with proven use cases, making them the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

After holding relatively stable during last week's global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.

Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound.

Bitcoin's prices haven't been this low since just after President Donald Trump's Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin's price broke $100,000 in December. Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year. 

Bitcoin's backers say it is a type of digital gold that can act as a hedge against volatility. But Garrick Hileman, an independent cryptocurrency analyst, said bitcoin's price slide shows that thesis still hasn't proven to be true.

“It's just not there today,” he said. “(Bitcoin) trades like a risky tech stock.”

Other major digital assets saw even bigger one-day percentage drops on Monday morning.

Ether, the second most popular crypto token, was trading at about $1,500 on Monday morning. It's lost about half of its value since Trump's son, Eric Trump, encouraged his followers on social media to buy ether in early February.

President Trump's own meme coin, which he launched just before taking office and once hit a high of more than $70, dipped below $8 Monday morning.

Stock prices of crypto-focused companies also saw declines in early trading Monday.

Bitcoin and most altcoin prices continued their strong downtrend on Monday as market participants braced for a recession. 

Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $74,428 on April 7, its lowest level since November 6, and down by over 31% from its highest point this year.

Altcoins did much worse as many investors exited their positions. Ethereum (ETH) crashed below $1,500 and moved to its lowest level since 2023. The other top laggards were coins like Berachain (BERA), Zcash (ZEC), Litecoin (LTC), and Maker (MKR).

The ongoing crypto market crash mirrored the stock market's performance, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 each falling by over 5% but has staged a late morning comeback.

These assets plunged after Donald Trump remained adamant that his Liberation Day tariffs would continue, citing the large US trade deficits. This trade war has pushed more analysts, including those from Goldman Sachs to boost their recession odds. 

Still, there are two main reasons why stocks and crypto prices may bounce back soon. First, there are signs that Trump is open to negotiations with other countries. In a statement on Friday, he said that Vietnam was ready to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods. 

In another statement on Monday, he said that talks were underway with Japan, a top trading partner. Japan is now sending a team of negotiators to the U.S., which could result in a significant deal, including a purchase agreement.

With the U.S. stock market under pressure, there's a likelihood that Trump will seek a major deal with countries like China and those in the European Union.

Second, there is a likelihood that the Federal Reserve will intervene as it has done in the past black swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Global Financial Crisis. Traders expect five interest rate cuts this year, including an emergency one. In a note, a Bloomberg analyst said:

“The Federal Reserve may soon not have a choice but to cut rates. Tariffs raise the ugly specter of inflation, true, but if growth turns pear-shaped, the Fed will have no choice but to prioritize the economy.”

Therefore, a combination of interest rate cuts and trade negotiations could help reverse the ongoing crypto market crash. For example, Bitcoin and altcoins surged to record highs in 2021 after the Fed slashed interest rates and implemented quantitative easing during the pandemic.

WeBank Technology Services has unveiled POTOS (Portal of the Orient Symposium for Web3), a new blockchain and real world asset (RWA) tokenization infrastructure targeting Hong Kong's Web3 ecosystem. In its initial phase, POTOS provides a three layer ‘value exchange' infrastructure solution for institutions: a high performance blockchain to connect different asset types, cross chain protocols enabling atomic swaps, and advanced security technologies including zero knowledge proofs.

“We hope that this value exchange evolution, driven by the trust machine, can truly solidify the foundation of trust for the advancement of Hong Kong's Web3 ecosystem,” said Henry Ma, EVP and CIO of WeBank. As a wholly owned subsidiary of WeBank in Hong Kong, the company aims to leverage its blockchain expertise to help position Hong Kong as a hub for compliant and innovative Web3 practices. WeBank was founded by Tencent, the owner of WeChat Pay, and still retains a 30% interest in the company.

POTOS is built on the FISCO BCOS blockchain platform, a Chinese open source initiative spearheaded by WeBank. The system boasts financial grade performance with processing capacity of up to 200,000 TPS and horizontal scalability. Since becoming fully open source in 2017, the platform has been implemented in over 500 digital transformation projects and established a community of more than 5,000 institutions and 100,000 individuals.

This development aligns with broader trends in WeBank's blockchain strategy. At a 2023 conference in China, a senior WeBank executive discussed the potential for an “Open Consortium Chain 2.0” to target Web3 opportunities. While China restricts cryptocurrency and public blockchains, WeBank is working to transition from permissioned consortium chains to blockchains “with a public spirit.” By 2023 the bank's  blockchain had processed over 400 million transactions with around 30 applications.

Meanwhile, in the competitive landscape, WeBank's main rival Ant has focused its international blockchain efforts on cross border payments, including tokenized deposits and stablecoins. Ant recently announced partnerships with Standard Chartered and OCBC bank for its Whale platform, including for enabling 24/7 real time payments between Singapore and Malaysia.

Economic tariffs could be helped with technology.

getty

Blockchain and AI may soon feel the effects of sweeping changes in global trade policies, as tariffs became the talk of the town in April 2025—and not just in trade circles. The U.S. rolled out a sweeping new set of tariffs, creating ripples throughout global supply chains. Almost every imported product now faces at least a baseline 10% duty, but some nations felt the pinch more than others.

China, in particular, saw significant hikes with tariffs reaching up to 54% on critical sectors like electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar cells. Vietnam didn't escape either, with a hefty 46% tariff impacting its key exports—think textiles and electronics. Vietnam is now looking at discussions and negotiations on the tariffs along with 50 other countries that have reached out to US for negotiations.

Europe, Japan, and India weren't left out of the tariff wave either, facing new duties of 20%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. And if you're shopping for a new ride, take note: a 25% tariff now hits all imported automobiles, affecting nearly half of U.S. auto sales.

The reaction? China responded swiftly, implementing a 34% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. imports starting April 10, 2025. These changes aren't just numbers—they're shaking up trade relationships, causing uncertainty, and forcing businesses everywhere to rethink their global strategies.

For companies shipping electronics from Vietnam to the U.S., these shifting trade policies aren't just headlines—they're operational headaches. Imagine you're running a supply chain for a hardware startup. Your team scrambles to determine whether the latest tariff rates affect your products, and if so, by how much. Meanwhile, your CFO asks whether rerouting production to another country would save millions. This is where emerging tech—AI and blockchain—steps in, not as buzzwords, but as lifelines.

Artificial Intelligence can digest complex tariff codes and regulatory changes in real time, flagging risks before goods even leave the port. Blockchain, on the other hand, acts as a digital notary, locking in proof of where products were made, how they moved, and who handled them. Together, these technologies offer a smarter way to handle global trade friction.

Circle back to that hardware company. With AI models constantly scanning trade databases and tariff announcements, the logistics team can get immediate updates on the best shipping routes and cost projections. Blockchain ensures that customs officers—and auditors—can verify the country of origin without endless paperwork or risk of fraud. The time and cost savings are huge, but the real win is agility.

Tariffs, by nature, are unpredictable. They change with political winds, react to global events, and often lack the clarity needed for confident decision-making. Businesses operating on tight margins can't afford guesswork. In this new era, having a digital infrastructure that supports transparent, automated, and verifiable decisions isn't just smart—it's necessary.

Across the globe, startups and innovators are already working on this. Take OpenSC, an Australia-based platform that tracks products from origin to shelf using blockchain. By scanning a simple QR code, buyers—and regulators—can trace exactly where a good came from. In a tariff-heavy landscape, that level of transparency could mean the difference between paying a 25% duty or none at all.

Similarly, Everledger, a U.K.-based company, is applying blockchain to authenticate the origin of diamonds and other luxury goods. Now imagine applying that same concept to industrial goods—steel, semiconductors, lithium batteries—where origin determines tariff rates. What if every bolt, battery, or board came with a blockchain-verified passport?

AI isn't sitting idle either. Predictive models are already helping companies assess the long-term cost implications of sourcing from one country over another. If tariffs on Vietnamese semiconductors jump next quarter, an AI model could suggest alternatives in real time—backed by real trade data, not assumptions. This allows companies to pivot faster, avoid disruptions, and maintain compliance.

Recent research by the World Trade Organization found that misclassification of goods contributes to billions in lost revenue annually. AI's ability to detect errors or fraud in trade documentation can help minimize those losses dramatically. A 2022 McKinsey report noted that combining AI and blockchain in customs and compliance systems could reduce processing costs by 30% or more, while increasing speed and accuracy.

There are even efforts underway to tackle the misuse of origin labeling, a tactic sometimes employed to dodge tariffs. Blockchain's immutable ledger makes it virtually impossible to forge shipment logs or fake a product's origin. AI can then audit this data for inconsistencies or red flags, alerting compliance teams before issues become legal problems.

While AI can analyze tariffs and blockchain can secure records, there's a critical missing piece: verification. That's where technologies like Truebit come in. Truebit's verification layer adds computational transparency—ensuring AI systems calculating tariffs are themselves accountable. This is vital in scenarios like the Trump administration's complex tariff structure, which included universal rates around 10% and country-specific duties, such as Cambodia's 49%.

Truebit is already deployed in real-world supply chains. It supports Quadrans, the blockchain behind the EU-funded TRICK project, a €8 million initiative tracking cross-border textile and food supply chains. "While blockchains can immutably record shipping records, and AI can analyze tariff patterns, there's a critical verification gap between them,” said Jason Teutsch, Founder and Chief Scientist at Truebit.

“Companies need proof that the AI's calculations themselves are trustworthy, especially with tariffs now ranging from 10% to nearly 50% depending on the country of origin. Like a notary for computational processes, verification technology can create proof that an AI system correctly applied the correct tariff rates and pulled data from legitimate sources – something customs authorities are increasingly demanding."

Davide Costa, co-founder of the Quadrans Foundation, reinforced this with his experience: “We discovered that blockchain alone wasn't enough when tracking products across international borders. The moment data moves between systems or undergoes AI analysis, verification becomes critical. Verification technology ensures that customs authorities and trading partners can trust not just the records, but the calculations and transformations applied to that data—essential when regulatory compliance and billions in tariffs are on the line.”

Even new stealth startups like Robotax are being built around this pain point. "The Trump administration's tariff reciprocity plan has a blind spot: we can't actually prove products are taxed correctly,” said David Deputy, a finance and regulatory tax software professional. “Blockchain can track a product moving from Nigeria to France to the USA, but it can't verify if the correct tariffs and sales or VAT tax were actually applied at each step. This is where computational verification becomes essential."

So, what does this look like in action? A company exporting textiles from Southeast Asia might deploy a system where every step—from fabric sourcing to final packaging—is logged on-chain. AI monitors the data flow, scanning for anomalies or mismatches against tariff rule sets. If a discrepancy arises, the system flags it before the shipment ever leaves the dock. That's not just smart—it's transformative.

The future of tariffs doesn't have to be murky. Yes, global trade will always be shaped by diplomacy and politics, but how businesses navigate those waters can be upgraded. Blockchain and AI give companies the tools not just to react—but to plan, adapt, and lead.

As countries tighten regulations and implement digital customs systems, the companies that win will be those who lean into innovation. Tariffs may never go away—but the confusion, inefficiency, and risk associated with them? That can.

It's time for businesses to stop fighting yesterday's trade wars with outdated tools. The new era of global trade demands tech that's proactive, predictive, and permanent. Blockchain and AI don't just offer a way through the tariff storm—they offer a way forward.

Bitcoin hovered below the $77,000 level in early Monday trading as the broader crypto market downturn deepened. Losses extended across altcoins, with major ones like Ether, XRP, and Solana suffering double-digit losses ahead of the US stock market opening.

Bitcoin fell below $75,000 today, its lowest level since November, as crypto markets tumbled amid growing concerns over President Trump's new global tariff policies impacting Asian markets, CoinGecko data shows.

The crypto market selloff intensified with major altcoins posting severe losses.

Ether dropped 17% to trade under $1,400, levels not seen in March 2023. The sharp price drop forced the liquidation of an Ethereum whale, who suffered losses surpassing $100 million.

XRP declined 16% to $1.7, with its market cap falling to $102 million and losing its position among the top three crypto assets. Solana and Dogecoin each fell 16%, while Cardano dropped 15%.

Binance Coin and TRON showed more resilience, declining 8% and 6% respectively. The total crypto market capitalization decreased by over 10% to $2.5 trillion, representing approximately $100 billion in lost value within 10 hours.

The decline coincided with sharp falls on Asian stock markets. Taiwan's benchmark index plunged nearly 10%, its largest single-day drop since 1990.

Shares of major Taiwanese companies like TSMC and Foxconn tumbled nearly 10%, triggering automatic trading halts. In response, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) introduced temporary short-selling restrictions in an effort to stabilize the market.

The ripple effect was felt across the region. Japan's Nikkei index plunged over 8% on April 7, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index sank roughly 12%. China's CSI 300 Index also dropped sharply, falling 7%.

In South Korea, the Kospi shed more than 5% early in the session, prompting a five-minute circuit breaker. Singapore's Straits Times Index wasn't spared either, slipping nearly 8%.

Markets in Australia and New Zealand followed the downtrend. The ASX 200 in Australia dropped 6.3%, and New Zealand's NZX 50 slid more than 3.5%.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, said Monday he's been actively purchasing Bitcoin while maintaining a cautious stance on altcoins.

“Been nibbling on $BTC all day, and shall continue,” Hayes said, indicating an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy amid market volatility.

The analyst points to cheaper altcoins but expects Bitcoin's dominance – its share of the total crypto market cap – to increase towards 70%, implying Bitcoin's market-leading gains.

“Shitcoins are getting in our strike zone,” he said, “but I think #bitcoin dominance keeps zooming towards 70%. So we are not gorging at the shitcoin supermarket.”

Hayes reiterated that the catalyst for Bitcoin's growth is the central banks' continued use of monetary stimulus in response to economic slowdowns.

              Highlights            



                        Traditional financial institutions are now handling hundreds of billions of dollars in blockchain transactions, underscoring how the cryptocurrency space is maturing.                      


                        The integration of AI tools offers the potential for enhancing crypto literacy, compliance and the fight against illicit financial activity.                      


                        Stablecoins play a key role in mainstream adoption, but the absence of a federal framework for stablecoins makes it difficult for financial services and enterprises to scale adoption.                      

File this under things you couldn't say two years ago: Blockchain technology is maturing, and its potential for compliant, mainstream use is growing.

“Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Karen Webster.

In particular, Levin said the adoption of stablecoins is one of the most significant shifts in blockchain usage, at least since Chainalysis began in 2014. The shift has been monumental. Now, hundreds of billions of dollars move across blockchains while being stored in traditional financial institutions like banks or United States treasuries.

“When we started the business in 2014, that wasn't yet a concept,” he said. “Cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain, including the U.S. dollar.”

Yet, challenges remain around global policy frameworks and the integration of concurrent advances such as artificial intelligence into on-chain ecosystems.

There is a push for a federal framework around stablecoins, and it's important for industry confidence Levin said.

“Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” he said, adding that as the conversation around crypto regulation evolves, providing clarity, compliance and insight will become more critical.

Chainalysis, a blockchain data company, was founded with a mission to illuminate the traditionally opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. Over a decade later, it boasts a dataset spanning 70 countries, capable of providing deep insights into how crypto is used, abused and regulated.

As it relates to the growth of stablecoins, tracking real dollars rather than merely crypto tokens has broadened the scope of blockchain monitoring. This evolution has transformed blockchain from a niche technology to a mainstream component of financial infrastructure, Levin said.

“What we are starting to see with OCC guidance and SEC guidance … is that this is something that is going to be possible for banks to do,” he said. “We now track not just cryptocurrency tokens, but … real dollars that are being used to settle financial transactions, remittances and payments all across the world on these rails.”

Still, a persistent criticism of cryptocurrency is its alleged use in illicit activities, and scams and fraud remain separate challenges. Estimates from Chainalysis highlight that between $10 billion and $12 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions annually are linked to scams.

Chainalysis is uniquely positioned to monitor the entire “supply chain of scam activity,” offering insight into how scammers procure tools and sell illicit services, Levin said.

“We've helped the government seize more than $10 billion worth of crypto assets from criminal proceeds,” he said.

There has also been progress made in combatting the use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for money laundering and other financial crimes.

“The cryptocurrency transactions that we've been able to link to those types of activities is actually a smaller percentage of the overall activity,” he said. “It started off much higher, but now it's consistently below 1% of the transactions that we can associate directly to these types of actors.”

This decline is largely thanks to improved regulation and the ability of blockchain monitoring tools to help detect illicit transactions more accurately when compared to many traditional financial systems.

One area of excitement shared by stakeholders within the Web3 ecosystem is the potential for AI to improve crypto literacy and compliance. Despite the inroads blockchain has made to date, widespread misunderstandings about the technology's opacity persist.

“Even the people who are advocating for the technology … don't also advocate for the fact that cryptocurrency has been much more effective as a tool for both enterprises identifying risky activity off-boarding bad clients from their platforms and law enforcement being able to hold scammers to account,” Levin said.

Chainalysis itself continues to invest in educating enterprises about how blockchain works, using AI to simplify complex concepts for regulators and industry participants.

“I'm very optimistic about the potential for AI to actually contextualize some of the transactions and concepts for people,” Levin said.

“We still got work to do,” he added. “But the progress is real. And the potential is enormous.”

Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency has signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. According to the agency, Binance will assist Kyrgyzstan in several key areas, including the development of blockchain infrastructure and the creation of a national cryptocurrency reserve.

The partnership will also focus on training young professionals, government employees, and specialists in blockchain technologies, virtual asset management, and cybersecurity. In addition, Binance will provide support in establishing a management system for virtual assets and blockchain technology in Kyrgyzstan source.

While public interest in cryptocurrencies continues to grow in Kyrgyzstan, the market remains poorly regulated. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce proposed legislation to create licensed crypto banks that would offer regulated banking services related to digital assets. The ministry stressed the need to integrate crypto assets into the national financial system, citing the rapid advancement of digital technology and the economic potential of legalizing cryptocurrency transactions. The introduction of crypto banks is expected to increase transaction volumes, boost tax revenues, and create new jobs in the fintech sector, positioning Kyrgyzstan as a regional hub for financial innovation.

In a separate move to stabilize the sector, Kyrgyzstan's Cabinet of Ministers significantly raised the minimum authorized capital required for crypto exchanges, from 100 million KGS to 10 billion KGS, a hundredfold increase. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce, which initiated the reform, stated that the measure is designed to ensure the financial stability of crypto platforms, safeguard user interests, and foster a transparent and secure virtual assets market. Existing exchanges have until January 1, 2026, to comply with the new capital requirements.

The tool is being touted as a digital safety net for artists in a fast-evolving tech era.

A pair of artists have launched a new app aimed at helping creators secure their work against the growing reach of artificial intelligence, as concerns mount over AI's use of human-generated content.

The app, named ARK, was developed by screenwriter Ed Bennett-Coles and songwriter Jamie Hartman. It uses blockchain technology to log creative ownership from concept to completion, offering a decentralised safeguard for writers, musicians, and other creators.

“AI is coming in and taking jobs,” Hartman told AFP. “This is our work. It's human. And we decide what it's worth.”

The platform allows users to register demos, scripts or any creative file, with additional features like biometric verification, NDAs, and blockchain time stamps designed to help prove ownership. It also enables collaborators to track their contributions in real time.

Bennett-Coles said the idea was born from his “career death moment” after reading about AI's first attempt at screenwriting back in 2008. Now, nearly two decades later, ARK aims to offer a solution by “ring-fencing” the creative process.

The app, set for a full launch in summer 2025, has secured investment from Claritas Capital and partnered with performing rights organisation BMI.

Its creators hope it will stand up in court as legal proof of authorship via blockchain-backed “smart contracts”.

“Copyright is a good principle—if you can prove it,” Hartman said. “Why not update how that's done?”

The initiative reflects growing unease in the creative sector over AI's rapid adoption and its potential to undercut traditional forms of artistic labour.

“Growth for growth's sake is the philosophy of the cancer cell,” Bennett-Coles said, adding that AI often dismisses the value of the creative journey.

The developers argue ARK is not just a tool, but a necessary defence mechanism for creators in the digital age.

A whale's Ethereum worth $105 million was liquidated after ETH dropped $1,650, despite the whale adding 2,160 ETH to delay the liquidation.

Ethereum faced intensified selling pressure in the past 24 hours, resulting in a sharp 19% decline that brought its price down to $1,460. Over the past month, ETH has dropped by 30%, driven by broader macroeconomic concerns. 

This steep descent has unsettled the market and triggered significant liquidation events, including the collapse of a massive whale position tied to a $105 million collateralized loan.

In an attempt to rescue his position, a whale holding a 67,500 ETH collateralized loan with a $1,650 liquidation threshold added new collateral early in the morning. 

The wallet added 2,160.52 ETH in three separate transactions: 1000.25 ETH, 1000 ETH, and 160 ETH. This effort slightly improved the collateral ratio from 152.13% to 160.25%. However, the new ratio remained dangerously close to the liquidation threshold of approximately 145%.

The price of ETH continued to slide, falling below the critical $1,650 mark. This drop activated liquidation protocols on the loan. Over the next hour, multiple automated actions occurred, starting with the liquidation of approximately 32,106 ETH to cover 35.3 million DAI.

A second liquidation of roughly 32,076 ETH against the same DAI value followed, and smaller liquidations were recorded again. These events totally liquidated the 67,500 ETH position, fully repaying a 74.4 million DAI loan.

With this wave of decline, the whale position of 67,500 ETH ($105 million) loan position liquidation line at $1,650 was completely liquidated, which also contributed to the further decline of ETH. He also added 2,160 ETH of collateral to lower the liquidation line. @EmberCN…

While one position was fully liquidated, another whale narrowly avoided a similar fate by adjusting their holdings just in time. This second position originally held 57,000 ETH with a liquidation price set at $1,564. The market drop pushed ETH close to that threshold, posing a serious risk of forced liquidation.

Roughly 90 minutes before hitting that margin, the wallet sold 3,920.8 ETH and exchanged it for 5.775 million DAI. This move helped reduce the overall position size and lowered the liquidation price. 

Now holding 53,000 ETH, the adjusted liquidation threshold sits at $1,495, still within a vulnerable range given ongoing market volatility.

The bearish sentiments across the markets have been intensified as Bitcoin marks range below $75,000 and Ethereum below $1500

The growing fear among the market participants is increasing the selling pressure that could drag the levels to the bottoms, offering a strong entry point

Meanwhile, altcoins like EOS and FARTCOIN remain within the bullish range and hence are believed to trigger a strong rebound soon

The global markets plummet as the tariff war escalates after Donald Trump's Liberation Day. The stock markets across the globe, including the US, Japan, China, Taiwan, the UK, and many more, have opened on a huge bearish note. While many refer to it as Black Monday, experts believe the bearish influence may settle soon. With this, crypto markets are also expected to recover, and this could be when these altcoins may make a strong move. 

The EOS price has been demonstrating massive strength in the last few days of Q1 2025, but the token faced a 20% pullback after entering the crucial resistance zone between $0.82 and $0.88. Despite the plunge below the multi-month ascending trend line, the price remains within a bullish zone. Hence, it holds the possibility of a strong recovery upright. 

The EOS price has dropped significantly, but a potential ascending trend seems to be imminent. The price is testing the crucial support at the 200-day MA at $0.677, and even if it loses the 50-day MA at $0.588, it may offer a strong base. Therefore, the EOS price is expected to trigger a strong rebound as the volume has surged notably, which reflects the increased trading activity. 

The global market conditions have failed to heavily impact the FARTCOIN price, which is attracting the significant attention of the market participants. The bulls are trying hard to revive a rebound, which could elevate the levels back to $0.6 very soon. However, volume remains low, which could adversely impact the pace of recovery. 

As seen in the above chart, the Bollinger Bands have begun to squeeze, citing the drop in volume and volatility. Moreover, the 50-day MA is offering a strong base, which collides with the lower bands of Bollinger. Therefore, the FARTCOIN price is expected to trigger a rebound or else may drop to test the support levels and later trigger a rebound.

The bulls seem to have entered the markets and are utilizing the ‘buy at dip' opportunity well. However, the Bitcoin price has triggered a decent recovery, and if it rises above $78,000, the path towards a strong recovery may be activated. Otherwise, a plunge below $72,800 could further drag the entire crypto markets lower.

Highlights

Satoshi Street is witnessing a major selloff as the crypto market crash in response to escalating global tensions triggered by Trump's renewed tariff war. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have dropped 6–12% in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations exceeding $900 million. The steep correction has prompted analysts to question Bitcoin's “digital gold” narrative and its reliability as a hedge amid growing volatility.

On Monday morning in Asian trading hours, crypto market crashed as risk-ON assets faced heavy volatility. Top markets like China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, hit circuit breakers in the early trading hours on Monday, with their indexes crashing 10%, sending the global markets into a situation of absolute turmoil.

Bitcoin price is down 6.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at the crucial support of $77,500, with daily trading volumes up by a staggering 220% to more than $44 billion. As per the Coinglass data, BTC's 24-hour liquidations have surged to $322 million. Based on the Bitcoin technical chart, $77,500 is a crucial support level for BTC. If it fails to hold these levels, further correction could be deeper.

Although Bitcoin price showed resilience to the Dow Jones crash last week, it is down by 7% today. However, it is still performing better as Asian indices are down 9-10% today. On the other hand, precious metals are up, as gold prices shot up $80 earlier today, and silver has an upward trajectory as well. Following today's crypto market crash, Peter Schiff took the opportunity to add:

“After a delayed reaction on Friday, crypto is finally starting to crack. Ether has already fallen to its lowest level since Oct. 2023, down 65% from its peak, and Bitcoin just traded below 81K, taking out last week's low. It could be a long day for those trapped in Bitcoin ETFs”.

As Donald Trump's tariff war increases odds of US recession, debates over Bitcoin's “digital gold” status have picked up once again. Long-term players still continue to remain bullish about BTC despite this volatility. Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise Investments, noted:

“As nations trust each other less. As corporations have more difficulty doing business. A global, digital, apolitical store of value — controlled by no nation — looks increasingly differentiated. Bitcoin's place in the world has never been more valuable”.

The altcoins market correction has extended further with Ethereum (ETH) price crashing 13.5% at press time and plummeting to $1,550. As a result, the world's largest acltoin has extended its 2025 losses to more than 53% while leaving investors in a complete state of shock. Investors believe that ETH price crash today leaves the gates open for the $1,100-$1,300 range. However, on-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that whales are buying the ETH price dips.

Other altcoins have faced a drop of a similar magnitude. XRP price is down 14.5%, dropping under the crucial $2 support, while analysts predict a further crash to $0.65 ahead. Solana price is also down today by 14% to $102 levels, while Dogecoin price has plummeted 16% to $0.143 levels.

The Ethereum network has reached a historic milestone with 200,000 addresses holding stablecoins. This record adoption is establishing itself as the backbone of a more mature digital economy, potentially reshuffling the cards for this altcoin whose price struggles to take off.

Ethereum has just crossed a historic threshold: more than 200,000 unique addresses now hold stablecoins. This steady progression since mid-2023, peaking at the end of March 2025, reveals a profound transformation in the use of blockchain.

Unlike previous bullish cycles marked by speculation, the adoption of stablecoins follows a stable and sustainable trajectory. USDT dominates the market, while USDC and DAI are gradually gaining ground.

This figure of 200,000 addresses takes on great importance when considering that it represents a significant share of users who are truly active on Ethereum.

Indeed, the number of truly operational addresses is much lower than the total number of created addresses, and this massive adoption of stablecoins reflects an ecosystem that is maturing and turning towards practical uses.

The accelerated adoption of stablecoins on Ethereum reflects the unique power of this blockchain as a programmable finance platform. Its technical robustness, combined with the most developed DeFi ecosystem, makes it the ideal ground for the rise of stable digital currencies.

In a crypto market known for its volatility, stablecoins offer a haven of stability necessary for daily transactions, capital preservation, and as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto universe.

This stability has become essential to attract new users who are less inclined to endure the extreme fluctuations of assets like bitcoin or Ethereum itself.

The rise of stablecoins also brings considerable liquidity to decentralized exchange platforms and lending protocols, thereby strengthening the entire ecosystem.

This increased liquidity facilitates more efficient transactions and paves the way for more accessible and less costly cross-border financial services than traditional solutions.

However, this rise is not without challenges. Regulators' attention is intensifying, particularly regarding the transparency of reserves and compliance with anti-money laundering rules.

Moreover, competing blockchains like Solana and Base are gaining ground in the stablecoin ecosystem, offering alternatives with lower fees and faster transactions.

This record adoption of stablecoins comes at a paradoxical time for Ethereum. While the blockchain is going through a tough period with a continuous drop in its price and a decline in activity, the growing interest in stablecoins could serve as a catalyst for recovery.

The upcoming Pectra update, scheduled for May 7, 2025, could also play a crucial role in this dynamic. By improving the capabilities of the blockchain and reducing transaction costs, it could make the use of stablecoins even more attractive on Ethereum.

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is a strange, alien world. Covered in rivers and lakes of liquid methane, icy boulders and dunes of soot-like "sand," its topography has long fascinated scientists and invited speculation on whether lifeforms might lurk beneath the moon's thick, hazy atmosphere.

An international team of researchers co-led by Antonin Affholder at the U of A Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Peter Higgins at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary sciences set out to develop a realistic scenario of what life on Titan might look like if it does exist, where it is most likely to occur and how much of it might be present.

"In our study, we focus on what makes Titan unique when compared to other icy moons: its plentiful organic content," said Affholder, who is a postdoctoral research associate.

Using bioenergetic modeling, the team found that Titan's subsurface ocean, estimated to be as deep as about 300 miles, may support lifeforms that consume organic material. Published in The Planetary Science Journal, their study concludes that while Titan could possibly harbor simple, microscopic life, it likely could support only a few pounds of biomass overall.

Often described as "Earthlike on the surface, ocean world on the inside," Titan is the target for future exploration via NASA's Dragonfly mission. While much has been speculated about possible scenarios that could give rise to living organisms on Titan based on the moon's abundant organic chemistry, previous estimates have suffered from what Affholder considers an overly simplistic approach.

"There has been this sense that because Titan has such abundant organics, there is no shortage of food sources that could sustain life," Affholder said. "We point out that not all of these organic molecules may constitute food sources, the ocean is really big, and there's limited exchange between the ocean and the surface, where all those organics are, so we argue for a more nuanced approach."

At the core of the research lies a "back-to-basics" approach that attempted to come up with a plausible scenario for life on Titan that assumed one of the simplest and most remarkable of all biological metabolic processes: fermentation. Familiar to Earthlings for its use in sourdough breadmaking, beer brewing and -- less desirably -- its role in spoiling forgotten leftovers, fermentation only requires organic molecules, but no "oxidant" such as oxygen, a crucial requirement for other metabolic processes, such as respiration.

"Fermentation probably evolved early in the history of Earth's life, and does not require us to open any door into unknown or speculative mechanisms that may or may not have happened on Titan," Affholder said, adding that life on Earth could have first emerged as feeding on organic molecules left over from Earth's formation.

"We asked, could similar microbes exist on Titan?" Affholder said. "If so, what potential does Titan's subsurface ocean have for a biosphere feeding off of the seemingly vast inventory of abiotic organic molecules synthesized in Titan's atmosphere, accumulating at its surface and present in the core?"

The researchers specifically focused on one organic molecule, glycine, the simplest of all known amino acids.

"We know that glycine was relatively abundant in any sort of primordial matter in the solar system," Affholder said. "When you look at asteroids, comets, the clouds of particles and gas from which stars and planets like our solar system form, we find glycine or its precursors in pretty much all those places."

However, computer simulations revealed that only a small fraction of Titan's organic material may be suitable for microbial consumption. Glycine-consuming microbes in Titan's ocean would depend on a steady supply of the amino acid from the surface, through the thick icy shell. Previous work by the same team had shown that meteorites impacting the ice could leave behind "melt pools" of liquid water, which then sink through the ice and deliver surface materials to the ocean.

"Our new study shows that this supply may only be sufficient to sustain a very small population of microbes weighing a total of only a few kilograms at most -- equivalent to the mass of a small dog," Affholder said. "Such a tiny biosphere would average less than one cell per liter of water over Titan's entire vast ocean."

For a future mission to Titan, the odds of finding life -- if it is indeed there -- could be like looking for a needle in a haystack, unless Titan's potential for life is to be found elsewhere than in its surface organic content, the team suggests.

"We conclude that Titan's uniquely rich organic inventory may not in fact be available to play the role in the moon's habitability to the extent one might intuitively think," Affholder said.

The International Space Science Institute, or ISSI in Bern, Switzerland, funded the research.

A new study by the University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Finland, found that a significant proportion of Parkinson's disease diagnoses are later corrected. Up to one in six diagnoses changed after ten years of follow-up, and the majority of new diagnoses were made within two years of the original diagnosis.

A recent study published in Neurology reveals significant diagnostic instability in Parkinson's disease, with 13.3% of diagnoses revised over a 10-year follow-up period. When dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is treated as a separate diagnostic category, the revision rate increases to 17.7%.

The large-scale study followed over 1,600 patients initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The results demonstrate the ongoing difficulty of distinguishing it from other similar disorders, despite improvements in diagnostics.

"Notably, a majority of these diagnostic changes occur within the first two years of diagnosis, which emphasises the challenges and uncertainty clinicians face in diagnosing Parkinson's disease accurately," explains Valtteri Kaasinen, Professor of Neurology at the University of Turku and principal investigator of the study.

Clinical practices and diagnostic challenges increase misdiagnoses 

Commonly revised diagnoses included vascular parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and clinically undetermined parkinsonism.

While dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging was frequently used to aid in diagnosis, the study found that postmortem neuropathological examinations were only conducted in 3% of deceased patients, with 64% of these confirming the initial Parkinson's disease diagnoses. This decline in postmortem examinations mirrors a global trend seen in other studies.

The study also highlights the difficulty in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, particularly in relation to the controversial "one-year rule."

"This rule, which considers the temporal sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms, resulted in more latter cases identified compared to the original clinical diagnoses. While the one-year rule is used in clinical practice, its relevance may be limited by the overlap between these disorders, with substantial group-level differences but minimal distinctions at the individual level," says Kaasinen.

Urgent need for improved diagnostic processes 

"The key conclusions of our study are the urgent need for ongoing refinement of diagnostic processes, enhanced clinical training for neurologists, more frequent use of postmortem diagnostic confirmation, and the development of widely accessible, cost-effective biomarkers," Kaasinen summarises.

Increasing the rate of autopsies would enhance clinicians' understanding of diagnostic accuracy, particularly in cases where initial diagnoses are unclear or revised. The development of cost-effective and accessible biomarkers could improve diagnostic precision, particularly in non-specialised settings, ultimately leading to better patient care.

This retrospective study was conducted at Turku University Hospital and three regional hospitals in Finland, analysing patient records from 2006 to 2020. The study aimed to evaluate the long-term diagnostic stability of Parkinson's disease and assess the accuracy of initial diagnoses over time in a large cohort of patients diagnosed by neurologists, with or without specialisation in movement disorders.

Tantalizing clues in the 4-billion-year-old asteroid Bennu samples could indicate the molecular formations that some scientists say support the workings of consciousness. 

Every six years, an asteroid by the name of Bennu passes by Earth. Bennu is a small, loosely compacted ball of black rocks that formed nearly 4.6 billion years ago. Recently, scientists accomplished an unprecedented feat, sending a spacecraft billions of miles to the asteroid and back to collect 121.6 grams of material from Bennu for study at an Arizona State University lab. NASA tasked the OSIRIS-REx team that retrieved material from Bennu to examine it for clues to the nature and origins of life. 

Tantalizing evidence in the Bennu sample suggests that the asteroid contains constituents of the “primordial soup” that scientists believe likely led to life emerging on Earth. But that's not all. It could also contain particular molecules that could have formed crystalline formations that some scientists believe are key to consciousness. These formations may have been present among organic molecules for a hundred million years before genes existed, enabling the earliest forms of decision-making and self-organization into life. 

According to Dr. Stuart Hameroff, a former anesthesiologist and one of the world's leading experts on consciousness, the director of the Bennu team, Dante Lauretta, reached out to him before they had received the samples. Both are at Arizona State University. Lauretta was wondering how one might find signs of life in the material they were about to receive and found an intriguing paper by Dr. Hameroff on the nature of consciousness and carbon molecules. 

The prevailing theory of consciousness is that humans manufacture it inside the brain—that it boils down to a computation. Yet, Dr. Hameroff and his collaborator, Nobel Laureate and physicist Roger Penrose, have argued for decades that consciousness made the world and not the other way around. They believe that it is not manufactured in the brain but only processed there, via an external quantum wave function sweeping through the universe that interacts with tiny protein tubes. These microtubules form the cytoskeleton of living cells and are especially plentiful in brain cells. Hameroff, Penrose and their collaborator, physicist and oncologist Jack Tuszyński demonstrated in 2023 that quantum activity in the brain could take place in these microtubules. According to this idea, known as  Orchestrated Objective Reduction theory, conscious moments occur almost constantly as the quantum wave function collapses, creating moments of conscious awareness. Hameroff names this quantum wave function proto-consciousness or “dream state” consciousness. 

Their other collaborator, quantum mechanics expert Anirban Bandyopadhyay, Ph.D., calls it the music of the universe. Consciousness in the universe can be compared to a Tibetan singing bowl. When you run a mallet around the rim of the bowl, the sound grows as the vibration from the mallet resonates in the bowl. The longer you run the mallet around the bowl, the louder the song gets as the vibrational resonance increases. When universal consciousness, or the music of the universe, hits the consciousness chambers of the microtubules, the resonance grows like the mallet and the bowl. 

And here's where Bennu comes in.

The asteroid is made up of carbons—the molecules that form the basis of all life. Researchers found that the samples include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to make proteins. The bits of rock also contain all five nucleobases used to store and transmit genetic instructions in more complex biomolecules, such as DNA and RNA. Plus, the team found salts, evidence that the larger space object which Bennu broke away from may have contained a similar primordial soup to Earth's own, 4 billion years ago. These are all signs pointing to Bennu as a repository of life's precursors.

But what about signs of consciousness?

Bennu also could contain the structures that allow the kind of quantum resonance Hameroff believes are needed for consciousness. These are organic ring molecules whose extra electrons form electron clouds that exchange photons, as in fluorescence. Organic rings are key components of biomolecules, and if you have a bunch forming a specific, periodic crystalline formation—like an array or lattice—Hameroff says they become quantum oscillators that are able to support consciousness.

In the human brain, he said, it's these quantum oscillators in our microtubules that give us our conscious experiences. Neurons are incredibly complex. Each neuronal cell comprises billions of microtubules that are oscillating, or passing electrons back and forth, at the astonishing speed of 1015 times per second.

Conventional brain studies have only looked at brain activity in a narrow range—frequencies around 40 hertz, or cycles per second, in the millisecond time range. But Anirban Bandyopadhyay and his team at Japan's National Institute of Material Sciences found that there are, in fact, three bands of frequencies that conduct electricity at the neuron level; three bands of higher frequencies at the microtubule level; and three bands of even higher frequencies at the level of tubulin—the material microtubules are made of. Within each frequency another three bands of frequencies operate: a triplet of triplets. Bandyopadhyay's team concluded that most cognitive, perceptive, and emotional bursts occur around 200–700 nanoseconds.

They believe this triplet of triplets pattern of resonance is a fundamental pattern of the universe. It's also found in DNA, RNA and other molecules, Hameroff said, so they hope to find evidence of it in the Bennu material.

The asteroid material, of course, is not as complex as a neuron. However, Hameroff postulates that while the earliest qualia—conscious experiences—would have been random, organisms experiencing the pleasure of a spark of consciousness would have sought more. They would have experimented and organized themselves in such a way as to maximize the likelihood of creating another such experience. After all, even single celled organisms eat, swim around, have sex. Hameroff thinks these polyaromatic ring molecules might have organized themselves to increase opportunities for conscious quantum experiences.

Lauretta says that polyaromatic ring molecules are everywhere in space, including in interstellar dust. “These are the same molecules which are the basis of organic chemistry, and life,” Hameroff says. “So we realized cooperative quantum oscillations among polyaromatics might be signs of life we could test in Bennu samples.”

Meanwhile, Hameroff is working to demonstrate that anesthesia works to block consciousness by blocking electrical signals between molecules in the microtubules. That might be all it takes to interrupt consciousness. 

If found, Lauretta says a test using anesthesia gases might block the oscillations, just as in human brains. “We could claim some justification for consciousness being present and causal at life's origins.”

Metrics details

Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have shot to prominence as efficient energy-conversion materials that can be processed using cost-effective fabrication methods. A reason for their exceptional performance is their crystallographic defect tolerance, enabling long charge-carrier lifetimes despite high defect densities. Achieving defect tolerance in broader classes of materials would impact on the semiconductor industry substantially. Considerable efforts have been made to understand the origins of defect tolerance, so as to design stable and nontoxic alternatives to LHPs. However, understanding defect tolerance in LHPs is far from straightforward. This Review discusses the models proposed for defect tolerance in halide perovskites, evaluating the experimental and theoretical support for these models, as well as their limitations. We also cover attempts to apply these models to identify materials beyond LHPs that could exhibit defect tolerance. Finally, we discuss the experimental methods used to understand defects in mixed ionic–electronic conductors, as well as the important information that is necessary for a deeper understanding, in order to develop improved models that enable the design of defect-tolerant semiconductors.

Metrics details

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2) testing has been a cornerstone of patient selection for HER2-targeted therapies, principally in breast cancer but also in several other solid tumours. Since the introduction of HercepTest as the original companion diagnostic for trastuzumab, HER2 assessment methods have evolved substantially, incorporating various testing modalities, from western blots, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, to early chromogenic quantitative methods and, probably in the future, fully quantitative methods. The advent of highly effective HER2-targeted antibody–drug conjugates with clinical activity at low levels of HER2 expression, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, has necessitated the re-evaluation of HER2 testing, particularly for HER2-low tumours. In this Review, we provide an in-depth overview of the evolution of HER2 testing, the current clinical guidelines for HER2 testing across various solid tumours, challenges associated with current testing methodologies and the emerging potential of quantitative techniques. We discuss the importance of accurately defining HER2-low expression for therapeutic decision-making and how newer diagnostic approaches, such as quantitative immunofluorescence and RNA-based assays, might address the limitations of traditional immunohistochemistry-based methods. As the use of HER2-targeted therapies continues to expand to a wider range of tumour types, ensuring the precision and accuracy of HER2 testing will be crucial for guiding treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.

The advent of new antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) capable of targeting breast cancers and other solid tumours with much lower levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression has created a need to rethink the current approach to companion diagnostics owing to the insufficient sensitivity of current assays.

Accurate and precise identification of HER2-low cancers is crucial for drug selection in light of the emerging landscape of novel ADCs.

New approaches, such as quantitative immunofluorescence and RNA-based assays, have the potential to provide more accurate and precise assessments of HER2 expression, especially in the range of HER2 expression typically seen in non-malignant breast ducts.

Better assessment criteria are needed for HER2 testing in solid tumour types beyond breast cancer given that expression patterns and response to therapy vary by cancer type.

We believe that the future of HER2 testing lies in standardized, quantitative assays, which will be essential for personalized treatment, particularly with multiple ADCs targeting different tumour types.

Long COVID advocates attend a budget hearing in the US Senate.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty

Long COVID advocates and researchers in the United States have done the extraordinary. After a bruising battle, they managed to revive some of the research grants cancelled by the administration of President Donald Trump ― a rare victory for science as Trump's team slashes funding and fires federal scientific staff.

The crisis began in late March, when the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) terminated the funding for dozens of long-COVID projects. Activists and researchers – including many with long COVID — began a dogged advocacy campaign, including an eleventh-hour effort to sway a sympathetic member of Congress to intervene, according to an employee of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the NIH. (The employee requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.) Within days, the cuts had been reversed.

But the administration's termination of an array of infectious-diseases research suggests a rocky path ahead for long-COVID research. Now activists and scientists are both anxious and hopeful as they brace themselves for the potential of future cuts to federal support.

“The long COVID patient community is reeling and flabbergasted by what they're seeing,” says Emily Taylor, president of the Solve ME/CFS Initiative and based in Glendale, California. “We've been telling congresspeople, ‘Stop cutting, first thing. Stop hurting us. Stop the pain.'”

The HHS, which includes the NIH and other health agencies, did not respond to a request for comment.

Over the past two months, US President Donald Trump's new administration has cancelled or delayed thousands of biomedical research grants, including those for research on COVID-19.

When asked about the COVID-19 cuts, a spokesperson for HHS told Nature on 26 March, “HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”

That response appalled some long COVID advocates and researchers. “It's totally shocking and really incorrect,” says Serena Spudich, an infectious disease neuroscientist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “The aftermath of the COVID pandemic is absolutely affecting millions of people, the economy, people's ability to work and attend school.” A 2024 study estimated that 11 million people in the United States currently have long COVID, and that the condition costs the country more than $152.6 billion in lost work hours each year.

HHS is run by longtime anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who said during his confirmation hearing on 29 January that he'd commit to funding long COVID research. That gave Ian Simon, who was at the time the director of HHS's Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, a “glimmer of hope”, he says, because it seemed “a full-throated endorsement of serious government action.” But the grant cancellations “make me question what a full-throated endorsement in front of Congress means these days”.

Long COVID still has no cure — so these patients are turning to research

Long COVID still has no cure — so these patients are turning to research

Under Kennedy, the HHS shuttered its long COVID office and laid off Simon and another employee in the office. An executive order signed by Trump dismantled the only federal advisory committee on long COVID, and the US Department of Labor stripped mention of long COVID from its websites.

The NIH cut not only research on long COVID but also other work that could affect people with the condition. For example, the NIH has terminated several disability studies, says David Putrino, a physical therapist and neuroscientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Many people with severe long COVID live with disabilities.

Despite this, some advocates had hoped that a US$1.8 billion NIH long COVID research initiative, called RECOVER, might be safe because Congress had funded the programme directly in 2020.

Then, in late March, the NIH cancelled a wave of RECOVER grants. “We were completely shocked,” says Megan Fitzgerald, a neuroscientist in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who has long COVID and works with the advocacy group Patient-Led Research Collaborative. “And that's when we started mobilizing.”

Fitzgerald's detective work revealed dozens of cancelled projects, most of them studies of either the biology underlying long COVID, or of long COVID in children. The loss of the paediatric studies would have been particularly painful, says Fitzgerald, because the study of long COVID in children has lagged research in adults.

The biology studies included a project on dysautonomia, a condition sometimes seen in people with long COVID that affects the body's ability to control heart rate and blood pressure. Another terminated project aimed to characterize antibodies made against the body's own proteins. Such “autoantibodies” are thought to contribute to some cases of long COVID and could become targets for medicines to treat the condition.

Clarification 08 April 2025: This story has been amended to clarify that many activists who worked to undo cuts to long COVID research themselves have the condition.

NOAA Halts Upkeep of Critical Weather Satellites

The decision by the Trump administration to defer maintenance of the Joint Polar Satellite System threatens to degrade the accuracy of weather forecasts

By Scott Waldman & E&E News 

Unlike geostationary satellites, polar-orbiting satellites capture swaths of data throughout the full globe, and observe the entire planet twice each day. This global mosaic, captured by the VIIRS instrument on the NOAA-21 satellite, is a composite image created from these swaths over a period of 24 hours between Dec. 5 and Dec. 6, 2022.

CLIMATEWIRE | NOAA has begun to limit the work it devotes to maintaining a pair of polar weather satellites — putting at risk the accuracy of both weather forecasts and extreme storm predictions, say former agency officials.

The move, outlined in a memo obtained exclusively by POLITICO's E&E News, calls on the agency to take a “minimum mission operations approach” to the two probes. The satellites are part of the Joint Polar Satellite System, which serves as the backbone of three- and seven-day forecasts and early warnings for hurricanes and tornadoes.

The order means NOAA won't do much to upkeep the satellites, which orbit the Earth's poles 14 times a day. The March 28 memo calls for the deferral of discretionary activities including “modernization product maturation, flight software updates, decommissioning planning, ground system sustainment deployment(s), special calibrations, etc.”

The reason for the move is because of anticipated “reduced flight engineering support,” according to the memo. The decision to defer the satellites' maintenance comes as the Trump administration slashes NOAA's contracts with outside vendors and looks to cut its workforce in half.

Former NOAA officials warn the move is a short-sighted decision with potential long-term consequences. Deferring software updates and other maintenance work may save some money right now, but the approach increases the risk of failure and could drive up costs in the long-term, said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator in the Biden administration.

“As soon as you start having system glitches — and in the satellite world, system glitches are the name of the game — they're going to fail to collect the data they need,” Spinrad said.

The stakes for failure are high.

JPSS “provides the majority of data that informs numerical weather forecasting in the U.S. and delivers critical observations during severe weather events like hurricanes and blizzards,” according to NOAA.

In a worst-case scenario, a failure could blind the country to a severe storm, potentially for days if the system has a significant issue, Spinrad said.

It's unclear how much money the move will save. The section of the NOAA memo related to cost savings was left blank, and NOAA officials did not respond to a request for comment.

The total cost of the JPSS program was estimated at more than $13 billion, according to NOAA.

As it stands, the JPSS program is only partially complete. The oldest polar-orbiting satellite in the JPSS constellation is the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, which monitors long-term climate trends and biodiversity. That satellite was launched in 2011 and is nearing the end of its lifespan.

Two additional JPSS satellites are set to join the three in space right now, with the next one scheduled to launch no earlier than 2027. The federal government, during the Biden administration, signed a roughly $100 million contract for that launch with SpaceX, the rocket company run by billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of President Donald Trump.

Since Trump took office, Musk has led an aggressive campaign to slash both government spending and the size of the federal workforce, including at NOAA.

A fifth satellite is also in development and scheduled to launch in 2032. No one in the Trump administration has yet raised the possibility of canceling one or both future launches.

The new plan means NOAA and NASA will be less prepared to handle major issues that arise in the functioning of the satellites, according to Spinrad. Regular maintenance allows for problems to be addressed before they become serious. If something more serious were to occur, and the other satellites were also experiencing issues, the essential stream of weather monitoring data could be compromised for days, according to Spinrad.

Spinrad likened it to driving around in a car that could be disabled at any point while placing confidence on a second backup car parked in a garage with a dead battery or oil leak that no one has checked in years. The likelihood of a series of cascading failures notably increases without regular maintenance, he said.

Data from the satellites — which are about as big as a pickup truck and powered by solar arrays — is shared with other governments, who pass along their data to the United States, Spinrad said. It's part of a collaborative global system of weather monitoring.

For example, if a U.S. satellite collects data at one time of day, a European satellite might collect it later in the day. Collectively, they offer a comprehensive overview of global conditions that offer insights on incoming weather.

Losing a data stream — through the loss of a satellite, for instance — can erode the overall accuracy of this collaboration.

That's a real risk, Spinrad said, because satellites need constant maintenance. Their orbits need to be monitored and occasionally repositioned, the sensors need to be checked to ensure they are working properly and data transmission has to be evaluated as well.

That long checklist is part of the reason former NOAA officials are arguing against the anti-upkeep order.

The cuts to the maintenance of the satellites is similar to last week's proposed termination of a cloud usage contract for dozens of NOAA websites centered on climate change, extreme weather research and drought monitoring information. That termination would have destroyed a significant amount of research that would have been unrecoverable if the web pages were knocked offline. After news of the contract cuts became public, NOAA political appointees backed off the plan.

Andrew Rosenberg, who served as a senior official at NOAA during the Clinton administration, said the latest memo shows the NOAA cuts are being driven by officials who don't understand the cost and consequence of what they are eliminating.

“Are you really saying that maintenance of high tech, extremely expensive equipment that provides vital information is waste, fraud or abuse?” he asked.

The move to defer the NOAA satellites' upkeep is happening as three NASA satellites that provide essential climate and atmospheric data near the end of their life.

These probes could be offline within the year, and there are no plans to replace some of their specialized instruments, which provide information on long-term changes to the Earth's ozone layer, planet-warming solar radiation and other key climate information.

One instrument for which there is no replacement plan is the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, which tracks forests, clouds, glaciers and oceans.

Scientists are hoping the NOAA satellites make up for that loss.

Metrics details

The rheology of the lower crust and upper mantle influences Earth's plate tectonic style of mantle convection, yet its spatial variability is poorly resolved, particularly in continental interiors. Here we use satellite radar interferometry to map the delayed uplift resulting from the desiccation of the Aral Sea, which has lost ~1,000 km3 of water since 1960. From this we constrain the rheology of the underlying upper mantle by elastic and viscoelastic modelling. We find a long-wavelength uplift of up to ~7 mm yr–1 between 2016 and 2020 that decays radially from the Aral Sea. This uplift pattern is best explained by viscoelastic relaxation of the asthenosphere below a strong lithospheric mantle. We estimate that the asthenosphere has an effective viscosity of 4–7 × 1019 Pa s below 130–190 km depth, slightly larger than the values inferred from post-seismic deformation at subduction zones, but 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than estimates from glacial isostatic adjustment in other tectonically stable regions. Such uplift highlights the potential for human activities to influence deep-Earth dynamics and the interconnectedness of surface and mantle processes.

Metrics details

Environmental thermal stress substantially affects cellular plasticity of thermogenic adipocytes and energy balance through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms in rodents. However, roles of cold-adaptive epigenetic regulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in systemic energy metabolism in humans remained poorly understood. Here we report that individuals whose mothers conceived during cold seasons exhibit higher BAT activity, adaptive thermogenesis, increased daily total energy expenditure and lower body mass index and visceral fat accumulation. Structural equation modelling indicated that conception during the cold season protects against age-associated increase in body mass index through BAT activation in offspring. Meteorological analysis revealed that lower outdoor temperatures and greater fluctuations in daily temperatures during the fertilization period are key determinants of BAT activity. These findings suggest that BAT metabolic fate and susceptibility of metabolic diseases are preprogrammed by the epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure before the fertilization in humans.

Obesity is the major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular diseases, increasing all-cause mortality1,2. While exercise habits and eating behaviours are important for energy homeostasis, environmental stimuli also influence the risk of obesity due to dynamic fluctuations in energy expenditure (EE)3. Cold exposure is a well-established environmental determinant of whole-body EE, triggering adaptive thermogenesis through the activation of metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue (BAT)3,4. Individual differences in BAT activity are associated with age-related increases in body mass index (BMI), visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risks5,6,7,8. Despite the potential of BAT as a therapeutic target, underlying factors contributing to individual differences in BAT activity remain poorly understood, particularly in humans.

Environmental regulation of adipose tissue thermogenesis differs between acute and chronic activation. In small rodents, acute cold exposure (for a few minutes) evokes immediate heat production in BAT through activation of the sympathetic nervous system and β-adrenergic signalling pathways9. Conversely, prolonged cold exposure (several weeks) induces de novo brown adipocyte differentiation and the appearance of beige adipocytes, which require chromatin conformation changes and histone modifications orchestrated by epigenetic regulators such as JMJD1A, limiting metabolic disorders10,11. Consistently, in humans, acute cold exposure for a few hours elicits BAT thermogenesis and substrate utilization, which correlate with sympathetic innervation12,13,14,15,16. Moreover, repeated cold exposure or chronic administration of an adrenergic receptor agonist for several weeks increases BAT activity and mass, ultimately improving adiposity and insulin sensitivity12,17,18. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that BAT in the supraclavicular depots of human adults resembles mouse beige adipocytes; in addition, expression of the epigenetic regulator JMJD1A in adipose tissue negatively correlates with BMI19,20,21. These consistent findings across species suggest that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the recruitment of BAT in humans as it does in mice22,23.

Genetic inheritance of risk alleles in thermogenic genes can also influence BAT activity as evidenced by the accelerated age-related decline in BAT and visceral fat accumulation in human adults with single nucleotide polymorphisms on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and β3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3)24. Compelling evidence also suggests that epigenetic predisposition induced by specific nutritional and environmental stresses such as temperature during gestation and lactation can be inherited across generations, resulting in various physiological alterations in experimental animals25,26,27,28.

Building on these findings, we hypothesized that meteorological exposures experienced by parents before and during gestation influence BAT metabolic fate and regulate energy homeostasis in human offspring. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study in mice, demonstrating that preconception cold exposure, particularly within the paternal lineage, enhances adipose tissue thermogenesis in offspring through mechanisms possibly involving DNA methylation in sperm28. We present evidence that BAT metabolic activity, as well as adaptive EE, are elevated in healthy human individuals conceived during a cold season compared with those conceived during a warm season. Moreover, we performed a spatiotemporal meteorological analysis and identified a lower ambient temperature and larger diurnal temperature variation in the period before conception as critical determinants of BAT activity. Additionally, BAT activation resulting from preconception cold exposure was associated with a reduced BMI and waist circumference independent of age, sex and the season of birth. These findings provide comprehensive evidence suggesting that thermal stress experienced just before conception plays an intergenerational role in facilitating the activation and sustenance of BAT and modulating systemic energy homeostasis in humans.

To investigate the lifelong effects of early-life environmental exposure on BAT function, we examined the association of cold-induced BAT activity with the seasons of fertilization or birth in 356 healthy young male volunteers (Cohort 1; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The presence of detectable BAT and its quantitative metabolic activity were assessed with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) following cold exposure at 19 °C for 2 h (Fig. 1b)5,8,12,14. Based on the participant's day of birth, the seasons of birth and fertilization were categorized as either warm season (16 April through 16 October) or cold season (the remainder) (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Note that the seasonality of meteorological factors is distinct and rather coherent regardless of the latitude in the main islands of Japan, and the participant's place of birth distributed throughout Japan (Extended Data Fig. 1b,d). The prevalence of detectable BAT (high BAT) was indistinguishable between participants born in the cold season (cold birth group, 71.8%) and those born in the warm season (warm birth group, 73.8%, P = 0.381; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, BAT prevalence was significantly higher in those conceived in the cold season (cold fertilization group, 78.2%) than in those conceived in the warm season (warm fertilization group, 66.0%, P = 0.007; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Similarly, quantitative BAT activity was notably higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (P = 0.017; Fig. 1e), whereas BAT activity was not associated with the season of birth (P = 0.144). The association between the fertilization season and BAT activity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.949, P = 0.007) was irrespective of age, BMI and the season of birth (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The effect of fertilization season is not specific to the supraclavicular BAT because fertilization in cold period was associated with increased number of active BAT depots, including thoracic, cervical, axillary, mediastinal and perirenal regions (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). These suggest an intergenerational activation of BAT by preconception perceived environmental stress in young healthy men. These findings are not dependent on our method to define the seasons because the difference between our unbiased definition and another definition based on the median of outdoor temperature was only 2.7% of the year (10 days), having a negligible impact on the results.

a, Study protocol for investigating intergenerational control of BAT in humans. BAT activity and density were assessed by 18F-FDG-PET/CT following acute cold exposure and NIR-TRS, respectively. The day of fertilization was estimated based on the day of birth.

Source data

To address whether BAT activation by preconception environmental stress extends to the general population, we recruited 286 independent healthy male and female volunteers aged 20–78 years (Cohort 2). In this cohort, BAT density (BAT-d) was estimated noninvasively by measuring the total haemoglobin concentration ([total Hb]) in the supraclavicular region using near-infra-red time-resolved spectroscopy (NIR-TRS) (Fig. 1a). BAT-d measured by NIR-TRS exhibits a strong correlation with cold-induced FDG uptake by PET/CT, making it a reliable alternative index of BAT functionality29,30. We categorized the participants into high and low BAT-d groups based on the median of BAT-d (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Consistent with findings from Cohort 1, the season of birth did not affect the percentage of high BAT-d (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c) or quantitative BAT-d (Fig. 1i). In contrast, the percentage of high BAT-d was significantly greater in the cold fertilization group (56.4%) than in the warm fertilization group (44.4%, P = 0.029; Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3b,d). Additionally, we found a significant increase in BAT-d ([total Hb] at the supraclavicular BAT deposits), in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm fertilization group (P = 0.020; Fig. 1i). This increase in [total Hb] was specific to the supraclavicular BAT region and was not due to a general increase in blood flow because [total Hb] in other regions such as the abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue and the deltoid skeletal muscle remained consistent regardless of the season of birth or fertilization (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). A disaggregated analysis for sex revealed an enhanced BAT-d in the cold fertilization group in male and female participants (Extended Data Fig. 3g). These results were consistent with those in Cohort 1 and support the idea that the metabolic fate of BAT in adulthood is predetermined by parental exposure to meteorological environments during the period around fertilization in healthy humans.

It is widely recognized that cold-activated BAT has a crucial role in EE, especially in nonshivering cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT), which fluctuates seasonally in accordance with the recruitment of BAT31. We hypothesized that the intergenerational activation of BAT might influence CIT in a season-dependent manner. To test this, we analysed the resting EE at 27 °C and after 2-h cold exposure at 19 °C measured by indirect calorimetry in 42 young healthy males who underwent FDG-PET/CT31 (Cohort 3; Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). This test was conducted during both the summer (July to September) and winter (December to March) in a randomized crossover design. As expected, no notable difference in BAT activity was observed between the warm and cold birth seasons (Extended Data Fig. 4d, left). Whole-body EE adjusted for fat-free mass (FFM) at 27 °C and 19 °C and CIT were comparable between the warm and cold birth groups regardless of season of the measurements (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f).

Left, resting EE adjusted for FFM at thermoneutral condition (27 °C) and after 2-h cold exposure (19 °C). Right, CIT. b, Whole-body resting EE and CIT of the warm (n = 14) and cold fertilization groups (n = 28) (Cohort 3) measured in winter.

CIT (right). c, Postprandial changes in resting EE adjusted for FFM (left) and DIT calculated as incremental area under the curve (iAUC, right) for the warm (n = 10) and cold birth groups (n = 13) (Cohort 4). d, Postprandial changes in resting EE adjusted for FFM (left) and DIT calculated as iAUC (right) for the warm (n = 6) and cold fertilization groups (n = 17) (Cohort 4).

Source data

Conversely, BAT activity was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Extended Data Fig. 4d, right), consistent with findings observed in Cohorts 1 and 2. While there was no group difference in EE at 27 °C, the response of the adjusted EE to cold exposure seemed to be increased in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm fertilization group in the winter (Fig. 2b, left), but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Indeed, CIT was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group specifically in the winter (Fig. 2b, right) but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Given that neither shivering, as assessed by electromyography nor FDG uptake into the skeletal muscle is induced in our mild cold exposure protocol14,32, the observed increase in CIT is likely due to BAT activation. This aligns with the observation that BAT activity was positively correlated with CIT in the winter, but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4i), FFM did not associate with CIT regardless of the season (Extended Data Fig. 4j). These findings suggest that BAT activation due to fertilization in the cold season enhances cold-induced BAT thermogenesis and contributes to seasonal cold adaptation in humans.

We next examined the effects of the fertilization season on diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), another component of BAT-associated adaptive thermogenesis33,34,35. In this study, whole-body EE was measured in 23 healthy adult males (Cohort 4; Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) by indirect calorimetry over a period of 2 h following the ingestion of a meal (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d)35. All DIT measurements were carried out in the winter months (December through March). We ensured that age and anthropometric parameters were comparable between the warm and cold birth groups and between the warm and cold fertilization groups. Postprandial thermogenesis and DIT, calculated as the incremental area under the curve, did not differ significantly between the warm and cold birth groups (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5e). Increased BAT activity was observed in the cold fertilization group of Cohort 4 compared with the warm fertilization group (Extended Data Fig. 5b, right), as observed in Cohorts 1 and 3. It is noteworthy that postprandial thermogenesis and DIT were significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5f).

Finally, we asked whether fertilization in the cold season is sufficient to enhance total energy expenditure (TEE) under the free-living conditions in Cohort 5 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To this end, we measured TEE using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method and physical activity levels using a validated triaxial accelerometer36,37. The DLW method is an accurate way of determining metabolic rate with the advantage that the participants need not be confined, allowing us to investigate TEE in free-living conditions. TEE assessed using DLW was associated with age, anthropometric parameters, physical activity levels and step count per day (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that FFM and steps per day were significant predicting factors of TEE (model 1, R2 value = 0.794; Extended Data Fig. 6c). Of note, FFM- and step-independent TEE as residuals in model 1 was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group, whereas it was indistinguishable between the warm and cold birth groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Thus, adjusted TEE for FFM and steps was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 3b). A similar increase in adjusted TEE was found in a disaggregated analysis for sex (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the TEE-increasing effect of fertilization season was independent of body size- and physical activity-related parameters, including FFM and step count (Fig. 3c). Together, we demonstrate a critical role of the season of fertilization in adaptive CIT, DIT and TEE, suggesting that the pre-fertilization-origin activation of BAT is sufficient to modulate whole-body EE.

The above observations led us to hypothesize that fertilization in the cold season may reduce the risk of obesity and metabolic diseases in offspring by protecting against an age-related decline in BAT. Clinical cross-sectional studies demonstrated that BAT activity is inversely correlated with adiposity and blood glucose, preventing age-related obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases7,8. In Cohort 1, the inverse association between BAT activity and BMI was relatively weak (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7a), likely due to the younger age and lower adiposity levels among participants6,38. Conversely, more pronounced effects of BAT-d on obesity-related traits such as BMI, body fat content, visceral fat area and waist circumference were observed in Cohort 2, which included a wider range of ages and adiposity levels (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Next, we investigated whether the fertilization season is associated with adiposity. In Cohort 1, with a limited-range of ages and adiposity, BMI and related parameters did not exhibit a direct correlation with either the birth season or the fertilization season (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Figs. 1c and 8a). In Cohort 2, however, we detected modest yet significant associations of the cold fertilization season with decreased BMI, visceral fat area and waist circumference (Fig. 4b). Similarly, BMI, body fat content, visceral fat area and waist circumference were significantly lower in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 4c). Conversely, the season of birth had a negligible effect on adiposity in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Fig. 4a,b). Additionally, parameters such as skeletal muscle mass and cardiovascular function, including blood pressure and heart rate, remained unaffected by either the birth or fertilization season (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c).

To examine more deeply the intricate relationship between fertilization season, BAT and adiposity, we performed structural equation modelling based on the structural model hypothesized39. This analysis revealed that the fertilization season (coded as warm, 0 and cold, 1) positively correlated with BAT activity (Cohort 1: β = 0.145, P = 0.005, Fig. 4d; Cohort 2: β = 0.132, P = 0.022, Fig. 4e), which in turn negatively correlated with BMI (Cohort 1: β = −0.175, P < 0.001; Cohort 2: β = −0.547, P < 0.001). The direct association between the fertilization season and BMI, however, was not statistically significant (Cohort 1: β = −0.022, P = 0.671; Cohort 2: β = −0.041, P = 0.365). Based on these findings, we concluded that a decrease in BMI associated with the cold fertilization season is due to increased BAT activity.

Meteorological parameters, including temperature, vary seasonally, as depicted in Extended Data Fig. 9, and some of these parameters, along with temperature, can modulate BAT activity40,41. For example, studies in rodents demonstrated that photoperiod regulates BAT thermogenesis via the sympathetic nervous system or μ-opioid receptor signalling42,43. To pinpoint the environmental factor responsible for the intergenerational BAT activation, we performed an unbiased spatiotemporal meteorological analysis. This analysis involved examining associations between the participant's BAT activity and environmental parameters before, during, and after pregnancy periods within their specific region of residence (Fig. 5a).

a, Schematic of the study design for the meteorological survey and the definition of pregnancy periods. The pregnancy period was divided into five periods: preconception (−12 to −9 months), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), second trimester (−6 to −3 months), third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and postpartum (0 to 3 months). b, Schematic showing the extraction of meteorological data for pregnancy periods from Japan created by the JMA, the NARO and the NAOJ.

Variables included BAT activity (binary: 1 or 0), age and BMI: (the tertile values: 1, 2 or 3), low birth weight (yes, 1 and no, 0), smoking status (never, former, current: 1, 2, 3) and shift work (never, former, current: 1, 2, 3). d, Independent effects of diurnal temperature variation on BAT activity in c (model 2).

Source data

A total of 93 participants in Cohort 1 completed a questionnaire regarding their regions of birth and conception, their lifestyles and meteorological questionnaire survey. We collected meteorological parameters, including outdoor temperature, humidity, precipitation, sunshine duration, daytime length and atmospheric pressure, at the region residence during five pregnancy periods: before conception (−12 to −9 months from the birth), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), the second trimester (−6 to −3 months), the third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and after delivery (0 to 3 months) (Fig. 5a,b). A multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, BMI, smoking status and shift work status (referred to as model 1) revealed that the daily mean outdoor temperature before fertilization correlated inversely with BAT activity (adjusted OR = 0.335, 95% CI 0.138−0.809, P = 0.015; Fig. 5c), while humidity, precipitation, sunshine duration and daytime length showed no significant association with BAT activity. Additionally, we discovered a positive association between BAT activity and daily maximum temperature (adjusted OR = 3.033, 95% CI 1.27−7.25, P = 0.013), which contradicted the negative association with the daily mean temperature. We hypothesize that diurnal temperature variation might serve as a latent environmental stimulus for activating BAT in the offspring. To test this, we calculated the diurnal range of temperature and incorporated it into model 1 as an independent variable (referred to as model 2). Notably, this parameter emerged as the most significant determining factor of BAT activity (adjusted OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.028−2.519, P = 0.037; Fig. 5d). A similar association was found when diurnal temperature gap between daily maximum and mean temperature was incorporated in to the multivariate regression model (model 3; Extended Data Fig. 10a). These results suggest exposure to a lower outdoor temperature and larger diurnal temperature variation before conception preserves BAT activity of the offspring in adulthood.

Furthermore, the multivariate regression model revealed no association of BAT activity with outdoor temperature or its diurnal variation in the first, second and third trimesters (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 10a), suggesting a negligible effect of maternal thermal stress during gestation, consistent with earlier studies in mice28,43. We also observed an inverse association between the daily mean outdoor temperature and diurnal temperature fluctuation after delivery and BAT activity (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). We then tested the potential synergistic effect of thermal stress before conception and after delivery on BAT. To this end, we categorized the participants into four groups: (1) those with warm birth and warm fertilization seasons, (2) those with warm birth and cold fertilization seasons, (3) those with cold birth and warm fertilization seasons, and (4) those with cold birth and cold fertilization seasons (Fig. 5e). Increases in the BAT prevalence and activity by the cold fertilization season were clearly confirmed in the cold birth group whereas they were only marginal in the warm birth group (Fig. 5f,g). It is possible that cold exposure after delivery enhances the BAT-activating effect of preconception cold exposure although this requires further investigation. However, thermal exposure before conception is likely the primary stimulus because a clear linear-by-linear association between diurnal temperature gap and BAT prevalence was detected specifically in a period before conception (Extended Data Fig. 10b).

In summary, the spatiotemporal meteorological analysis revealed that a low outdoor temperature and a large diurnal temperature variation just before conception preserves BAT activity and energy homeostasis in human offspring (Fig. 6).

Preconception exposure to low outdoor temperature and temperature gap affects offspring's metabolic phenotype, promoting higher EE in humans. Our findings propose a conceptional theory, named PfOHaD. This concept suggests that environmental factors, such as temperature exposure before conception, can programme physiological traits in offspring, potentially influencing their health outcomes across generations.

Our study demonstrated that the season of fertilization significantly influences BAT development and metabolic health in adulthood. Utilizing healthy volunteers and employing three distinct methods (FDG-PET/CT, NIR-TRS and DLW), we observed a potential link between EE and the season of fertilization, which may be mediated by BAT activity. These findings extend the work by Sun et al.28, who reported that individuals conceived during colder months were 3.2% more likely to possess active BAT, whereas those conceived in warmer months were more likely to lack active BAT. They suggested that the season of conception is linked to BAT development in humans, proposing an intergenerational activation of BAT through paternal lineage, potentially involving sperm DNA methylation as demonstrated in mouse models. Incorporating meteorological analyses, we found that not only outdoor temperature but also diurnal temperature variations impact BAT activity, with effects observed based on the season of fertilization rather than birth season. These findings support and expand the theory of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) to encompass the concept of Pre-fertilization Origins of Health and Disease (PfOHaD), as discussed in later sections.

A major strength of our study is the thorough assessment of BAT using the gold-standard method and a large sample size of healthy participants. Prospective studies demonstrated that BAT remains metabolically inactive in warm conditions regardless of its maximal thermogenic capacity5,32,44,45. Moreover, BAT activity varies seasonally depending on age, sex and adiposity5,8,40,46. These factors impose a major limitation on retrospective assessment of BAT using clinical scans. In the present study, we ensured a sensitive evaluation of BAT functionality with season-matched FDG-PET/CT and acute nonshivering cold exposure. This analysis included over 350 young, lean male participants to minimize potential fluctuations in BAT activity. While FDG-PET may underestimate BAT activity in conditions such as insulin resistance47, our all participants of Cohort 1 were healthy individuals. Our well-designed approach and the largest sample size in this field, allow us to certify the intergenerational influence of cold stress on BAT activity in humans.

Of note, we validated the fertilization season-specific activation of BAT in an independent population of Cohort 2 with no discernible effect of the birth season. Despite a wide range of ages and adiposity in Cohort 2 and including both males and females, multivariate regression revealed that BAT activation by the cold fertilization season is independent of age, sex and adiposity. Moreover, the difference in the BAT prevalence between the warm and cold fertilization groups was 11.9% for Cohort 2, consistent with Cohort 1 (14.6%). Notably, these differences were four-times higher than those reported in the previous retrospective analysis of oncology scans (3.2%)28. Our results demonstrate the extent to which preconception seasonal acclimatization enhances BAT activity in offspring.

Previous studies demonstrated BAT's role in nonshivering adaptive thermogenesis (CIT and DIT)12,34,35,48. Our study is the first to show that preconception environmental exposure enhances whole-body EE and adaptive thermogenesis due to a significant increase in BAT activity. CIT for the cold fertilization group was 1.5-times higher than the warm group. In contrast, resting EE at 27 °C was unaffected by the fertilization season, as BAT remains inactive in thermoneutral conditions. The impact of the fertilization season on CIT was negligible in the summer, when BAT activity is low31. These results suggest that preconception cold exposure is sufficient to increase adaptive thermogenesis and whole-body EE. Notably, TEE under free-living conditions increased by ~5.8% in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm group, indicating that intergenerational inheritance of cold adaptation enhances whole-body EE in humans. Future study employing 15O-O2 and 11C-acetate PET/CT is required for validating the contribution of BAT to intergenerational control of whole-body EE.

Fertilization during the cold season was linked to a lower BMI in Cohort 2, which encompassed a wider range of age and adiposity levels. Structural equation model suggested that the BMI-decreasing effect is mediated by BAT activation. Given the absence of a significant impact of the fertilization season on BMI in young lean individuals (Cohort 1), we propose that the beneficial metabolic effect of preconception cold exposure is greater in middle-aged and older populations. Consistent with this notion, a cross-sectional study involving over 4,500 middle-aged males reported that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high in those born in the spring (with an estimated summer fertilization season) compared with those born in the fall (with an estimated winter fertilization season)49. Similar trends were reported by a large cohort study that included male and female participants50,51. The current study highlights the need of investigating the hypothesis that global warming may be contributing to disruptions in energy homeostasis and the ongoing obesity pandemic. Together, our present findings suggest a crucial role of intergenerational regulation of BAT in the systemic energy homeostasis, reducing the propensity for age-associated metabolic diseases. Our findings align with earlier studies reporting protective roles of BAT against insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases7,38,40.

The mechanisms of intergenerational activation of human BAT have remained unclear because the key meteorological factors remained undetermined. Our unique spatiotemporal meteorological analysis, however, identified the daily mean outdoor temperature before conception as a significant determinant of BAT metabolic fate in adult offspring. This finding is compatible with findings in mice28. Other parameters, such as daytime length, sunshine duration, humidity and precipitation, before conception were not associated with BAT activity. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that diurnal temperature variations serve as a novel meteorological factor that mediates BAT activation. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may be involved in this temperature gap-induced activation. For example, the cold pressor test (cold water immersion of the limbs) increases SNS activity in humans without altering core body temperature52. Further investigations are needed to confirm whether the SNS plays a role in passing on BAT activity to the next generation in humans.

Potential factors that may influence the intergenerational activation of BAT include individual differences in dietary and behavioural pattern, genetic variants, and other unmeasurable variables such as living indoor temperature and gut microbiota composition24,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60. The use of pharmacological agents such as adrenomimetics may also confound the association of preconception thermal stress with BAT44,61,62,63. We note, however, that all our participants were healthy individuals who did not regularly take medications, and neither smoking history nor shift work status influenced the BAT activation.

A notable limitation of our study is the use of a fixed cold exposure at 19 °C to assess BAT activity with FDG-PET/CT. We cannot rule out the possibility that our fixed cold exposure might be insufficient for some participants with low cold perception, resulting in low BAT activity. An alternative approach would be FDG-PET/CT with personalized cold exposure protocol64. The use of only FDG as a radiotracer is also a limitation because FDG uptake does not directly reflect total heat production in BAT and its anatomical presence47, although it is proportional to nonshivering CIT. However, fixed protocols like ours have been recognized as suitable for evaluating BAT's thermogenic responsiveness to a certain stimulus, which is one of the most physiologically important readouts64,65. Nevertheless, our findings need to be validated by future studies employing PET/CT with various tracers in combination with personalized cold protocols13,61,64,65. Moreover, our correlational results do not exclude possibility that other tissues, including skeletal muscle66,67, contribute to the intergenerational cold adaptation and metabolic improvement. Additional investigations are required to establish BAT as a causative driver of metabolic improvements due to pre-fertilization cold exposure. Another limitation of this study is its geographically focus on Japan. Future studies should test the effects of different geographic regions of living and races of individuals on the intergenerational activation of BAT. In addition, our meteorological approach faces challenges in determining whether the intergenerational regulation of BAT originates from the paternal lineage, as reported in mice28. In this regard, two independent study groups reported that maternal cold exposure does not activate BAT in mice28,43. We also emphasize that no meteorological parameter during the first, second and third trimesters correlated with BAT activity, suggesting minimal effects of maternal lineage during gestation. Although it may not be feasible to experimentally validate whether it is paternal lineage in humans, alternative approaches may involve investigations of cold-induced epigenetic changes in human sperm68,69, as discussed in the below paragraph. It seems likely that the intergenerational control of BAT by preconception cold exposure is linked to the paternal lineage.

In future studies, it would be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure and to examine the effect of cold exposure on sperm, ovum, fertilized eggs and embryos in humans. Earlier studies in small rodents suggested that certain molecular mechanisms in sperm govern the intergenerational inheritance of paternal metabolic stress68,69. First, a previous DNA pyrosequencing study revealed that paternal preconception cold exposure induces alterations of DNA methylation in mouse sperm28. The specific genes or sites targeted by cold-induced DNA methylation, as well as their causal link to the BAT activation remain undetermined. Second, although sperm chromatin undergoes massive epigenetic reprogramming through histone–protamine exchange, minimal histones (~1% in mice and ~10% in humans) are retained in mature sperm70. The retained histones carry epigenetic marks, for example methylation, which are transferred to the embryo and play a role in intergenerational physiological adaptation71,72,73. Third, transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNA) have the potential to be transmitted to the zygote and are proposed as a molecule responsible for germline epigenetic transmission27,74,75,76. Future studies should investigate the roles of these mechanisms in the intergenerational inheritance of cold exposure.

Together, these findings provide evidence of a discernible impact of preconception cold exposure on BAT metabolic fate, adaptive thermogenesis and systemic energy homeostasis in human offspring. Our findings indicate a perspective beyond the DOHaD theory, which acknowledges that environmental stress, for example poor nutritional conditions, during pregnancy or lactation triggers predictive adaptation during embryonic and postnatal development via the maternal lineage77. Because the intergenerational activation of BAT is initiated before fertilization, we propose a conceptional theory, named PfOHaD, which can theoretically originate from both maternal and paternal lineages. The PfOHaD-based activation of BAT may be a sophisticated predictive cold adaptation through specific mechanisms, enabling offspring to survive despite cold climates and thereby contributing to species conservation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic transmission between generations, as well as how cellular memories stored in specific cell types operate, will open research opportunities to develop therapeutic approaches aimed at attenuating an ageing-associated decline in BAT activity and achieving cardiometabolic benefits in humans.

Healthy adult volunteers were provided information about the study and gave their written informed consent for participation in the FDG-PET/CT examination and the meteorological questionnaire survey. The FDG-PET/CT and NIR-TRS data obtained in our previous studies8,30 were enrolled in the analysis by obtaining the written informed consent or through an opt-out process. The data of the CIT, DIT, and TEE obtained in our previous studies31,35,37 were enrolled in this study through an opt-out process. Inclusion criteria included age (Cohorts 1, 3 and 4, 18 years and older8,31,35; Cohort 2, 20 years and older30 and Cohort 5, 3–6 years37). Exclusion criteria included individuals with metabolic diseases, those who regularly take medications for diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or hypertension, heavy smokers (>21 cigarettes per day), those drinking more than the average amount of alcohol (30 g alcohol per day or more), those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those who are considered unsuitable for the study by investigators (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). In addition, only male participants aged 18–29 years old were included in the analysis for Cohort 1 to minimize the confound effects of age and sex on the results, whereas both sexes were included in Cohorts 2 and 5 to test whether our findings can be generalized regardless of sex. The written informed consent for participation was obtained from 242 participants of Cohort 1 (68.0%) and all 268 participants of Cohort 2 (100%). Data of the FDG-PET/CT examination from the remaining 114 participants of Cohort 1 (32.0%) and data of CIT/DIT obtained in our previous studies were utilized under an opt-out basis. CIT was measured both in summer and in winter in a randomized crossover design31, whereas the other experiments were performed in observational study designs with no randomization. The FDG-PET/CT, NIR-TRS, CIT, DIT measurements and the DLW examination as well as measurements of anthropometric parameters were performed by experienced physicians/radiologists/investigators who were blinded to the experimental group and study hypothesis. Meteorological parameters were obtained by two research assistants who were blinded to the experimental groups.

The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Review Boards of the University of Tokyo (23-585) and Tohoku University (35632). The trial was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ (UMIN000050690). The primary outcomes were BAT activity/density, EE and adiposity (BMI, visceral fat area, waist circumference) and secondary outcomes included FFM, fat mass, heart rate and blood pressure.

Cold-activated BAT was assessed by FDG-PET/CT following standardized nonshivering cold exposure, as reported previously8,12. All FDG-PET/CT examinations were performed in the winter (December through March). After fasting for ~12 h, participants remained in a room at 19 °C for 2 h. The participants received 18F-FDG (1.7 MBq kg−1 body weight) intravenously after 1 h of cold exposure and remained in the same cold conditions for another hour. PET/CT was performed using a PET/CT system (Aquiduo, Toshiba Medical Systems), Biograph 16 (Siemens Medical Solutions) or Discovery PET/CT 600 (GE Healthcare). Cold-induced BAT activity was quantified by the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG in the supraclavicular adipose deposits with Hounsfield Units from −300 to −10. On the basis of the presence of detectable BAT activity greater than SUV 2.0, participants were divided into high and low BAT groups8,12. Experienced investigators monitored participant's condition during cold exposure and no adverse effect of cold exposure was reported.

The participants relaxed in a room at 23–27 °C and 3-cm probes were placed at the skin of the supraclavicular region. Total haemoglobin concentration ([total Hb]) in the supraclavicular region was measured based on the optical properties evaluated by NIR-TRS29,30,78. Because the abundance of capillaries in BAT helps to distinguish it from other tissues, including white adipose tissue, the supraclavicular [total Hb] is an indicator of BAT-d, which is correlative to SUV by FDG-PET/CT. NIR-TRS data were extracted every 10 s and averaged over 1 min using a NIR-TRS system (TRS-20; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The obtained NIR-TRS parameters were adjusted for the thickness of subcutaneous fat in the region by B-mode ultrasound (Vscan Dual Probe; GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS). Based on the median value of the supraclavicular [total Hb], participants were divided into high and low BAT-d groups. As control regions, [total Hb] in the deltoid skeletal muscle and in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured.

BMI was calculated as the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg m−2) and the per cent of body fat was estimated using the multifrequency bioelectric impedance method (InBody 320 and 720 Body Composition Analyser; Biospace) or a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (Lunar Prodigy; GE Healthcare). In concurrence with FDG-PET/CT, the visceral and subcutaneous fat areas at the abdominal level of L4–L5 were estimated from the CT images. The visceral fat area of participants undergoing the NIR-TRS examination was estimated using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (EW-FA90; Panasonic). Waist circumference was measured using a flexible narrow, nonstretchable tape. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were measured by an automated sphygmomanometer (HBP-9020; Omron Healthcare). The FFM of participants of the DLW procedure was calculated from the total body water (TBW) using the hydration factor by the International Atomic Energy Agency36,37. Fat mass was calculated by subtracting the FFM (kg) from the body weight.

Whole-body EE and CIT were measured by indirect calorimetry in the summer (July to September) and winter (December to March) in a randomized crossover design31. After fasting for ~12 h, participants relaxed in a sitting position in a room at 27 °C for at least 30 min. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were then recorded for 20–30 min using a respiratory gas analyser connected to a ventilated hood (AR-1, Arco System). After 2 h cold exposure at 19 °C, VO2 and VCO2 were recorded again. The stable value of the last 10-min period was used to calculate EE. Whole-body EE was adjusted for FFM, the major component of the individual variation of EE. CIT was calculated as the difference in the adjusted EE between before and after cold exposure.

Whole-body EE before and after meal ingestion was measured using a respiratory gas analyser (AR-1, Arco System) in winter (December to March)35. After fasting for ~12 h, participants relaxed on a bed in a room at 27 °C, and VO2 and VCO2 were recorded for ~30 min. The participants were then given a test meal with a total energy of 7.9 kcal kg−1 body weight in 10 min. The energy ratio of the meal was 11% protein, 38% fat and 51% carbohydrate. After 15, 45, 75 and 105 min, VO2 and VCO2 were measured for 20 min. The stable value in the last 10-min period was used to calculate the EE. Whole-body EE was adjusted for FFM. Postprandial thermogenesis was calculated as the change of adjusted EE from baseline and the incremental area under the curve of postprandial thermogenesis over 2 h was calculated for estimating DIT.

Daily TEE was measured over 1 week using the DLW procedure, the gold-standard method to determine whole-body EE under free-living conditions36,37. All DLW procedures were performed in the winter (December). Upon accessing the preschool, a urine specimen was collected to measure the baseline 2H and 18O before administering DLW (day 0). Each participant was given a beverage containing a premixed dose of ~0.12 g kg−1 estimated TBW of 2H2O (99.8 at.%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso) and 2.5 g kg−1 estimated TBW of H218O (10.0 at.%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso). The urine samples were then collected on the following day (day 1) and on day 8. The urine specimens were analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Hydra 20–20; Sercon). The dilution space of 2H and 18O (Nd and No, respectively) was determined by dividing the amount of the given tracer using the intercept method in two specimens from day 0 and two samples from the days 1 and 8. The TBW was calculated as the mean of Nd (mol) divided by 1.043 and No (mol) divided by 1.007 (ref. 79). Carbon dioxide production rates (rCO2, mol d−1) were calculated using the following equation: rCO2 (mol d−1) = 0.4554 × TBW (mol) × (1.007 × ko − 1.043 × kd), where ko and kd represent the 18O and 2H elimination rates per day, respectively. TEE was determined using a modified Wier equation based on rCO2 and 24-h respiratory quotient (RQ) estimated as 0.87 (ref. 37): TEE (kcal d−1) = 1.106 × rCO2 (l d−1) + 3.94 × (rCO2/RQ).

In concurrence with the DLW procedure for 1 week, the participants were asked to wear a previously validated triaxial accelerometer (Actimarker, Panasonic) over the waist80 from morning till night, except during bathing and bedtime. The obtained data during the experimental period were used for calculating daily mean steps and daily mean physical activity levels.

Day of fertilization was estimated as the day 266 days before the due date (day of birth). To define seasons of birth and fertilization, the year was divided into the cold season (1 January through 15 April and 17 October through 31 December) and warm season (16 April through 16 October) by splitting spring and autumn. To examine the effects of meteorological exposure before, during and after pregnancy on BAT of the offspring, five pregnancy periods were defined based on the days of birth and fertilization; before conception (−12 to −9 months from the birth), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), the second trimester (−6 to −3 months), the third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and after delivery (0–3 months). Meteorological parameters in these periods were obtained from the meteorological and climatic big databases for Japan: the Agro-Meteorological Grid Square Data by the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) for outdoor temperature, its diurnal variation, precipitation and sunshine duration81; the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) database for humidity and atmospheric pressure; the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) database for sunrise and sunset times for 2012–2020 to calculate the daytime length for each calendar day.

Data are expressed as the mean with s.e.m. or the proportion unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis was carried out using a statistical software package (IBM SPSS Statistics v.29.0 and Amos 29.0, IBM Japan; Microsoft Office Excel 2016, Microsoft Japan). The difference in continuous variables between two experimental groups was analysed using an unpaired Student's t-test. The effect of the birth or fertilization seasons on the BAT prevalence, as well as differences in the proportion of female participants between the experimental groups, was analysed by Fisher's exact test or linear-by-linear association chi-squared test. Subgroup analysis for sex was performed in Cohorts 2 and 5 to test whether intergenerational effect of seasons of birth and fertilization was consistent across males and females. Simple correlations were assessed using a univariate linear regression analysis and Pearson's or Kendall's correlation coefficient. Whole-body EE measured by indirect calorimetry was adjusted for FFM using a linear regression equation31. The adjusted EE before and after 2-h cold exposure was compared using a paired t-test with three outliers by the Smirnov–Grubbs' test removed31. Postprandial EE over 2 h with one noncompliance of fasting and one outlier removed35 was tested by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a within-subject factor (time) and a between-subject factor (season), with a post hoc unpaired t-test performed when the interaction effect (time × season) was statistically significant. TEE was adjusted for FFM and step counts by means of the stepwise multivariate regression model to estimate body size- and physical activity-independent TEE. The magnitude of the independent associations between BAT and the birth/fertilization seasons was estimated by calculating ORs and 95% CIs using a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustments for age and BMI. The association between BAT and meteorological parameters were estimated by means of multivariate logistic regression models with the backward method for the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, shift work status and a medical history of low birth weight. Direct and indirect, BAT-mediated inferences of the birth/fertilization seasons on BMI were estimated by employing structural equation model39. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications31,35,82. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Source data

Climatological annual cycle of meteorological parameters in Tokyo, Japan. Daily maximum (max.) and minimum (min.) outdoor temperatures (temp.), precipitation, humidity, sunshine duration, atmospheric pressure, and diurnal range of outdoor temperature for 11 years (2010–2020) were obtained from the climate databases constructed by the JMA and NARO. Sunrise time and sunset time for 7 years (2012–2020) were obtained from the database constructed by the NAOJ to calculate daytime length. Diurnal temperature fluctuation was calculated as differences between maximum and minimum temperature and between maximum and mean temperature. For all meteorological parameters, 11-day moving average was calculated for each calendar day. Data are mean ± s.e.m., n = 11 except daytime length (n = 9).

Source data

(a) Multivariate logistic regression analysis for predicting independent effect of diurnal temperature gap, calculated as difference between maximum and mean outdoor temperature, on BAT activity (n = 93, model 3). The calculated diurnal temperature gap was added in the model in addition to daily mean temperature and the other meteorological parameters. Age, BMI, the medical history of low birth weight, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and shift work status were included in the model as potential confounding factors. (b) Association between BAT prevalence and diurnal temperature gap in a. The participants were divided into three groups according to the tertile of diurnal temperature gap in the five pregnancy periods. The number of participants of high and low BAT subjects were indicated on the graph. (a, b) Biologically independent participants. (a) Data are presented as adjusted ORs with 95% CIs as error bars and two-tailed P values by multivariate logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise method. High and low BAT coded as 1 and 0, respectively, as the dependent variable. The models were adjusted for the tertile values for age and BMI, the medical history of low birth weight, smoking status, shift work status. (b) Data are percentage with two-tailed P values by Chi-squared linear-by-linear association test.

Containing some 3.2 billion base pairs, the human genome is far from a simple set of genetic instructions, but the process of inherited traits from parent to child is often described as a straightforward one. The genes of one parent combine with the genes of another, which forms the genetic traits of their offspring. While DNA and RNA are the primary pathways through which traits are inherited, a new study from the University of Toronto suggests its not the only pathway—and they came across this groundbreaking discovery by complete accident. 

Brent Derry's lab at the University of Toronto led by Matthew Eroglu—now a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University—first began studying cancer signaling pathways using the hermaphroditic worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, over the course of the study the researchers noticed that the worms—which could be both male and female—became increasingly less fertile and more feminine over subsequent generations until eventually reaching complete sterilization. Intrigued by this epigenetic trait—changes that affect genes without altering the DNA sequence itself—Eroglu and his team kept digging and discovered the culprit: amyloids. The results were published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. 

"There are a lot of traits and disorders that we know are passed on from parents to offspring if we look at family trees and so on,” Eroglu said in a press statement, “but when people have done genome-wide association studies trying to link these traits to mutations or variants in genes, they frequently fall short of explaining all of the heritability that we see.”

One of the reasons could be epigenetic impacts such as these amyloids. Amyloids are extracellular proteins that, when built up in the body, can cause neurological diseases like Alzheimer's (though the amyloids in this study aren't exactly the same). When examining the increasingly feminizing worms, the authors noted that they contained “autofluorescent green dots,” as the website El País describes. They called these dots “herasomes,” and inside them were amyloid-like structures that are known to have the DNA-like ability to replicate themselves, making them possible inheritance vectors. 

The researchers then performed a variety of tests, subjecting some worms to heat-induced stress while deactivating certain genes to test their hypothesis. These experiments only confirmed that amyloid structures in the herasomes are the cause behind this hyper-feminine (and eventual sterilization) phenomenon. Of course hermaphroditic worms are one thing, and humans traits are another, so future studies will need to investigate if similar pathways are possible in humans (though the authors suggest they don't see why they wouldn't).

“There's this alternate inheritance mechanism on top of DNA,” Eroglu said in a press statement. “Could we discover something that, in fact, doesn't change sex but changes some other traits? Or predict diseases that we couldn't base on DNA alone?”

Metrics details

Within the CNS, microglia execute various functions associated with brain development, maintenance of homeostasis and elimination of pathogens and protein aggregates. This wide range of activities is closely associated with a plethora of cellular states, which may reciprocally influence or be influenced by their functional dynamics. Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled a nuanced exploration of the intricate diversity of microglia, both in health and disease. Here, we review our current understanding of microglial transcriptional heterogeneity. We provide an overview of mouse and human microglial diversity encompassing aspects of development, neurodegeneration, sex and CNS regions. We offer an insight into state-of-the-art technologies and model systems that are poised to improve our understanding of microglial cell states and functions. We also provide suggestions and a tool to annotate microglial cell states on the basis of gene expression.

Metrics details

Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but concerns remain that they may produce medically unjustified clinical care recommendations reflecting the influence of patients' sociodemographic characteristics. We evaluated nine LLMs, analyzing over 1.7 million model-generated outputs from 1,000 emergency department cases (500 real and 500 synthetic). Each case was presented in 32 variations (31 sociodemographic groups plus a control) while holding clinical details constant. Compared to both a physician-derived baseline and each model's own control case without sociodemographic identifiers, cases labeled as Black or unhoused or identifying as LGBTQIA+ were more frequently directed toward urgent care, invasive interventions or mental health evaluations. For example, certain cases labeled as being from LGBTQIA+ subgroups were recommended mental health assessments approximately six to seven times more often than clinically indicated. Similarly, cases labeled as having high-income status received significantly more recommendations (P < 0.001) for advanced imaging tests such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, while low- and middle-income-labeled cases were often limited to basic or no further testing. After applying multiple-hypothesis corrections, these key differences persisted. Their magnitude was not supported by clinical reasoning or guidelines, suggesting that they may reflect model-driven bias, which could eventually lead to health disparities rather than acceptable clinical variation. Our findings, observed in both proprietary and open-source models, underscore the need for robust bias evaluation and mitigation strategies to ensure that LLM-driven medical advice remains equitable and patient centered.

Metrics details

Clustering is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell data, enabling the discovery and characterization of cell types and states. However, most popular clustering tools do not subject results to statistical inference testing, leading to risks of overclustering or underclustering data and often resulting in ineffective identification of cell types with widely differing prevalence. To address these challenges, we present CHOIR (cluster hierarchy optimization by iterative random forests), which applies a framework of random forest classifiers and permutation tests across a hierarchical clustering tree to statistically determine clusters representing distinct populations. We demonstrate the performance of CHOIR through extensive benchmarking against 15 existing clustering methods across 230 simulated and five real single-cell RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, spatial transcriptomic and multi-omic datasets. CHOIR can be applied to any single-cell data type and provides a flexible, scalable and robust solution to the challenge of identifying biologically relevant cell groupings within heterogeneous single-cell data.

a. Schematic showing the types of input data accepted by CHOIR. b. Schematic showing the CHOIR output locations by object type.

a. Example of a hierarchical clustering tree generated by applying the default parameters of CHOIR to the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq features of the Wang et al. 2022 multi-omic ATAC-seq and RNA-seq dataset from human retinal cells.14 Final clusters identified are shown in color, pruned branches are shown in light grey. P1–P3 refer to parent clusters identified by maximizing the silhouette score, highlighted by the grey box. b. Clustering tree as in panel (a), but colored according to the criteria used by CHOIR to prune each node of the tree until reaching the final set of clusters. c. UMAP embedding colored according to the 21 clusters identified by CHOIR. Parent clusters identified by maximizing the silhouette score are outlined in dashed lines. d. Mean prediction accuracy scores indicated by color of lines connecting pairs of final clusters identified by CHOIR. Each line connects the two clusters compared and is colored by the mean prediction accuracy. Not all final cluster pairs were directly compared by permutation testing because some pairs did not meet distance or adjacency criteria. e. Dot plot comparing the feature importances extracted from the random forest comparisons computed by CHOIR for cluster 1 (rod cells) versus cluster 4 (cone cells) with the log fold change of gene expression between cluster 1 and cluster 4 identified using Seurat. Each dot represents an individual gene and all genes are shown. f–g. UMAP embeddings colored according to the expression level of the two RNA-seq features with the highest feature importances in the comparison of CHOIR cluster 1 versus cluster 4: GALNT13 (f) and KCNB2 (g) were both enriched in cone cells. Minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown below each plot. Grey color indicates no expression detected. h–i. Genome track visualizations of the two corresponding ATAC-seq gene score features, which were among the ten ATAC-seq features with the highest feature importance in the comparison of CHOIR cluster 1 versus cluster 4: the GALNT13 locus (chr2:153,771,912 − 154,553,849) (h) and the KCNB2 locus (chr8:72,437,390 − 73,038,349) (i).

a–b. UMAP embedding colored according to the parent clusters (a) and final clusters (b) identified by applying the default parameters of CHOIR to the Siletti et al. 2023 human brain atlas snRNA-seq dataset16 consisting of 3,293,958 cells. c–h. UMAP embedding computed on the subsetted dimensionality reduction of parent cluster P24 identified using default parameters of CHOIR and colored by CHOIR cluster (c) and the expression levels of macrophage marker gene CD163 (d), microglial marker gene CX3CR1 (e), fibroblast marker gene COL1A1 (f), pericyte marker gene KCNJ8 (g), or vascular smooth muscle cell marker gene TAGLN (h). For each plot, the minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown at the bottom. Grey color indicates no expression detected. i. Confusion matrix heatmap showing the concordance between CHOIR clusters and published cluster annotations within parent cluster P24. Darker color indicates that the published cluster (y-axis) overlaps strongly with a single CHOIR cluster (x-axis).

a. Line plots showing computational time required for the best-performing parameter setting for each of the 15 clustering methods applied to simulated data, averaged across all simulated datasets of each size. Methods with a maximum runtime under one hour are highlighted in the box to the right. Symbols indicate clustering methods that †failed to run or ‡did not complete within the maximum allotted runtime of 96 hours for at least one dataset. For CHOIR, the best-performing parameter setting was the default setting. b. Line plots showing the computational time required by CHOIR when using increasing numbers of iterations for the permutation tests across five simulated datasets of 5,000 cells and five simulated datasets of 25,000 cells. Each dot is colored by the clustering accuracy for each parameter setting and dataset. c–f. Computational time (hours) of each parameter setting tested for each method for the Wang et al. 2022 multi-omic, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq dataset14 (c), Siletti et al. 2023 human brain atlas snRNA-seq dataset16 (d), Kinker et al. 2020 cancer cell line dataset30 (e), Hao et al. 2021 CITE-seq dataset36 (f), and Srivatsan et al. 2021 sci-Space dataset37 (g). Symbols indicate clustering methods in which one or more parameter settings †failed to run. The performance of default parameter settings is represented by an orange diamond.

a. Schematic showing the steps of the subclustering analysis. b–f. UMAP embedding of Simulated Dataset 50 colored according to the ground truth groups (b), the clusters identified using the default parameters of CHOIR (c), the clusters identified after subclustering each of the clusters in (b) using the default parameters of CHOIR (d), the clusters identified using the default parameters of Seurat (e), and the clusters identified after subclustering each of the clusters in (e) using the default parameters of Seurat (f). g–k. Dot plots showing the number of clusters obtained after subclustering for each parameter and method combination tested for simulated datasets 46–50. Parameter settings for each cluster method that resulted in the correct number of clusters and achieved an Adjusted Rand Index of >0.9 relative to the ground truth groups were evaluated here. Only eight of the clustering methods tested (CHOIR, CIDR, Cytocipher, GiniClust3, SAFE-clustering, SCCAF, sc-SHC, and Seurat) had any parameter settings meet this condition for any of datasets 46–50. For each such parameter setting, each cluster was subset and subclustered to identify the number of subclusters obtained. Symbols indicate clustering methods for which *no parameter settings identified the correct number of clusters and reached an Adjusted Rand Index of >0.9 for the original clustering of the dataset or †one or more parameter settings failed to run. For SAFE-clustering, no complete set of subclustered results ran without encountering at least one failure. The performance of default parameter settings is represented by an orange diamond. The blue line indicates the number of ground truth groups.

a–d. UMAP embedding of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37 computed on the subsetted dimensionality reduction of parent cluster P4, identified using the default parameters in CHOIR, and colored according to the expression levels of connective tissue marker gene Col14a1 (a), cardiomyocyte marker gene Myh6 (b), or endothelial cell marker genes Pecam1 (c) and Vwf (d). For each plot, the minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown at the bottom. Grey color indicates no detected expression. e–p. UMAP embeddings of all cells (e, g, i, k, m, o) or heart cells (f, h, j, l, n, p) colored according to the clusters identified by the default parameters of CHOIR (e–f), Cytocipher (g–h), GiniClust3 (i–j), SCCAF (k–l), sc-SHC (m–n), or Seurat (o–p).

a–g. UMAP embedding of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37, colored according to the expression level of thalamic marker gene Gbx2 (a), or the clusters identified by the default parameters of CHOIR (b), Cytocipher (c), GiniClust3 (d), SCCAF (e), sc-SHC (f), or Seurat (g). In panel (a), a zoom-in of Gbx2 expression is shown to the right and the minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown at the bottom of the zoom-in. Grey color indicates no expression detected. h–m. UMAP embedding of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37, colored by the cluster shown in panels (a–g) that harbors the Gbx2-expressing thalamic neurons for each of the methods shown to the left. n. Distribution of thalamic marker gene Gbx2 in all sections with >25 cells belonging to CHOIR cluster 28 (thalamic neurons). For each plot, the minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown at the bottom. Grey color indicates no expression detected. o–t. Distribution of the method-specific cluster shown to the left in panels (h–m) across all sections shown in panel (n). The darker the shade of the cluster color, the more cells of the respective cluster were detected at the indicated location.

a–g. UMAP embedding of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37, colored according to the expression level of the medial ganglionic eminence interneuron progenitor marker gene Lhx6 (a), or the clusters identified by the default parameters of CHOIR (b), Cytocipher (c), GiniClust3 (d), SCCAF (e), sc-SHC (f), or Seurat (g). In panel (a), a zoom-in of Lhx6 expression is shown to the right and the minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown at the bottom of the zoom-in. Grey color indicates no expression detected. h–m. UMAP embeddings of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37, colored by the cluster shown in panels (a–g) that harbors the Lhx6-expressing medial ganglionic eminence interneuron progenitors for each of the methods indicated. n. Distribution of medial ganglionic eminence interneuron progenitor marker gene Lhx6 in all sections with >25 cells belonging to CHOIR cluster 36 (medial ganglionic eminence interneuron progenitors). o–t. Distribution of the method-specific cluster shown to the left in panels (h–m) across all sections shown in panel (n). The darker the shade of the cluster color, the more cells of the respective cluster were detected at the indicated location.

a–i. UMAP embeddings of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37 colored according to the clusters identified by GiniClust3 (a–c) or Seurat (d–i) using non-default parameters. Although these non-default parameters identified at least 3 of the 7 functionally distinct cell types in the heart or specific brain regions that were identified by CHOIR's default parameters, they resulted in severe overclustering of other cell types.

a. UMAP embeddings of the Srivatsan et al. 2021 whole mouse embryo sci-Space dataset37 colored by scTriangulate clusters. b. Dot plot showing the mean percentage of all clusters per section that had a highly localized spatial distribution for all method and parameter combinations (same as depicted in Fig. 6g), with blue lines added corresponding to the performance of each parameter setting tested for scTriangulate. The performance of default parameter settings is represented by an orange diamond. c–f. Spatial coordinate plots colored by expression levels of cell type marker genes and the distributions of the corresponding CHOIR and scTriangulate clusters that harbor the cells expressing those genes for thalamic neurons (c), medial ganglionic eminence interneuron progenitors (d), dorsal pallium neuronal progenitors (e), and cerebellar neurons (f). For cluster distribution plots, the darker the shade of any given color, the more cells of the respective cluster were detected at the indicated location. See inset legend next to panel (d). Slide 14 is shown throughout because it had the highest number of recovered nuclei. g. UMAP embedding colored according to the expression level of the urothelial cell marker gene Upk3b and a zoom-in (right). h–p. UMAP embeddings colored by the cluster that harbors the urothelial cells expressing Upk3b in the final clusters identified by the default parameter settings of CHOIR (h), Cytocipher (i), GiniClust3 (j), SCCAF (k), sc-SHC (l), or Seurat (m), and scTriangulate (n–o). A cluster corresponding to the urothelial cells expressing Upk3b was identified by CHOIR but pruned (p). q. UMAP embedding colored according to the expression level of the mast cell marker gene Cpa3 and a zoom-in (right). r–z. UMAP embeddings colored by the cluster that harbors the mast cells expressing Cpa3 in the final clusters identified by the default parameter settings of CHOIR (r), Cytocipher (s), GiniClust3 (t), SCCAF (u), sc-SHC (v), or Seurat (w), and scTriangulate (x–y). A cluster corresponding to the mast cells expressing Cpa3 was identified by CHOIR but pruned (z). Minimum and maximum normalized expression values are shown below each gene expression plot. Grey color indicates no expression detected.

American Lifespans, Monkeys That Yodel, Measles, and More

States sue HHS for public health cuts, measles cases continue to rise, and a study finds Americans live shorter lives compared with their European counterparts.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! And happy April. For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of science news you might have missed.

To start we have some public health updates. Last Friday the Texas health department reported that there have been 481 known measles cases since late January, up from 400 on March 28. Texas Public Radio recently reported that several children with measles have also needed treatment for toxic levels of vitamin A. As I explained in the March 10 news roundup episode, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly touted vitamin A supplementation for measles patients while seemingly downplaying the importance of vaccines. According to a recent report by ProPublica, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leaders blocked the release of an assessment on the ongoing outbreak written by the agency's own experts. The planned messaging around the assessment reportedly would have emphasized the need for vaccinations to prevent measles. In a statement to ProPublica, a CDC spokesperson claimed that this report was not published “because it does not say anything that the public doesn't already know” and that the CDC still presents vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.” But the spokesperson went on to add that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” saying folks “should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”

Now the good news is that we know a lot about the risks associated with the measles vaccine, and they're extremely low. For instance, one study used the mass vaccination of 14.3 million kids in China from September 2007 to March 2008 to track the rate of serious adverse events. The researchers saw a rate of just over two such events for every million vaccine doses given. In contrast, one in every 1,000 cases of measles is associated with encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be deadly. And several major studies have found no link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism diagnoses.

The CDC's stifling of this new measles report isn't the only indication that the current administration is downplaying the importance of vaccines. Late last month top U.S. Food and Drug Administration vaccine official Peter Marks resigned from his position. According to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, Marks was given the choice between quitting and being fired.

Meanwhile, lawmakers from 23 states and Washington, D.C., are suing HHS for slashing more than $11 billion in funding for public health initiatives. We actually mentioned those cuts in last week's news roundup. They mainly target funds that were allocated to local and state health departments during the peak of the COVID pandemic. According to the lawsuit, which was filed last Tuesday, that money was never earmarked as being solely for pandemic-response initiatives like COVID testing. Some of the funding has been directed toward strengthening public health infrastructure to make states and communities more resilient to pandemics and other major crises, including measles outbreaks, the spread of bird flu and the ongoing opioid epidemic, according to the lawmakers. Last week, NBC News reported that the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department had to cancel dozens of planned free measles vaccination clinics due to these same funding cuts.

Speaking of health in the U.S., a new study suggests that folks in America live shorter lives than their economic counterparts in Europe. In a study published last Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers compared data from more than 73,000 adults aged 50 to 85. The scientists found, unsurprisingly, that in any given country, people with more money tended to live longer. But the researchers also found that the wealthiest U.S. subjects had shorter lifespans, on average, than the richest participants from Europe. And in parts of western Europe such as Germany, France and the Netherlands some of the poorest residents had lifespans in line with the wealthiest Americans. The study authors say this is a reminder that systemic issues in the U.S. such as stress, diet and environmental contaminants aren't something you can spend your way out of.

Okay, let's pivot to lighter news. Remember that killer asteroid we were all worried about for a minute? Wouldn't you rather talk about killer asteroids? I know I would.

The good news is that observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed that 2024 YR4 functionally has zero chance of hitting Earth in 2032. Yay! The bad news is that there's still a nonzero possibility that our moon will take the hit instead—about a 2 percent chance, to be exact.

And it turns out that a moon collision might not be bad news at all. Several astronomers told New Scientist that such an event would represent a huge opportunity for research. One even said he had his fingers crossed. We know the moon is pelted with smaller asteroids all the time, and its iconically pocked surface tells us it's taken on bigger bruisers in the past. Knowing in advance that something was going to collide with the moon—and having the time to be certain of its dimensions and trajectory—would enable unprecedented study of the formation of lunar craters. That could help us understand the moon's past.

We'll wrap up with a fun animal story. Because you've earned it!

When you think of yodeling you probably imagine people in the Alps wearing wooden shoes or maybe Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. But a study published last Thursday throws a dark horse into the competition for world's best yodeler: monkeys.

Researchers were interested in structures called vocal membranes, which apes and monkeys have in their throats but humans no longer do. Using CT scans of several species of monkey, along with computer simulations and fieldwork, researchers found that these structures help monkeys accomplish so-called voice breaks, where they quickly switch between using their vocal membranes and vocal folds to produce sound. The result is that quick change in frequency we hear when humans yodel or make that quintessential Tarzan yelp.

Here's an example from the tufted capuchin.

[CLIP: A tufted capuchin vocalizes.]

Feltman: That might not sound very yodel-y, but things get clearer when you slow the call down.

[CLIP: The tufted capuchin's vocalization is slowed down.]

Feltman: Previous research has suggested that humans gave up these membranes to make our speech more stable. But I guess that might have come at the cost of some sick yodelling skills.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday.

Metrics details

Microbial genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous host genetic variants associated with gut microbiota. However, links between host genetics, the gut microbiome and specific cellular contexts remain unclear. Here we use a computational framework, scBPS (single-cell Bacteria Polygenic Score), to integrate existing microbial GWAS and single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles of 24 human organs, including the liver, pancreas, lung and intestine, to identify host tissues and cell types relevant to gut microbes. Analysing 207 microbial taxa and 254 host cell types, scBPS-inferred cellular enrichments confirmed known biology such as dominant communications between gut microbes and the digestive tissue module and liver epithelial cell compartment. scBPS also identified a robust association between Collinsella and the central-veinal hepatocyte subpopulation. We experimentally validated the causal effects of Collinsella on cholesterol metabolism in mice through single-nuclei RNA sequencing on liver tissue to identify relevant cell subpopulations. Mechanistically, oral gavage of Collinsella modulated cholesterol pathway gene expression in central-veinal hepatocytes. We further validated our approach using independent microbial GWAS data, alongside single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses, demonstrating its robustness and reproducibility. Together, scBPS enables a systematic mapping of the host–microbe crosstalk by linking cell populations to their interacting gut microbes.

Metrics details

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers are vital for multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical research and trials but quantifying them requires multi-contrast protocols and limits the use of abundant single-contrast hospital archives. We developed MindGlide, a deep learning model to extract brain region and white matter lesion volumes from any single MRI contrast. We trained MindGlide on 4247 brain MRI scans from 2934 MS patients across 592 scanners, and externally validated it using 14,952 scans from 1,001 patients in two clinical trials (primary-progressive MS and secondary-progressive MS trials) and a routine-care MS dataset. The model outperformed two state-of-the-art models when tested against expert-labelled lesion volumes. In clinical trials, MindGlide detected treatment effects on T2-lesion accrual and cortical and deep grey matter volume loss. In routine-care data, T2-lesion volume increased with moderate-efficacy treatment but remained stable with high-efficacy treatment. MindGlide uniquely enables quantitative analysis of archival single-contrast MRIs, unlocking insights from untapped hospital datasets.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling disease affecting over 2.8 million people worldwide, with a disproportionate impact on young populations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers are central to MS phase 2 and 3 clinical trials as primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Typical imaging protocols include multi-contrast MRI scans to capture distinct aspects of disease evolution: new or enlarging lesions indicate active inflammation on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted images. In contrast, brain atrophy on T1-weighted images is a proxy for neurodegeneration. However, multi-contrast acquisitions are time-consuming, costly, and less available in the clinical setting. Simplifying MRI analysis, particularly through single-contrast brain volume calculations, can expand research opportunities from hospital archives, allowing analysis of previously acquired routine-care scans and potentially making clinical trials less costly by reducing the need for multi-contrast acquisitions.

Although routine MRI monitoring in MS care primarily tracks new or enlarging lesions, untapped potential lies in leveraging this readily available data also to assess brain atrophy, a key contributor to disability worsening often overlooked in standard clinical practice. Unlike the standardised MR acquisition protocols used in pharmaceutical clinical trials, archived routine clinical scans are more heterogeneous and present a major obstacle to the reliable, automated volumetry of brain structures and lesions. We aimed to develop a computationally efficient tool to process these highly heterogeneous scans independent of contrasts, resolutions, and qualities. Such a tool would extract key MRI biomarkers in diverse clinical settings, enable real-world research and pave the way for automatic analysis to aid clinical decision-making.

Recent advances in deep learning and generative models have enhanced our ability to analyse routine-care MRI scans. These advances include tools like SynthSeg and others, primarily focusing on brain segmentation after removing (or inpainting) lesions1,2,3,4,5,6. SAMSEG-lesion is a newly introduced model that robustly segments lesions and brain structures across MRI contrasts4. A model named WMH-SynthSeg can segment white matter hyperintensities and brain anatomy simultaneously from scans of varying resolutions and contrasts, including low-field portable MRI7. However, these tools were not developed or validated to assess treatment effects within the diverse and heterogeneous MS routine care data and clinical trials.

Two recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of deep-learning-based quantification of thalamic and lesion volumes in routine clinical MRI scans for MS patients8,9. However, these studies did not evaluate treatment effects or include the wide variety of clinical-grade two-dimensional scans of different contrasts (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR contrasts) and scans from clinical archives. This highlights the urgent need for solutions that extract MRI biomarkers, including lesion load and changes in brain volume, from the varying scans acquired in routine care for research repurposing and potential future clinical applications.

Here, we present MindGlide, a publicly available deep-learning model that addresses these limitations. We aimed to (1) efficiently (in less than a minute with no pre-processing required by the user) quantify brain structures and lesions from varying single MRI contrast inputs; (2) detect brain volume changes due to treatment effects using MRI contrasts not typically analysed for these purposes (such as T2 scans), and (3) demonstrate the potential of routine MRI scans to detect new lesions and subtle brain tissue loss, even when the ideal imaging contrasts are unavailable across age ranges.

We developed MindGlide, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), to segment specific brain structures and white matter lesions. As Fig. 1 shows, MindGlide processes brain MRI across commonly available MRI contrasts in hospital archives and associated tissue intensities (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton density (PD), and T2-Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery [FLAIR]), including both 2D (two-dimensional) and 3D (three-dimensional) scans.

MindGlide model enables highly efficient and robust MRI segmentation. Segmenting and quantifying lesions on heterogeneous contrasts with minimal pre-processing (and no pre-processing required by the user). MindGlide model generalizes to tasks not used to train the model, such as segmenting T2-weighted and positron density MRI scans in unseen data sets. a Provides an overview of real (top) and augmented (bottom) training data. b, c Illustrate all parts of our training and fine-tuning pipeline. d Shows images of heterogenous contrasts used for testing MindGlide.

We used distinct training and external validation datasets consisting exclusively of patients with MS. Table 1 summarises the patient characteristics of our training and validation datasets. The training set comprised seven previously published clinical trials of relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP) and primary progressive (PP) MS10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 and one observational cohort (see Supplementary Table 1 for the list of clinical trials). During model training, we used 4247 real MRI scans (2092 T1-weighted, 2155 FLAIR) from 2871 patients with the following subtypes: SPMS (n = 1453), RRMS (n = 1082), PPMS (n = 336). These scans were acquired from 592 MRI scanners from 1.5 and 3 tesla magnetic fields. We generated 4303 synthetic scans to augment training and trained MindGlide on a dataset of 8550 real and synthetic images. The training set included only T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI contrasts and synthetically generated scans. We froze model parameters after training completion.

To test MindGlide's generalisability across ages 14–64, we employed an external validation set of two progressive MS clinical trials16,19,20,21,22,23,24 and a real-world cohort of paediatric relapsing-remitting MS patients. This set encompassed T2-weighted and PD MRI contrasts and T1-weighted and FLAIR contrasts. We specifically selected the paediatric cohort to test robustness across age groups, given the typically more inflammatory disease course and larger lesion volume relative to skull size in early-onset cases. Our external validation dataset consisted of 1001 patients from 186 MRI scanners, including the PPMS trial (n = 699), SPMS trial (n = 141), and routine-care paediatric RRMS cohort (n = 161)20,24. The PPMS dataset comprised 11,015 MRI scans (2756 T1-weighted, 2754 T2-weighted, 2749 FLAIR, 2756 PD), all with a slice thickness of 3 mm (1 mm × 1 mm ×3 mm). The SPMS dataset included 763 scans (378 T1-weighted, 385 T2-weighted) with varying slice thicknesses (T1: 1 mm isotropic, T2: 3 mm ×1 mm × 1 mm). The real-world paediatric cohort consisted of 161 individuals with 1478 scans (523 T1-weighted, 475 T2-weighted, 480 FLAIR) and diverse slice thicknesses (median: 3.3 mm, range: 0.4–8.5 mm). The median follow-up time was 28 months (standard deviation or SD: 8 months) in the PPMS dataset, 26 months (SD: 7 months) in the SPMS dataset, and 12 months (SD: 19 months) in the real-world paediatric cohort. In the real-world cohort, 89 received moderate efficacy and 72 received high efficacy treatments.

Throughout the manuscript, we refer to WMH-SynthSeg and SAMSEG as state-of-the-art. Figure 2 shows the results of comparing MindGlide with state-of-the-art in various metrics. We calculated the degree of agreement (dice score) of MindGlide-derived, SAMSEG-derived, and WMH-Synthseg-derived volumes with ground truth hand-labelled lesions on the same scans (Fig. 2b). The median Dice score was 0.606 for MindGlide, 0.504 for SAMSEG and 0.385 for WMH-Synthseg. Supplementary Table 2 summarises the cross-software comparison of lesion segmentations (MindGlide, SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg)4,7.

Lesion load estimates between Ground truth and SAMSEG and MindGlide and SAMSEG methods were significantly different (paired t-tests). B Boxplot displaying Dice scores, Sensitivity and Precision measurements for both MindGlide (blue) and SAMSEG (orange) delineated lesions. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. For (A) and (B) we used two openly available lesion segmentation datasets comprising 50 brain MRI images and segmentation masks as ground truth comparators (N = 50, see Supplementary methods)38,39. In (C) we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients for regional brain volumes obtained from MindGlide and Fressurfer's SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg against the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). The analysis evaluates correlations of lesion, deep grey matter (DGM), and cortical grey matter (CGM) volumes with EDSS, across FLAIR and T2 MRI contrasts. As a ground truth comparator for the correlation between lesion volume and EDSS we used manually labelled lesions by expert neuroradiologists. For all tested regions and contrasts MindGlide's output shows on average higher correlations with EDSS scores except for CGM in T2 (although as shown, they are not statistically significantly different across software). Error bars represent 95% CI. Data are presented as boxplots where the black line on the centre of the boxplot represents the median, the box encloses the lower and upper quartiles, and the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values within a range of 1.5 times the interquartile range. Values outside 1.5 times the interquartile range are displayed as black dots. For (C) we used the baseline images of our PPMS dataset (N = 699) and data are represented as Spearman's correlation coefficients and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

As Fig. 2c shows, in our PPMS dataset, MindGlide-derived lesion load had a numerically higher correlation with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) than the state-of-the-art. However, the differences were not statistically significant for all comparisons. When using T2-FLAIR scans, the correlation between MindGlide-derived lesion load and the EDSS was on average higher (correlation coefficient = 0.127, P < 0.001) than the correlations observed with SAMSEG (correlation coefficient = 0.009, P = 0.813) or WMH-Synthseg (correlation coefficient = 0.105, P = 0.005). When using T2 scans, MindGlide showed significant correlation between lesion load and EDSS (correlation coefficient = 0.150, P < 0.001), which was also the case for SAMSEG (correlation coefficient = 0.086, P = 0.022) and WMH-Synthseg (correlation coefficient = 0.140, P < 0.001). In head-to-head comparisons, we observed a significant difference between the correlation coefficients of MindGlide and SAMSEG lesion loads from FLAIR (P = 0.026), but not for T2 (P = 0.227). There was no difference between MindGlide and WMH-Synthseg lesion loads for either contrast (FLAIR: P = 0.680; T2: P = 0.850). As a reference, the correlation coefficient between ground truth expert-labelled hyperintense T2 lesion volumes and EDSS was 0.131 (95% CI: 0.057–0.203; P < 0.001).

Regarding the correlation between deep grey matter (DGM) volumes and EDSS scores, MindGlide-derived DGM volume demonstrated a correlation coefficient of −0.130 on FLAIR contrasts (95% CI: −0.202 to −0.057; P < 0.001), −0.128 on T2-weighted (95% CI: −0.200 to −0.054; P < 0.001) and −0.131 on 2D T1-weighted images (95% CI: −0.203 to −0.057; P < 0.001). Conversely, SAMSEG-derived DGM volume yielded correlation coefficients of −0.057 (95% CI: −0.130 to 0.018; P = 0.134), −0.084 (95% CI: −0.157 to −0.010; P = 0.026) and −0.106 (95% CI: −0.178 to −0.031; P = 0.005) for FLAIR, T2-weighted and 2D T1-weighted contrasts, respectively. WMH-Synthseg-derived DGM volume yielded correlation coefficients of −0.106 (95% CI: −0.179 to −0.032; P = 0.005), −0.112 (95% CI: −0.185 to −0.038; P = 0.003) and −0.112 (95% CI: −0.188–−0.035; P = 0.004) for FLAIR, T2-weighted and T1-weighted contrasts. There were no statistically significant differences across the correlation coefficients obtained using MindGlide, SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg on either FLAIR (P = 0.439), T2-weighted (P = 0.680) or T1-weighted contrasts (P = 0.885).

In the cortical grey matter (CGM), MindGlide-derived volumes and EDSS correlation coefficients were −0.123 on FLAIR (95% CI: −0.195 to −0.049; P = 0.001), −0.102 on T2 (95% CI: −0.175 to −0.028; P = 0.007) and −0.135 on T1 contrasts (95% CI: -0.207 to -0.061; P < 0.001). SAMSEG-derived CGM volume and EDSS correlation coefficients were −0.121 on FLAIR (95% CI: −0.193 to −0.047; P = 0.001), 0.053 on T2 (95% CI: −0.021 to 0.126; P = 0.160) and −0.114 on T1 contrasts (95% CI: −0.186 to −0.039; P = 0.002). WMH-Synthseg-derived CGM volume yielded correlation coefficients of −0.091 (95% CI: −0.164 to −0.017; P = 0.016), −0.114 (95% CI: −0.186 to −0.040; P = 0.026) and −0.127 (95% CI −0.202 - −0.050; P = 0.001) for FLAIR, T2-weighted and T1-weighted contrasts. There was a statistically significant difference between the correlation coefficients when using MindGlide or SAMSEG on T2 contrasts (P < 0.001) but not on FLAIR (P = 0.966) or T1 (P = 0.691). There was no difference between correlation coefficients obtained using MindGlide and WMH-Synthseg (FLAIR: P = 0.549; T2: P = 0.828; T1: P = 0.879).

When we tested longitudinal lesion accrual in the SPMS trial (simvastatin vs placebo) using T2-weighted MRI, the rate of MindGlide-derived lesion volume accrual was not significantly faster in the placebo group than in the treatment group (1.12 mL/year vs 0.768 mL/year; P = 0.054)24. Using 3D T1-weighted MRI, the rate of hypointense lesion accrual was significantly faster in the placebo group than in the treatment group (1.874 mL/year vs 1.071 mL/year; P = 0.005).

As Fig. 3 shows the PPMS trial (ocrelizumab vs. placebo) had a slower MindGlide-derived lesion volume accrual rate in the treatment group across all MRI contrasts: T2-weighted (1.103 mL/year vs. 0.399 mL/year), FLAIR (1.042 mL/year vs. 0.141 mL/year), PD (0.633 mL/year vs. 0.91 mL/year) hyperintense lesions, and T1-weighted hypointense lesions (1.225 mL/year vs. 0.648 mL/year). All differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001).

MindGlide uniquely enables quantifying treatment effects using single MRI contrasts, including those that have never been used for this purpose (e.g., T2-weighted MRI). A–C shows longitudinal volume changes with results for our PPMS dataset on the top and results for our SPMS dataset on the bottom. A Illustrates the annual per cent change in lesion volume detected by MindGlide across FLAIR, PD, T1, and T2 contrasts (resolution: 1 × 1 × 3 mm) for primary progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) cohorts, stratified by treatment allocation. Notably, treatment cohorts exhibited a reduction in lesion volume accrual compared to placebo across all contrasts. B Depicts the annualized rate of cortical grey matter (CGM) atrophy. MindGlide successfully differentiated between treatment and placebo groups, demonstrating reduced cortical atrophy across all MRI contrasts in treated patients. This is also the case for atrophy rates in deep grey matter (DGM) as seen in (C). There are no FLAIR and PD contrasts available for the SPMS cohort. D Shows inter-contrast consistency for percentage brain volume changes (PBVC): High intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for percent brain volume change (PBVC) across different MRI contrasts within the PPMS dataset (2D), indicating high inter-contrast consistency. This underscores the segmentation tool's robustness and consistency in detecting neurodegenerative changes across various imaging contrasts. In the SPMS dataset we compared PBVC of 2D-T1 images and 2D-T2 images with an ICC-coefficient of 0.81 [95% CI 0.73–0.87]. PPMS: N = 680, SPMS: N = 130. All boxes in (A–D) display medians and 95% CI.

As Fig. 4 shows, MindGlide-derived lesion volumes in the T2 scans of the routine-care paediatric cohort increased by 0.612 ml/year in the moderate-efficacy treatment group (P < 0.001), while remaining stable in the high-efficacy treatment group (model-estimated average −0.376 ml/year, P = 0.230). FLAIR lesion volumes were stable in both groups: −0.063 ml/year in the high-efficacy group (P = 0.824) vs 0.009 ml/year in the moderate efficacy group (P = 0.966). T1-weighted hypointense lesion volumes remained stable in the high-efficacy group (model-estimated average 0.165 ml/year, P = 0.611) but increased by 0.647 ml/year in the moderate-efficacy group (P = 0.001).

Figure 5 illustrates example segmentations across different contrasts and Table 2 shows the treatment effects in the two clinical trials. In the SPMS trial (simvastatin vs. placebo), MindGlide showed a significantly slower rate of cortical GM volume loss in the treatment group than placebo using MRI contrasts previously unused for this purpose such as T2-weighted MRI. This effect was consistent across both T2-weighted (−0.704 mL/year (95% CI [−1.254–0.155]) vs. −1.792 mL/year (95% CI [−2.089–−1.495]), P = 0.008) and 3D T1-weighted MRI (−1.630 mL/year (95% CI [−2.283–−0.976]) vs. −2.912 mL/year (95% CI [−3.266–−2.558]), P = 0.009). The DGM had a slower rate of loss in the treatment group compared to placebo for both T2-weighted (−0.102 ml/year (95% CI [−0.155–−0.048]) vs. −0.205 ml/year (95% CI [−0.234–−0.176]), P = 0.009) and 3D T1-weighted contrasts (−0.105 ml/year (95% CI [−0.159–−0.050]) vs. −0.234 ml/year (95% CI [−0.263–−0.204]), P = 0.001).

The figure shows separate segmentations by the MindGlide model on 2D T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR and PD contrasts in the PPMS trial. The top row shows the unprocessed (“raw”) scans, and the bottom row shows labels or segmentations corresponding to anatomical regions, in addition to white matter hyperintensities (or hypo-intensities in the case of T1-weighted contrast).

In the PPMS trial (ocrelizumab vs. placebo), MindGlide consistently showed a slower rate of cortical GM volume loss in the treatment group across T2-weighted (−1.638 ml/year (95% CI [−1.820–−1.457]) vs. −2.335 ml/year (95% CI [−2.606–−2.065]), P < 0.001), T2-FLAIR (−1.778 ml/year (95% CI [−2.033–−1.524]) vs. −2.342 ml/year (95% CI [−2.722–−1.963]), P = 0.016), and PD contrast (−1.683 ml/year (95% CI [−1.980–−1.386]) vs. −2.310 ml/year (95% CI [−2.752–−1.868]), P = 0.021), with a similar trend in 2D T1-weighted contrast (−2.183 ml/year (95% CI [−2.363–−2.002]) vs. −2.485 ml/year (95% CI [−2.753–−2.217]), P = 0.06).

Regarding deep GM volume loss, there was no significant difference between groups using T2-weighted MRI (−0.172 ml/year (95% CI [−0.203–−0.141]) vs. −0.143 ml/year (95% CI [[−0.164–−0.123]), P = 0.130). However, analysis with FLAIR (0.200 ml/year (95% CI [−0.234–−0.167]) vs. 0.156 ml/year (95% CI [−0.178–−0.133]), P = 0.028), PD (0.220 ml/year (95% CI [−0.255–−0.186]) vs. 0.144 ml/year (95% CI [−0.167–−0.121]), P < 0.001), and 2D T1-weighted images (0.212 ml/year (95% CI [−0.245–−0.179]) vs. 0.172 ml/year (95% CI [−0.194–−0.150]), P = 0.049) consistently showed slower loss rates in the treatment group.

In the routine-care paediatric cohort, we observed cortical GM loss across all MRI contrasts with MindGlide segmentations in both treatment groups. T1 scans showed a loss of 5.807 ml/year (95% CI [−8.013–−3.601], P < 0.001) in the moderate-efficacy group and 3.736 ml/year (95% CI [−7.423–−0.048], P = 0.049) in the high-efficacy group. T2-weighted images revealed a loss of 3.66 ml/year (95% CI [−4.401–−2.919], P < 0.001) and 2.102 ml/year (95% CI [−4.353–0.150], P = 0.068) respectively, while FLAIR scans showed a loss of 3.516 ml/year (95% CI [−5.626–−1.405], P = 0.001) and 4.19 ml/year (95% CI [−7.057–−1.322], P = 0.005).

Regarding deep GM, T1 contrast showed stable volume in the high efficacy group (-0.086 ml/year, (95% CI [−0.368–0.197], P = 0.552)) but a loss of 0.301 ml/year (95% CI [−0.474–−0.128], P = 0.001) in the moderate efficacy group. T2 images showed no change in the high efficacy group (−0.163 ml/year (95% CI [−0.416–0.090], P = 0.207)) but a loss of 0.32 ml/year (95% CI [−0.403–−0.236], P < 0.001) in the moderate efficacy group. FLAIR scans revealed a loss of 0.22 ml/year (95% CI [−0.421–−0.018], P = 0.034) and 0.399 ml/year (95% CI [−0.548–−0.250], P < 0.001) in the high and moderate efficacy groups, respectively.

In the power analysis single-contrast sample sizes were feasible for some, but not all, of the acquisitions. For example, for the PPMS group using only T2-weighted contrast and hyperintense lesion accrual as the primary outcome the sample size was 94, and for the cortical GM as the primary outcome a sample of 420 patients was required to achieve 80% statistical power. Supplementary Table 5 shows the complete sample size results.

In our analysis, MindGlide-derived lesion volumes demonstrated a treatment effect of 5.31% (95% CI [4.50–6.12%], P < 0.001) difference between treatment groups in FLAIR images and 4.62% (95% CI [3.88–5.37%], P < 0.001) in T2 images (Fig. 6). This closely aligns with ground truth values, which indicated a 4.63% (95% CI [3.73–5.54%], P < 0.001) difference between treatment groups. In contrast, longitudinal SAMSEG overestimated the treatment effect, showing a 10.70% (95% CI [3.42–17.98%], P = 0.004) difference for FLAIR images and 8.81% (95% CI [3.64–13.97%], P = 0.001) for T2 images, while WMH-Synthseg underestimated the effect with only a 2.56% (95% CI [1.64–3.47%], P < 0.001) difference in FLAIR images and 2.45% (95% CI [1.69–3.22%], P < 0.001) in T2 images. Additionally, longitudinal SAMSEG exhibited a broader spread in lesion changes across both T2 and FLAIR images compared to MindGlide-derived volumes, suggesting a higher precision in MindGlide's lesion volume estimation.

This figure compares derived percentage volume changes per year of MindGlide, longitudinal SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg for lesion volume, CGM and DGM separated by treatment groups. We used the PPMS clinical trial for this comparison because it was the largest of our datasets and the only one that includes manually segmented lesion volumes by expert neuroradiologists which we used as ground truth. The effect size calculated using MindGlide-derived lesion volume changes is closest to the ground truth. WMH-Synthseg-derived lesion volume change in the placebo group is closest to the ground truth for both FLAIR and T2 images. Ground truth lesion accrual rate was −1.304% per annum in the treatment group and 3.33% per annum in the placebo group. For FLAIR images, MindGlide detected a lesion accrual rate of 0.64% per annum in the treatment group and 5.95% in the placebo group, compared to 1.863% and 12.566% for longitudinal SAMSEG and 0.56% and 3.11% for WMH-Synthseg. With T2 images, MindGlide showed lesion accrual rates of 2.151% and 6.775% for treatment and placebo groups, while longitudinal SAMSEG showed 4.47% and 13.277% and WMH-Synthseg showed 0.359% and 2.813% respectively. The differences between the three tools in measuring CGM and DGM changes are minor compared to lesion volume changes except for the CGM estimates of longitudinal SAMSEG. Here, especially in T2 images, longitudinal SAMSEG estimates more atrophy in the treatment group (−0.418% p.a.) than in the placebo group (−0.334% p.a.), although these differences are not significant (p = 0.291) PPMS dataset.

As Fig. 6 shows, in assessing regional brain volumes, MindGlide-derived measurements demonstrated greater treatment effects between treatment groups compared to those obtained from longitudinal SAMSEG or WMH-Synthseg. Specifically, MindGlide-derived CGM volume changes revealed a 0.14% (95% CI 0.04–0.24%], P = 0.006) difference between treatment groups for FLAIR images and a 0.16% (95% CI 0.09–0.23%], P < 0.001) difference for T2 images. In comparison, longitudinal SAMSEG-derived CGM volume changes indicated a 0.04% (95% CI −0.18–0.24%], P = 0.744) difference for FLAIR images and 0.08% (95% CI −0.07–0.24%], P = 0.288) for T2 images, while WMH-Synthseg-derived CGM volume changes exhibited a 0.11% (95% CI 0.02–0.19%], P = 0.014) difference for FLAIR images and a 0.12% (95% CI 0.05–0.2%], P = 0.002) difference for T2 images. For deep grey matter, all three tools reported similar treatment effects. MindGlide estimated a treatment effect of 0.15% (95% CI 0.03–0.27%], P = 0.015) for FLAIR images and 0.10% (95% CI −0.01–0.21%], P = 0.078) for T2 images, while longitudinal SAMSEG estimated 0.16% (95% CI −0.04–0.36%], P = 0.124) for FLAIR images and 0.03% (95% CI −0.07–0.12%], P = 0.602) for T2 images, and WMH-Synthseg reported a treatment effect of 0.16% (95% CI 0.03–0.29%], P = 0.019) for FLAIR images and 0.14% (95% CI 0.03–0.24%], P = 0.010) for T2 images.

WMH-Synthseg performed better than both SAMSEG and longitudinal SAMSEG on in the PPMS dataset. Therefore, we only used WMH-Synthseg as a comparator to MindGlide for our analysis of the routine-care clinical dataset. We visually inspected WMH-Synthseg and MindGlide in our routine-care clinical dataset to assess gross segmentation failures, which included 433 baseline contrasts from 161 patients. WMH-Synthseg demonstrated a significant failure rate, particularly in scans exceeding a thickness of 5 mm. Out of the 433 contrasts that we visually assessed, WMH-Synthseg failed to segment 65 (15%) of the scans, whereas MindGlide exhibited a markedly lower failure rate of only 6 (1%). Of the 6 instances where MindGlide was unable to successfully segment the scans, only one was successfully processed by WMH-Synthseg; the remaining five failed with both methods. Figure 7a shows one example where both, MindGlide and WMH-Synthseg successfully segmented a clinical trial scan. Figure 7b shows a scan from our routine-care clinical dataset with a slice thickness of 7 mm, where WMH-Synthseg's segmentation failed.

Examples of segmentation masks acquired using MindGlide and WMH-Synthseg. a Segmentation masks of a scan from our PPMS trial dataset with the segmentation mask acquired using MindGlide on top and the segmentation mask acquired using WMH-Synthseg on the bottom. Areas labelled as lesion are more conservative defined in the MindGlide segmentation mask (olive colour) than in the WMH-Synthseg segmentation mask (black). The red arrow points at an area that is incorrectly defined as lesion by WMH-Synthseg segmentation but not by MindGlide. b Segmentation masks of a scan from our routine clinical dataset (RRMS) with the segmentation mask acquired using MindGlide on top and the segmentation mask acquired using WMH-Synthseg on the bottom. WMH-Synthseg fails to segment an image acquired in anterior-posterior direction with 6 mm thick slices (as seen in the frontal area of the transverse view and multiple areas of the coronal view in (b)). Most segmentation tools are designed to use superior-inferior acquisition directions (as in (a)), while MindGlide allows segmentation of images acquired in any direction.

Figure 8 shows MindGlide segmentation's strong agreement (except for one region) across MRI contrasts (T1, T2, T2-FLAIR, PD) of the same brain in 19 regions. ICC values for brain regions ranged from 0.85 to 0.98, except for the optic chiasm (ICC 0.59). MS lesions demonstrated an ICC of 0.95 (95% CI [0.93, 0.95]) across contrasts. We used our PPMS dataset for this analysis.

Consistency of segmented regions or labels across multiple MRI contrasts measured by the intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs). On the left, coloured brain maps depict all 19 brain region labels: CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid), 3rd and 4th Ventricle, DGM (Deep Grey Matter), Pons, Brainstem, Cerebellar GM (Grey Matter), Temporal Lobe, Lateral Ventricle Frontal Horn, Lateral Ventricle, Ventral DC (Diencephalon), Optic Chiasm, Cerebellar Vermis, Corpus Callosum, Cerebral WM (White Matter), Frontal Lobe GM, Limbic Cortex GM, Parietal Lobe GM, and Occipital Lobe GM, along with MS (Multiple Sclerosis) Lesions. The right side presents ICC values ranging from 0 to 1 for these regions, providing a quantitative measure of the consistency across multiple MRI contrasts. Higher ICC values indicate greater consistency in the measurement of a particular brain region. Dots represent median intraclass Correlation Coefficient and error bars display 95% confidence intervals. A vertical dashed line marks the median intraclass Correlation Coefficient across all regions. PPMS dataset, baseline images, N = 699. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In our SPMS dataset (the only cohort with both 2D and 3D T1-weighted acquisitions) we analysed consistency between MindGlide-derived volumes from 3D-T1 scans (1 ×1 × 1 mm) vs 2D-T1 scans (1 × 1 × 3 mm). The intraclass correlation coefficients or ICC were 0.929 for lesion, 0.918 for CGM and 0.943 for DGM. We visualised this correlation using a scatter plot in Supplementary Fig. 1.

We evaluated the inter-contrast agreement of longitudinal total brain volume changes. In the PPMS dataset, T1 vs. FLAIR showed an ICC of 0.91 (95% CI [0.88, 0.93]), T1 vs PD had an ICC of 0.916 (95% CI [0.90, 0.93]) and for T1 vs. T2 we calculated an ICC of 0.93 (95% CI [0.91, 0.94]). In the SPMS dataset, the ICC between T1 and T2 was 0.81 (95% CI [0.73, 0.87]). All the images used for this analysis were 2D.

For the deep grey matter in the SPMS dataset (which had both 2D and 3D T1 scans as well as 2D T2 scans), the annual rate of percentage volume loss across both treatment groups was 0.521% [0.346–0.696] for 3D-T1 acquisition, 0.513% [95% CI: 0.308–0.718] for 2D-T1 and 0.474% [95% CI: 0.301–0.645] for 2D-T2 acquisition. The annual rate of percentage volume loss in the cortical grey matter was 0.462% [95% CI: 0.318–0.606] for 3D-T1 acquisition, 0.295% [95% CI: 0.165–0.425] for 2D-T1 and 0.256% [95% CI: 0.139–0.377] for 2D-T2 acquisition. Without ground truth available, we assessed the relative sensitivity loss of the 2D approach compared to the 3D approach. Comparing 3D-T1 and 2D-T1, 2D-T1 showed a 1.54% lower volume loss rate than 3D-T1 for deep grey matter and 36.15% for cortical grey matter. The 2D-T2 acquisition showed a 9.02% lower volume loss rate for deep grey matter than 3D-T1. The sensitivity loss was more pronounced in cortical grey matter, where 2D-T2 detected 44.59% less volume loss than 3D-T1. Comparing 2D-T1 and 2D-T2, 2D-T2 showed a 7.60% lower volume loss rate than 2D-T1 for deep grey matter and 13.22% for cortical grey matter.

Our work establishes the capability to extract multiple clinically relevant MRI biomarkers from a single MRI contrast. MindGlide demonstrates superior performance in multiple key areas compared to state-of-the-art: it more closely aligned with ground truth lesion segmentation, significantly outperformed existing tools in processing routine-care clinical scans (99% success rate vs 85% for WMH-SynthSeg), and showed enhanced sensitivity in detecting cortical grey matter changes, while it performed similarly in deep grey matter segmentation. Furthermore, it captured treatment effects on disease activity (as shown by lesion accrual) and neurodegeneration (as shown by cortical and deep grey matter tissue losses) in clinical trials and routine care hospital settings across a wide age range of trials and hospital settings. This tool significantly streamlines analysis and will enable large-scale research using diverse and often incomplete clinical MRI datasets – an advantage for routine-care studies looking at archival data. Below we will first discuss a comparison of MindGlide with state-of-the-art software (SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg) looking at segmentation metrics, treatment effects and clinical correlation. We then discuss MindGlide's consistency across MRI contrasts and highlight the differences between clinical trial scans and routine-care scans.

Our results demonstrate that clinically meaningful tissue segmentation and lesion quantification are achievable even with limited MRI data and single contrasts not typically used for these tasks (e.g., T2-weighted MRI without FLAIR). We established the validity and reliability of these findings both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We compare MindGlide to two state-of-the-art methods: an established contrast-agnostic segmentation method (SAMSEG4) and a recently published segmentation method (WMH-Synthseg7) that was based on a previous model called SynthSeg1,2,3. MindGlide performed best in lesion load estimation, dice score and sensitivity (Fig. 2a, b). Treatment effects on lesion volume detected by MindGlide were larger in magnitude than those detected by WMH-Synthseg. When looking at the results of MindGlide and state-of-the-art approaches, MindGlide-derived lesion volumes demonstrated a treatment effect more closely aligned with ground truth values, than SAMSEG, which overestimated, and WMH-Synthseg, which underestimated the treatment effect. While ground truth comparisons were not feasible for regional brain volumes due to the impracticality of manual segmentation of these regions, we were able to compare the relative performance of SAMSEG, WMH-Synthseg and MindGlide in detecting volumetric changes between treatment groups. MindGlide revealed larger differences in regional brain volume changes between treatment groups compared to the other tools, indicating enhanced sensitivity in detecting subtle changes. Overall, these results support MindGlide as a suitable tool for measuring treatment effects in clinical trials.

At baseline, volumetric measurements extracted using our method showed on average higher correlation with EDSS than SAMSEG or WMH-Synthseg. In our study, WMH-Synthseg, despite having lower dice coefficients compared to SAMSEG, demonstrated a stronger correlation with EDSS. This can be attributed to the relationship between lesion volume and EDSS. WMH-Synthseg tends to estimate lesion volumes closer to those derived from MindGlide and ground truth than those from SAMSEG. The lower dice score of WMH-Synthseg suggests limited spatial overlap, which is a result of both high false positives and high false negatives, indicating a poor performance in spatial accuracy. Conversely, SAMSEG's higher precision and lower sensitivity led to fewer false positives and a lower dice score. This analysis underscores the limitations of using dice scores as the sole metric for evaluating segmentation tools, which is why we combined various metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of segmentation performance.

Overall, segmenting different structures was highly consistent except for optic chiasm, which had moderate consistency (ICC of 0.59). This can be explained by the smaller size of the optic chiasm compared to all other MindGlide labels. A single voxel discrepancy within this region wields a proportionately larger impact on the ICC, magnifying the effect of any spatial variations. Furthermore, its close encirclement by cerebrospinal fluid can obscure the chiasm's boundaries in imaging contrasts, reducing the dice score25. The intra-class correlation analysis across different MRI contrasts demonstrated the consistency and reliability of percentage brain volume change measurements or PBVC obtained by MindGlide, although ICC across contrasts was higher in the PPMS dataset than in the SPMS dataset.

While our proposed model demonstrates an advantage over state-of-the-art models trained on smaller cohorts of MS patients, it is important to recognise that these improvements may not be as pronounced when analysing clinical trial scans, which often feature controlled conditions and high-quality imaging. However, the benefits of our model become significantly more evident in the context of routine-care scans, where variability in image acquisition and image resolution can pose substantial challenges. In these cases, our model's enhancements lead to dramatic improvements in lesion segmentation and analysis, thereby offering valuable insights into real-world clinical scenarios.

As expected, there was lost sensitivity in detecting volume changes between two and three-dimensional scans. Comparing 3D-T1 scans with 2D-T2 and 2D-T1 acquisitions revealed a differential impact on sensitivity. In deep grey matter there was only a 2% reduction in detecting atrophy using 2D-T1 and 9% reduction using 2D-T2 acquisitions. In cortical grey matter the reduction in detecting atrophy were 36% using 2D-T1 and 45% using 2D-T2 acquisitions. The comparison between 2D-T1 and 2D-T2 scans showed stability, with 2D-T2 resulting in an 8% lower volume loss rate for deep grey matter and a 13% lower rate for cortical grey matter. These findings will pave the way to incorporate fewer contrasts of the same resolution in MRI protocols, maintaining sensitivity while optimising efficiency, whilst 3D acquisitions are still needed for more detailed analysis.

Our work contributes to the evolution of MRI processing tools that streamline previously time-consuming pipelines. Running the model on consumer-grade graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware took on average, 37 s (see Supplementary Material). Efficiency is especially valuable for MS MRIs, where multimodal imaging is traditionally used to extract biomarkers. The typical workflow has involved intensity inhomogeneity correction26, followed by automatic segmentation of white matter lesions using T2-FLAIR and three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. To mitigate the misclassification of hypointense lesions as grey matter (which share a similar intensity profile), anatomical T1-weighted MRIs may undergo lesion filling after affine registration with T2-FLAIR images27. Subsequently, hand-labelled T1-weighted MRIs (known as atlases) are non-linearly registered to the patient's T1-weighted MRI28,29. Labels from the co-registered atlases are then fused using various fusion algorithms, followed by probabilistic segmentation to differentiate tissue classes (white matter, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid)30. Moving towards newer deep-learning-based pipelines allows fast turnaround times for automatic MRI analysis and real-world implementations.

Our study benefits from a large sample size for model training and external validation. Importantly, our findings generalised across datasets and MRI contrasts. Our training used only FLAIR and T1 images, yet the model successfully processed new contrasts (like PD and T2) from different scanners and periods encountered during external validation. This success is due to the domain randomisation during synthetic data generation (or augmentation), enabling cross-contrast generalisation as has been shown before1,7. It is important to note that MindGlide, like WMH-Synthseg, is a 3D convolutional neural network with the same core architecture. The varying performances in segmenting lesions and detecting treatment effects on grey matter structures are due to the diversity of data used to train these models. We used a combination of real and synthetic scans, while previous studies used synthetic or real scans (but not both). The effect of data diversity is well-known in the machine learning community31. However, quantifying improvements caused by using various training regimes with real and synthetic data needs further work and was out of the scope of our study.

While we found high ICC values across all segmented brain structures, interpreting the ICC values for MS lesions is complex. We analysed the ICC across different MRI contrasts, including FLAIR, T2, T1, and PD. We analysed the ICC across different MRI sequences during external validation, including FLAIR, T2, T1, and PD. While the MindGlide model was trained on both T1 and FLAIR images, the lesions used for training came from the FLAIR contrast, but the domain randomisation enabled the model to generalise to unseen contrasts. While improving generalisability, this approach blurs pathological specificity and is a limitation of our contrast-agnostic approach. T1 hypointensities are pathologically distinct from FLAIR hyperintensities32. Therefore, while the ICC values provide an essential insight into the tool's reliability, the difference in pathophysiological representation between contrasts necessitates a careful approach to interpreting these results. For example, chronic T1 hypo-intensities, often called “black holes,” indicate MS lesions characterised by axonal loss and tissue destruction33. The ICC values obtained for MS lesions must, therefore, be considered within the context of these different imaging signatures. A high ICC value might suggest that while the segmentation tool is consistent across contrasts, it may not fully distinguish the complex nature of lesion pathology that varies between T1 and T2/FLAIR contrasts. Nonetheless, as explained above, this approach enables using data to enable a new avenue of research on archival real-world, data.

In our mixed-effects models for estimating treatment effects, we included intracranial volume (ICV) as an extra covariate to account for individual differences at baseline and growth trajectories observed in a paediatric cohort34,35,36,37. While using the volume-to-ICV ratio as a dependent variable could yield comparable results, our approach maintains the original volume scale, enhancing interpretability and clinical relevance across diverse age groups. The analysis of our routine-care paediatric dataset reveals significant variability in imaging acquisitions, which poses challenges for comparing volume changes across different contrasts. With a heterogeneous range of slice thicknesses and incomplete data for some patients—where only certain contrasts were acquired—our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding treatment effects is limited. Additionally, as is the case for any observational cohort, treatment effect estimation and causal conclusions are extremely challenging. For example, we observed an average reduction for patients on moderate-efficacy group (although not statistically significant) using FLAIR images but significant increase in T2-weighted MRI lesions. Despite this wide variability in absolute values, the relative difference between treatment groups was statistically significant and relatively stable across comparisons and brain regions. These results show that MindGlide can enable quantitative insights from highly variable image acquisitions which were previously unanalysable.

Our study has several limitations. The primary limitation is reduced sensitivity in detecting treatment effects using 2D versus 3D scans. While MindGlide showed strong agreement (ICC) across both scan types in the SPMS dataset, the lower resolution of 2D images affects segmentation performance significantly. This can limit detection of small lesions and subtle volume changes, particularly in longitudinal studies tracking tissue changes and volumetric assessments of deep and cortical grey matter. Although 2D scans are more clinically accessible, 3D imaging remains optimal for detailed segmentation. However, our findings suggest that fewer imaging contrasts may suffice for accurate lesion and atrophy detection, potentially reducing scan time and improving resource efficiency in clinical care and research. Additionally, our current implementation is restricted to brain scans. Spinal cord MRI is also widely available in routine care setting and is strongly associated with disability. Future work should expand our approach to the entire central nervous system. We chose the number of labels or segmentations to be 19 by merging smaller labels from the atlas to ensure efficiency and lower computational expense during inference time with a view for implementation within under-resourced research settings (e.g., non-research hospitals). Therefore, current implementation is not intended for detailed segmentations (for example a thalamic volume instead of deep grey matter volume) of brain structures.

In conclusion, we developed and validated a contrast-agnostic deep learning model that can quantify MRI biomarkers from routine care and clinical trial datasets from varying single MRI input contrasts.

This study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board under the auspices of the International Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Alliance (www.progressivemsalliance.org) at the Montreal Neurological Institute, Canada (IRB00010120) and by the Great Ormond Street Hospital Research and Development Department (reference: 16NC10). Written informed consent was acquired from participants during data acquisition for clinical trials. For routine care MRI scans, consent was waived for processing anonymised data.

For training our model we sampled the training data from the International Progressive MS Alliance data repository at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Supplementary Table 1 lists the trials included in the Progressive MS Alliance data repository and Table 1 summarises the patient characteristics of our training and validation datasets. For validation we used 5 different datasets unseen during training. These datasets are from the MS-STAT trial24, ORATORIO trial20, a routine-care dataset of paediatric relapsing-remitting MS patients and two open source datasets38,39.

Figure 1 illustrates our training and external validation strategy and the associated steps. We developed MindGlide, using “nnU-Net”, a 3D CNN building on the widespread U-Net architecture40. nnU-Net yields state-of-the-art results (e.g., it has won several recent challenges6,41) while featuring automatic self-configuration, thus bypassing the costly hyperparameter tuning procedure. We trained MindGlide to simultaneously segment brain grey and white matter regions and MS lesions, accommodating real-world MRI variations and artefacts that often hinder traditional image processing software. Our primary goal was to ensure generalisation across MRI contrasts with minimal or no pre-processing at inference, even for contrasts unseen during training (for example, for PD and T2-weighted that were not in our training data). This aligns with successful approaches in other brain imaging studies1,2.

Supervised models like MindGlide require large, accurately labelled datasets for robust performance. Manually creating such labels, considered the ‘gold standard', is time-consuming and impractical for diverse real-world data, especially when the lower quality of scans hinders manual labelling. We used existing segmentations from our datasets of phase two and three clinical trials previously published42 with Geodesic Information Flows software (GIF v3.0) as explained in our previous publication43, with additional manual quality control. These labels, derived from the Neuromorphometrics atlas (http://neuromorphometrics.com), were grouped into 18 regions (Supplementary Table 3). To reduce the number of labels and make MindGlide more comparable to other brain image segmentation tools we performed this label grouping according to the hierarchical model of the Mindboggle project (https://mindboggle.info/braincolor). We used a validated lesion segmentation model (a convolutional neural network)42,44, to generate lesion masks, creating a single file with 20 labels (18 brain regions, one lesion, one background) for training. For feasibility, we employed existing expert-labelled ‘ground truth' lesion segmentation data for external validation in fewer individuals, as described below.

We employed a minimal pre-processing pipeline. We first standardised image resolutions to 1.0 mm isotropic voxels, per the nnU-Net design6,41. We then extracted 128 × 128 × 64 voxel patches using a sliding window technique, to optimise memory and computational efficiency during training. While we used data augmentation during training (see below), no further pre-processing was performed at inference.

Data augmentation artificially expands training data diversity through random modification, enhancing model generalizability and mitigating overfitting. To minimise post-training pre-processing and broaden MindGlide's adaptability, we used two techniques: (1) distorting real scans in their geometry and image intensities and (2) generating synthetic ones. Synthetic data generation offers greater flexibility than mere distortion. We employed domain randomisation (Fig. 1a), resulting in intensity variations that prepared the model for diverse MRI contrasts. As shown in Fig. 1d, we performed image augmentation with T1-weighted and FLAIR scans during training.

We used SynthSeg version 2.0 for synthetic data generation and MONAI version 1.2.0 for augmentation during training1,3,5,45. We generated synthetic scans of varying contrasts directly from the training dataset's labels (units are as defined by the software)3:

Left-right flipping (0.5 probability).

Scaling (uniform distribution, bounds: 0.85–1.15).

Rotation (uniform distribution, bounds: −15–15 degrees).

Elastic deformation (scale: 0.04, standard deviation: 1).

Bias field corruption (scale: 0.25, standard deviation: 0.5).

Random low-resolution resampling (uniform distribution, 1–9 mm per dimension).

Domain randomisation3 (varying voxel intensities of synthetic scans per tissue class)

Figure 1a illustrates examples of the synthetic data generated. The model architecture, detailed in the Supplementary Material (Model Architecture), has one input channel (receiving a single MR contrast) and 20 output channels (generating 20 labels).

We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to assess MindGlide's performance for its validation and reliability in unseen cohorts.

We used the first available visit in each of the longitudinal datasets for cross sectional analysis. This involved clinical validation by correlating segmented structure and lesion volumes with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, comparing MindGlide, SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg results4,7. We chose SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg because they are both recently introduced models, publicly available, as part of Freesurfer, and are among the few models that can segment multiple different contrasts46,47.

Regarding comparison across MRI contrasts, we used intra-class correlation analysis. Segmentation Consistency across Contrasts: In the PPMS trial, the only dataset with PD, T2, T1, and FLAIR contrasts, we assessed the agreement of segmentations for the same brain structures across these contrasts. We used a hierarchical intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to account for the fact that these measurements were taken from the same individuals, which introduces inherent correlation (ICC 3). Only in the SPMS trial, both 3D-T1 and 2D-T1 imaging data was available, and we used these scans to calculate ICC between different resolutions.

We evaluated MindGlide's ability to detect known treatment effects by analysing data from two successful clinical trials: MS-STAT24 (placebo vs. simvastatin in secondary progressive MS) and ORATORIO20 (ocrelizumab vs. placebo in primary progressive MS). Our aim was to demonstrate the capability of MindGlide in detecting known treatment effects using MRI contrasts that have never been used for this purpose (e.g., 2D T2-weighted MRI). We calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for percentage brain volume change with MindGlide segmentations and SIENA algorithm48 (PBVC), a key trial outcome measure, across MRI contrasts (FLAIR, T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and PD in the PPMS trial and T1 and T2-weighted MRI in the SPMS trial). For longitudinal software comparison, in the PPMS trial, we calculated treatment effects using WMH-Synthseg and MindGlide only without SAMSEG, because WMH-Synthseg showed better performance in cross-sectional comparisons with SAMSEG.

Additionally, we used a routine-care dataset of paediatric relapsing-remitting MS patients from three UK hospitals (Great Ormond Street Hospital, Evelina London Children's Hospital and Birmingham Children's Hospital) to study the longitudinal evolution of lesions and brain structures based on available MRI contrasts (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR). We excluded scans from participants whose FLAIR image slice thickness differed by more than a factor of three across follow-up scans. We did not exclude T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRIs because their slice thicknesses varied by less than a factor of three across visits. We categorised patients as receiving high-efficacy (ocrelizumab, natalizumab, rituximab or cladribine) and moderate efficacy treatments (interferon betas, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide)49,50.

We performed a power analysis based on MindGlide-derived treatment effects for each contrast to estimate the sample sizes required for a hypothetical clinical trial designed to detect treatment effects using MindGlide on only a single MRI contrast. We used the R pwr library for this analysis.

Lesion Segmentation across Software: We compared lesion segmentations produced by MindGlide, SAMSEG and WMH-Synthseg against ground truth labels (hand-labelled segmentations). We used the same ICC analysis as explained in the cross-sectional analysis above. We measured longitudinal reliability using the ISBI dataset, calculating ICC between raters and MindGlide. See Supplementary Material for details.

Manual lesion segmentation by expert neuroradiologists is considered the gold standard in MS. We used two open-source lesion segmentation datasets (called MS-30 and ISBI)38,39 and assessed cross-sectional performance against manual lesion segmentations (consensus in MS-30, expert rater in ISBI) using lesion volume and voxel-wise spatial metrics (e.g., Dice score, a standard metric for image segmentation overlap). Cross-sectionally, we assessed lesion load and voxel-wise spatial metrics on 50 FLAIR images from 35 patients, and longitudinally, we calculated the intraclass coefficient (ICC) between raters and MindGlide on the ISBI dataset. For more details, please refer to the Supplementary Material.

We used R version 4.3.0 for all analyses. In cross-sectional analysis, we assessed correlations between segmented brain volumes and EDSS using Spearman's rank correlation and Fisher Z scores because EDSS is an ordinal variable.

We used linear mixed-effects models to estimate treatment effects. Each regional volume or lesion load was the dependent variable in a separate model. Fixed independent variables included time, treatment group, their interaction (time x treatment group), and intracerebral volume (ICV). Random effects, nested by visit within participant ID, accounted for repeated measures and within-participant variability. We did not adjust for other variables because the comparisons were made in data from randomised controlled trials in treatment and control arms. In the real-world data we did not adjust for age (all participants were in their adolescence) and used the same fixed independent variables and random effects. In real-world paediatric dataset, we did not perform a head-to-head comparison of moderate versus high efficacy treatment because participants were not randomised and the small number of children with MS did not allow for causal modelling.

We performed ICC with the Pengouin statistical package for Python 3. We used ICC3 because we had a fixed set of “raters” (segmentation of the same structures by different software [MindGlide vs SAMSEG vs WMH-Synthseg] or from different contrasts).

Obesity-Drug Pioneers and Large Hadron Collider Physicists win $3-Million Breakthrough Prizes



Advances recognized by science's most lucrative awards include high-energy physics experiments and groundbreaking weight-loss treatments

By Zeeya Merali & Nature magazine 

The Breakthrough prize trophy's design is inspired by imagery from science, including black holes, seashells and the structure of DNA.

Breakthrough Prize

Five scientists who contributed to the development of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have picked up one of this year's US$3-million Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science.

Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that controls blood sugar levels and helps to curb appetite. “This class of drugs truly saves lives, changes lives and brings joy back to people's lives,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, a physician-scientist at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who recently led a massive study analysing data from almost two million people to evaluate the effects of such medication.

This life-sciences prize is shared between the four researchers who discovered and characterized GLP-1 – endocrinologist Daniel Drucker at the University of Toronto, Canada; physician-researchers Joel Habener at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts and Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen; and chemist Svetlana Mojsov at The Rockefeller University in New York City — along with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark, who spearheaded the development of drugs based on these discoveries.

In the 1990s, Drucker and his colleagues realized that GLP-1 caused animals to eat less and lose weight. Knudsen stablized the drug by adding fatty-acid chains, enabling it to bind to proteins in the blood, which prevents it from breaking down rapidly once injected. “It's a tremendous honour to receive this prestigious award,” says Drucker. “But the most amazing gratification is when someone comes to my office and says, ‘I lost 40 pounds [18 kg] and I feel healthy'.”

The award is one of six Breakthrough prizes to be awarded this year in life sciences, physics and mathematics.

Unusually for a major award, one of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to a grand total of 13,508 physicists spanning four collaborations at CERN, Europe's particle physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland. Through experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these researchers have taken multiple precision measurements over the past decade to probe, and so far confirm, the standard model of particle physics. “We're honoured the award was made to the entire collaboration because without all those people we could not have made these advances,” says Patricia McBride, a spokesperson for CERN's CMS collaboration. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit CERN, she adds.

The award is well deserved, says Brian Rebel, a particle physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Finding the Higgs [boson] in 2012 was a once-in-lifetime event, but it was only the first step,” Rebel says. Since then, LHC scientists have been pinning down the mass of the Higgs and its interactions, as well as discovering 72 new particles, investigating antimatter and probing the nature of the ‘quark–gluon plasma' that existed soon after the Big Bang. “It takes a small army to create the tools to test and validate these results,” says Rebel.

Another Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to one of the architects of the standard model, theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who also won a share of the 1999 Nobel prize in physics for his work on the weak nuclear force, and contributed to understanding the strong nuclear force. “A beautiful synthesis emerges when one's mathematics is linked to particles actually seen in the world,” says 't Hooft, adding that he is “honoured” to win the prize.

The mathematics prize went to Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, for numerous contributions to the development of the Langlands programme — dubbed the ‘grand unified theory of mathematics' because it brings together the disciplines of number theory, geometry and function fields.

And two other prizes in the life sciences were awarded — one shared between neuroscientist Stephen Hauser at the University of California, San Francisco, and epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio at Harvard University, for research on the drivers of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease caused by damage to myelin, the material that surrounds and insulates nerve fibres.

In the 1990s, Hauser and colleagues demonstrated that antibodies produced by the immune system's B cells were likely to be behind the damage4. This initially invited scepticism because it had been assumed that T cells were the culprits, and Hauser recalls being “devastated” at being refused funding because his ideas were deemed “biologically implausible”. “The Breakthrough Prize is recognition of the importance of ‘stick-to-it-ness',” says Hauser. Independently, in 2022, Ascherio and his colleagues definitively established that infection with the Epstein–Barr virus drastically heightens a person's risk of developing MS.

The final life-sciences prize went to David Liu, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for developing technologies that use CRISPR gene-editing to rewrite segments of DNA. His techniques are being employed in clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell leukaemia, sickle-cell disease, β-thalassemia and high cholesterol.

The Breakthrough prizes were founded in 2012 and are sponsored by Yuri Milner, a Russian–Israeli billionaire, and other Internet entrepreneurs, including Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

On Monday, Microsoft reportedly terminated the roles of two software engineers, Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal, who protested the company's reported dealings with the Israeli military during Microsoft's Copilot and 50th anniversary event last week.

According to an internal message viewed by CNBC, Microsoft wrote that Aboussad could have raised concerns “confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.”

Last Friday, during the event, Aboussad shouted that Suleyman had “blood on his hands,” interrupting him while he delivered a keynote about new AI products. Later that day, Agrawal interjected during a panel featuring Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, former CEO Steve Ballmer, and founder Bill Gates, shouting “shame on all of you … Cut ties with Israel.”

Shortly after the incidents, Aboussad sent an email to Microsoft staff and executives claiming the company had silenced certain dissenting employees, according to CNBC. The email reportedly contained a link to a petition from “No Azure for Apartheid,” a group of Microsoft staffers who have made headlines for their protests against the company's work with Israel in the past.

Besides thinking about the ancient Roman Empire all the time, men have also been known to fantasize about bravely fending off a bear attack at any given moment. A contraption in Wyoming could make that dream almost real—and give them some practice at it, too.

Hungry bears with some serious bedhead have begun emerging from their winter hibernation, making unwelcome encounters with humans more likely. To spread awareness about bear safety, Wyoming's Game and Fish Department's very own “Robobear” has also returned: a fake bear on top of a remote-controlled wheeled platform intended to simulate a charging bear. Its aim is to prove that the day a grizzly comes barreling through the trees, many people won't be as prepared as they are in their fantasies—but practice makes perfect.

“It's difficult to know how you will react in a high stress situation. So, planning and practice are critical,” said Maria Davidson, Safari Club International Foundation (SCIF) large carnivore program manager, in a statement by the foundation. SCIF is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of wildlife, and is a partner on the Robobear project, along with other groups.

As reported by the Cowboy State Daily, individuals participating in the training are divided into groups, and each person is given a canister of fake bear spray. One group at a time, the participants are told to face away from the Robobear. The organizer then sends the Robobear charging toward their backs, and calls out a warning. At the sound of the warning, the participants have to turn and spray the predator.

It's harder than it sounds.

“Like an idiot, I kept the holster's Velcro-secured retaining strap over the top of my can,” outdoors reporter Mark Heinz, who participated in the training, wrote for Cowboy State Daily. When Mark Aughton, Game and Fish large carnivore biologist and Bear Wise Wyoming coordinator, gave the warning, “I scrambled helplessly at the strap, developing a severe case of butterfingers in the heat of the moment,” he recounted.

In fact, the point of the training is for individuals to practice accessing and employing their bear spray as quickly as possible. The defense weapon is only useful if it's accessible, Aughton explained, and as quoted by Cowboy State Daily. After all, digging through your giant camping backpack while a grizzly is charging your way at 35 miles per hour (56 kilometers per hour) is probably not the best course of action. Aughton added that bear spray should be kept readily available in a holster, where one can grab it at any moment—and everyone in a group should have one on them.

“Bear spray is an effective deterrent in an aggressive bear encounter,” Wyoming Game and Fish Department bear conflict manager Brian DeBolt said in the SCIF statement. “We hope this effort continues to raise awareness and remind those recreating in bear country to be prepared and stay safe.”

From Chris and Paul Weitz, the minds behind About A Boy and American Pie, comes a new Apple TV+ sci-fi comedy riff on the future of androids in Murderbot. The show starring Alexander Skarsgård adds another cold and ruthless killer to the actor's resume of heartless roles, but with one hiccup. This Murderbot just doesn't get the appeal of its job: to murder. “All it ends up doing is procrastinating,” Skarsgård told Vanity Fair about the concept based on The Murderbot Diaries from author Martha Wells.

“It just doesn't get humans at all,” Skarsgård explained. “It's not a deep hatred, it's just zero amount of curiosity. It's confused by humans and wants to get away from them.”

Which, let's be real, is relatable content if you too get hyper-fixated on the eternal search for meaning. And it's not the first time Skarsgård has portrayed an eternally searching but inhuman character. On HBO's True Blood, the actor played the playfully charming and chilling vampire Eric Northman, who he likened to Murderbot for this reason: “They are observing humanity from a similar distance,”

Recently, Skarsgård made a cameo reprising the role of Eric on What We Do in the Shadows‘ final season. He's so unserious, and poking fun at his heartthrob vampire past is why we love when he plays against type. He continued to compare the two roles.

“Eric used to be human, so in a way he can relate, even though it's been a millennium. But he also finds them incredibly silly and petty and just… insignificant. Murderbot has organic components, so there are human components there. I think it can also understand or feel something. There's something about being an outsider, and observing humanity from a slight distance, and being a bit confused and perplexed by it.”

But the similarities end there. “The big difference is, Eric reveled in being a troublemaker and stirred the pot—while Murderbot is the opposite. Murderbot definitely doesn't want to step into the center of things. Murderbot wants to blend into the background and just be left alone to watch its TV shows.”

Both are still in the package of Alexander Skarsgård so would it be okay if, you know, we got Murderbot in the streets, vampire in the sheets?

Murderbot premieres on Apple TV+ May 16.

The first major frontier of “de-extinction” has just been crossed. Earlier today, the company Colossal Biosciences reported that its scientists have successfully brought back a version of the dire wolf—purportedly the first such resurrection of a previously extinct species.

Colossal announced its seismic accomplishment Monday morning, accompanied by a lengthy cover article in Time magazine. Using a combination of gene-editing and surrogate dogs, the company has reportedly bred three sibling dire wolves since last fall, all of which appear to be healthy so far. The feat follows Colossal's genetic engineering of “woolly mice” and should bode well for their larger resurrection project: bringing back the woolly mammoth.

Dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus) were canines that emerged during the Late Pleistocene, between 129,000 and 11,700 years ago, before becoming extinct around 9,500 years ago. They lived throughout the Americas and likely evolved to hunt down the especially massive megafauna seen during the Ice Age.

One difference from modern canines was their size; on average, they were as big as the largest gray wolves seen today, and with larger and more robust teeth. The general public might be more familiar with them lately thanks to their appearance on the HBO show Game of Thrones, where they were the trusted companions of the Starks.

Colossal's dire wolves are named Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi (the latter a reference to the show). All were born separately to surrogate large hound mixes, with Romulus and Remus born close together in October, and Khaleesi the youngest in the winter. The wolves are reportedly doing well in a 2,000-acre ecological preserve (its location has been kept hidden to protect the animals) and are being carefully and constantly watched by a staff of veterinarians.

“I could not be more proud of the team. This massive milestone is the first of many coming examples demonstrating that our end-to-end de-extinction technology stack works,” said Colossal CEO Ben Lamm in a statement. “Our team took DNA from a 13,000 year old tooth and a 72,000 year old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies. It was once said, ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' Today, our team gets to unveil some of the magic they are working on and its broader impact on conservation.”

To be crystal clear, Colossal's scientists didn't create these so-called dire wolves by directly copying DNA over from ancient samples. Instead, after reconstructing and analyzing the wolves' genomes, they made precise edits to the DNA of existing cells taken from a gray wolf. They made 20 edits in total, 15 of which were intended to make genes resemble the variants found in their dire wolf samples.

It's these variants, the company says, that make dire wolves truly distinct from wolves alive today. Some of these variants, they say, are thought to influence the wolves' size and facial shape. The nucleus of these reconstructed cells was then transplanted into donor egg cells that had their nucleus scooped out, which gave rise to viable embryos that were implanted into surrogate mothers (large hound mixes).

For context, the gray wolf—the closest living relative of the dire wolf—has a genome of about 2.45 billion base pairs (the fundamental building blocks of DNA). Given that dire wolf DNA differs by roughly 0.5% from that of gray wolves, the researchers have barely scratched the surface. This 0.5% disparity amounts to roughly 12 million base pairs that set the dire wolf genome apart from its gray wolf counterpart. Accordingly—and not to minimize the achievement—Colossal remains very far from capturing the genetic differences between the two species.

De-Extinction Company Reveals Genetically Engineered ‘Woolly Mouse'

That said, Colossal says that its analysis of the dire wolf genome is the most comprehensive to date, and seemingly even resolves long-standing questions about the animals' evolutionary history. Based on its work, they argue that gray wolves are indeed the dire wolves' closest living relative, rather than jackals, as some recent research has suggested. But this feat of resurrection, while certainly impressive, does have its caveats.

The researchers avoided making certain changes that would more closely match dire wolf DNA if they believed those changes could potentially harm the health of the pups. Sometimes, they opted to make different but safer genetic changes that still resulted in the phenotype (a trait influenced by a genetic variant, like height) they expected from their analysis. One example of this highlighted by the researchers is the wolves' white coloring.

In other words, the genetic makeup of these wolves isn't a one-to-one copy of a dire wolf's—it's the company's interpretation of how to safely create an animal they say is close enough. They've dubbed this approach “functional de-extinction.”

“Functional de-extinction uses the safest and most effective approach to bring back the lost phenotypes that make an extinct species unique,” said Beth Shapiro, Colossal's Chief Science Officer, in an emailed statement. “We turn to ancient DNA to learn as much as we can about each species and, whenever possible, to link specific extinct DNA sequence variants to each key trait. In some cases, we learn that variants already present in the surrogate species can be used to engineer that key trait. In those cases, engineering existing variants into the donor genome is an optimal path, as that path provides strong confidence in the outcome with minimal risk to the animal.”

Some people might disagree that Colossal's wolves are truly dire wolves, and the team's claims about the dire wolf's ancestry will be certainly studied further by other scientists. Scientific questions aside, there are also moral concerns about whether it's appropriate to try bringing back extinct species in the first place.

But the company's accomplishment shouldn't be minimized either. This is a major barrier that has been broken, and the company isn't done. Colossal also announced today that its cloning technology was recently used to birth four red wolves, which are the most critically endangered wolves around today (between 17 and 19 wolves exist in the wild, while 270 more are captive). And it still plans to birth the world's first resurrected woolly mammoth by 2028.

The world has definitely changed now, and whatever you want to call them, these wolves likely only mark the beginning of a new era in genetic engineering.

A Meta exec on Monday denied a rumor that the company trained its new AI models to present well on specific benchmarks while concealing the models' weaknesses.

The executive, Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said in a post on X that it's “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” In AI benchmarks, test sets are collections of data used to evaluate the performance of a model after it's been trained. Training on a test set could misleadingly inflate a model's benchmark scores, making the model appear more capable than it actually is.

Over the weekend, an unsubstantiated rumor that Meta artificially boosted its new models' benchmark results began circulating on X and Reddit. The rumor appears to have originated from a post on a Chinese social media site from a user claiming to have resigned from Meta in protest over the company's benchmarking practices.

Reports that Maverick and Scout perform poorly on certain tasks fueled the rumor, as did Meta's decision to use an experimental, unreleased version of Maverick to achieve better scores on the benchmark LM Arena. Researchers on X have observed stark differences in the behavior of the publicly downloadable Maverick compared with the model hosted on LM Arena. 

Al-Dahle acknowledged that some users are seeing “mixed quality” from Maverick and Scout across the different cloud providers hosting the models.

“Since we dropped the models as soon as they were ready, we expect it'll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in,” Al-Dahle said. “We'll keep working through our bug fixes and onboarding partners.”

The GeForce RTX 5090 ranks among the best graphics cards available today. But the GeForce RTX 5090D, a variant exclusive to China, is highly coveted in that market. Galax has expanded its Boomstar series by launching two new custom GeForce RTX 5090D models for gamers in China.

Galax has announced the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox. A noteworthy feature of these two models is the quick-release shroud. Rather than securing the shroud to the graphics card using conventional screws, Galax has implemented a magnetic attachment system, utilizing magnets at several points to ensure the shroud remains securely in place. This is an interesting idea, particularly with regard to maintenance, as it allows for tool-free removal.

Galax has a history of utilizing magnets in its graphics cards. The Boomstar series, renowned for its anime-inspired theme, previously featured detachable front and back panels to allow for user customization. The notion of providing detachable components on a graphics card can be traced back several years, with manufacturers such as Sapphire and XFX having offered graphics cards equipped with swappable cooling fans in the past. The most recent iteration from Galax takes things a bit further.

The GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox are similar, with the difference being the color. The former features a white theme, while the latter has a black theme. The graphics cards appear to adhere to a triple-slot design with a triple-fan cooling system. Both come equipped with a 14-layer PCB with a color matching the model. The power subdelivery system consists of a 16+6+7-phase design.

Galax sells the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna in standard and overclocked variants. The GeForce RTX 5090D Nox's product page wasn't live at the time of writing, but we expect the manufacturer to offer versions similar to the Luna SKU. The standard version flaunts a 2,407 MHz boost clock, the same as the reference specification for the GeForce RTX 5090D. On the contrary, the overclocked version has a 2,452 MHz boost clock, slightly higher than the vanilla version.

The GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox are rated for 575W and employ the latest 12V-2x6 power connector, an upgraded version of the 16-pin power connector. The minimum recommended capacity for the power supply is 1,000W. As for display outputs, you receive three DisplayPort 2.1b outputs and one HDMI 2.1b port.

Galax has yet to reveal the pricing and availability for the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox. However, the graphics cards are unlikely to launch outside the Chinese market.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his price targets for Apple and Tesla over the weekend as President Trump's tariffs threaten to disrupt both businesses. 

“The tariff economic Armageddon unleashed by Trump is a complete disaster for Apple given its massive China production exposure,” Ives said in a warning note over the weekend. “In our view, no U.S. tech company is more negatively impacted by these tariffs than Apple with 90% of iPhones produced and assembled in China.”

Wedbush cut its price target for Apple stock by $75, down to $250 per share. Apple's shares are down this afternoon by 4.3% and trading at $180. 

Ives also cut his price target for Tesla to $315 from $550, which is still well above Tesla's current share price of $233.94 as of 2:10 p.m. ET.

Ives said the affect of tariffs isn't the only reason for the price cut. He also cited CEO Elon Musk's politics, which has created a brand crisis for the automaker. Musk's association with Trump and his tariffs policies are affecting sales in the U.S. and Europe and also threaten Tesla's popularity in China, “further driv[ing] Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD,” said Ives. 

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” he wrote. “It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty. 

Tesla shares were down nearly 10% compared to Friday's closing price, but have rebounded somewhat as of Monday afternoon.

Former Tesla executive Drew Baglino has a new startup developing solid-state transformers for the electric grid, Axios reported.

The new company, Heron Power, is raising between $30 million to $50 million for a Series A, according to the report, with Capricorn Investment Group pegged to lead the round.

Baglino was a longtime employee at Tesla, starting at the company in 2006, two years before Elon Musk took over as CEO. He rose through the ranks, designing the powertrain for the first Model S and leading engineering for Tesla's battery storage products before being named senior vice president of powertrain and energy.

Baglino left Tesla last April, the same time the company laid off 10% of its staff. 

In founding Heron Power, Baglino is tackling a part of the electrical grid that hasn't seen much innovation in over a century. Transformers have been largely unchanged in that time, and having been commoditized, the majority of them are now made overseas. 

Solid-state transformers are more capable than existing transformers, regulating dips in voltage that might arise from solar panels and wind turbines. They're also a lot more compact, can quickly transition from one source of power to another, and can be actively managed, boosting grid stability.

Heron Power isn't the only startup hoping to shake up the transformer market. Singapore-based Amperesand is also in the process of raising a Series A after closing a $12.5 million seed round in early 2024. Like Heron, Amperesand also counts Tesla alumni among its executive ranks.

The stock market went on a rollercoaster ride this morning, shooting upwards after news circulated online that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause of his global tariff policy. However, the White House has now called the information “fake news.” After it became apparent that Trump has no intention of backing down from a policy most economists have dubbed totally insane, the market acted accordingly and dropped like a stone.

It's unclear exactly where the news originated, although online chatter and multiple news outlets have pointed to it having been boosted by one particular X account. Business Insider writes that the tweet came from an account known as “Walter Bloomberg” which typically posts headlines and information from news outlets. According to BI, that tweet read: “HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA,” in an apparent reference to Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, who recently went on Fox News to discuss Trump's tariff policy. The tweet has since been deleted. Gizmodo reached out to the account via email for comment.

However, around the same time, the news was also briefly perpetuated by multiple reputable outlets, including Reuters. An archived version of the Reuters report claims that “White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in an interview that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries expect China.” Indeed, the Walter Bloomberg account has claimed that he first heard the news from Reuters.

When reached for comment by Gizmodo, Reuters said that it had initially heard the news from a television report from CNBC. A spokesperson said, in a statement: “Reuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China. The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.”

With the apparent news that Trump might roll back his daft economic policy, the market rose precipitously—shooting up 8.5 percent in 34 minutes, BI writes.

However, the White House was quick to shoot down the media reports. Rapid Response 47, which is the Trump administration's social media account on X, quote-tweeted the news, writing: “Wrong. Fake News.” The market promptly plummeted.

Later Monday morning, a Bloomberg business reporter came out to disavow any link between the news outlet and the “Walter Bloomberg” social media account: “PSA: Do not rely on Walter Bloomberg X account. He doesn't work for us and is not authorized by Bloomberg.”

Barron's writes that the tweet may have been a misunderstanding of Hassett's Monday morning interview with Fox. During that interview, Hassett was asked whether Trump would consider pausing his tariffs and Hassett responded that “the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,” whatever that's supposed to mean.

“INSANE market action right now,” wrote Joe Weisenthal, who runs Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast. “Market exploded higher on a headline attributed to Kevin Hassett. And now nobody can figure out where it came from and the markets are diving again. An 8% surge and then a 3.5% plunge in a matter of seconds.”

Other web-users chimed in to comment on the ridiculousness of the situation. “s&p is now a memecoin,” one X user wrote.

“You know The Economy is real when trillions of dollars can move up and down based on a tweet of a made-up quote,” said another user.

Another user noted that the account being blamed for the mistake is “verified” by X's standards, meaning the person operating the account pays a monthly subscription fee in exchange for “verification.” Twitter verification used to be reserved largely for professional media organizations and was determined by an internal team. Since Elon Musk took over the platform, anybody can be an expert, as long as they pay Musk's company money. “Twitter letting random users pay $8 a month for a verified badge just led to a $4 trillion market mistake caused by fake news,” someone wrote.

Trump's tariff policies have sent the global economy into a tailspin, with critics maintaining that the world is headed for recession. The president has sought to alleviate concerns about evaporating 401ks by coining a new, deeply idiotic term: Panican, as in an American who panics. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump said, in a post to his website, Truth Social, on Monday. “Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”

President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on goods imported from China in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday. The total tariff on China would rise to 104% if the country doesn't back off and drop the 34% retaliatory tariff it announced in response to Trump's own 34% hike on goods coming from the U.S. last week. And Trump's new threat isn't exactly calming anyone's nerves.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote.

Trump introduced a new 34% tariff on Chinese goods on April 2 during his bizarre “Liberation Day” announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House. But that tariff was already on top of an existing 20% tariff on imports from the country. If Trump does go through with his threat, it would seem the total tariff would amount to 104%, though it's not entirely clear yet if that's indeed the ceiling.

As always, Trump's threats on Monday provided little clarity on how everything may actually work. When the president made his tariffs announcement last week, complete with a now-infamous chart, market analysts and journalists were left confused about what the numbers he was displaying actually meant. It turned out that Trump was creating fake numbers that purported to show existing tariffs on U.S. goods. In reality, the White House was using an equation that made absolutely no sense.

To arrive at its numbers, the White House took the trade deficit with each country divided by the total imports from that country to the U.S. and then divided that number by half to find the tariff. If the U.S. had a trade surplus with a country, it still got slapped with a baseline tariff of 10%. Australia, for example, imports more from the U.S. than it exports but still got hit with a 10% tariff on all goods it exports to Americans.

Trump did give some breadcrumbs of hope that his tariffs on other nations outside China were up for negotiation, according to his latest Truth Social post.

“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump concluded in his Truth Social post.

The markets have been swinging wildly on Monday, first plunging at the open but then recovering briefly after a tweet from someone named Walter Bloomberg on X. Bloomberg has no affiliation with Bloomberg News but many people follow the account because it often tweets breaking news from the wire services. Erik Wasson, a reporter for Bloomberg News, even tweeted Monday that people shouldn't rely on that Walter Bloomberg account, writing “He doesn't work for us and is not authorized by Bloomberg.” Walter Bloomberg tweeted that the White House was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs, apparently because Trump advisor Kevin Hassett had given a Fox News interview two hours earlier where he'd been asked about the possibility of just such a reprieve.

KILMEADE: Would Trump consider a 90 days pause in tariffs?

HASSETT: I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide … even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP

Hassett responded “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,” which is essentially saying that he doesn't know. But the stupid game of Telephone that is our modern internet took that as gospel that Trump would be pausing the tariffs, sending the markets soaring into positive territory before crashing back down when the White House called it “fake news.”

Congress has the power to impose tariffs under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution but Trump is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which allows the president to impose tariffs in the name of a national emergency. Trump is imposing these global tariffs because he says trade deficits are an “emergency.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, introduced a bill last week to claw back some of that power. And as of Monday, the bill has seven Republican sponsors, according to NBC News. But even if the bill passes the Senate, it seems unlikely to come to a vote in the House, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, has shown no signs that he will betray Trump by taking back any of the powers originally given to Congress.

Nobody knows what the rest of the week holds for the global economy, but it seems like it can only get stupider from here. And it's almost entirely the fault of one guy if you don't count the Republicans who have enabled this stupidity. Trump is playing chicken with the global economy. And picking a fight with the entire world hasn't worked out well historically for the aggressor country.

Waymo is preparing to use data from its robotaxis, including video from interior cameras tied to rider identities, to train generative AI models, according to an unreleased version of its privacy policy found by researcher Jane Manchun Wong. 

The draft language reveals Waymo may also share this data to personalize ads, raising fresh questions about how much of a rider's behavior inside autonomous vehicles could be repurposed for AI training and marketing. 

Waymo is working on Generative AI training using “interior camera data associated with rider's identity,” provides opt-opts for this and data sharing under CCPAWaymo explicitly states in this unreleased Privacy page it may share your data for personalized ads pic.twitter.com/wDUu867Eh3

The privacy page states: “Waymo may share data to improve and analyze its functionality and to tailor products, services, ads, and offers to your interests. You can opt out of sharing your information with third parties, unless it's necessary to the functioning of the service.” 

That language is standard in today's world; bringing cameras into the mix is what ratchets up the creepiness factor.

Waymo gives riders the option to prevent their personal information, as defined by California's privacy laws, from being shared or sold. Riders can also: “Opt out of Waymo, or its affiliates, using your personal information (including interior camera data associated with your identity) for training [generative AI].”

It's not clear what interior data might be used to train generative AI models, or what the intended use cases of such models are. Nor is it obvious what sort of data the interior cameras capture — facial expressions? Body language? — or whether Waymo is using the data to train in-house models or whether it's sharing that data with other Alphabet companies working on AI like Google or DeepMind. 

TechCrunch has reached out to Waymo for more information and will update this post if the company responds.

Waymo is, to date, the only autonomous vehicle company pulling in revenue for robotaxi rides in the United States. As of February, the company is logging more than 200,000 paid robotaxi rides every week via its commercial services in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin. That's up from 10,000 rides per week just two years ago and is a harbinger of more growth as Waymo expands into new markets. The company aims to launch a commercial service in Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., over the next two years. 

Despite these gains, Waymo is still likely a money loser for Alphabet, which might be why the company appears to be exploring other revenue streams, like in-vehicle advertising and data sharing for generative AI models. 

Last year, Alphabet poured another $5 billion into Waymo, and the company raised an additional $5.6 billion from outside investors that boosted its valuation to more than $45 billion. 

Waymo is still investing heavily in R&D and incurring the costs of expansion, including growing its fleet, buying specialized equipment, vehicle maintenance, and charging infrastructure. 

It's not clear how far Waymo is from breaking even, much less profitability. Alphabet doesn't break out Waymo's financials in its earnings report. Instead, Waymo is included in Alphabet's “other bets” section of its balance sheet, which in 2024 recorded an operating loss of $1.2 billion.

Google is bringing multimodal search to AI Mode, its Google Search experiment that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic. Users who have access to AI Mode can now tap the feature to ask questions about photos they've uploaded or taken with their camera.

The new image-analyzing functionality in AI Mode is powered by Google Lens' multimodal capabilities, Google said in a blog post on Monday.

AI Mode can understand the entire scene in an image, including how objects relate to each other, as well as their materials, colors, shapes, and arrangement, according to Google. Using a technique called “query fan-out,” AI Mode asks multiple questions about both the image and the objects shown in it, providing more detailed information than a traditional Google search.

For example, you could snap a photo of your bookshelf and enter the query: “If I enjoyed these, what are some similar books that are highly rated?” AI Mode will identify each book and then provide a list of recommended books with links to learn more about and/or purchase them.

AI Mode also lets you ask follow-up questions to narrow down your search, such as “I'm looking for a quick read, which one of these recommendations is the shortest?”

As part of Monday's announcement, Google said it's making AI Mode available to millions more users who are enrolled in Labs, Google's home for experimental features and products. Prior to this, AI Mode was only available to Google One AI Premium subscribers.

Launched last month, AI Mode looks to take on popular services like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search. Google has said that it plans to continue to refine the user experience and expand functionality in the feature.

In a recent memo to employees, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke made a bold policy change: teams must demonstrate why AI can't perform a job before they're permitted to ask for more headcount and resources.

“Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI,” Lütke wrote in the memo, which he shared publicly on social media Monday. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team? This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” 

Advancing the notion that AI and so-called agents may help Shopify maintain a smaller workforce is sure to attract controversy, given widespread concerns about AI's impact on jobs. A new report from the United Nations' Trade and Development organization estimates that AI could disrupt over 40% of roles globally.  

However, Lütke isn't the only CEO looking to AI for efficiency gains. Other leaders in the tech space have expressed similar sentiments.

Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna, has boasted about how Klarna's AI chatbot does the work of 700 customer service agents. He has also said that, thanks to AI, Klarna's workforce could eventually be reduced to just 2,000 people. Klarna currently employs around 4,000.

As of 2024, Shopify had around 8,100 employees. The year prior, the company laid off 20% of its staff. In January, Shopify reportedly quietly laid off employees in its customer service division, according to Business Insider.

The measles outbreak in Texas has gotten deadlier, just as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., visited the state over the weekend. Health officials have reported a second local death from the resurgent virus, now marking the third overall U.S. death connected to measles this year.

The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reported the second death late Saturday night, though it actually occurred Thursday. The person (since identified as eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand) died from “measles pulmonary failure,” according to doctors at University Medical Center Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas. On Sunday, RFK Jr. attended Hildebrand's funeral, and he has continued to both tout the benefits of vaccination as well as unsupported medical treatments for measles.

As of early April, 481 measles cases have been documented in Texas, dating back to mid-January, while 56 people have been hospitalized. Much like the first fatal case reported in Texas last month, Hildebrand was unvaccinated and had no pre-existing health conditions. New Mexico officials reported the death of an adult with measles last month as well, though it's not yet confirmed whether the viral disease was to blame. These are the first documented measles deaths in the U.S. since 2015.

Overall, more than 600 cases of measles have been reported in the U.S. Outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly Kansas are connected to each other, and have largely occurred among unvaccinated Mennonite communities in rural regions. There have also been isolated, travel-related cases in over a dozen other states. This case toll in 2025 has already surpassed last year's, and there is a chance it will top 2019, the previous high-water mark seen since the virus was locally eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. There were 1,274 cases in 2019, as the U.S. teetered on the brink of losing its measles-free status.

RFK Jr.'s Measles Cure? Cod Liver Oil and a Whole Lot of Other Nonsense

During his visit to Texas, RFK Jr.—a regularly debunked vaccine skeptic—offered his strongest endorsement of vaccination yet. He stated in a social media post Sunday that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR [the combination measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine.” At the same time, he continued to promote medically unsound treatments for the viral disease. In a separate post, he stated that he met with two doctors, Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards, and claimed that they had “treated and healed” some 300 Mennonite children using a combination of aerosolized budesonide (a steroid) and clarithromycin (an antibiotic).

Doctors have occasionally turned to steroids for serious and relevant measles complications, such as brain swelling, but there isn't strong-enough evidence supporting its standard use. A 2023 study, for instance, failed to find that steroids were associated with better outcomes during a 2017 measles outbreak in Italy (thankfully, they weren't associated with worse outcomes). Antibiotics can be used to treat secondary bacterial infections that could emerge from measles, but they can't directly treat viral infections. These medications aren't risk-free either: steroids are known to weaken people's immune systems, for instance.

RFK Jr.'s Vitamin A Fix for Measles Is Hurting Kids in Texas

Previously, RFK Jr. has claimed that cod liver oil—rich in vitamin A—can be an effective measles treatment as well. But there's no rationale for its use in the U.S., since very few Americans suffer from vitamin A deficiency. And some children given vitamin A for their measles have already developed vitamin A toxicity as a result, according to doctors in the region.

While Kennedy may finally have found a vaccine that he can support, his other medical advice has and could very well endanger more children suffering from measles.

That's a lot of cores.

Linux 6.15 will bring support for 8,192 cores in the Turbostat CPU monitoring utility, if you happen to have such a system (via Phoronix). The change was driven by an HPE (Hewlett-Packard Enterprise) engineer who faced an issue with their unnamed 1,152-core system since Turbostat wasn't designed to handle more than 1,024 cores/threads. We currently aren't aware of any server CPU configurations that can exceed this limit (in terms of physical cores), so this may be a custom or next-generation solution from Intel or AMD. The utility currently only supports x86 processors, which seemingly rules out an Arm system from causing the issue.

Turbostat is a Linux command-line utility provided by the kernel-tools package and is baked into most distributions. It's a monitoring utility that reports clock speeds, idle power-state statistics, temperature, etc., on x86-based processors. This is important information, as we can infer that the 1,152 core system is likely an Intel/AMD solution. Likewise, a while back, Ampere's 384-core servers exposed a maximum core count limitation with the ARM64 Linux kernel, which only supported up to 256 cores.

Turbostat had a hardcoded limit (CPU_SUBSET_MAXCPUS) that was set to 1,024, which defines the maximum number of CPUs (cores) it can handle. Yesterday, just before the merge window for Linux 6.15-rc1 closed, the CPU limit was increased to 8,192 along with the addition of a CPU idle debug telemetry tool, and several bug fixes.



The HPE engineer didn't specify the details of the hardware powering their system. On the Intel side, it would make sense to look into its latest Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids' offerings, where we find the Xeon 6788P (86 cores) with 688 cores or 1376 threads in an 8S configuration or the Xeon 6900E (288 cores), topping out at 576 cores when put in a 2S setup. Similarly, AMD's EPYC 9005 'Turin Dense' can achieve 384 cores in a dual-socket configuration with the EPYC 9965.

Since none of these match up to the 1,152-core system, it's plausible to assume HPE is using a custom solution for higher socket counts. There is a possibility that this metric refers to the logical cores (threads) and not the physical cores, which falls well in the ballpark of existing solutions. As far as future products like Diamond Rapids and Venice are concerned, we're still in the dark regarding key specs like core counts.

Taiwanese government remains optimistic.

Taiwan's stock market plunged nearly 10% on Monday, its steepest single-day decline ever, following U.S. announcement of a 32% import duty on goods from Taiwan, as well as Trump's intention to apply tariffs on chips. The slide was fueled by investor panic and heavy selling of major high-tech firms, including TSMC and Foxconn, Reuters reports.

Losses of TSMC and Foxconn highlight how deeply Taiwan's economy is tied to technology and global exports. The collapse followed a new round of U.S. duties, including a 32% charge on goods from Taiwan. TSMC and Foxconn were hit especially hard. Each saw share prices drop close to the daily 10% limit, triggering automatic halts.

Foxconn assembles consumer electronics for Apple (including iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads) as well as AI servers for some of the most significant cloud service providers. With a 32% tariff on goods produced in Taiwan, a 54% tariff on items made in China, Foxconn's profits are at risk.

The situation is more complex for TSMC. For now, tariffs are not imposed on semiconductors, but TSMC-made chips are ubiquitous, so if sales of consumer electronics and AI servers drop, TSMC's revenues and profits will decline too. Also, once tariffs on chips come into effect, TSMC, UMC, and other Taiwanese chipmakers will get hurt even more.

Taiwan's government responded quickly. A relief fund worth about $2.65 billion was rolled out to help businesses affected by the new trade rules. Taiwan's National Stabilisation Fund, which controls NT$500 billion ($15,164 billion) in assets, said it might step in to calm the market. Temporary restrictions were also placed on short-selling to limit volatility.

President Lai Ching-te addressed the situation by pledging stronger economic ties with the U.S. He promised increased imports from America and efforts toward eliminating tariffs altogether. Writing on X, he made clear there would be no countermeasures, emphasizing a joint path to economic growth and stability. 

Financial experts warned of long-term risks. Analysts described the selling as panic-driven and flagged a potential recession with odds exceeding 50% if conditions worsen. Goldman Sachs lowered Taiwan's rating to 'underweight' in its Asia outlook, pointing to the country's strong reliance on U.S. exports and heightened market sensitivity.

Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said that the company did not factor in possible tariffs from the U.S. when deciding on the pricing for its Nintendo Switch 2 console, according to Wired.

Nintendo unveiled its highly anticipated Switch 2 last week and announced that the console would be released on June 5, priced at $450. But later that day, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would impose sweeping tariffs on goods imported into the country, sending the global economy into disarray.

U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin on April 9, but U.S. consumers won't be able to preorder the console until Nintendo figures out how to address the tariffs. Many of the Switch 2's parts are assembled and manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia; under Trump's new plan, China is subject to 54% tariffs, while Cambodia and Vietnam are subject to 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively.

According to Bowser, Nintendo had already begun trying to diversify where it makes products, moving most production from China to other countries.

Nintendo unveiled its highly anticipated Switch 2 last week and announced that the console would be released on June 5, priced at $450. But later that day, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would impose sweeping tariffs on goods imported into the country, sending the global economy into disarray.

U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin on April 9, but U.S. consumers won't be able to preorder the console until Nintendo figures out how to address the tariffs. Many of the Switch 2's parts are assembled and manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia; under Trump's new plan, China is subject to 54% tariffs, while Cambodia and Vietnam are subject to 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively.

According to Bowser, Nintendo had already begun trying to diversify where it makes products, moving most production from China to other countries.

Since President Donald Trump mandated that remote and partially remote federal workers all must return to their offices, thousands of employees across the country have been figuring out how to navigate new commutes, seating arrangements, and a lack of supplies as basic as toilet paper and legal pads while still getting their work done.

One effect of all this, many federal employees tell WIRED, is that they are traveling long distances to spend all of their time in virtual meetings.

“I don't directly work with anyone in the office that I am going into,” one employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development tells WIRED. “So I show up and sit on [Microsoft] Teams calls.”

A Treasury employee says they spend most of their time at the office on video calls as well, “because of people working at other sites … and that's hard when working from a cubicle. I definitely get less done because of the distractions.”

At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one employee says that the focus on the return-to-office mandate has meant a lot of chaos for people who actually need to do their jobs in person. “Some teams and groups aren't even on the same campuses because space was so limited. So they're coming to work just to sit on the same virtual meetings as always,” they say. “And all the chaos has made it more difficult for the lab people, who actually need to be on campus. I'd say with everything they get two-to-three hours less of meaningful work out of me each day.”

Over the past few months, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has upended the government. In addition to firing tens of thousands of federal employees, before being forced by judges to rehire some of them, return-to-office mandates have resulted in chaos. Outlets like CNN and Reuters reported on the initial confusion and disarray caused by forcing tens of thousands of employees back to the office all at once, but weeks later, employees say the situation is getting worse.

Though Trump and Musk have claimed the mandate would result in huge productivity increases and financial savings, more than 30 federal employees at 17 federal agencies tell WIRED the return-to-office order has resulted in widespread chaos, plummeting productivity, and significantly reduced services to the public. It isn't just traveling to work to sit on Zoom calls—it's that there may be no place to take the call or no working internet to connect to it. WIRED granted employees anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, which some say are affecting their physical and mental health—and nearly all say are resulting in a lower quality of work and worse public services.

"The workplace environment is unpleasant, loud, people talk about whatever they want, and the workload is insane with the mass layoffs and hiring freeze," an employee at the Department of Defense (DOD) tells WIRED. "This is a terrible place to work." The employee says they cry almost every day after leaving the office.

Multiple government employees claim that there isn't enough space in federal offices, or necessary equipment, to make their return worthwhile.

At a DOD building, one employee says, the influx of people now working from the office has made simply accessing the facility a daily struggle for them.

“We are on a secure military facility with only a few access points,” the employee tells WIRED. “There are not enough gate guards to open multiple access points so the traffic backs up onto the highway.”

At one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office, during the first week of the return-to-office mandate in March, around 40 people were forced to work out of a single room. “I have lots of meetings every day, so I would have to go elsewhere to find some privacy, along with everyone else,” a DHS employee tells WIRED. Now, employees are not assigned office spaces until they arrive at work each day. “Every day, we have to go to one room to get an office assignment,” says the employee. “You don't know the assignment until the day of. If you are not assigned an office, you sit in a training room until that happens. My productivity has drastically decreased.” The offices are also so “gross,” the employee says, that they bring their own cleaning products to work.

Weeks after returning to the office, a Social Security Agency (SSA) employee claims there isn't enough furniture for everyone. “If you're stuck on a floor without enough chairs, you're stuck standing for eight hours,” they say. “I'm unfocused, exhausted, and in pain. I'm certainly not at 100 percent.”

An employee at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says he was ordered to return to his office on March 10, despite being hired for a fully remote position in 2022. There isn't enough space for private meetings, so if he wants to talk to one of the employees he supervises, he says, he has no options. “For private staff calls I have to go out to my truck and use my personal phone,” he tells WIRED. “I have requested a government cell, but they tell me I won't get it since I'm back in an office.”

Tech issues have plagued the return of many federal employees.

The USDA employee claims that the internet connection at his new office is “far worse than it is at home. So much so that I have had trouble using Teams with my staff in recent calls.”

“We are getting hammered with RTO tickets,” says another source at the USDA, describing the number of employees making requests for equipment to do their jobs in-office. “We do not have the IT infrastructure to support this massive RTO mandate.”

The DOGE-enforced $1 spending limit on federal credit cards, enforced in February, has exacerbated the problem, leading to shortages of basic supplies.

“All the money we saved on decommissioning equipment, saving on having contractors run cabling, enterprise hardware savings, will all be gone,” the USDA source says. “This RTO will not only bring work completion down for people now having to commute and people are going to work exactly their eight hours and not any time over. The stoppage of IT issues will bring down a lot of this as well.”

At the Internal Revenue Service, which ordered its workers back to the office four weeks ago, the $1 limit caused significant problems for those back in the office. “They have no soap, toilet paper, or paper towels anywhere in the building. Their water machine is broken. Many cannot get on LAN, and the Wi-Fi keeps going down,” one IRS employee tells WIRED. Another SSA employee says that they were told to “ration paper.”

“Supplies are limited because no one has purchasing authority,” the Treasury employee tells WIRED. “It's a running joke that we bring our own pens and paper. We have a bit of a stock of pens in my department but can't order more. We are out of notebooks, though there are some partially used legal pads from meetings available.”

Employees say the return-to-office mandate has also negatively impacted their productivity. “My whole team had been, probably to a fault, working long hours on quick turnaround projects,” a source at the Army Futures Command, which operates under the DOD, tells WIRED. “We were able to do a lot of this at home after dinner in the evening, because we've all got kids and family obligations. [Return to office] has ended all of that.”

Some federal employees say the return-to-office mandates are having a negative impact on their health.

One employee at the SSA, who identifies as queer and uses they/he pronouns, is also disabled and suffers from chronic pain and mobility issues. Still, they were left with no option but to make the long journey from their home to the office once the return-to-office mandate was enforced.

“With no car, I am walking a mile to the train, and from the station to the office on concrete and metal, limping along, using elevators when I can,” they say, adding, “While I can ask for Reasonable Accommodations, our DEI offices were gutted, so despite being directed to apply through the proper channels, there's no one there to process them.” In the weeks since they've returned to the office, nothing has improved.

“I'm not sleeping well, I can't have access to chairs and desks and monitors at proper heights to make me more comfortable,” they say. “I've had to start revisiting my orthopedic doctor to pursue treatments and start physical therapy again.”

A USDA employee says that returning to an office has aggravated their long-dormant carpel tunnel symptoms.

“I got an old wooden desk that is not intended to be a workplace,” the employee tells WIRED. “As a result of the table being too high for the chair they gave me, my carpel tunnel has been aggravated with numbness and piercing pain in the hand. My carpel tunnel has not been an issue for about 25 years now.”

A Treasury employee says that people on her team have had to quit due to stress stemming from the return-to-office mandate and the uncertainty of what's next. “People here love their jobs. We love what we do,” they say. “Getting fired would mean so much more than just losing a paycheck.”

Some employees say these fears, combined with the poor working conditions, are impacting their mental health as well.

“I'm just going through a depressive episode in part because of the nonstop uncertainty and stress,” says an employee at the DOD. “Even the hardcore military bros in my agency are feeling grim about everything that's happening.” A USDA employee told WIRED that they are now dealing with severe depression due to these mandates and general fear.

The threat of a reduction in force, or RIF, remains a constant concern for employees as they return to federal offices.

“There is just a lot of very dark humor at the office,” the Treasury employee says. “I think all of us are expecting to get RIFd or fired or something, but we are just waiting. Business as usual while everything is on fire.”

As another example, Microsoft Outlook 2003 infamously used CRC32 to "hash" the personal folder (.PST) passwords: <https://www.nirsoft.net/articles/pst_password_bug.html>.  Naturally, it was trivial to find a CRC32 checksum collision and open someone else's PST.Thankfully, the industry has come a long way since then.  These days, rolling your own cipher is, quite rightly, considered a red flag!

Cryptography is such an esoteric and deep field that it's easy for a fairly smart but inexperience engineer to misjudge the security of a particular implementation or usage of a cryptographic primitive.


reply



Indeed!  As I just wrote in another comment on this page, Microsoft Outlook 2003 used CRC32 to "hash" the personal folder (.PST) passwords.  Since CRC32 isn't a cryptographic hash, it was trivial to generate a collision and access someone else's Outlook personal folder.  This flaw persisted until at least 2006!  More details here: <https://www.nirsoft.net/articles/pst_password_bug.html>.

But the triumphant social media post gets a Community Note.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) social media post boasts of the elimination of tape data storage facilities at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSE). A triumphant Tweet by DOGE says that a million dollars per year will be saved “by converting 14,000 magnetic tapes (70 yr old technology for information storage) to permanent modern digital records.” However, many X users, and a Community Notes addition, highlight that despite its apparent elderliness, tape still remains the best choice in a range of data storage scenarios.

The @USGSA IT team just saved $1M per year by converting 14,000 magnetic tapes (70 yr old technology for information storage) to permanent modern digital records.April 4, 2025

Hopefully, no official installed at DOGE or GSA assumed that because magnetic tape has been around for such a long time, it is outdated and, therefore, a prime target for replacement with new and improved storage tech. Recently, we reported that the tech behind tape storage, the Linear Tape-Open (LTO) standard, carries on with a robust development roadmap that continues to deliver higher densities.



Tape storage devices are constantly being refreshed with new interfaces, like the new Thunderbolt 5 models announced last month. Media manufacturers also enjoy continued growth driven by trendsetting AI hyperscalers, and companies like Huawei are developing entirely new storage subsystems built around tape storage. A year earlier, we reported on research that claimed tape storage remained cheaper and less polluting than HDDs or SSDs.

As with many choices in tech, be it a decision about your display, processor, or GPU, there remains a diverse choice in storage media because one size doesn't fit all. Though we have fingernail-sized micro-SD cards that can store 1TB now and consumer SSDs that can transfer data at over 14 GB/s, older magnetic storage media like HDDs and tape remain on the menu. That's because they still have particular strengths or a sweet spot balance of features.



In the case of the 14,000 magnetic tapes that have been consigned to history by the government, Community Notes attached to the DOGE post reference articles about why tape is still popular for backups in organizations of all sizes and will still be around for “decades to come.” In brief, tape storage remains in favor for multiple reasons, but most importantly due to the format's huge capacity, long-term development roadmap that continues to evolve, known durability (30 years estimated), low energy consumption, TCO, and suitability for cold storage.

It would be very interesting to know what storage system and media have been selected to replace the GSA's tape system, but we don't have these details to hand. We also wonder whether the DOGE-celebrated $1M per year change away from tape will stick.

IBM on Monday said it has acquired Hakkoda, a data and AI consultancy based in New York.

The acquisition would “further expand” IBM's ability to bring consultants and AI to clients, particularly customers in industries like financial services, public sector, and healthcare and life sciences, said Mohamad Ali, SVP and head of IBM's consulting business, in a statement. 

“With Hakkoda's data expertise, deep technology partnerships, and asset-centric delivery model, IBM will be even better-positioned to deliver value faster to clients as they transform with AI,” Ali said.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal comes as IBM continues to ramp up its investments in AI and automation technologies. In February, the company acquired DataStax, a platform for building AI apps, and it recently finalized its purchase of infrastructure and security automation firm HashiCorp.

The strategy has borne fruit for IBM. In Q4 2024, the company, which makes the bulk of its AI income from consulting, recorded its biggest revenue jump in five years — sending its stock soaring 10%. IBM said at the time that AI bookings and sales stood at over $5 billion inception-to-date.

Co-founded in 2021 by ex-Deloitte GM Erik Duffield, Hakkoda helps customers move data to the cloud — in particular, the Snowflake data cloud. The startup offers a range of tools to help firms migrate and transform data, as well as products to “modernize” data from older systems.

The startup had managed to raise a total of $5.6 million in venture capital, according to Crunchbase. Its backers include Tercera, Lead Edge Capital, and Casimir Holdings.

Duffield said Hakkoda's hundreds of consultants across the U.S., Latin America, India, Europe, and the U.K. will join IBM's consulting division as part of the deal.

“From the beginning, Hakkoda has committed to being ‘in the arena,' not observing the greatest transformation in history but shaping it,” Duffield said in a statement. “IBM's heritage of innovation, their commitment to discovery, and deep partnerships with clients on their most technical challenges [are] a perfect pairing to take Hakkoda's industry-focused modern data consulting to the global marketplace.”

The WD Black SN770M 2TB is a great choice for expansion cards for smaller computing devices such as the Steam Deck. The SN770M uses a small M.2 2230 form factor, enabling it to fit in the tiniest chassis. So if you're looking to expand the storage of your gaming handheld or laptop, then the WD Black SN770M would be an excellent choice.

Available at Amazon, you can find the 2TB WD Black SN770M on sale for just $177 - although it may not be the lowest price we've seen for this drive, it is still a great deal. The list price for the SN770M is $237, with the Amazon price checking tool (Camelizer) showing the average sales price fluctuating between $190 and $210.

The SN770M SSD has a one-sided design, takes up less space, and is easier to cool. The performance is fast and steady with the combination of Kioxia 112-Layer TLC (BiCS5) NAND and SanDisk 20-82-10081-A1 controller. The 2TB version of the drive has a 1,200 TBW endurance rating and a standard 5-year limited warranty from Western Digital.

WD Black SN770M (2230) 2TB SSD: now $177 at Amazon (was $100)The 2TB WD Black SN770M is no slouch, with sequential read speeds of 5,150 MB/s and sequential write speeds of 4,850 MB/s. The small form factor 2230 SSD has a one-sided design and an endurance rating of 1,200 TBW.

For more detailed information and benchmark testing, please see our review of the WD Black SN770M, where we highlight its excellent all-around performance but have concerns about price and thermals when used in desktop mode. The 2TB SN770M has sequential read speeds of 5,150 MB/s and sequential write speeds of 4,850 MB/s - giving you more time in the action and less time on the loading screen.

Looking for a laptop that won't chain you to a desk? The Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 3i Chromebook transforms from laptop to tablet and back again, making it perfect for everything from coffee shop work sessions to couch-based Netflix binges. With its 15.6-inch Full HD display and 10-hour battery life, it's like having a mobile entertainment center that also happens to be a productivity powerhouse.

Amazon has slashed the price of the IdeaPad Flex 3i from $400 to $300, saving you a cool $100. At 25% off, this is one of the better deals we've seen on a versatile 2-in-1 Chromebook.

See at Amazon

The Intel Pentium N6000 processor and 128GB SSD storage work together to keep things running smoothly, whether you're juggling multiple Chrome tabs or streaming your favorite shows. No more frustrating lag when switching between work and play. And with Intel UHD graphics, you can expect smooth video playback and decent performance for casual gaming.

The star of the show is the 15.6-inch 1920×1080 FHD display, which delivers crisp, vivid visuals whether you're editing photos or binge-watching series. The flexible hinge lets you flip between laptop, tent, and tablet modes, adapting to whatever you're doing. The dual stereo speakers complement the display with rich, clear audio that fills a room.

Connectivity is well-covered with both USB-A and USB-C ports, plus a 3.5mm audio jack for your headphones. The thoughtful port selection means you won't need to carry around a bunch of dongles just to connect your accessories.

Battery life is a strong point – you'll get up to 10 hours on a single charge. That's enough to get through a full workday or a cross-country flight without hunting for an outlet. When you do need to charge, the USB-C charging is quick and convenient.

Despite its large screen, the IdeaPad Flex 3i remains surprisingly portable. The slim, lightweight design means you won't think twice about tossing it in your bag for a day of mobile productivity. The durable build quality gives you confidence that it can handle daily commutes and frequent travel.

At $300, this Chromebook hits a sweet spot for students, remote workers, or anyone who wants a versatile device that can handle both work and entertainment. With its flexible design, solid performance, and all-day battery life, it's a compelling option for those who need more than just a basic laptop but don't want to break the bank.

If you've ever been unfortunate enough to experience a break in at your home, you'll know the experience shakes you. Our homes are private and sacred. Whether something was taken or not, you feel violated knowing someone had gone through your home and belongings. If you can help it, do what you can to never let that happen to you.

A home security system is not too steep of an investment and works as an excellent deterrent for any unwanted intruders coming onto your property. The Blink Outdoor 4 is a wireless smart security system with a number of different camera options than can give you the peace of mind to leave town for a couple of days or sleep comfortably at night. Right now, it's part of a limited time deal in which you can snag the five-camera system for just $200. That's $200 off it's full price—a 50% discount.

See at Amazon

This fourth-generation home security camera is wire-free meaning it can be mounted anywhere along the outside of your house without a concern for nearby power. And if you think that means you'd have to be changing the batteries constantly, it does not. Each camera has a two-year battery life which you can set yourself up with in minutes as they are simply powered by AA lithium batteries — which come included!

The cameras have enhanced motion detections so you can be alerted on your smartphone if a person is detected, which it can differentiate from motion by other sources. ON the smartphone app, you can see a live view in 1080p HD and infrared night vision. The system even supports two-way audio communication with the built-in microphones and speakers on each camera.

You can save and share clips on the cloud with the Blink subscription plan or locally with the Sync Module 2 which comes included. You get the five Outdoor 4 cameras, ten AA lithium metal batteries, five mounting kits, one USB cable, one power adapter, and the sync module. You'll also get a free 30-day trial to the Blink subscription. Play around with it to see if you like it enough to sign up for more months.

Surprisingly none of the other differently-sized bundles are on sale. It's just the five-camera pack. Right now, it's cheaper than the three-camera pack by 60 bucks. You can set yourself up with great visibility of your property using the five camera system for just $200 for a limited time. That works out to just $40 per camera.

In the run-up to the Switch 2 launch, part of Nintendo's focus has been on ensuring it can meet the demands of an audience hungry for a new console. And that new system comes with a hefty price—$450—which could go up even more due to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced last week.

But in an interview a day after Trump's announcement, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser told WIRED the tariffs “weren't factored into the pricing” of the console.

The company is “actively assessing” the situation and its impact, he adds. “It creates a challenge,” Bowser says. “It's something we're going to have to address.”

Trump's tariffs sent the stock market into free fall; prices on many products are about to go up, and companies in the tech sector will be turned on their heads. On Friday, Nintendo made the unprecedented move of delaying preorders in the US for the hotly anticipated console “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”

Part of the company's business strategy, to this point, had been “to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories,” Bowser says. The company has already shifted much of its production to Vietnam and Cambodia and away from China.

According to Bowser, that diversification allowed Nintendo to move production around as needed during the Covid-19 pandemic. “That also applied to the early stages of tariffs,” he says. “The situation [on April 2] changed that.” Among Trump's new tariffs: 46 percent on Vietnam, 49 percent on Cambodia, and 54 percent on China.

An additional price hike on the console would be problematic for Nintendo. The current top Switch model, the OLED, is $350, while a standard edition comes in at $300. The price was oddly missing from the console's big announcement on Wednesday, a fact that hasn't been lost on would-be customers already clamoring for Nintendo to “drop the price.” At the New York event, journalists were discouraged from asking hardware developers about the console's cost.

Games have not been spared from high price tags either; Mario Kart World will cost $80. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a tech demo masquerading as a game that explains the ins and outs of the Switch 2, will be an experience people have to pay for. (Notably, this got a huge laugh from the crowd present.)

Two former Nintendo public relations managers, Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis, have broken down the criticism around the pricing on their YouTube channel, as well as criticized how news about the price was presented to fans.

“Obviously it was intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places,” Yang said, lambasting the decision to leave consumers to get answers themselves. “It's a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer.”

In the past, Nintendo products, including the original Switch, have been hard to find due to problems like chip shortages or global pandemics, but the company has taken efforts to “make sure that consumers can find a console when they're ready to buy the console," Bowser says.

Part of that includes a new loyalty program that aims to stop scalpers by requiring those who want to purchase the console to have an active Nintendo account. They'll also need to get a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a year and to have clocked at least 50 hours of gameplay. Console sales will be limited to one per person.

“We wanted to make sure that we were rewarding loyal players,” Bowser says. “Those that have been playing on [the Switch] for quite some time that we knew would be those upgraders—those that were eager to dive into play. That's why some of the gates, if you will, have been a part of the preorder process.” Other retailers, Bowser says, have their own systems to thwart scalpers.

The Switch 2 will soon move into global events, including those that are open to the public, ahead of its June launch. Bowser says that the company hopes to show its audience that “this is the next generation of platform” from Nintendo. The Switch 2 “obviously takes what you know and love so much from the Switch and then adds a lot of powerful features,” he says.

If tariffs force Nintendo's hand, the company may find it harder to win over players than ever before. However, it's unlikely Nintendo will face that dilemma alone. In an interview with IGN last Friday, ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn said that if people believe only the Switch 2 will be affected, “then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.”

The Switch 2 may yet be a bellwether for what's to come.

One of the most exciting features of the Switch 2 is its GameChat, a new social feature that lets up to 12 people share screens, game together, or just talk directly via the console. It puts social features found on platforms like Discord directly onto the console in a way Nintendo's platforms have yet to do.

Gaming is more social than most people give it credit for. Pre-internet, gaming with friends was the sort of thing you'd do together on the couch. After moving online, people were finally able to broaden their social circles to anyone who enjoyed their hobby, and not just whoever lived nearby; apps like Twitch and Discord have made this even easier.

While typically, gamers chatting are playing together, GameChat does not require you to play the same games or even play a game at all in order to chat. In some ways, the feature almost acts as an advertisement. People can watch their friends play games they themselves don't own, and then, if they're in a Family Group, borrow them via the system's newly announced virtual game cards.

“There's layers to GameChat that I think are really exciting,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser tells WIRED.

The feature will reach its full potential in the hands of players, he added. “One of the things that for us is really important is that we watch and see how people engage in GameChat.”

But online communities in gaming can be notoriously noxious. Any lobby or platform with open communication will, inevitably, become a vector for harassment and inappropriate imagery. Online games and platforms like Roblox, which are popular with young users, have massive problems with predators and pedophiles on the platform.

GameChat activates voice chat with the system's C button and allows for video use with a USB-C camera—features that could enable a great deal of abuse if left unchecked. During a roundtable discussion with Nintendo's hardware team in New York City last week, Switch 2's director Takuhiro Dohta and producer Kouichi Kawamoto talked about how they designed the system with safety considerations in mind. The feature is limited to a player's friend list, and parents maintain a lot of control.

“Parental controls for the minor who's gonna be using the chat can be set and controlled through the app,” Dohta tells WIRED. That means that only friends a parent has approved will be able to chat with players who are minors. Roblox has installed similar safety features as part of overhauled parental controls.

Adult players, however, or players who do not have parental controls turned on, will need to be more proactive. “When it's just two adults, they also need to be friends with each other to be able to do a chat,” Dohta says, pointing to the console's friend list systems. “You won't find yourself in a situation where you'll be placed in a chat with strangers.” Players will be able to import their friend lists from the Switch, though it may take some “fine tuning” to figure out who's up for chatting, he said. “There's bound to be people who like chats, and there's people who don't prefer to chat.”

“Ultimately, if something does happen or if someone is chatting with someone you don't want to chat with, there is also a report feature,” Kawamoto added.

GameChat will launch with the Switch 2 on June 5 and will be included with Nintendo Switch Online membership.

Close enough, welcome back, Vega 56.

Within just a month, the PC enthusiast community has already flashed the base RX 9070 with the XT's vBIOS, as reported by PCGH. In this instance, the increased TGP and clock speeds net a solid 15-20% uplift over the base configuration, and with some tuning, the RX 9070 can approach or even surpass its XT equivalent. While this is a fun experiment with tangible benefits, remember that modding your GPU's vBIOS will likely void any warranty and carries a number of risks, like bricking your GPU.

As shown in the benchmarks below, the base RX 9070 is quite power-starved, limited to a 220W TGP compared to the 304W TGP design on its XT brethren. The clock speeds also take a significant hit, dropping from 2.97 GHz (reference) to 2.52 GHz (reference). A member of the PCGH community successfully flashed his Asus Prime RX 9070 with the vBIOS of the Asus Prime RX 9070 XT, clearing the power and frequency blockade. This effectively bumped the power draw to 317W, with the boost clocks up in the 3.1 GHz range.

Across the 3DMark suite, the modded RX 9070 coupled with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consistently achieves 15-20% higher performance than similar non-modded configurations. In addition, with some overclocking and tuning, it is reported that the user managed to beat a stock RX 9070 XT. As might be expected, some minor instabilities were observed. AMD's ULPS (Ultra Low Power State) not working was one such issue.

Both Nvidia and AMD have tightened restrictions on vBIOS modifications in recent years. Such modding is especially tricky with Nvidia's hardware, owing to a vBIOS signature check that started with the Maxwell generation, primarily to prevent fraud and scams.

With previous AMD GPU generations like Vega and RDNA 1, the firm used the same underlying chip for its top two GPUs, differentiating them mainly through disabled hardware shaders and software-locked clock speeds. Much of the same saga repeats with RDNA 4, and the mere $50 price difference makes the RX 9070 seem like an obvious upselling tactic for the RX 9070 XT.

The software aspect of earlier gen limitations could be overcome by flashing the vBIOS, allowing many Vega 56 cards to perform like Vega 64s, while bringing RX 5700 performance up to RX 5700 XT levels. However, since the missing shaders are likely fused off on the hardware level, they cannot be re-enabled through software.

If you decide to take your GPU for a spin, be aware of the obvious dangers of vBIOS modding. Likewise, keep an eye on your core, memory, and VRM temperatures as you'd be pushing over 300W across a board that's likely not designed with that figure in mind.

Scandium and Dysprosium are just the latest materials added to the list.

China has introduced new export restrictions on materials containing key materials for RF and storage applications — scandium and dysprosium — which may hurt key players in these industries, including Broadcom, GF, Qualcomm, TSMC, Samsung, Seagate, and Western Digital. China's new restrictions follow two prior rounds of rare earth export rules that are slowly tightening the supply of these critical minerals, especially those used in several chipmaking applications.

Scandium is widely used for RF front-end modules found in smartphones, Wi-Fi modules, and base stations, whereas dysprosium is used for HDD heads and electric vehicles.

This is not the first time China's Ministry of Economy has restricted exports of rare-earth materials. The restriction on rare earth materials export has been made in response to the 54% tariffs imposed on goods produced in China by the Trump administration, complemented by a 34% import duty on all products made in the U.S.

Effective immediately, exporters of products containing Scandium, Dysprosium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Lutetium, Samarium, and Yttrium must apply for an export license from the China Ministry of Economy. The application requires customers to detail the final use of the material.

The new rules cover various products containing the previously listed rare earth metals, including raw ore, metal, compounds, and finished goods. While not an outright ban, this is the third round of China's export restrictions that raises supply concerns among manufacturers worldwide and deepens tensions between the U.S. and China.

These export restrictions reflect a calculated escalation strategy that targets the entire supply chain of high-tech manufacturing, from foundational wafer-level materials to fabrication-critical metals, in addition to rare earth materials used in other use-cases.

But is the third round of export restrictions from China more impactful on the industry than the first two?

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



As the image above illustrates, two of the key materials restricted in this round are Scandium and Dysprosium, both of which hold significant importance for the telecom and storage industries, which are difficult to overstate.



Scandium is primarily used in RF applications through its role in Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN). This material is used for high-performance wave filters like BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) and SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave).

By introducing (doping) Scandium to Aluminum Nitride at levels of around 10% to 40%, ScAlN achieves higher piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling (compared to AlN alone), which is critical for improving signal strength, bandwidth, and power efficiency in high-frequency telecom applications.

These filters are essential components in the front-end modules of 5G smartphones and base stations and Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 modules. While scandium is ubiquitous, one 200-mm or 300-mm wafer with chips featuring ScAlN only needs a few grams of Scandium.

Dysprosium is an even more widely used material as it is used for storage, electric vehicles, and even radiation-hardened applications. In HDDs, dysprosium is added to permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets used in voice coil motors, which control the read/write head as it improves the magnet's coercivity under high temperatures. NdFeB magnets are also used for motors in electric vehicles, so dysprosium is used for the same purpose.

In MRAM (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory), Dysprosium is used in the free or pinned magnetic layers of GMR (Giant Magnetoresistance) or TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) stacks to maintain stability of magnetic orientation. In addition, radiation-shielding components, such as those used in nuclear reactors, spacecraft, and satellites, also use Dysprosium.

Other materials in the list, namely Gadolinium, Terbium, Yttrium, Lutetium, and Aamarium, are also widely used and cannot be substituted without tradeoffs and at enhanced costs (including those associated with changes of production flows), characteristics, and risks.

But there is good news, too. While rare earth metals are called 'rare' and China supplies the lion's share of the world's rare earth materials, these elements are actually not rare. In fact, these metals are pretty widespread well beyond China.

They are hard to get; as in many cases, rare earth metals are obtained by mining other materials and subsequent separation of rare earths. The key reason why China is the dominant supplier of these materials and products on their base is because Chinese companies have managed to build an efficient ecosystem to mine, extract, and refine rare earth elements.

Some say China subsidizes its rare earth industry to control the supply of critical materials by making it unprofitable to produce them in other parts of the world. However, once China began to 'weaponize' its rare earth prowess, companies in other countries rejoiced, as their potential to supply rare earth materials in volume just became a real business opportunity. Few companies would try to save on strategically important items, such as rare earth materials, so companies would likely be willing to switch suppliers following the restrictions.

As noted above, this isn't the first round of China's restrictions of rare earth supplies. Moreover, this is not the most 'impressive' one, either. China's rare earth export curbs escalate from foundational materials (Antimony, Gallium, and Germanium) to fabrication-critical metals, then to rare earths used in RF, storage, and precision components.



In the initial round, China restricted Antimony, Gallium, and Germanium. Germanium is crucial for producing wafers featuring strained silicon and the most high-performance chips made by Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. These companies have used strained silicon for a couple of decades. Meanwhile, a 300-mm wafer uses around a gram of Germanium.

Antimony is used as a dopant to make n-type regions in transistors, so again, requirements per wafer are limited. As for Gallium, it is a key element to power semiconductors, RF electronics, infrared sensing, and compound semiconductors (such as ScAlN/AlGaN/GaN). However, when it comes to usage in applications like radars and telecommunications, Gallium and Germanium are inseparable.

Without any doubt, these materials support industries ranging from telecommunications to defense and data centers. That makes the restrictions highly disruptive at the early stage of the semiconductor value and manufacturing chain.

The second round expanded pressure to include Tungsten, Indium, Molybdenum, Bismuth, and Tellurium, materials tied directly to semiconductor fabrication. Tungsten and Molybdenum are used in transistor contacts, gates, and interconnects in advanced nodes where extreme thermal and electrical reliability are necessary. Indium is crucial for 5G mmWave front-end modules, satellite communications, and photonic chips.

Restricting these materials strikes at the core of modern semiconductor production, though we have yet to see any actual disruption of chip supply due to China's export curbs.

With its export restrictions, China leverages its dominance not only in resource extraction, but also in processing and material science. Thus, creating widespread uncertainty across the global semiconductor ecosystem, which now spans from smartphones, to PCs, self-driving vehicles, and sophisticated defense systems.



On one hand, this means that China's approach to export curbs indicates a deliberate, phased control strategy, targeting the entire vertical stack of semiconductor and high-tech production, including niche but irreplaceable elements. On the other hand, it means that the impact of China's curbs could decrease over time as the industry adapts its supply chains to the new reality.

Will there be further rounds? Without a doubt. We can only wonder what materials they will target, but keep in mind that China does not want to ruin the whole semiconductor or high-tech supply chain and instead wants to thrive on it. Stay tuned, as it's unlikely that this will be the last time we'll hear from the country about rare earth export restrictions.

The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, in collaboration with researchers across multiple institutions, has published a new study that challenges the long-held belief that high cholesterol correlates and even directly causes coronary artery disease, or plaque buildup in the arteries in metabolically healthy individuals.

The study, published today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances, recruited 100 metabolically healthy individuals following a long-term low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet who developed elevated levels of LDL cholesterol–dubbed Lean Mass Hyper-Responders (LMHRs). The researchers found that traditional cholesterol markers (ApoB and LDL-C) were not associated with baseline heart disease or progression in this population, calling for investments in further research and personalized treatment strategies.

Cardiovascular disease is the world's leading cause of death, making diagnosis and risk assessment a high priority. The prevailing theory of cardiovascular disease risk is the lipid hypothesis, which posits that elevations in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are significant risk factors that should be primary treatment targets. However, this new research questions the relevance of the lipid hypothesis in metabolically healthy individuals whose cholesterol levels rise in response to a low-carb ketogenic diet–often adopted to address significant mental or physical health challenges.

As evidence accumulates for the efficacy of therapeutic carbohydrate reduction to improve chronic conditions ranging from diabetes to inflammatory bowel disease to bipolar disorder, investigating the cardiovascular risk of diet-induced high cholesterol is becoming increasingly critical. Despite the striking beneficial effects that are seen following this therapy, adoption is often discouraged by medical doctors because of the presumed increased risk of heart disease.

The study investigated the relationship between LDL-C, ApoB, and heart plaque progression in a subpopulation of people who adopt low carbohydrate diets and fit the LMHR phenotype. This unique metabolic profile includes elevated LDL-C and ApoB levels despite otherwise healthy metabolic marker levels including low triglycerides, high HDL, low blood pressure, low insulin resistance, and low body mass index.

The researchers found no association between plaque progression and total exposure to, changes in, or baseline levels of ApoB and LDL-C. Rather, baseline plaque burden was identified as the strongest predictor of future plaque progression. These findings suggest that high cholesterol is not always a marker of cardiovascular plaque progression and that individuals with the LMHR phenotype may benefit from cardiac imaging to further assess their cardiovascular risk. 

The findings build on previous work from the research team demonstrating that LMHR individuals have similar levels of coronary plaque to a carefully-matched comparison group with normal LDL levels, underscoring that ketogenic diet-induced LDL increases may not indicate a higher risk of coronary plaque.

The research was co-led by senior author Dr. Matthew Budoff, MD, Investigator and Program Director and Director of Cardiac CT, and the endowed chair of preventative cardiology at The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. The study leaders included independent researchers Nick Norwitz, PhD, Dr. Adrian Soto-Mota, MD, and Dave Feldman, founder of the Citizen Science Foundation, which, uniquely, crowd-sourced funding for the study.

"It is important that clinicians, along with the general public, are made aware that personalized, data-driven approaches to assessing risk should be considered based on individual conditions," said Dr. Budoff, who is also a Professor of Medicine at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. "The existence of this phenotype suggests that alternative markers or tests should be used to establish metabolic health in some cases."

The study points to a clear need to expand cardiovascular disease risk assessment to include a personalized approach that can prioritize cardiac imaging. The researchers also call for an open-minded multidisciplinary approach to better understanding the heart disease risk of individuals with the LMHR phenotype, who often rely on low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets to keep chronic disease at bay.

Twins—smaller at birth, on average, than singletons—start out smaller in pregnancy than was previously known, according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The ultrasound study revealed that twins have less fat tissue and less muscle mass than singletons beginning at 15 weeks of pregnancy. If results are confirmed by additional research, the findings could provide information to guide physicians in monitoring and managing twin pregnancies.

Researchers analyzed data from previous ultrasound studies of fetal development in the uterus.  Included in the analysis were 3D ultrasound scans of 2,604 singleton pregnancies and 315 twins. All twin pairs had individual placentas. Twin pairs who shared a placenta were not included in the analysis.r

Beginning at 15 weeks, thigh volumes were significantly smaller for twins than singletons. Twins had smaller fat and lean thigh volumes than singletons. They also had a lower thigh fat to lean ratio than singletons, having proportionately 2.7 to 4.2% less fat from 15 to 37 weeks. Previous studies of twin growth in the womb involved 2D ultrasound scans and had documented decreased twin growth relative to singletons only in the early 3rd trimester (28 to 40 weeks).

Scientists do not think the twins early small size resulted from increased competition for nutrients as their placentas should have been developed enough to supply needed resources until the third trimester. Rather, they hypothesize that twins' small size early in pregnancy could be an adaptation to accommodate the need for increased resources of two fetuses later in pregnancy.

The study was conducted by Jessica Gleason, Ph.D. and Katherine Grantz, M.D., of NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and their colleagues. It appears in JAMA Pediatrics.

More than 7 million American adolescent girls ages 13 to 17 live in states with abortion bans, restrictive gestational limits or parental involvement requirements, according to Rutgers Health researchers.

Their study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, is the first to examine in detail the experiences of adolescent girls after states enacted restrictions on abortion access following the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court decision.

As a result of Dobbs, two-thirds of girls ages 13 to 17 now live in states that ban or severely restrict their abortion access. Minors are often targeted by restrictive policies and less able to use routes to abortion care common for adults – traveling to another state or using telehealth – leaving them disproportionately impacted. Without access to abortion, these girls have lost the ability to control their lives and their futures."

Laura Lindberg, professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health and author of the study

As of December, 12 states have banned abortion entirely and 10 states have restrictive gestational limits. As of Sept. 1, 2023, parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion is required in the 10 states with restrictive gestational limits and 14 of 29 states (as well as Washington, D.C.) without bans or without restrictive gestational limits. New Jersey is a protective state for minors and does not require parental involvement.

The researchers relied on population estimates from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, numbers that reflected the U.S. 2020 Census. They found that 66% (7,080,485 of 10,666,913) of adolescent girls live in states with an abortion ban, restrictive gestational limits (six to 22 weeks), parental involvement requirements or a combination of the three.

In addition, the researchers found that 42% of adolescent girls live in the 24 states where abortion isn't banned but that require parental consent or notification. Lindberg said, "twenty-four states protect abortion access for adults but don't afford the same rights to minors forcing them by law to involve a parent, adding an unnecessary and harmful barrier to care."

Cells throughout the body work together like singers in a choir to keep us healthy, as long as they work in perfect harmony. If any cells are off key, that harmony can be disrupted, with far-reaching effects across the body. By pinpointing the discordant cells, scientists may be able to learn how to get them back in tune and restore health.

Taking inspiration from that musical metaphor, a team of researchers at Gladstone Institutes has released a novel computational tool called CHOIR that can improve the detection of off-key cells. CHOIR, short for "cluster hierarchy optimization by iterative random forests," categorizes thousands or even millions of cells into separate, biologically distinct groups, helping home in on specific cell types or conditions that may underlie disease.

"What's exciting about CHOIR is that it solves some of the key limitations of existing tools," says Gladstone Investigator Ryan Corces, PhD, senior author of a new study published in Nature Genetics that introduces CHOIR. "It can more accurately identify rare cell types, while also avoiding the tendency of other tools to 'hallucinate' cell types that aren't actually biologically distinct from each other."

Using this new tool, we can pinpoint cells that promote health or disease and that may not have been revealed otherwise. This deep insight allows us to focus investigations and therapeutic interventions on the most promising targets."

Lennart Mucke, MD, director of the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease and co-author of the study

CHOIR arose from necessity. Cathrine Sant, PhD, now a postdoctoral scholar at Gladstone, began work on this project as a graduate student in Mucke's lab.

At the time, she was studying Alzheimer's disease and learning how to analyze data generated by single-cell sequencing technologies. Such methods capture the distinct biological identities or states of cells in any given tissue sample-revealing, for instance, which genes are turned on or off, or which proteins are present on cell surfaces.

Sant wanted to explore the different cell types or states potentially involved in Alzheimer's. To do so, she needed a statistical method to help her sort through her single-cell data by grouping the cells into biologically distinct clusters-just as singers in a choir might be grouped into sopranos, altos, or baritones.

She considered a variety of existing tools designed for projects like hers. But none seemed quite right.

"I was struck by the number of arbitrary decisions some of the tools require scientists to make, and by how these decisions can introduce personal bias or limit you to existing biological knowledge-reducing the potential for novel discovery," says Sant, who led the development of CHOIR and is first author of the new study. "It felt more like a choose-your-own-adventure than actually getting to the biological truth in the dataset."

So, Sant set out to find a better way of revealing that truth. She turned to Corces, who had just started his lab at Gladstone, to leverage his expertise in computational methods, while also tapping into Mucke's extensive knowledge of neurodegenerative diseases.

Together, the scientists developed a user-friendly method that relies on an unbiased statistical framework rather than intuition. The result is CHOIR, a freely available tool that can be applied across different tissue types from humans and experimental models to identify biologically meaningful groups of cells or cell conditions.

"Hundreds of people have downloaded CHOIR since we first made it available online in a preliminary format about a year ago," Sant says. "It has been gratifying to see the many creative ways in which scientists are already using the tool across diverse fields, including neuroscience and immunology, as well as cardiovascular and cancer research."

As a key component of its design, CHOIR incorporates a machine learning method that lets scientists use it for data produced by any single-cell analysis method, including those focused on RNA, DNA, or proteins.

CHOIR also has built-in guardrails to avoid pitfalls of other tools. For example, it safeguards against underclustering, in which biologically distinct cell types are mistakenly grouped together, and also prevents overclustering, which could send a researcher on a wild goose chase by identifying cell types as distinct when they're not.

Additionally, unlike other tools that assume different cell types occur in similarly sized clusters, CHOIR takes into account what actually happens in the body, which is made up of cell populations whose sizes range from abundant to rare.

"CHOIR excels at grouping common cell types into large, cohesive clusters while simultaneously pinpointing rare cell populations-the needles in a haystack," Sant says.

Together, these features allow CHOIR to reliably detect and discover cell types or states that might be important for diagnosing, treating and preventing disease.

To confirm CHOIR's prowess, Sant and her colleagues tested it across a variety of single-cell data types-including combinations of multiple data types-and a variety of biological samples, including brain, blood, and cancer cells. When pitted against other tools for analyzing single-cell data, CHOIR outperformed 15 of the most popular ones, identifying distinct cell types that other tools missed.

"Regardless of the type of tissue we tested, CHOIR performed better than other methods, even without any tweaks to its default settings," Corces says. "Being able to rely on those defaults avoids potential biases that can be introduced when researchers are required to tweak settings based on their personal intuition. That's really important for standardization and ensuring research findings are rigorous and reproducible across labs."

Now, equipped with CHOIR, Sant is taking a fresh approach to Alzheimer's research. She and her colleagues are using it to zoom in on specific types of brain cells after reducing levels of the protein tau-a strategy being explored as a potential treatment for the disease. They're also using CHOIR to analyze an Alzheimer's dataset involving single-cell data from millions of cells from human tissue samples.

Meanwhile, other labs at Gladstone are already applying CHOIR to study the brain, the heart, and the immune system. "Many researchers are using single-cell data these days and CHOIR is applicable across many studies," Mucke says. "We hope this powerful new research tool will advance diverse areas of science and biomedicine."

A new study presented today at the European Psychiatric Association Congress 2025 reveals that gender plays a significant role in excessive and problematic (psychological or behavioral dependence) smartphone use, with young females more likely to experience higher social anxiety than other genders. In the study, it was also found that gender was significantly linked to the amount of time spent using smartphones and the fear of being judged negatively by others online. 

The researchers set out to investigate problematic smartphone use, mental well-being, emotional regulation and social anxiety differences between genders, so that a stronger understanding can be built of the smartphone addiction process. The study involved 400 young adults (average age 25.9): 104 men, 293 women and three of another gender. 

Key findings from the study include: 

Gender accounts for significant differences in the mediating factors (time of use per day, Mental Health Continuum Scale (MHC), Assessing Emotions Scale (AES), Fear of Negative Perception Questionnaire (FNPQ)), that affect problematic smartphone use 

Young females experience higher fear of negative perception online 

Gender is significantly related to the time spent with smartphones, with higher use in young females than other genders 

These results point to serious differences between genders in that females are much more likely to suffer mental ill health at the hands of a smartphone. Our study also reveals the influence of social interactivity, low emotional understanding and variations in perceived social support that could be caused by problematic smartphone use. It is important that these areas are further researched so we can work to build our understanding of these behavior differences between genders and what methods need to be put in place to support these individuals." 

Dr. Csibi Sándor, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Romania, and Lead Investigator

Co-author Ms. Neha Pirwani, Eotvos Lorand University, Hungary, added: "Our findings add to previous studies showing that females can face increased suffering and therefore need additional attention, guidance and help compared with other genders, to identify problematic smartphone use and what this may lead to. Our continued work to further understand the causes and effects of this is key to addressing these issues amongst the younger generation." 

Professor Geert Dom, EPA President, said: "Nearly 100% of Generation Z own and use a smartphone. There is already evidence from a variety of cross-sectional, longitudinal and empirical studies implicating smartphone and social media use being factors in the increase in mental distress, self-injurious behaviour and suicidality among this age group. This is an area that must be given further attention so that any detrimental areas can be addressed quickly." 

The European Congress of Psychiatry takes place from 5-8 April 2025 in Madrid, Spain, and represents Europe's largest congress dedicated to psychiatry, with around 1,500 attendees: epa-congress.org. 

Full abstract: 

Gender differences regarding problematic smartphone use, mediating by mental well-being, emotional regulation, and social anxiety in young adult sample [EPA2025-LB-4869] 

Csibi Sándor, Neha Pirwani, Mónika Csibi, Attila Szabo 

Introduction: Research underlay various results concerning the differences focusing on gender in smartphone use and mental issues. Some find no difference, but assessing mental factors reveals the influence of social interactivity, low emotional understanding, and perceived social support variations according to problematic smartphone use. 

Objectives: Our research aims to investigate problematic smartphone use, mental well-being, emotional regulation, and social anxiety as a function of gender to explore specific ways of functioning in the addiction process. 

Methods: The study participants were 400 young adults, of whom 104 were men (26%), 293 were women (73.2%), and three individuals (0.8%) were of another gender. The mean age of the participants was 25.9 years (SD 10.9). Registered answers refer to demographic data (gender, age, smartphone usage habits) as well as psychological measures: a Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS), a Mental Health Continuum Scale (MHC), an Assessing Emotions Scale (AES), and Fear of Negative Perception Questionnaire (FNPQ). 

Results: The results showed that gender showed significant differences in the mediating factors that affect problematic smartphone use. In the mediation model, gender relates significantly related to time spent with smartphones (p=.001) and fear of negative perception (p=.001). The statistical mediation model highlighted the gender-depending significant role of the mediating factors (time of use per day, MHC, AES, FNPQ) in problematic smartphone use. 

Conclusions: Our research highlights gender differences in excessive smartphone use, such as higher social anxiety, which is a higher predisposing factor in women than in men. Gender is a significant indirect determinant of problematic smartphone use.

The Chinese Medical Association has released new guidelines for diagnosing and treating Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children. Addressing challenges like variable symptoms and rising antibiotic resistance (81% for macrolides in China), experts recommend PCR testing for accurate diagnosis, macrolides for mild cases, and tetracyclines for severe infections in older children. Corticosteroids are also advised for severe cases, and judicious antibiotic use is stressed to combat resistance and improve treatment outcomes.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is a bacterial pathogen that causes pneumonia in school-aged children and adolescents. It spreads through respiratory droplets, leading to prolonged cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. While most cases resolve without complications, some become severe and require advanced medical care. Due to variations in disease presentation and rising antibiotic resistance, standardized diagnostic and treatment approaches are essential.

To address these challenges, the Chinese Medical Association has released new guidelines in Pediatric Investigation, led by Professor Baoping Xu, from the Department of Respiratory at Beijing Children's Hospital, on 11 March 2025. These guidelines provide clear recommendations on diagnosis, treatment, and managing complications, ensuring healthcare professionals have access to standardized, evidence-based strategies. Given the overlap of clinical symptoms with other respiratory infections, the guidelines emphasize a multi-faceted diagnostic approach that integrates clinical observations, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

"Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial in preventing unnecessary antibiotic use and ensuring appropriate treatment," said Prof. Xu. "By combining Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, antibody detection, and imaging, we can improve diagnostic precision and reduce misdiagnosis."

PCR, particularly fluorescence quantitative PCR targeting MP-DNA, is highlighted as the gold standard for confirming MPP due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Antibody tests like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination may help identify infections but have limitations, including false positives or negatives depending on infection timing and immune responses. Chest imaging, primarily X-rays, assesses lung involvement and distinguishes MPP from other pneumonias. In severe cases, computed tomography (CT) scans may provide additional insights into lung inflammation and complications.

Treatment strategies depend on infection severity. For mild MPP, macrolide antibiotics like azithromycin remain the first-line therapy due to their effectiveness against M. pneumoniae. However, increasing macrolide resistance, particularly in China, necessitates alternative antibiotics for severe or refractory cases.

For children aged 8 and older, tetracyclines such as minocycline or doxycycline are preferred due to their effectiveness against resistant strains. However, these are generally avoided in younger children due to potential effects on developing teeth. In such cases, macrolides are still used despite resistance concerns. Quinolones, including levofloxacin, are an alternative but require careful monitoring due to potential adverse effects, particularly in younger patients. Physicians must weigh risks against benefits and obtain informed consent before prescribing quinolones.

Severe MPP often involves significant lung inflammation, requiring additional treatments. Corticosteroids, particularly methylprednisolone, are recommended to reduce inflammation and improve respiratory function. However, they should always be used alongside antibiotics, as they do not directly target the infection. The routine use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not supported due to insufficient evidence of its effectiveness for MPP.

Refractory MPP, which does not respond to initial antibiotics, is managed similarly to severe MPP, with alternative antibiotics and corticosteroids when necessary. The guidelines acknowledge the lack of consensus on the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy, highlighting the need for further clinical research.

Beyond medications, the guidelines address managing complications in severe cases. Some children with MPP develop increased D-dimer levels, indicating a higher risk of blood clot formation. To mitigate this, low molecular weight heparin is recommended. In cases of mucus accumulation causing airway blockage, bronchoscopic lavage therapy may be necessary. This procedure, which removes mucus and debris from the airway, is most effective when performed 7 to 14 days after symptom onset, though its use should be based on individual patient needs.

"Antibiotic overuse and misuse are driving resistance, making infections harder to treat. These guidelines emphasize responsible antibiotic use—choosing the right drug, dose, and duration for each case," emphasizes Prof. Xu.

The authors acknowledge that some recommendations rely on expert opinion due to limited high-quality clinical trials. Additionally, while the guidelines primarily focus on diagnosis and treatment, they provide limited information on complications and long-term effects of MPP. Future updates will incorporate new research findings to address these gaps, ensuring healthcare professionals have the most up-to-date strategies for diagnosing and treating MPP, ultimately improving outcomes for affected children.

Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.

FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.

At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.

Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have "an enormous effect on patient safety" and are "antithetical" to Kennedy's promise to bring "radical transparency" to federal health agencies.

"It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff," Lurie said. "Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that."

HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department's plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.

Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.

"What we need to be doing is the opposite of what's happening now: hiring more staff," she said.

Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.

Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what's available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.

All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.

"I think one thing we've learned is that if there's less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse," Morisy said. "I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety."

Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.

During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS' most recent annual FOIA report.

Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.

Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That's why it's important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.

"We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge," Morisy said. "And I just don't see how these things continue to function."

David Rousseau, the publisher of KFF Health News, serves on the board of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

Most handheld Raman spectrometers are built for quick, on-the-spot material analysis, making them particularly valuable for security applications such as identifying illicit drugs. Beyond that, the BRAVO spectrometer is specifically designed with industrial quality control (QC) in mind, streamlining raw material release processes in a way that saves both time and costs. This is especially critical in the pharmaceutical industry, where 100 % material verification is often required.

The BRAVO often provides analytical results for materials at which competitive devices have their challenge. This comes by significant investments in R&D, leading to exceptional performance across Bruker's entire product range. With the BRAVO, the goal was to deliver benchtop-level performance in a handheld device while addressing a key challenge in Raman spectroscopy—the trade-off between fluorescence suppression and sensitivity based on excitation wavelength. This is where SSETM (Sequentially Shifted Excitation) technology comes in, offering the best of both worlds.

For example, this level of performance is well recognized in the scientific community, with the BRAVO widely used for R&D applications, including the analysis of valuable historic paintings.

With its Class 1 laser certification, the BRAVO eliminates the need for additional laser safety measures such as personal protective equipment, designated safety officers, training programs, or access restrictions. Today, the health and safety of employees are more important than ever, and as well an aspiration in product development is to establish designs that are as safe as possible.

In the pharmaceutical industry, providing robust hardware and reliable services is crucial – but equally important is the software. As digitalization continues to shape pharmaceutical QC, seamless system integration and compliance-driven yet efficient software solutions are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of analytical devices in modern QC environments.

A few years ago, Bruker introduced TOUCH software for its OPUS vibrational spectroscopy suite, designed specifically for routine tasks. The BRAVO follows the same intuitive GUI concept, allowing even inexperienced users to quickly learn and operate the device within minutes.

From a data integrity standpoint, BRAVO features a dedicated validation mode that ensures electronic records remain secure, regardless of user role. Data cannot be deleted or modified without authorization, maintaining compliance with the ALCOA+ principles emphasized by the FDA.

First, the BRAVO features a true high-performance spectrograph, expanding its applications beyond traditional quality control. With OPUS, Bruker offers the industry-leading vibrational spectroscopy software suite, also enabling full remote control of the handheld spectrometer—making it a viable option for R&D tasks that don't require a large benchtop system.

Combined with its onboard software and advanced fluorescence mitigation for challenging materials, BRAVO has matured into a highly specialized solution for the pharmaceutical industry - one that is widely recognized and valued by our global customers.

Compared to other analytical techniques, Raman spectroscopy is still relatively young, particularly in industrial applications, making its market and technological evolution highly dynamic. High Throughput Virtual Slit (HTVS™) technology for process Raman applications significantly enhances sensitivity—by more than an order of magnitude – impressing even experts in the field.

Additionally, advancements in Raman imaging eliminate the need for time-consuming point-by-point mappings, making Raman microscopy most accessible to routine applications. These innovations are truly exciting for today's scientists, opening up new possibilities in research and industry.



Dr. Felix Fromm holds a PhD in solid-state physics with a specialization in Raman spectroscopy. Having joined Bruker in 2015 as an application manager for handheld Raman spectroscopy, he has accumulated over 15 years of experience in this field. With his extensive expertise in Raman spectroscopy, combined with his role as a pharmaceutical expert, he plays a key role in Bruker's Validation team.

Bruker Optics, part of the Bruker Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturer and worldwide supplier of Fourier Transform Infrared, Near Infrared and Raman spectrometers.

Recent research published in Nature Medicine highlights the rapid impact that dietary changes can have on immune and metabolic health.

Urbanization and increased availability of processed foods in Africa are shifting dietary patterns, with many people abandoning traditional diets for Western-style diets. 

To explore the effects of this dietary shift, researchers from Radboud University Medical Center and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College investigated the health impacts at the cellular level. 

Their findings indicate that just 2 weeks of adopting a Western diet over a traditional African diet can lead to increased inflammation, weakened immune responses, and disrupted metabolic pathways tied to lifestyle-related diseases.

In contrast, switching from a Western diet to a traditional African diet or consuming traditional fermented beverages may have anti-inflammatory benefits.

While more research is needed, these results support the idea that largely plant-based heritage diets — like traditional African, Mediterranean, and Latin American diets — can improve health and lower the risk of lifestyle-related diseases. 

This randomized controlled trial involved 77 healthy young men, with a median age of 26, residing in the Kilimanjaro region in Northern Tanzania.

Researchers assessed initial eating habits through three 24-hour food diaries recorded on nonconsecutive days, with one diary specifically collected during a festival or weekend.

They conducted the trial with three groups, providing daily meals:

Researchers had five participants in each of the first two groups stick to their usual diets to eliminate any external factors affecting the results. 

Blood samples were taken at three key points: at the start of the study, right after the 2-week dietary intervention or the 1-week fermented beverage intervention, and again 4 weeks after the intervention ended.

The main goal was to investigate changes in the participants' immune and metabolic health, focusing on immune system function, blood inflammation markers, and various metabolic processes.

The researchers' final analysis included only high-quality samples that met specific standards. Results were adjusted for factors including age, body mass index, and physical activity levels.

Their results showed that switching from a traditional African diet to a Western diet for 2 weeks disrupted key metabolic pathways linked to lifestyle-related diseases.

It also appeared to trigger a pro-inflammatory state involving white blood cells, inflammatory proteins in the blood, and changes in gene expression.

Additionally, their immune cells became less effective at responding to pathogens.

Conversely, transitioning from a Western diet to a mostly plant-based traditional African diet or consuming the fermented beverage resulted in mostly anti-inflammatory effects, including reduced inflammatory markers.

Certain immune and metabolic changes remained four weeks after the intervention, suggesting that even short-term dietary modifications might have some lasting effects.

This study may be the first thorough investigation of the health effects linked to a traditional African diet.

“Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet,” study author Quirijn de Mast, MD, PhD, internist-infectious disease specialist from Radboud University Medical Center, said in a press release.

“However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa's rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health.”

– Quirijn de Mast, MD, PhD

Medical News Today spoke with Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study.

He explained that “the shift from a traditional African diet to a Western-style diet resulted in increased inflammation and weakened immune responses, likely due to differences in nutrient composition and microbial exposure.”

The traditional African diet in this study was rich in:

These foods are high in dietary fiber and bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and promote metabolic health. They also encourage a healthy gut microbiome and the production of beneficial metabolites that enhance overall health and well-being.

In addition, Holland emphasized the potential advantages of traditional African fermented foods and beverages, like Mbege, which “play a critical role by enriching the gut microbiome with beneficial microbes and bioactive metabolites that enhance immune function.”

He noted that specific compounds present in Mbege, such as flavonoids, also likely contributed to improved immune responses and vascular health in the individuals who consumed the fermented beverage.

In contrast to the nutrient-rich traditional African diet, the Western diet in the study lacked whole foods and included items such as:

Holland pointed out that “Western diets are typically high in refined sugars, saturated fats, and processed foods, which can promote inflammation and oxidative stress and disrupt immune regulation.”

This likely results from the direct impact of cholesterol, saturated fats, and sugars on immune and metabolic health, as well as indirect effects through changes in gut bacteria and weight gain, according to the researchers.

“Given that Westernized diets promote chronic diseases, this study's results are unsurprising—processed foods drive inflammation, whereas healthy traditional diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds help mitigate metabolic and immune dysfunction.”

– Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS

While the study showed promising results, the authors acknowledge a few limitations. These include the short duration of the research, a small sample size consisting only of men, and unrestricted food intake, which may have led to weight changes affecting immune and metabolic profiles.

Despite these limitations, Mast emphasized the significant impact of dietary changes, even over just two weeks. He stated that the “study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body.”

“At the same time,” he said, “we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be.”

“Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well,” Mast noted.

Holland agreed, saying that “these findings reinforce the idea that diet has a rapid and lasting impact on immune and metabolic health.” 

“Even short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects, suggesting that integrating more traditional, whole-food-based eating patterns could be a key strategy in disease prevention,” he added. 

In conclusion, Holland noted that “by preserving and adapting traditional plant-rich dietary patterns, individuals can enhance long-term health while maintaining cultural and regional food heritage.”

Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects millions worldwide, especially women, causing unrelenting dryness of the mouth and eyes. These symptoms severely impact daily life — making it hard to speak, eat, or sleep. Though doctors have long known the immune system targets the body's own moisture-producing glands, the exact mechanism that shuts down saliva production remained a mystery. Scientists had clues that intercellular "zipper-like" structures were involved but lacked a clear picture of what failed, and how to fix it. The burning question lingered: What's tearing open these cellular zippers — and can we seal them shut again?

On March 19, 2025, researchers at Peking University reported a series of pivotal findings that answer this very question. Their study (DOI: 10.1038/s41368-025-00349-9), published in the International Journal of Oral Science, revealed that tricellulin — a protein acting as a clasp at the three-way junctions of glandular cells — is destroyed early in the progression of Sjögren's syndrome. Using human tissue samples and specialized mice, the team traced the damage to a specific inflammatory pathway. Most notably, they tested two intervention strategies: an investigational drug (AT1001) and a molecule that blocks microRNA-145. Both approaches successfully restored saliva secretion in mice, demonstrating that the damage is not only identifiable but also reversible.

The research showed that tricellulin functions as the glue at three-cell junctions in saliva glands. Its loss causes leakiness and disrupts normal secretion. Interferon-gamma and other inflammatory molecules launch a molecular cascade: they activate the JAK/STAT1 pathway, boosting levels of microRNA-145, which then targets and dismantles tricellulin. To confirm tricellulin's central role, scientists engineered mice lacking the protein — and reproduced Sjögren's symptoms almost exactly. The breakthrough came when they reversed this engineered damage: AT1001 repaired the cell junctions, while microRNA-145 inhibitors stopped the breakdown before it began. Both restored normal gland function, offering a potential blueprint for human treatment.

This changes how we think about treating Sjögren's syndrome. We're moving beyond simply calming inflammation — now we can fix the actual structural damage in the glands. It's like repairing a burst pipe instead of just drying the floor. What's even more encouraging is that both approaches worked, which gives us real confidence in developing patient-ready therapies."

Dr. Xin Cong, lead researcher

This discovery holds vast potential for the millions struggling with Sjögren's dry mouth. Early detection of tricellulin loss could lead to preemptive care before irreversible damage sets in. The repurposing of AT1001, already tested for other illnesses, might accelerate clinical trials. Meanwhile, the microRNA-145 insight offers a gateway to highly targeted therapies that halt the problem at its root. Beyond Sjögren's, this research could extend to other disorders involving damaged glands or leaky epithelial barriers — including dry eye disease and certain gut conditions. While clinical trials in humans are the next step, the leap from symptom management to glandular repair marks a watershed moment in autoimmune disease research.

New research led by Western Sydney University finds limited evidence on the association between health literacy and medication adherence among ethnic minority adults living with Type 2 Diabetes.

Published in BMC Public Health, the research team from Western Sydney University and the University of Sydney reviewed seven global studies investigating reduced medication adherence and lower levels of health literacy, however, only one study found a significant association between the two factors and to date none have been based in Australia.

Lead author, PhD Candidate, Jinal Parmar from Western Sydney University's School of Health Sciences said the review has revealed the need for more targeted studies to address disparities in cultural and linguistic considerations of Type 2 Diabetes patients from ethnic minorities in Western Sydney.

“People from ethnic minorities face significant barriers in accessing diabetes care, including facing cultural and language barriers, and low health literacy. There is a need for more targeted strategies to improve access and health outcomes for these communities,” said Jinal.

“Health promotion experts need to co-design resources with ethnic minority groups to address this problem. More studies are needed globally, but especially in the Greater Western Sydney region.”

Senior author, Associate Professor Amit Arora from Western's School of Health Sciences and Translational Health Research Institute said that one of the key recommendations of the review is that health services and policy makers need to consider cultural safety training for healthcare professionals providing care to people with Type 2 Diabetes.

Health professionals should be using techniques such as teach-back and asking patients to repeat information in their own words, visual aids, and using simple language to confirm understanding and address any gaps.”

Amit Arora, Senior author, Associate Professor, Western's School of Health Sciences and Translational Health Research Institute

“By ensuring ethnic minority groups understand their diabetes management instructions, patients are empowered in making informed decisions and remain in control of their treatment.”

Dr Tien-Ming Hng, Endocrinologist at Western Sydney Local Health District and Conjoint Associate Professor at Western Sydney University's School of Medicine emphasized the need for research-driven insights to improve patient outcomes.

Dr Hng works with culturally diverse communities in clinics in Western Sydney and can see the importance of addressing the challenges of medication adherence.

“The rates of Type 2 diabetes in Western Sydney are higher relative to other parts of metropolitan Sydney,” said Associate Professor Hng.

“Multiple medications are sometimes needed to achieve treatment goals, and regular use is key to their success. There are potentially many factors that can influence medication use within specific ethnic groups, and studies that inform us of these challenges will help us treat our patients better.”

 April 07, 2025  

BOSTON — In the staging of liver fibrosis in the post-liver transplant setting, readings from noninvasive tests commonly have major discrepancies when compared with liver biopsy results, particularly in cases of severe steatosis, according to the results of a new study.

Our findings support liver biopsy as “the gold standard for confirmation of allograft fibrosis that is predicted by transient elastography and assessment of its underlying cause,” said first study author Nazire Albayrak, MD, of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.

Liver fibrosis is known to be the main driver of chronic liver disease as well as a key factor influencing post-liver transplant morbidity and mortality.

While a liver biopsy is indeed considered the gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis, such biopsies have important drawbacks, including the involvement of invasive surgery, discomfort, the potential for complications, and the consumption of time.

To help assist in the assessment of fibrosis, noninvasive tests, including serum biomarker indices and hepatic imaging techniques, have gained interest and have been validated in the detection and monitoring of chronic liver disease.

Although these tests have been adopted for clinical use post-liver transplant, research is lacking on their reliability in this setting, the study authors noted here at the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology 2025 Annual Meeting. 

To compare the results of such tests with confirmed assessments on liver biopsy, Albayrak and colleagues evaluated results on the two most widely used noninvasive tests: FibroScan, which uses ultrasound to assess liver stiffness, and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), an index that calculates liver fibrosis with a score based on age, platelet count, and levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.

They identified 108 liver transplant recipients who had received a liver biopsy between 2015 and 2024 and who had testing with FibroScan within 6 months of transplant and lab values within 1 month.

Liver biopsies with < 7 portal tracts and/or < 1 cm in total core length were excluded.

The median age of the study participants was 63 years, 54% were male, and the median graft age was 5.4 years. More than half had type 2 diabetes (60.1%) and/or obesity (58%).

The most common post-transplant major liver biopsy diagnoses included recurrent and new steatotic liver disease (45.4% and 26.8%, respectively), recurrent hepatitis C (8.3%), and organ rejection (7.4%).

All of the patients with recurrent steatotic liver disease had diabetes, while 82.7% of patients with new steatotic liver disease had diabetes and/or obesity.

The patients had a median fibrosis stage of 1, as determined by trichrome stain. A median stiffness of 8.2 kPa and a FIB-4 of 2.032 were both predictors of stage 2 fibrosis.

Importantly, for patients with no fibrosis, FibroScan and FIB-4 each overestimated the degree of fibrosis (P < .0001); FIB-4 also predicted more fibrosis than liver biopsy in stage 1 of disease (P < .0001).

Overall, major discrepancies occurred in 25% of cases, and most were associated with severe stenosis, observed on 62.5% of biopsies and imaging.

Specific over-assessments included 24% (21/88) of stage F0-2 cases that were wrongfully described as stage F3-4 on FibroScan.

Conversely, 30% (6/20) of stage F3-4 cases on liver biopsy were undercalled as stage F0-2 on FibroScan.

On FIB-4 scoring, 29.6% (26/88) that were stage F0-2 were called stage F3-4, while 45% (9/20) of patients that were stage F3-4 were undercalled as stage F0-2.

Specific examples of cases involving discrepancies included:

The high rate of discrepancies observed in the study could have been related to the fact that a higher proportion of patients had obesity, and as many as 40% had moderate to severe steatosis, Albayrak cautioned.

“Also, one of the overcalls was due to amyloid infiltration,” she said.

The bottom-line result remains, however, that “major discrepancies in fibrosis assessment occurred in more than 50% of cases,” in the study, she concluded.

Further commenting on the issue, Nigar Anjuman Khurram, MD, of the UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, added that various other factors are known to elevate estimations of fibrosis potentially falsely on FibroScan.

“Physiological factors such as hepatic inflammation, cholestasis, and vascular congestion may [also] alter liver stiffness readings, compromising accuracy,” she told Medscape Medical News.

“Additionally, technical considerations, including probe positioning, patient cooperation, and operator proficiency, can introduce measurement variability,” she said.

Khurram presented separate research at the meeting showing that yet another factor — ferritin — may also not be as reliably predictive of liver fibrosis as expected.

“Ferritin estimation alone, in the absence of liver biopsy, remains a key parameter in guiding hemochromatosis management,” she said. However, “in our study, we observed that despite normal serum ferritin levels, some patients exhibited fibrosis progression to advanced stages, as confirmed by histological examination.”

These findings indicate that ferritin levels, “while useful clinically to guide therapy, cannot be used to replace liver biopsy as a gold standard,” said Khurram.

Albayrak and Khurram had no disclosures to report.

Underscoring the massive scale of America's medical debt problem, a New York-based nonprofit has struck a deal to pay off old medical bills for an estimated 20 million people.

Undue Medical Debt, which buys patient debt, is retiring $30 billion worth of unpaid bills in a single transaction with Pendrick Capital Partners, a Virginia-based debt trading company. The average patient debt being retired is $1,100, according to the nonprofit, with some reaching the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The deal will prevent the debt being sold and protect millions of people from being targeted by collectors. But even proponents of retiring patient debt acknowledge that these deals cannot solve a crisis that now touches around 100 million people in the U.S.

"We don't think that the way we finance health care is sustainable," Undue Medical Debt chief executive Allison Sesso said in an interview with KFF Health News. "Medical debt has unreasonable expectations," she said. "The people who owe the debts can't pay."

In the past year alone, Americans borrowed an estimated $74 billion to pay for health care, a nationwide West Health-Gallup survey found. And even those who benefit from Undue's debt relief may have other medical debt that won't be relieved.

This large purchase also highlights the challenges that debt collectors, hospitals, and other health care providers face as patients rack up big bills that aren't covered by their health insurance.

Pendrick's chief executive, Chris Eastman, declined several requests to be interviewed about the debt sale, which has not been previously reported. But Eastman acknowledged in a 2024 podcast episode that collecting medical debts has grown more challenging as regulators have restricted how collectors can pursue patients.

Pendrick has now shuttered, which Sesso said provided strong motivation for this deal. "This was a really great opportunity to get a debt buyer out of the market," she said.

Undue Medical Debt pioneered its debt relief strategy a decade ago, leveraging charitable donations to buy medical debt from debt trading companies at steeply discounted prices and then freeing patients from the obligation to pay.

The nonprofit now buys debts directly from hospitals, as well. And it is working with about two dozen state and local governments to leverage public money to relieve medical debt in communities from Los Angeles County to Cleveland to the state of Connecticut.

The approach has been controversial. And Undue Medical Debt's record-setting purchase — financed by a mix of philanthropy and taxpayer dollars — is likely to stoke more debate over the value of paying collectors for medical debts.

"The approach is just treating the symptoms and not the disease," said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president at the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that has led efforts to restrict aggressive hospital collections. Benjamin and other advocates say systemic changes such as ensuring hospitals offer sufficient financial aid to patients and reining in high medical prices would be more valuable in preventing people from sinking into debt.

But many government officials see retiring people's unpaid medical bills as part of a larger strategy to make it easier for patients to avoid debt in the first place.

"Turning off the tap is what's really important in the long run," said Naman Shah, a physician who directs medical affairs at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The county is working to improve local hospital financial aid programs for patients. But Shah said debt relief is key, as well.

"It's easy to criticize band-aids when you're not the one who's cut," he said. "As a physician, I take care of people who have cuts, and I know the importance of stitching them back up."

Undue Medical Debt's latest deal, which it is spending $36 million to close, will help patients nationwide, according to the nonprofit. But about half the estimated 20 million people whose debts Pendrick owned live in just two states: Texas or Florida.

Neither has expanded Medicaid coverage through the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a key tool that researchers have found bolsters patients' financial security by protecting them from big medical bills and debt.

The patients eligible for debt relief have incomes at or below four times the federal poverty level, about $63,000 for a single person, or debts that exceed 5% of their incomes.

About half the debts are also more than seven years old. These have been donated to Undue Medical Debt by Pendrick, the group reported.

The nonprofit plans to pay for the rest of the debts over the next year and a half, though all collections have stopped against patients. It also plans to spend an additional $40 million — or $2 a person — to process the debts, find patients, and inform them that their debts have been relieved.

Sesso, Undue's chief executive, said she hopes the debt purchase will keep policymakers focused on enacting longer-term solutions to the nation's medical debt crisis.

She applauded state leaders for taking steps to bar medical debts from their residents' credit scores. But she said action is also needed in Washington, D.C. However, the Trump administration has suspended regulations enacted under former President Joe Biden that would have barred credit reporting of medical debt nationally, and congressional Republicans are now moving to revoke the new rules.

"There is a limit to what state and local governments can do to solve this problem," Sesso said. "It's really a national problem that has to be solved at the national level."

A major international study finds that even the wealthiest Americans don't live as long as their European peers—raising tough questions about inequality, healthcare, and policy failure in the U.S.

Study: Association between Wealth and Mortality in the United States and Europe. Image Credit: Khongtham / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers examined the relationship between wealth and mortality among individuals aged 50 to 85 in Europe and the United States.

They found that having more wealth was associated with lower mortality in both regions; however, the survival gap between the wealthiest and poorest individuals was greater in the U.S. compared to Europe. Wealthy Europeans had better survival rates than wealthy Americans.

Importantly, the wealthiest Americans had survival rates similar to the poorest individuals in northern and western Europe, indicating systemic disadvantages across the U.S. population.

The study tracked survival rates over specific follow-up periods (2, 5, and 8 years), revealing that even short-term gaps in wealth predicted mortality differences. Wealthy Europeans maintained their survival advantage consistently across all time frames.

Over the past six decades, the United States has experienced a significant rise in wealth inequality, as resources have shifted from middle-class households to the wealthiest Americans. While other high-income nations have also seen rising inequality, this has been to a lesser degree.

At the same time, life expectancy for Americans has fallen below that of other wealthy nations and continues to decline, particularly among poorer groups. Wealth, defined as the total resources and assets that an individual controls, is crucial for health in older age.

Unlike income, which can be redistributed through taxation, wealth inequality is more challenging to correct and tends to persist across generations. Wealth becomes especially important after retirement, influencing access to long-term care, healthcare, and social support.

Comparing the associations between health and wealth outcomes in the U.S. and Europe, where social support and healthcare systems differ, may reveal whether America's poorer life expectancy is due to wider disparities or consistently increased mortality for all groups.

In addition, the study focused on relative wealth within countries rather than absolute wealth, which allowed researchers to assess how an individual's standing within their national wealth distribution relates to survival.

Switzerland and Poland stood at opposite extremes of Europe's wealth spectrum, with median wealth in Switzerland (€157,400) over 150 times higher than in Poland (€800). This stark contrast shaped regional mortality patterns.

In this study, the researchers used data from 2010 to 2022 to investigate how wealth correlates with mortality in older adults across 16 European countries and the U.S. They utilized data from two large surveys: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the U.S. and the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).

Both surveys collect detailed information on health, wealth, education, residence, and demographics for adults aged 50 and older. The researchers included participants who were aged 50–85 at baseline in 2010 and followed them until 2022. Proxy interviews were conducted to collect information from participants who had passed away.

To account for regional differences, Europe was divided into three groups: Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and Northern and Western Europe. Total non-housing assets measured wealth, and participants were categorized into wealth quartiles based on age group and country. The primary outcome measured was mortality from all causes between 2010 and 2022, with death rates calculated in thousands of person-years.

The team adjusted their analyses for several factors measured at the start of the study: age group, marital status, sex, education (whether any college education was received or not), rural versus non-rural residence, smoking status (current smoker or nonsmoker), and the presence of long-term health conditions.

Mortality risks were assessed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox proportional-hazards models to quantify the relationship between mortality and wealth. American mortality patterns were also analyzed by Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West).

They also assessed how the relationship between wealth and mortality changed over time at 2, 5, and 8 years of follow-up, and how this association varied across age groups.

The U.S. showed a “survivor effect”: Poorer Americans died so disproportionately in their 50s and 60s that older cohorts had higher average wealth—a trend less pronounced in Europe.

The research team analyzed data from 73,838 participants aged 50–85 across the United States and 16 European countries, with a median follow-up of 10 years. Participants in northern and western Europe had higher levels of education and wealth compared to those in southern and eastern Europe, as well as in the United States.

The median wealth was highest in Switzerland (€157,400) and lowest in Poland (€800), while in the U.S., it varied widely across regions. Overall, 18.7% of participants died during the study period, with mortality rates ranging from 2.9 per 1000 person-years in northern and western Europe to 6.5 per 1000 person-years in the United States.

Wealth was strongly associated with survival: participants in higher wealth quartiles had significantly lower risks of death compared to those in the poorest quartile. The poorest American participants had worse survival rates than even the poorest Europeans.

The survival disparity by wealth was greatest among those aged 50 to 59 years, and diminished in older age groups, suggesting that the protective effect of wealth is more pronounced in earlier old age.

Regional gaps within the United States were notable, with the Midwest and South exhibiting the greatest disparities in survival by wealth. Adjusted hazard ratios showed that wealthier participants had substantially lower mortality risks.

Europeans, particularly those from northern and western Europe, consistently showed lower mortality rates than their counterparts in the United States over two, five, and eight years of follow-up.

The researchers observed a stronger 'survivor effect' in the U.S., where poorer individuals died disproportionately earlier, skewing the older population toward higher wealth levels.

Younger adults (50–59 years) saw the strongest link between wealth and survival, suggesting financial resources matter most during the transition into older age. The protective effect of wealth weakened gradually after 65.

This study highlights a strong link between wealth and survival among older adults across the U.S. and Europe, with poorer Americans facing particularly high mortality rates. The wealthiest Americans had survival rates similar to those of the poorest in northern and western Europe. Wealth-related survival gaps were evident, especially in the U.S. Midwest and South.

Although the study reported differences in hazard ratios over time intervals, it did not explicitly conclude that survival gaps widened over time.

These findings challenge the assumption that wealthy Americans enjoy equal or superior health outcomes compared to their European peers and suggest that systemic disadvantages affect even the most privileged socioeconomic groups in the U.S.

Limitations of this study include potential differences in wealth reporting, healthcare access, and unmeasured confounders between countries. Further study is needed to explore the mechanisms linking wealth and mortality, including healthcare quality, social policies, and lifestyle factors, in order to better understand cross-national differences and inform interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities.

The study also lacked racial and ethnic data, limiting the ability to assess how disparities in wealth and health intersect among minority populations in the U.S.

The authors emphasize that while weaker social structures may explain some disparities, additional factors such as behavioral, cultural, and environmental influences may play a role in shaping health outcomes across all wealth strata.

A new genetic study reveals that some gut bacteria and blood chemicals aren't just linked to short stature—they may be causing it, opening doors to microbiota-based interventions for childhood growth issues.

Study: Causal relationship between gut microbiota, metabolites, and short stature: a Mendelian randomization study. Image Credit: Tomsickova Tatyana / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Pediatric Research, researchers investigated the causal relationship between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and the risk of short stature (SS).

SS is a common endocrine and metabolic disease in children, defined as a height below the third percentile or two standard deviations below the mean height of children of the same age, sex, and race under comparable growth conditions. In 2019, there were around 144 million children with stunted height globally. Various epigenetic, environmental, and genetic factors regulate SS. Around 60% of children with SS have unknown pathogenesis and unidentifiable etiology, viz., idiopathic SS (ISS).

One study suggested that the gut microbiota and metabolites contribute to human bone health. Further, another study reported shorter femur lengths in germ-free mice, and colonization by normal gut flora increased bone formation rate and femur length. This suggests that gut microbiota play a vital role in longitudinal bone growth. While studies have assessed associations between SS and gut microbiota, they are observational; thus, causal relationships cannot be inferred.

This is the first study to use Mendelian randomization to investigate causality between gut microbiota, blood metabolites, and SS.

Children with higher Prevotella9 levels showed reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) activity, a key hormone for bone development, suggesting a direct microbiome-growth axis.

In the present study, researchers investigated the causal relationship between SS, blood metabolites, and gut microbiota, as well as how blood metabolites influence this relationship. They performed a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data. GWAS summary data on SS, gut microbiota, and metabolomics were acquired from separate studies.

The GWAS data for short stature were obtained from the FinnGen R9 dataset, comprising 611 cases and 361,988 controls, with a mean age of approximately 8 years. Notably, the GWAS data were derived primarily from European populations, which may limit generalizability to other ethnic groups.

Instrumental variables were selected if the single-nucleotide polymorphism loci showed significant associations with the exposure. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was the primary MR method, while simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median, and MR Egger regression were complementary methods. MR-Egger intercept was used to assess horizontal pleiotropy. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic. The causal relationship was deemed stable if the effect directions of the complementary methods were consistent with the findings of the IVW analysis.

Additionally, a two-step mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the mediation of blood metabolites in the association between SS and the gut microbiota.

The gut genus Roseburia produces butyrate, a fatty acid previously linked to bone density in mice, but its role in human height remained unexplored until this study.

The IVW analysis suggested seven causal relationships between gut microbiota and SS. After validation with complementary methods, six effect directions were in line with IVW results. Three genera (Alloprevotella, Prevotella9, and FamilyXIIIAD3011) were positively associated with the risk of SS, and three others (Parasutterella, Roseburia, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1) were negatively associated. The protective role of Parasutterella may relate to its involvement in testosterone and bile acid metabolism, as suggested in prior research.

In addition, the team performed a reverse MR analysis to examine whether SS has a causal effect on identified genera. This revealed no reverse causality between SS and these gut microbes. Furthermore, IVW results revealed six causal relationships between blood metabolites and SS, and after validation with complementary methods, five of the effect directions were concordant with the IVW results.

Three metabolites (caffeine, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and laurate) were negatively associated with SS risk, and two (cyclo (leu-pro) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate) were positively associated. The odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.08 to 16.12, demonstrating substantial variation in effect size.

While caffeine showed a protective effect here, the authors caution that animal studies have reported caffeine may inhibit bone growth, suggesting this finding warrants further investigation. There was no heterogeneity or pleiotropy. Furthermore, the mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 on SS through 4-hydroxyhippurate, with a mediation effect proportion of 43.03%. This metabolite is linked to flavonoid metabolism, which depends on gut microbiota for processing.

The five metabolites identified span four major metabolic pathways: lipid, amino acid, peptide, and xenobiotic (compounds not naturally produced by the body, such as dietary or environmental chemicals).

No association was found between vitamin D metabolites and short stature, contradicting hypotheses that micronutrient deficiencies dominate growth disorder risks.

The study examined causal relationships between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and SS risk. The team identified Alloprevotella, FamilyXIIIAD3011, and Prevotella9 as risk factors for SS. Indeed, a previous study reported a higher abundance of Prevotella in children with ISS compared to healthy children, and this level returned to normal upon treatment with recombinant human growth hormone.

In contrast, Roseburia, Parasutterella, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 were protective factors for SS. Five blood metabolites were causally related to SS. Specifically, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate and cyclo(Leu-Pro) were associated with a higher risk of SS. In contrast, caffeine, laurate, and 4-hydroxyhippurate were associated with a lower SS risk. The mediation analysis revealed a novel mediating role of 4-hydroxyhippurate in the relationship between SS and Clostridium sensu stricto 1.

Taken together, the findings illustrate causal relationships between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and SS and that 4-hydroxyhippurate mediates the effect of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 on SS. The effect directions of different methods were consistent, and there was no heterogeneity or reverse causality. However, the study's reliance on genus-level microbiota data limits resolution, and species- or strain-specific effects remain unexplored. The lack of demographic subgroup analysis also limits insight into how these associations may differ across age, sex, or ancestry groups. Overall, future clinical diagnosis and treatment of SS should consider the regulation of gut microbiota.

New evidence reveals that treating SIBO with antibiotics, diet, and supplements dramatically boosts quality of life—even when test results don't show full recovery.

Study: Should We Treat SIBO Patients? Impact on Quality of Life and Response to Comprehensive Treatment: A Real-World Clinical Practice Study. Image Credit: Pepermpron / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Spain assessed the effectiveness of an integrated treatment approach in enhancing the quality of life for patients with Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO).

Did you know that over half of the people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) might actually have SIBO? SIBO occurs when bacteria excessively grow in the small intestine, causing bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Despite affecting millions globally, healthcare providers frequently underestimate or misdiagnose this condition, limiting proper treatment. Patients experience reduced productivity, compromised mental health, and disrupted social lives, significantly impacting their quality of life. In addition to this underrecognition, diagnostic methods such as breath testing have come under scrutiny, with recent clinical guidelines suggesting that their reliability may be limited. Given the lack of clarity on the most effective management strategies and limited data on long-term outcomes, more targeted research is essential to optimize treatments and improve patient well-being.

Blood tests revealed reduced inflammation markers (C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin) in 68% of participants, linking symptom improvement to measurable biological changes.

The present study involved 179 adult patients diagnosed with either hydrogen-predominant (H2-SIBO) or methane-predominant (CH4-SIBO) small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients were recruited between November 2021 and March 2023 from Sagunto Hospital and Casa de Salud Hospital in Valencia, Spain. Diagnosis relied on breath tests measuring hydrogen and methane gas after ingestion of lactulose or lactitol, where gas increases above certain thresholds indicated SIBO.

Participants underwent comprehensive treatment, guided by gastroenterologists and nutritionists, tailored according to gas phenotype (H₂ or CH₄) as per real-world clinical protocols. All patients initially received antibiotic therapy: rifaximin alone for H2-SIBO and a combination of rifaximin and neomycin for CH4-SIBO, supplemented with herbal treatments included in the Valencian Digestive Institute (IVADI) protocol, such as oregano oil, peppermint, and berberine. This pharmacological approach was supported by dietary intervention using the low-Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAP) diet, carefully personalized by dietitians to maximize adherence.

Additionally, gut health supplements, including probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum) and L-glutamine, were administered. The quality of life improvements were evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, one month, and three months post-baseline. These questionnaires assessed overall health (EuroQOL-5D), IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL), gastrointestinal symptom severity (GSRS), and stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale). Follow-ups included repeated breath tests and blood and stool analyses to monitor treatment response and health status.

Herbal antimicrobials (oregano oil, berberine) were standardized as part of the Valencian Digestive Institute's clinical protocol, reflecting regional trends in integrating phytotherapy with conventional medicine.

After the 90-day comprehensive treatment regimen, substantial improvements were observed across various health indicators. Although breath test normalization (gas excretion returning to healthy levels) occurred in only 41.3% of participants, a significant majority (72.6%) reported meaningful clinical improvement, demonstrating a discrepancy between objective test results and subjective symptom relief.

The quality of life, as assessed by the EuroQOL-5D, showed substantial improvements for all patients, indicating an enhanced overall health perception. All participants reported improved self-perceived health status, even those who did not achieve gas normalization, further underscoring the subjective benefit of treatment. Patients who experienced symptom improvement reported notably higher scores, highlighting the importance of subjective health perception in managing SIBO. Specifically, those who achieved clinical relief had significantly better scores across the categories of mental health, emotional well-being, physical energy, and social interaction.

Using the GSRS, patients exhibited a significant reduction in symptom severity, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation, with scores decreasing substantially from baseline to the end of the study period. However, there were no statistically significant differences in GSRS score improvements between patients who normalized gas levels and those who did not. Interestingly, symptom improvement occurred independently of gas normalization, suggesting that treatment effectiveness in symptom relief might depend more on overall microbiome health and dietary factors than solely bacterial reduction.

Stool consistency, assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale, demonstrated marked normalization. Initially, most patients experienced abnormal stool types associated with either constipation or diarrhea. Post-treatment, a significant shift towards normal stool consistency was observed, directly correlating with better patient comfort and daily function.

Anxiety/depression scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) dropped by 40% in patients achieving stool consistency normalization, tying physical symptom relief directly to mental health gains.

The IBS Quality of Life questionnaire revealed substantial improvements across all sub-domains, including emotional and psychological health, physical activity, dietary adaptations, and social engagement. Although direct psychological outcomes such as anxiety or depression were not measured in the study, improvements in these domains are consistent with findings from related literature. These psychological benefits are likely due to the reduction of physical symptoms and improved dietary habits, which in turn lead to greater confidence in social settings and daily activities.

Regression analysis underscored the importance of initial self-perceived well-being in predicting successful symptom resolution. Patients who began the treatment with a higher subjective perception of health exhibited a greater likelihood of clinical improvement, highlighting the psychological component as an integral part of treatment outcomes.

To summarize, this study demonstrates that a holistic therapeutic approach significantly improves the quality of life and clinical outcomes for SIBO patients, emphasizing the necessity for individualized treatments that address diet, microbiota balance, and symptom relief. Despite moderate normalization of diagnostic test results, substantial clinical improvement highlights the importance of patient-reported outcomes. This is one of the first large-scale studies to specifically evaluate quality-of-life outcomes in SIBO patients using validated tools, making it a unique contribution to the field. These findings underscore the critical need for increased awareness and acceptance among healthcare providers of comprehensive SIBO management strategies. However, the authors also acknowledge key limitations, including the lack of a placebo or control group and the difficulty in isolating the effects of individual treatment components.

Future research should investigate psychological interventions, long-term sustainability, and personalized diets to better address the profound impact of SIBO on patients' daily lives, ultimately improving care standards and patient well-being globally.

New study reveals how dairy products like non-fermented milk and cheese may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, while fermented options provide a surprising protective effect. Find out which dairy could be a game-changer for your health!

A new study involving Swedish adults finds that high intake of non-fermented milk and cheese can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. The study findings are published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels, is becoming a major public health concern worldwide, with a projected increase in its prevalence from 537 million in 2021 to 783 million by 2045. Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of all diabetic cases.

Diet is one of the major modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Dairy products are vital components of any diet, and the dietary components present in these products are considered essential for growth and immune function.

A dairy-linked xenobiotic—likely from pesticides or veterinary drugs in cattle feed—was strongly tied to non-fermented milk intake. Its role in human metabolism remains unknown, but it could signal industrial farming's indirect health impacts.

Regarding the associations between dairy product intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes, studies have produced mixed results, with some reporting inverse associations and others suggesting neutral associations.

Existing evidence also suggests a link between higher intake of dairy products and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, studies investigating diabetes risk with very high intakes are lacking due to a lack of data among populations with high dairy consumption.

Sweden is among the countries with the highest intake of dairy products worldwide. Various dairy products are consumed in regular diets in this country. These factors present a suitable opportunity for researchers to investigate the association between various types of dairy products and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a particular focus on the level of consumption.

In this study, researchers utilized high-quality dietary data from a group of Swedish adults to investigate the impact of high intakes of different dairy products on the risk of type 2 diabetes. They also explored plasma metabolites associated with dairy intake.

The study analyzed dairy intake data from 26,461 Swedish individuals who participated in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) between 1991 and 1996 and were followed up until December 31, 2020.

Dairy products analyzed in the study included non-fermented milk, fermented milk (yogurt and sour milk), cheese, cream, and butter.

To identify plasma metabolites associated with dairy intake, a subgroup of 893 participants with data on metabolomics and dairy intake was analyzed separately in this study. Metabolites are end products of metabolic reactions that serve as crucial biomarkers of dietary intake. Assessment of plasma metabolite levels can provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between dairy products and type 2 diabetes.

Fermented milk's arabonate/xylonate isn't just a biomarker: It may reflect gut microbes breaking down plant fibers more efficiently, linking yogurt consumption to improved glucose processing.

About 17% of study participants (4,552 out of 26,461 participants) developed type 2 diabetes during the average follow-up period of 24 years.

The analysis, adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, dietary intake, and body mass index (BMI), revealed that high consumption of non-fermented milk and cheese can significantly increase the risk of developing diabetes; however, these associations were attenuated after accounting for BMI (e.g., non-fermented milk hazard ratio [HR] dropped from 1.40 to 1.15), suggesting body weight may partially mediate the observed effects. In contrast, high consumption of fermented milk, cream, and butter was associated with significantly reduced risk of diabetes.

Specifically, the study found that a 100-gram increase in daily intake of non-fermented milk and fermented milk is associated with a 4% increased risk and a 3% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, respectively.

Notably, the study found that the association between dairy product intake and diabetes risk is independent of participants' socioeconomic status. Similarly, no significant impact of participants' gender was observed on the association between intakes of non-fermented milk, fermented milk, cream, and butter and the risk of diabetes. However, the negative impact of cheese intake on diabetes risk was observed more strongly in male participants, a notable sex-specific finding, but not in female participants.

By analyzing metabolomic data, the study identified 45, 48, 12, 27, and 46 metabolites that were distinctly associated with the intakes of non-fermented milk, fermented milk, cheese, cream, and butter, respectively.

Plasma metabolite profiles of fermented milk exhibited positive associations with intakes of vegetables, fruits, and dietary fibers, and inverse associations with meat intake. In contrast, the metabolite profile of butter exhibited inverse associations with dietary fiber intake.

Butter's unexpected benefit (lower diabetes risk) correlated with metabolites also found in nuts and seeds, hinting that butter might share bioactive compounds with plant fats when consumed minimally.

The study reveals that high intake of non-fermented milk can significantly increase type 2 diabetes risk among Swedish men and women. A similar positive association between very high cheese intake and diabetes risk has also been observed in the study. However, this association is restricted only to male participants.

In contrast to the modest health impact of these dairy products, the study finds that higher intakes of fermented milk, cream, and butter have modest protective effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes among both Swedish men and women. These protective associations were weaker after adjusting for BMI (e.g., butter HR increased from 0.82 to 0.86), implying that body weight may play a mediating role.

Notably, the study identifies sphingomyelins as robust plasma biomarkers of dairy intake. Furthermore, a strong association was observed between a xenobiotic metabolite and non-fermented milk intake in the study. This metabolite, which belongs to the class of organic compounds known as salicylic acids, can serve as a novel biomarker for dairy intake.

For fermented milk, the strongest association has been observed with arabonate/xylonate, a metabolite associated with pentose metabolism. Probiotics in fermented milk may be involved in this process. For cheese, the study identifies three novel plasma biomarkers that need further investigation for a more conclusive interpretation.

The study measured dairy intake only at baseline. This could be a potential limitation, as any changes in dairy intake during the 24-year follow-up period may influence the observed associations with diabetes risk.

Moreover, the study was conducted with Swedish middle-aged participants, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to populations of different ethnicities and age groups.

TOPICS:

A Columbia native and Rock Bridge High School graduate designed a poster that was selected as the 2026 FIFA World Cup poster representing Kansas City. 

Jadie Arnett, now a Kansas City resident, submitted a poster design for the 2026 World Cup.  FIFA held a design contest for each of the 16 host cities.

"I'm trying to soak in every minute because it really is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I'm just thrilled to be here," Arnett said.



Arnett credited her AP art teachers at Rockbridge and the Columbia Area Career Center as catalysts of her vocation.

"I always loved art, but they were who made me feel like I could do this professionally," she said. "And then the career center right off Rock Bridge was when I first started taking graphic design classes."

The poster, titled "Woven Together," featured a scarf design that Arnett said was to symbolize how Kansas City weaves the state of Missouri and Kansas together. 

Arnett described the experience of having her poster shown worldwide for the World Cup as "unreal."

"It leaves me speechless," she said. "The FIFA World Cup is maybe the biggest thing in sports. It just leaves me ecstatic."

Kansas City is scheduled to host six World Cup matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The initiative aims to give back to teachers. 


Henkel's brand Dial announced its new Clean Sheet program in collaboration with the U.S. Soccer Federation. For every clean sheet in a U.S. Men's and Women's Soccer match, Dial will donate an additional $50,000 on top of the $50,000 already provided to DonorsChoose, a nonprofit supporting teachers. 


	A clean sheet in soccer means the team concedes zero goals during a match.

	“Preventing the opposing team from scoring any goals, delivers a ‘clean sheet' match for the winning team. This is a mark of defensive excellence and is a significant achievement for both the goalkeeper and the entire defensive line, demonstrating the power of teams,” said Phil Schaffer, corporate senior vice president of Henkel consumer brands North America. “Like the U.S. Men's and Women's National Teams, Henkel's success is also driven by our passion for team play, which is why we are so excited to not only celebrate with the fans, but also to give something back to the community through education grants to engage and inspire the future generation,” Schaffer said.

	“Henkel is a proud partner of the U.S. Soccer Federation, and we at Dial are thrilled to take the partnership further with the launch of our ‘Clean Sheet' program,” said Allison Feldman, vice president of marketing — personal care at Henkel. “For years, a primary goal for the Dial brand has been to support charitable organizations that focus on helping their local communities. Donations as a result of the ‘Clean Sheet' program will enable us to show our commitment to local communities and support future generations to chase their goals.”

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The official FIFA World Cup 2026 host city poster for Kansas City was revealed over the weekend at the Sporting KC-St. Louis SC match at Children's Mercy Park.

Artist Jadie Arnett, of Columbia, Missouri, said she drew inspiration from some of her first moments in Kansas City.

“When I first moved to Kansas City, I went to a few KC Current games, and I noticed that a lot of the fans wear a scarf," Arnett said. "And each time they score, they wave and raise their scarves in the air to show support for the team that they love. And so I wanted that to be the canvas for my artwork.”

Her observation led her to name the work “Woven Together” because “Missouri and Kansas are woven together in Kansas City just like the knitting of a scarf,” Arnett told KC2026, the nonprofit overseeing host city efforts.

Beyond scarves, Arnett explained the piece also drew inspiration from Greek ceramic potter, “recognizing a connection between the athletes depicted in sport and the spirit of competition at the FIFA World Cup 2026,” per KC2026.

Arnett said after submitting her sketch and being selected as a top-five finalist, she was paired with a mentor to help guide her before the final submission.

“Jadie's poster is dynamic. There are so many layers to it and so much storytelling involved,” Chandler Johnson, Arnett's mentor, said in a news release.

The longer one observes the poster, the more Easter eggs they find, Arnett said. A few include a yellow brick road, a heart for KC being the heart of America, a barbecue sauce bottle and Wichita's Keeper of the Plains.

“I actually had a harder time with people wanting more and more. And I was like, we gotta cut it back or it's gonna get too busy,” Arnett joked.

Starting April 19, the poster will be available for purchase online.

Each host city's poster was crafted to reflect the “distinctive spirit and culture of its community while showcasing a shared passion for the beautiful game,” KC2026 said.

The thought of her work being recognized worldwide is still "unbelievable" to Arnett.

“I was so shocked and excited … speechless, really,” she said of when she learned she was the winner. “And now that it's more sunk in, I'm just over the moon and really honored to have been chosen.”

More than 100 artists entered the KC contest. The top five finalists were awarded $1,000, and as the grand prize winner, Arnett will receive an additional $10,000.

Fifa is so concerned about sluggish ticket sales for this summer's Club World Cup that it is offering fans the incentive of a guaranteed opportunity to buy a ticket for next year's World Cup finals.

Supporters are being offered the perk in a bid to drive interest in an expanded 32-team Club World Cup (CWC), which takes place from June 14 to July 13 in the United States. The 2026 World Cup is also being held in the US, who are co-hosting with Canada and Mexico.

The incentive has been launched at a time when tickets for some CWC matches are now being sold on secondary sites for less than the initial asking price.

For example, for the round-of-16 match in Miami on June 29, seats on Ticketmaster, Fifa's official partner, are being advertised at $105.95 for section 328, row 17, but $88.63 (£69) for the same row on the secondary ticket site Viagogo.

Fifa did not respond when asked to provide figures on ticket sales or secondary sites selling cut-price tickets. But Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, has been doing his bit to try to boost sales. He posted an Instagram video on Monday from the Saudi-owned LIV Golf Miami tournament at the Trump National Doral course — owned by the US president Donald Trump — imploring fans not to “miss the opportunity” to buy CWC tickets.

The World Cup ticket offer is aimed at boosting sales for the club tournament — Chelsea and Manchester City are the two English teams involved — but the small print makes the offer considerably more complicated.

A standard ticket pack for the CWC has tickets to two or three matches and buyers “will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a Fifa World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final)”.

But the terms and conditions state that Fifa will decide which World Cup match that will be, with a clause saying: “Fifa ticketing is entitled to determine, in its sole discretion . . . the match or matches that may be available to you in connection with the FWC26 Ticket Option redemption”.

To have an option of buying a ticket for the World Cup final, a “Super Ticket Pack” must be purchased, which includes one ticket to attend 20 different CWC matches. The games are on different days and there are only 22 separate CWC matchdays. Even though buyers can pass their tickets on to family members or friends, attending the 20 matches would be a huge logistical operation.

Infantino, who has established close links with Trump, claims in his video that, “We are [here] in the best golf tournament” — a somewhat controversial boast in the week of the Masters at Augusta — “and in Fifa events we bring the best here”.

He added: “Fans should have to go to the games in the stadiums, opening here in Miami on June 14 and the final in New York on July 13. Don't miss the opportunity, so go to fifa.com/tickets — get your ticket for the first ever Fifa Club World Cup to see the best players in the world and the best clubs in the world; it will be unique.”

Expectations are low for New Zealand team, but there could be some surprises from the Northern League side

Let's get one thing out of the way: Auckland City FC aren't going to the Club World Cup's knockout stages. In a stacked Group C, which features heavyweights Bayern Munich, Boca Juniors and Benfica, the team will be lucky to get a draw, let alone a win against teams with higher pedigree, payrolls and tradition.

Yet, the 10-time Dettol Northern League winners have plenty to play for and it could be a catalyst for an unlikely result or two. This is the top team from the Oceania region, with seven straight OFC Champions League titles in their trophy cabinet.

Including previous Club World Cup appearances, this is the biggest tournament the New Zealanders have participated in. The Navy Blues play in a 2,500-capacity stadium. They'll be playing one of the tournament favorites in Bayern at the 26,000 seater TQL stadium, by comparison, for their opener.

That's not to mention the potential chance to showcase a relatively unknown team to dozens of international scouts at the tournament. Former New Zealand defender Winston Reid parlayed a strong showing in the 2010 World Cup into big money move to West Ham following the tournament. That should also serve as motivation.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

Next up is Auckland City FC, with a look at key players to watch, and expectations for the pride of Oceania ahead of this summer's tournament.

NWSL

This is Alyssa Thompson's moment.

That much was palpable when she received the ball left of the center circle from defender Crystal Dunn during the U.S. women's national team's 2-0 win over Brazil on Saturday in front of 32,303 people in her home city of Los Angeles.

For anyone who has watched the 20-year-old attacking player during her three seasons across town with Angel City FC in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), her path might as well have been cut into the field at SoFi Stadium with a lawn mower: straight to goal.

One feint sent a Brazilian defender sliding out of the play and Thompson exploited the space left behind. By the time she reached the top of the 18-yard box, the moment had begun to feel like what could one day be considered vintage Thompson, much like the goal she scored for Angel City before the international break. But rather than aim for the goal, Thompson delivered an assist that split two more defenders to reach an oncoming Trinity Rodman, who knocked the ball past Brazilian and Kansas City Current goalkeeper Lorena in the sixth minute.

“That was the perfect ball to a perfect finish. I think we read each other's minds in that moment,” Rodman said after the match.

Her direct attacking style aside, Thompson's short journey from being voted Gatorade Player of the Year at high school level in 2021 to this moment has been anything but linear.

She was the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft and the youngest player on the USWNT's World Cup roster in a matter of months. Her standout rookie season rolled into her first senior call-up, however, and things quickly changed.

Thompson made just two appearances off the bench in the defending champion United States' ill-fated run to the round of 16 at that World Cup, playing just 17 minutes in a tournament that saw very little squad rotation by coach Vlatko Andonovski. The World Cup crash led to Andonovski resigning and the youngest member of the squad getting left out of the roster to regain form, with mixed results, for her club.



After new coach Emma Hayes took the reins midway through 2024, Thompson watched the USWNT's Olympic gold medal run from home. Instead of a summer in France, she worked to hone her skills, and after five goals and two assists in seven NWSL games, Thompson got the call from Hayes in October. And she didn't waste her shot.

The then-19-year-old scored her first senior international goal 39 minutes into a friendly against Iceland in Austin. The joy was apparent on her face as she leaped into the arms of substitute Sophia Wilson on the sideline.

“I feel like last year, and the last couple of years, I put a lot of pressure on myself,” Thompson told reporters last week. “I think just coming in this year, I just wanted to be confident in my abilities and know what I bring as a player, and not compare myself to other people. I think that has helped me a lot, just knowing that if I'm playing like Alyssa Thompson then I'll be able to put a good foot forward for my team.”

Each month since, Thompson has been finding and learning ways to sharpen her craft. And, with the marquee front three of Wilson, Rodman and Mallory Swanson, who headlined that Olympic triumph, down to just Rodman for now, Thompson found another moment to make her case on Saturday.

Hayes acknowledged Thompson's journey ahead of the match as a cautionary tale of how a mistimed moment can obscure a player's potential, especially from an outsider's perspective.

“I hope that we can look at someone like Alyssa Thompson's situation, i.e. a 17-year-old coming into the program probably underprepared for that because the level is so much higher, to then have a journey which is pretty normal for a young player. But I think she's in the best place she has been in terms of her start to the season,” Hayes said.

But the former Chelsea manager also expressed her intention to continue elevating the characteristics that make Thompson an attacking threat as she progresses through national team camps and racks up minutes on the field.

“Since October we've been working so hard positionally with her to get her to have a better understanding of what to do and when, and saying, ‘Listen, at the top level, you're a great one-v-one specialist, but when you're playing the top players in the world, they know how to drop off of you in a certain way where they don't give you a one-v-one opportunity, so how do you link with others?',” Hayes said.

There were glimpses of those areas of growth in Saturday's match, particularly in some of Thompson's unsuccessful attempts to take on the well-read Brazilian and Olympique Lyonnais central defender Tarciane. Still, she created dangerous scoring opportunities that contributed to the team's 2.72 expected goals (xG) figure.

Hayes has seen the gap close between where Thompson was six months ago and where she is now, and part of that comes through in her instinctive thinking.

“When you play for me, I will overload you to take a player to another level tactically, but that means for a period of time, there's a lot of thinking going on, a lot of processing,” Hayes said. “There's a lot of conscious thinking, whereas I feel like with Alyssa now, she understands that, so she's able to do it more naturally.”

Thompson is still at the beginning of her professional career and it's important to consider: managing internal pressure, brewing confidence and resisting the urge to compare herself to others. These are all tall orders for most teens (and adults) even when they haven't faced the challenges she has. But they, too, have led to the moment Thompson is now enjoying, and she credits her teammates with supporting her through it.

“They believe in me so much and I attribute a lot of my success to them because their help and reassurance has really helped me become the player that I am right now,” Thompson said.

Angel City captain and defender Ali Riley has viewed Thompson's journey from a unique vantage point.

The 37-year-old Los Angeles native attended Harvard-Westlake, the same high school Thompson and her younger sister and Angel City teammate Gisele did, and experienced that same World Cup in 2023, though Riley played for co-host New Zealand (she was born in LA but her father is from New Zealand). Riley was quick to refuse credit for any guidance she's given the elder Thompson and made clear her progress is just as promising as her ceiling — as a player and as a face of the sport.

“Even when we look at how much she's grown, her performances on the field, what's so special about her is that this is the beginning,” Riley told The Athletic. “I think she has the personality and the eloquence to be someone who can speak about being a woman in sport, being a woman of color in sport. She's so good about speaking about her experience growing up, the value of representation.”

Riley, who hasn't played since last season because of nerve damage in her left leg, added that Thompson was voted into the team's leadership group this year.

When Thompson went through a bit of a scoring drought during that 2024 season, Riley said she faced criticism from “keyboard warriors” on social media who picked through her stats and body language with a fine-tooth comb. Now, Riley said, “when she scores, she doesn't seem relieved, she's genuinely happy.”

So far, that happiness has shown up as cheeky TikTok goal celebrations with her sister Gisele and fellow Angel City striker Casey Phair on the sidelines. Other times, it's a full-throated rebel yell.

For Thompson to enjoy another stellar performance in her hometown on Saturday only sweetened the moment — topped off with one of those yells after assisting fellow Southern California native Rodman.

“I love playing in LA,” Thompson said in the mixed zone following the match. “Being here is amazing for the club, and I've never played in LA with the national team, so being able to feel that comfort from my city and my family and friends, I just felt like I could be more like me, and I knew what I could do.”

Hello there! The Champions League returns for some quarterfinal action this week, while the U.S. women's national team wrap up a two-game series against Brazil on Tuesday. I'm Pardeep Cattry with an update ahead of a busy week.

The headlining act of this week's Champions League action will be Real Madrid's trip to Arsenal, which comes with fairly big stakes for two teams at very different stages in their season.

For the hosts, the baggage of seasons past defines the importance of this  month's two-legged tie. This was poised to be a season in which Mikel Arteta's Arsenal would act upon the promise they demonstrated in years past and finally win a major title, but the nonexistent Premier League race means they are down to just one potential trophy lift – the Champions League. The Gunners' European campaign has been as straightforward as it gets but a clash against Real Madrid offers their first serious test of the season, and at a crucial juncture of the competition. Arsenal have not booked a spot in the Champions League semifinals in nearly 20 years, so the importance of the quarterfinal tie is not lost upon Arteta, who described these matches as the most significant of his managerial career.

In order to live up to the momentous occasion, though, they will have to get through Real Madrid first. It may not be as daunting a task as it sounds considering how the season has gone for Los Blancos – they registered some notable losses during the league phase, but managed to oust Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the knockouts and are making a case that they are peaking at the right time. Recent results might raise some questions about that claim, though, with a 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad in the Copa del Rey and a 2-1 loss to Valencia in La Liga play showcasing the imbalance that Carlo Ancelotti's side have long had.

The possibility of a trophyless season does not define Real Madrid's Champions League campaign as much as it does Arsenal's at this point, but there's just as much pressure for them to deliver their uncanny ability to cross the finish line even in imperfect circumstances. Real Madrid have been resigned to taking the hard road to repeat as champions and have done well in those circumstances, but will once again have to prove their worth to ensure they have a spot in the semifinals.

The U.S. women's national team kicked off their two-game series against Brazil with a 2-0 win on Saturday that showcased head coach Emma Hayes' mix and match approach as she continues a period of player pool expansion.

Six members of the USWNT's Olympics squad started in the rematch of last summer's gold medal game, most notable among them Trinity Rodman, who scored just eight minutes into her first game since Paris. Rodman's star quality was on full display for her 61 minute shift, but she was not the only attacking talent who made the most of her moment – Alyssa Thompson, who already has two goals in three NWSL games this season, notched the assist to Rodman's goal and enjoyed yet another strong showing in the U.S.' post-Olympics era of experimentation.

Hayes mixed some of the USWNT's mainstays with a batch of less-experienced talent, including goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. She, as well as defender Avery Patterson, earned her first cap on Saturday and made six saves as the battle to succeed Alyssa Naeher continues. Though the head coach admitted there are still areas of improvement, including ball retention and decision-making, but she believes the "less-experienced team are growing up" and pointed towards the attacking effort as an example.

Hayes and company wrap up the two-game swing against Brazil on Tuesday, where a different group of players could receive the opportunity to impress as the USWNT's long road to the 2027 Women's World Cup continues.

🇪🇸 La Liga title race: Both Barcelona and Real Madrid dropped points in La Liga play over the weekend, but the former's four point lead means the title race tilted further in the favor.

💤 Goalless in Manchester: The Manchester derby ended 0-0 on Sunday as the struggles both Manchester City and Manchester United have faced all season long were on full display at Old Trafford.

🔴 Liverpool lose: Liverpool's 3-2 loss to Fulham may not cause many issues in their quest to win the Premier League title, but offers a signal that things may not be so straightforward next season.

🌴 Messi scores again: Lionel Messi scored a crucial – and impressive – equalizer for Inter Miami against Toronto FC on Sunday, but their 1-1 draw means they are winless in two ahead of their Concacaf Champions Cup quarterfinal against LAFC on Wednesday.

This summer, Manchester City and Chelsea will both head to the USA to compete in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

Unlike previous variations of the tournament, the competition has been revamped to include 32 teams from around the world in a format akin to a major international tournament. 

Both Premier League teams will be among the favourites to take home the brand-new trophy, but which English clubs have previously been crowned world champions?

DAZN News runs down the honour list. 

Almost a decade after they turned their back on the FA Cup to compete in the first-ever Club World Cup, Manchester United became the first English winner of the competition by lifting the trophy in Yokohama. 

After earning their spot with 2008's Champions League win over Chelsea, United saw off Gamba Osaka in the semi-final with a comfortable 5-3 win and went on to face Ecuadorian side LDU Quito in the final. 

It was then Wayne Rooney who etched his name into the competition's folklore by netting the only goal of the game to add another trophy to the Sir Alex Ferguson dynasty. 

Cup final winning team: Van der Sar, Rafael (Neville), Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Carrick, Anderson (Fletcher), Ronaldo, Park, Tevez (Evans), Rooney 

Held in the winter and seen as a test event for the upcoming 2022 World Cup, Qatar was the setting for Liverpool's only FIFA World Club Cup win in 2019. 

Their 2019 Champions League win saw them earn their spot in the competition and would defeat Monterrey in the semi-final thanks to a Roberto Firmino winner, which set them up for a final meeting with Flamengo. 

In the showpiece, it was once again Firmino who was the difference, scoring an extra-time winner for Jurgen Klopp's men. 

Cup final winning team: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Djik, Roberton, Keita (Milner), Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain (Lallana), Salah (Shaqiri), Firmino (Origi), Mane

Thomas Tuchel's short reign as Chelsea boss saw two major continental wins - including this FIFA World Club Cup triumph in Abu Dhabi. 

The Blues edged past Saudi champions Al Hial in the semi-final thanks to a Romelu Lukaku goal and it set up a second England vs Brazil finale in three years. 

This time, it was Palmerias, but it was Lukaku again who made his presence known, opening the scoring before Chelsea's Champions League-winning hero Kai Havertz repeated the trick by tucking home a penalty in extra time to seal the victory.

Fresh off a season where Manchester City nabbed a historic treble, the silverware continued to reign as they added the FIFA Club World Cup to their list of accolades. 

City made light work of it too, first defeating Urawa Red Diamonds 3-0 in the semi-final before a thumping victory over Brazilian side Fluminense saw them take home the trophy. 

Julian Alvarez scored a brace either side of a Nino own goal and Phil Foden's strike to see Pep Guardiola win the competition for a third time with a third different club. 

Cup final winning team: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Stones (Gvardiol), Ake (Bobb), Lewis (Kovacic), Rodri (Akanji), Silva, Foden (Nunes), Grealish, Alvarez

Home > Headlines > Bounou Confident as Al Hilal Prepare to Face Real Madrid in Club World Cup

Yassine Bounou

Rabat – Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou has said that Al Hilal are ready to take on the world's best teams, including Real Madrid, at the upcoming Club World Cup 2025.

Speaking in an interview with FIFA, Bounou shared his excitement about playing in the tournament and expressed confidence in his team's ability to make a strong impact.

Al Hilal, champions of Asia, will face a tough challenge in Group H, where they are drawn against Real Madrid, FC Salzburg, and CF Pachuca. 

But Bounou, who has faced Real Madrid many times before while playing for Spanish clubs Girona and Sevilla, said his past experience gives him confidence. “I've played against Real a lot; I have many friends in the team, and I've always met their fans on the streets of Spain. I've always had mutual respect for the club and its supporters,” he said.

“I've faced a lot of great teams throughout my career, and I'm privileged that Real Madrid is one of them, and it's a great honour to do it again wearing the Al Hilal shirt,” the player added.

The 2023 African Goalkeeper of the Year added that the Saudi Arabian team is motivated to go far in the competition. “We at Al Hilal are honored to participate in the first edition of the Club World Cup (in its new format). We look forward to delivering a performance worthy of Al Hilal,” he stated.

The upcoming Club World Cup will be the first to feature an expanded format featuring 32 of the world's top clubs. 

Bounou also spoke about the difficulty of the group stage and said he hopes to reach “a level I have never reached before” as a Moroccan player in this global competition.

The player also reflected on his experience at the World Cup 2022 in Qatar, where he helped Morocco reach the semi-finals for the first time in history. “The experience I have gained from it will be an additional factor that the team can capitalise on,” he said.

When asked whether he would like to face one of his old clubs, Wydad or Atlético, in the later rounds, Bounou laughed and said, “Honestly, I'd rather not face them, but I hope they reach the highest levels.”

The 31-year-old never considered herself a guaranteed starter, but she is making the most of every opportunity under Emma Hayes.

On the current United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) roster, only three players have tallied over 100 appearances for their nation.

Emily Sonnett is one of them.

It may have seemed an unlikely achievement for the 31-year-old, who has never considered herself a bona fide starter when it comes to playing for her nation.

“I think one thing I think about for my personal journey [is that] it didn't come quickly,” she told The Guardian.

“I wasn't seeing starts or a lot of game time… I actually never thought I'd reach 100 caps for [because] I've never been a true starter for this team.”

Even with the arrival of a new manager mid-2024, there was a general feeling that her role under Emma Hayes would be a supporting one from the bench.

The reality, however, has been quite the contrary.

In the face of injury woes across central defenders, Hayes has called on the centurion to fill in at the back. Before that, Sonnett had been deployed in midfield when in rotation.

She is quickly but surely becoming a key player in this new U.S. era, with her versatility proving to be a secret and reliable weapon for the current coaching staff.

Emily Sonnett honoured for 100 appearances in a USWNT shirt.

Full-back, defensive midfielder, and now centre-back.

These are all positions occupied by Sonnett for the national team in the space of a year.

Her versatility stems from her drive to represent the U.S. on the biggest stages – instilling the kind of work ethic that pushes her to succeed wherever she is called on.

“I think I'm versatile because every roster I really had to fight to be on, and that sometimes meant moving positions to make it and get to a tournament,” the NJ/NY Gotham star said in an interview with Just Women's Sports.

“This team is so competitive in every position, especially [squads like] the Olympics that [only have] 18 spaces.

“You have to stay coachable, you have to learn… if that's what is going to get me on rosters, then that is what I have to do.”

That kind of approach wasn't born overnight. It has been tireless years of work and going the extra mile.

Determined to become a consistent performer in any of the roles she was required to play, Sonnett went as far as working with an analyst to identify any areas of weakness.

‘It probably took me four years to really get that [consistency across the pitch] down,” she admitted to the Women's Game podcast.

“I worked with an analyst so I [could] understand exactly where I'm falling short and where I'm not, so I can have these consistent years back-to-back.

“I would look into defensive duels, aerial duels, progressive passes, where I'm passing the ball and [assessed] if I was hitting certain numbers compared to some of the best centre-backs in the world.”

Such willingness to improve her game and apply it at each opportunity has made her a go-to option in the face of a minor injury crisis in the backline.

Emily Sonnett helps the USWNT keep a clean sheet against Brazil in April 2025.

At Paris 2024, it became clear that Sonnett – much to her surprise – would be a crucial part of Hayes's plans going forward.

Her experience and expertise across multiple positions made her an invaluable asset in the English coach's first tournament in charge.

More importantly, it outlined what her plans for the player were and that included seeing her as more of a central defender as opposed to a fullback, which had previously been her core role with the national team.

In the six games it took for the U.S. to be crowned Olympic champions, Sonnett featured in each of them.

Subbed on four times and a starter for two, including the 1-0 quarter-final victory over Japan.

Then came the SheBelieves Cup and, without first-choice centre-back Naomi Girma, the Georgia-native stepped in comfortably.

She is once again the go-to replacement at the back for the USWNT's latest friendlies against Brazil, amid more injury woes following Tierna Davidson's withdrawal from camp.

“I'm someone who leads a lot by example and being coachable… [I want to be] a constant reminder for everyone that we have to be working hard, but also applying what we're learning,” she told ESPN.

“What I really appreciate about Emma and her staff is that they're always forward-thinking, always layering in.

“I think the Olympics are the tip of the iceberg for how much they can teach in a short amount of time.”

...

Benjamin Pavard could play at wingback in tomorrow's Champions League showdown between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. They report that the Frenchman could fill in if Matteo Darmian doesn't see out the ninety minutes.

Inter Milan will be without wingback Denzel Dumfries against Bayern Munich tomorrow.

And that creates quite a headache for Nerazzurri coach Simone Inzaghi.

Matteo Darmian is available. The veteran former Manchester United and Torino has played all of Inter's last three matches.

However, that has naturally taken quite a toll on Darmian.

The wingback role is a physically demanding one. Therefore, it may be difficult for the 35-year-old to see out yet another ninety minutes after going the distance against Parma over the weekend.

And Matteo Darmian is really the only natural right-wingback in the Inter squad besides Dumfries.

Nicola Zalewski has played there a couple times off the bench.

However, Zalewski has not looked comfortable playing on the right flank.

Therefore, Inter coach Simone Inzaghi had even tested Carlos Augusto in the position in training recently.

However, Augusto could have a different task at left-centre-back or left-wingback tomorrow.

That leaves Inzaghi somewhat short of options, if Darmian reaches his limit.

One would be to move Benjamin Pavard into the attacking wingback role on the 3-5-2 shape.

That is not the Frenchman's natural position. He prefers to play in the back three.

However, Pavard could be the most effective option in the position at a certain stage of tomorrow's match.

Phil Foden's form has 'fallen off a cliff' and he needs to be left out of Manchester City's squad for this summer's Club World Cup, Ian Ladyman has told Chris Sutton on the latest 'It's All Kicking Off!' podcast.

Foden, 24, was subbed off before the hour mark during Sunday's turgid Manchester derby which finished goalless.

The winger still made headlines after the match as he was the target of abusive chants about his mother from rival fans.

Looking ahead to this summer's Club World Cup, The Mail's Football Editor Ian Ladyman told co-host Chris Sutton that Foden's 'exhausted' performances show that the player needs a sustained break from the game to recover his form.

'Foden looks ruined, he looks exhausted, he looks like he needs a long rest', Ladyman said.

'I think at times with footballers, you get to a point where you've got to ask yourself: do we need that player for this tournament? What is best for him? Do we have a duty of care towards him?'

'It doesn't happen very often, but I think we're getting to that point with Phil Foden – that guy needs to be left at home in June and July, so he can take a breath and get ready for next season.

'With Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, and De Bruyne, you can put down their form to age, playing at the highest level for a decade. You can't say that with Phil, he's a young player – there's got to be another reason for what we're seeing.

'This isn't a dip – he looks on the floor.'

Last season, Foden recorded 19 goals and eight assists across all competitions: his tally this season stands at seven goals and two assists in 10 fewer matches.

He was named PFA Players' Player of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season but struggled to make an impact for England at the Euros.

Former professional player and pundit Chris Sutton defended Foden, accusing Ladyman of unfairly 'singling him out' from an underperforming City side.

'All players go through this; I went through it. He was the best player in the country last year and he's now having a dip.

'You're singling Foden out because of his age. I don't see age the way you're seeing it. Foden is one of many Manchester City players whose form has fallen off a cliff.

'Pep Guardiola is smart enough to realise if there's an issue beyond football, whether or not he needs a mental break from the game. But I think you can say that about any Manchester City player right now.'

Sutton added however that he believes no Manchester City players should be going to the Club World Cup this summer based on their tired performances this season.

'We know what that tournament's all about: it's about money, it's about finance, it's about greed.

'None of the Manchester City players, based on this season's form, should be going. But they are going to go – I don't see Foden as different from any of them.'

To hear Ian Ladyman and Chris Sutton's full opinions on Phil Foden, listen to 'It's All Kicking Off!' now, wherever you get your podcasts.

MLS

Patrick Agyemang has no problem elaborating on his answers to questions about his rapid rise. He's generous when it comes to sharing detail and perspective. Only one of over a dozen queries warrants a one-word answer of “no” – albeit with a bit of a chuckle to provide plenty of subtext.

The question: Did he hear from U.S. Soccer or sense he was being considered for inclusion prior to Mauricio Pochettino's tenure?

It's defensible to an extent. Striker has quickly become one of the deepest position groups in the USMNT pool, with multiple players scoring regularly in Europe – Josh Sargent and Haji Wright were at it again this past weekend – and a steady stable of dependable forwards playing regularly in MLS. Injuries, however, remain a regular concern.

Folarin Balogun has struggled since joining Monaco in the summer of 2023 and hasn't played since October after suffering a shoulder injury. Ricardo Pepi's season ended in late January after suffering a knee injury. Sargent missed all of November and December with a groin injury, and Wright missed nearly four months with an ankle complaint.

Even so, to those who hadn't been watching Agyemang's 2024 season, the 24-year-old's inclusion on Pochettino's January camp squad may have seemed like little more than a flier on a young player.

“It's so easy to go into these camps and think you're not good enough to be here, or just feel like this isn't your level, it's too high for you or something,” Agyemang told The Athletic. “For me, I go into these camps and I'm just like, ‘I need to do my role. I need to work hard. If I get on the field, I need to show that I belong here and I want to be back, to be in this picture.'”

Agyemang was arguably the standout player of his first USMNT camp, scoring in each of his first two international caps in wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica. The strong impression kept him in frame for the Nations League finals, where he came off the bench in the semifinal vs. Panama and then started the third-place match against Canada. His 35th-minute goal in the latter fixture helped the U.S. pull level before halftime.

While the end result — a fourth-place showing in a four-team bracket — hardly inspired, Agyemang's conversations with Pochettino made him feel as though he had impressed again.

“I've been really trying to make a presence for myself on the field,” Agyemang said. “In the first game against Panama, if I could go back, I would change the decisions that I made in a split moment, because essentially, I could have scored two goals, but the fact I was able to create space for myself in those opportunities, (Pochettino) was happy with it. He's realizing I can come in showing a different profile and spark to the game. As long as I continue doing that, he was happy with it.

“There's things I need to still improve on, but in the overall bulk of it, it was a positive outlook on what I did (from him).”

It was hard to find reasons for optimism surrounding the USMNT after those consecutive defeats.

The two games provided a worrying 180 minutes for Pochettino to assess, with defensive miscues and clumsy attempts at upfield progression leaving time for concerningly few glimpses of promise. After each game, pundits and fans alike grasped for answers as to how the U.S., once lauded for grit and determination, could look so flat.

Throughout the discourse, two players' names emerged as bright spots amid the carnage, the same two who combined for the team's only goal of the window: Diego Luna and Agyemang. While Luna's stock began rising during a breakout 2023, Agyemang's has escalated more rapidly, having only just become Charlotte FC's starting striker in 2024.

He has now been thrust into contention for the 2026 World Cup, and even the loudest detractors of the U.S.'s present form can notice what he brings to the fold.

“Yeah, it has been a lot, just how quickly everything has been moving,” Agyemang said. “I've always prayed for this. I've always had the faith that at some point, hopefully I'll be able to be on a stage where I can really show what I can do and just give my all for it, just to see that this is the start of something that potentially could just keep going higher. It's a blessing.”

At a time when former U.S. stars are questioning the motivation and commitment of the current group of players, Agyemang's performances have merited increased attention. While many other U.S. forwards have played abroad, Agyemang's development has fully come stateside, first in the college ranks and then with Charlotte.

A striker can often force his way onto a tournament squad on the back of strong scoring form, and Agyemang is no exception. The fact that making the World Cup squad seems like a genuine possibility is an impressive development from a player whose professional career is still getting started.

“To hear stuff like that, it's a nice feeling,” Agyemang said of his increasing support, “but that just makes me want to do it more.”

Agyemang's ascent is even more impressive when considering that he didn't begin playing striker regularly until he was 21.

Given his pace and dribbling ability, coaches asked Agyemang to play on the wing, most often on the left to cut inwards onto his preferred right foot. It's the spot where Agyemang began his college career with his hometown Eastern Connecticut State Warriors. He was prolific during his two years in Division III, bagging 30 goals and 10 assists in 39 appearances and garnering D-1 interest from the University of Rhode Island. Once he arrived, his new coach saw a different way to maximize his skillset.

“When I got to Rhode Island, that's when the coaches said, ‘I want you to be my No. 9,'” Agyemang said. “I was like, ‘OK, cool. I could do pretty well (in) this position for myself.' I thought if I continue just learning more about the nine position, I could be a really good nine.”

Agyemang took to his new position and level of competition quickly, landing on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference first team in both his junior and senior seasons. He scored 19 times while adding 12 assists in 37 games, and that caused his stock to soar ahead of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft, where Charlotte traded up to select him 12th overall.

While he earned 423 minutes across the regular season and Leagues Cup, scoring twice, most of his rookie development came in MLS Next Pro with Crown Legacy FC. Throughout 2023, however, he found himself being asked to play striker in a less agile manner, a potential byproduct of his 6-foot-4 stature as well as a coach (Christian Lattanzio) whose positional play model had granularly defined job descriptions for each role.

“It's hard,” Agyemang said of being assessed on his stature. “I remember when I first got here, a lot of times, it was just like: hold the ball, set and go. Obviously, that's a lot of principles that as a striker you want, because at the end, you want to score your goals in the box and stuff like that. I think I had to build into it, because I was letting people know, like, I could do more than that.

“I know my game, and I know when I'm at my best. I know what I'm good at. When the ball is on my feet, I'm never scared to, like, take somebody on in a 1-v-1. I look for those opportunities, and I always want to go.”

Ahead of 2024, Charlotte appointed Dean Smith as its new head coach, bringing the former Aston Villa and Norwich City boss over for his first job outside England. Early in preseason, Agyemang worked with his new coaching staff to try incorporating more of his natural skillset into his game.

Agyemang feels as though Smith — like Pochettino with the national team — took the time to size up how he could thrive most.

“There's a difference,” Agyemang said of coaches who tailor game plans to their personnel instead of forcing players into strict systems. “You definitely feel that. Initially, when I first was here at Charlotte, it felt like I was just a role, like they weren't really looking into who I was as a player.

“I think a lot of times, coaches try to give you too much information rather than letting you just play. So I think now, especially with the coaches I've been working with now, it's been a big change. I feel like now, I'm just gonna continue to elevate my game.”

Agyemang and Charlotte leveled up during a transformative 2024. Across 2,014 minutes in the regular season and playoffs, Agyemang led the club with 10 goals and tied for the team lead with six assists. He bagged three crucial game-winners as Charlotte found its rhythm in the spring and summer, showing Smith he could swing results with his approach to leading the line.

“His ceiling is as much as he wants it to be, to be honest,” Smith told the Total Soccer Show podcast in March. While he has just one goal to date in the 2025 MLS season, the underlying numbers show that he has the requisite instinct to find dangerous areas that typifies an elite center forward.

Since the start of 2024, 30 strikers have played at least 1,500 minutes in MLS. It's a sample that includes luminaries like Luis Suárez, Christian Benteke and Cucho Hernández as well as prolific MLS forwards like Jordan Morris and Cristian Arango. While Agyemang's numbers are competitive among them in most categories, he tops the charts in two crucial rate stats for a forward with his profile.

Nobody has a higher progressive carry rate — that is, how often his carries advance the ball at least five yards closer to goal — of 32% (second-best is 22.1%), while no striker has logged a greater share of his touches in the opponent's box than Agyemang's rate of 25.4%.

When presented with the data, Agyemang can't help but take a little pride in how his work is paying off. Still, he sees it as evidence that he needs to keep refining the rest of his game.

“It's cool to hear those stats, but I just know how I like to play the game now,” Agyemang said. “I'm comfortable being on the ball and on the run with the ball. With my frame, you look at me, and you're like, ‘A 6'4” winger, it just doesn't make sense.'

“I like to add those things I've learned on the wing, and bring it into my game, because I want to make my game unique to myself. There's a lot of players in the world that play the nine in a way, but I want to make it my unique way. That's why I think like that progressive ball carrying is a way that I like to do. Maybe nines, you know, they don't want the ball (that far from goal), but I love carrying the ball.”

UNSTOPPABLE from Patrick Agyemang to double the lead!#USMNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/BxMB1B16Lx

— U.S. Soccer Men's National Team (@USMNT) January 18, 2025



Another area that Agyemang continues to refine is his off-ball movement, a facet that changes considerably when shifting from the wing to center forward.

He admits to being “very critical” of himself, watching each of his performances back to revisit in-moment thoughts that crop up in games. He looks for “patterns” that come up in game scenarios, trying to identify pockets of space that opponents are presenting his team so he can exploit them to create room for himself or his teammates as a clever decoy.

“I've just been really working on that, because before I really didn't do as much movement,” Agyemang said, “But the best way as a striker is like, you want to feel as if the defenders don't know where to go at times. If I'm always in front of them and stuff like that, it's a field day for them. You kind of mix it up and find ways to open space.”

That effort is possibly more crucial now as Smith calibrates his system to include Wilfried Zaha, who joined the club this winter on an initial loan. The former Crystal Palace great is among the modern era's most prolific dribblers, and his presence will inevitably take some carrying responsibility off of Agyemang's shoulders. While the striker acknowledged that they're “still learning and understanding each other's games,” the initial collaboration has been positive and he's already seen glimpses of the pair “getting that rhythm down.”

Charlotte fans are watching that partnership blossom with great hope, as the team — which also includes U.S. international defender Tim Ream and former Villa and Burnley midfielder Ashley Westwood — projects to remain in contention in the Eastern Conference. It'll also be closely assessed by Pochettino and his staff as they continue to size up the U.S.'s player pool ahead of next summer.

Agyemang's work rate in the Nations League finals stood out in contrast to some of his teammates. His goal against Canada was a just return for his first-half shift, where his movement had unsettled the defense and opened spaces for Luna, Tim Weah and Christian Pulisic.

To him, that inner drive was refined during his time in the NCAA.

“I think there's things that I still need to work on, but I think it's just like the grit and the grind part — like the determination,” Agyemang said of his college tenure. “No matter what happens, I'm gonna keep going. I think that's the part I really like grabbed and has stuck with me since college.”

He, like his peers, will also want to play in the 2026 World Cup. The fierce competition in his position will keep a fire under Agyemang to turn in good performances, refine that interplay with Zaha and keep himself on the radar regardless of what his compatriots are doing.

Agyemang isn't fixating too much on what could happen when the tournament kicks off in over 15 months — after all, he wasn't even a projected starter for his club 15 months ago.

“For me, I try not to look too far, because it brings a lot of extra pressure,” he said. “But at the end of the day, it's home. If you're a part of that, you're involved in something that's so special, just to be able to play in a World Cup on your home soil. That's such a special feeling. I think a lot of Americans will want to be a part of that. It's cool to just be in the conversation for it. At the end of the day, who knows?”

And so, the hard work continues in Charlotte and off the training ground. Agyemang emphasized that he wants to improve his consistency in 2025, and not just in front of goal. He's studying the tape to see how he can improve his defensive pressing, how to be even better at retaining the ball and making better decisions when it's at his feet. In total, it's about “polishing the cleanness of (his) game” now that he's getting consistent reps.

At a time when greats like Landon Donovan question if the current group wants to represent the U.S., it's an honor that's only fueling Agyemang to push on. Although it comes with increased expectations and scrutiny, it's a blessing he's worked hard to invite – and an area where he's more than happy to elaborate.

“Now that I've quickly gotten into this national team, they're expecting more from me,” Agyemang said. “For me, it's cool. It's a fun dynamic to work with. At the end of the day, if you want to be a great player, you need to know what's to come with it.

“I'm blessed to be in this position, but I won't puff my chest because of what's come, if that makes sense. I'm always this type of guy to keep my head down and want to do more, and get better each and every day. I don't want it to just be, like, that was my first and my last camp. I want it to be the beginning of something to come.”

Perhaps the biggest draw of this summer's FIFA Club World Cup is the sight of Europe's most successful club heading Stateside for the tournament. 

Not only are the Spanish giants 15-time Champions League winners and La Liga champions on a record 36 occasions, but Real have also won the Club World Cup more times than any other side. 

They have lifted the trophy five times, with the last coming in 2022 as they beat Al Hilal in Rabat thanks to braces from Federico Valverde and Vinicius Jr. 

DAZN  is the only place to watch every match of the Club World Cup live and for free - download the free app now for smart TV's, smartphones, streaming devices and games consoles to start watching.

DAZN News   has everything you need to know about Real Madrid. 

Real are Madrid's crown jewel, alongside the other capital clubs Atletico Madrid and Rayo Vallecano.

The famous Bernabeu Stadium has the second-largest seating capacity in Spain and has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.

Football was introduced to Spain by English workers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Madrid was officially founded in 1902 by Juan Padros.

In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.



Real Madrid are the most dominant team in Spanish football history, having lifted La Liga 36 times. Their battle at the top of La Liga with Barcelona is the stuff of legend, and their 'El Clasico' battle is arguably the most popular football rivalry in the game. 

They also hold the record for most Champions League wins with 15, making them the most successful side in European football. 













Real Madrid are one of twelve European teams competing in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and qualify as one of the last three winners of the UEFA Champions League.

Real Madrid have been drawn into Group H, alongside Al Hilal, Pachuca and Red Bull Salzburg.

The new expanded Fifa Club World Cup will take place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July 2025.

Previously an annual tournament contested by the top seven teams, the Club World Cup will now feature 32 teams and occur once every four years.

The tournament once branded a "mistake" by ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter is undergoing a revamp as significant as it is controversial.

Club World Cup draw pairs Man City with Juventus; Chelsea face Flamengo

Teams from each of the six international football confederations will be at the Club World Cup: Asia (AFC), Africa (Caf), North and Central America (Concacaf), South America (Conmebol), Oceania (OFC) and Europe (Uefa).

There are 12 places available for European clubs - the highest quota of the confederations. These places are decided by clubs' Champions League performances over the past four seasons.

That means recent winners Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid have all qualified.

Other European teams have qualified through a Uefa ranking system determined by clubs' performances over the four seasons. Only two clubs per country can qualify, so England's 2022 Champions League finalists Liverpool are not included.

Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg - who will be known as FC Salzburg because of Fifa sponsorship regulations - will be there.

There are four club places each for Asia and Africa, as well as the North and Central America federation.

Six places are awarded to South American clubs, and one to Oceania.

Clubs have accrued points over the most recent four seasons, based on their performances in their continental club competitions.

Group A: Palmeiras, FC Porto, Al Ahly, Inter Miami

Group B: Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Botafogo, Seattle Sounders

Group C: Bayern Munich, Auckland City, Boca Juniors, Benfica

Group D: Flamengo, Esperance Sportive de Tunisie, Chelsea, Club Leon

Group E: River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds, Monterrey, Inter Milan

Group F: Fluminense, Borussia Dortmund, Ulsan, Mamelodi Sundowns

Group G: Manchester City, Wydad, Al Ain, Juventus

Group H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal, Pachuca, Salzburg

One spot in the tournament is reserved for a team from the host nation.

Fifa opted to award that place to Inter Miami for winning the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield, the trophy given out to the team which has the best regular-season record. The Floridians then lost in the MLS play-offs, meaning they are not this season's champions.

The decision to invite Inter Miami to the Club World Cup before the MLS campaign was concluded has been interpreted by some as an attempt on Fifa's part to ensure Lionel Messi, who joined the team in 2023, will play in a tournament that has attracted little public enthusiasm so far.

The revamped Club World Cup will run in a similar way to the international men's and women's World Cup competitions.

The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four, who will play each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams from each group will then go through to the knockout stages.

Unlike the international World Cups, the Club World Cup will have no third-place play-off.

The final will take place on 13 July 2025.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

Clubs will take home a set figure for each round:

Group Stages: £1.5m for a win / £800k for a draw

Round of 16: £5.8m

Quarter-Final: £10.1m

Semi-Final: £16.2m

Finalist: £23.2m

Winner: £30.0m

Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria.

European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents. The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

All matches will be held in the United States, a year before the country co-hosts the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

Fixtures are set to be played in 12 different stadiums.

Atlanta, Mercedes-Benz Stadium

Charlotte, TQL Stadium

Cincinnati, Bank of America Stadium

Los Angeles, Rose Bowl Stadium

Miami, Hard Rock Stadium

Nashville, GEODIS Park

New Jersey, MetLife Stadium

Orlando, Camping World Stadium

Orlando, Inter&Co Stadium

The opening match will be held in Miami, and the final is scheduled for New Jersey.

Streaming platform DAZN has secured exclusive rights and will show all 63 matches free to view on on its platforms, and there is also potential for it to sublicense rights to local free-to-air broadcasters.

Fifa is currently facing legal action from player unions and leagues about the scheduling of the tournament.

Global players' union Fifpro and the top European Leagues say the international football calendar is "oversaturated" and "risks player safety and wellbeing".

Several players - including Liverpool's Alisson Becker and Manchester City's Rodri - have raised concerns about player wellbeing amid an increasingly jam-packed football calendar.

There are just five weeks between the Club World Cup final and the first Premier League match of the 2025-2026 season, which is scheduled for 16 August.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has already requested a late start to the Premier League season for his team, while City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne told reporters: "The issue is that Uefa and Fifa keep adding extra matches, and we can raise concerns but no solutions have been found. It seems that money speaks louder than the players' voices."

A Fifa spokesperson BBC Sport: "The Fifa Club World Cup is not responsible for calendar congestion. It is a competitive tournament that takes place once every four years and, as independent studies have verified, Fifa is only responsible for a small percentage of matches per season.

"Fifa cares about the welfare of the players. Following a decision taken earlier this year, Fifa is formalising the Task Force on Player Welfare, headed by Arsene Wenger, to promote further global dialogue on player welfare issues with key stakeholders across football."

The Club World Cup will partially overlap with Women's Euro 2025, which runs from 2-27 July.

BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify this scheduling clash and whether there were concerns about the Women's Euro competing with the Club World Cup for attention.

A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: "The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa.

"While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.

"It is also important to note that given the time difference between Switzerland [host of Uefa Women's Euro 2025] and the United States [where the Fifa Club World Cup will take place], the number of matches where a potential clash could take place will be fewer."

The new expanded Fifa Club World Cup will take place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July 2025.

Previously an annual tournament contested by the top seven teams, the Club World Cup will now feature 32 teams and occur once every four years.

The tournament once branded a "mistake" by ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter is undergoing a revamp as significant as it is controversial.

Club World Cup draw pairs Man City with Juventus; Chelsea face Flamengo

Teams from each of the six international football confederations will be at the Club World Cup: Asia (AFC), Africa (Caf), North and Central America (Concacaf), South America (Conmebol), Oceania (OFC) and Europe (Uefa).

There are 12 places available for European clubs - the highest quota of the confederations. These places are decided by clubs' Champions League performances over the past four seasons.

That means recent winners Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid have all qualified.

Other European teams have qualified through a Uefa ranking system determined by clubs' performances over the four seasons. Only two clubs per country can qualify, so England's 2022 Champions League finalists Liverpool are not included.

Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg - who will be known as FC Salzburg because of Fifa sponsorship regulations - will be there.

There are four club places each for Asia and Africa, as well as the North and Central America federation.

Six places are awarded to South American clubs, and one to Oceania.

Clubs have accrued points over the most recent four seasons, based on their performances in their continental club competitions.

Group A: Palmeiras, FC Porto, Al Ahly, Inter Miami

Group B: Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Botafogo, Seattle Sounders

Group C: Bayern Munich, Auckland City, Boca Juniors, Benfica

Group D: Flamengo, Esperance Sportive de Tunisie, Chelsea, Club Leon

Group E: River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds, Monterrey, Inter Milan

Group F: Fluminense, Borussia Dortmund, Ulsan, Mamelodi Sundowns

Group G: Manchester City, Wydad, Al Ain, Juventus

Group H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal, Pachuca, Salzburg

One spot in the tournament is reserved for a team from the host nation.

Fifa opted to award that place to Inter Miami for winning the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield, the trophy given out to the team which has the best regular-season record. The Floridians then lost in the MLS play-offs, meaning they are not this season's champions.

The decision to invite Inter Miami to the Club World Cup before the MLS campaign was concluded has been interpreted by some as an attempt on Fifa's part to ensure Lionel Messi, who joined the team in 2023, will play in a tournament that has attracted little public enthusiasm so far.

The revamped Club World Cup will run in a similar way to the international men's and women's World Cup competitions.

The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four, who will play each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams from each group will then go through to the knockout stages.

Unlike the international World Cups, the Club World Cup will have no third-place play-off.

The final will take place on 13 July 2025.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

Clubs will take home a set figure for each round:

Group Stages: £1.5m for a win / £800k for a draw

Round of 16: £5.8m

Quarter-Final: £10.1m

Semi-Final: £16.2m

Finalist: £23.2m

Winner: £30.0m

Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria.

European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents. The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

All matches will be held in the United States, a year before the country co-hosts the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

≡ THE 5-RING CIRCUS ≡

● Olympic Games 2028: Los Angeles ● Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt has asked the City Council to approve a $34.6 million guarantee to the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games organizing committee in order to host the slalom canoeing and softball events.

The motion is scheduled for Tuesday, with the cost calculated by a projection of the amount it would take to relocate the events to the Los Angeles area in case of an Oklahoma City default.

Holt told The Oklahoman, “It's not a check we expect to write out.

“From their perspective, we've committed to do this. They committed to the [International Olympic Committee] these events will happen. They are relying on us to keep the commitment they made.”

¶

Los Angeles City 15th District Council member Tim McOsker continued his rage against the LA28 organizers, trying to get the sailing competition moved from Long Beach to San Pedro, filing two more motions on Friday to compel reports from LA28 on commitments made in the November 2021 Games Agreement with the City.

One asks for a report in seven days by City staff on the current status of the “LA28 Community Business and Procurement Program and the Local Hire Program” and the other for a City staff report – in seven days – on the LA28 “Impact and Sustainability Plan.”

Both motions were referred to the City's Ad Hoc Committee on the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games; the first motion was also referred to the Economic Development and Jobs Committee.

● Football ● On Thursday, FIFA announced a special ticket offer, tying purchases – and attendance – at FIFA Club World Cup matches this summer for tickets at the FIFA World Cup in 2026:

“This package involves one ticket per match to two FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches, with the option to add one ticket to a third match at an additional cost. The purchaser of a Ticket Pack who uses all tickets to attend all matches included in their Ticket Pack will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final).”

This is available for 25 days (from 3 April), or until the allocation runs out. There is also a “Super Ticket Pack:”

“A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enjoy the groundbreaking FIFA Club World Cup 2025, this package features one ticket per match to 20 FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches, which must include a semi-final and either the opening match or the final. The purchaser of a Super Ticket Pack who uses all tickets to attend all matches included in their Super Ticket Pack will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket for the eagerly anticipated FIFA World Cup 26 final.”

The Club World Cup kicks off on 14 June in Miami, Florida, with the final on 13 July in New Jersey.

● Gymnastics ● A total of 14 Russian artistic gymnasts received neutral status from the Federation Internationale de Gymnastique to compete in FIG World Cup events, but decided not compete. According to the Russian Gymnastics Federation:

“All Russian athletes representing artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, who have received neutral status, have decided to refrain from participating in the upcoming competitions under the auspices of the International Gymnastics Federation. The reason for this decision is the numerous unfounded and biased refusals by the FIG special committee to allow our gymnasts to compete.”

According to the Russian news agency TASS:

“[T]he FIG refused to grant neutral status to some athletes from Russia due to the posting of a congratulatory message on social networks for Victory Day, the athletes' participation in a gala concert for Defender of the Fatherland Day, during which the St. George ribbon was used and photographs were taken with children in military uniform.

“Another reason for the refusal was the athlete's subscription to a group on a social network where an announcement of the V All-Russian Anti-Doping Dictation, dedicated to the Physical Culture Day, was posted. The experts of the special FIG committee took the number V for one of the symbols of the SVO [Ukrainian invasion].”

● Skateboarding ● The Italian news agency ANSA reported that World Skate will impose a minimum age limit on athletes at the 2028 Olympic Games of 14, to be achieved by the end of the year (meaning 13-year-olds could compete in Los Angeles).

Athletes as young as 11 – China's Haohao Zhang – competed in Paris in 2024; an age limit of 12 will be installed for the Youth Olympic Games.

≡ RESULTS ≡

● Athletics ● At the USATF National 10-mile Championships in Washington, D.C., held in conjunction with the annual Cherry Blossom 10, with former Oklahoma State All-American Taylor Roe backing up her win in the USATF Half Marathon champs in March with two American Records.

She surged away from the field after a couple of miles and won going away in a U.S. record of 49:53, destroying Molly Huddle's 2018 mark of 50:52. Emma Grace Hurley was a distance second in 51:04 and Fiona O'Keeffe was third in 51:49.

Along the way, Roe passed 10 km in 30:56, four seconds off Shalane Flanagan's 2016 best, but got a U.S. women's-only record, ahead of Weini Kelati's 31:18 in 2021. Roe also grabbed the American Record for 15 km at 46:24, slashing Kelati's 46:32 from earlier in 2025.

The men's race was won by U.S.-British dual citizen Charles Hicks in 45:14, with a final sprint to beat USATF Half Marathon champ Alex Maier (45:15) and Biya Simbassa (45:23). Maier claimed the American Record, one second better than Conner Mantz's en route time during the Houston Half Marathon earlier this year.

● Curling ● Olympic silver medalist Bruce Mouat's Scottish rink claimed their second World Curling Men's World Championships in the last three editions in Moose Jaw (CAN) on Sunday.

Canadian star Brad Jacobs, the 2014 Olympic winner, had his rink at the top of the round-robin after an 11-1 record, ahead of the Swiss (9-3) and then China, Sweden and Scotland at 8-4.

In the playoffs, Mouat's Scots dispensed with Canada's Jacobs in the semis, 7-4, and Swiss Yannick Schwaller's rink dumped China, 7-3. That set up the final, with the Swiss leading, 1-0, through four ends, but Mouat coming up with two in the fifth, only to see Schwaller match in the sixth. The Scots scored twice more in the seventh, but the Swiss tied it at 4-4 in the eighth.

Finally, a score in the 10th gave Mouat and Scotland a 5-4 win and the title, their seventh in history and the second for Mouat, who won with the same team as in 2023: Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie, Hammy McMillan Jr. and Kyle Waddell.

Canada and Jacobs won the third-place game, 11-2, over China (Xiaoming Xu). The U.S., with Korey Dropkin as skip, finished 4-8, in 11th.

● Cycling ● The great Tadej Pogacar (SLO) did it again, riding away with another major race win, this time at the 109th Ronde van Vlaanderen – the Tour of Flanders – attacking with 18 km to go and winning over the 268.9 km course in 5:58:41.

That was 1:01 better than Mads Pedersen (DEN) and Mathieu van der Poel (NED), who ended up 2-3, with Wout van Aert (BEL) in fourth, with the same time. It's Pogacar's second win in this race, also in 2023.

The women's race was won by home favorite Lotte Kopecky, winning a final sprint of four riders at the end of the 168.9 km track, in 4:24:34. She was just better than Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (FRA) and Liane Lippert (GER), both with the same time, and a second up on Kasia Niewiadoma (POL). It was the third win in this race for Kopecky, who took it in 2022 and 2023.

¶

Colombia and the U.S. led the way at the Pan American Track Championships in Asuncion (PAR), finishing 1-2 on the medal table.

In the men's events, American riders won the Individual Pursuit (Anders Johnson), the Omnium (Peter Moore), Elimination Race (Brendan Rihm) and the Madison, with Moore and Rihm together, and they were both on the winning Team Pursuit squad. Rihm also got second in the Scratch Race behind Canada's Cameron Fitzmaurice.

Trinidad & Tobago star Nicholas Paul won the Sprint and the Time Trial (and his team took the Team Sprint) and Peru's Hugo Perez took the Points Race.

In the women's finals, the star was Mexico's Yareli Acevedo, who won the Scratch Race, Elimination Race and the Omnium. Colombia's Stefany Quadrado won the Time Trial over Hayley Yoslov of the U.S., and Lina Hernandez and Elizabeth Castano won the Madison.

American Emily Ehrlich won the Individual Pursuit and rode on the winning Team Pursuit squad for the U.S. The American squad also took the Team Sprint. Canada's Lauriane Genest took the Sprint and the Keirin.

In all, Colombia won 20 medals (3-10-7) and the U.S. had 13 (8-3-2).

¶

The UCI Mountain Bike World Series opened in Aranxa (BRA), with a stirring win for France's Olympic runner-up Victor Koretzky, winning the Cross Country Olympic men's race in 1:19:32, up 10 seconds on American Chris Blevins, the 2021 World Short-Track champ. Chile's Martin Vidaurre was well back in third in 1:20:01.

Blevins won the Short Track race on Saturday over Koretzky, 21:40 to 21:41.

New Zealand's Sammie Maxwell, the 2023 World U-23 gold medalist, took the women's Cross Country Olympic gold with a big lead after seven laps, but losing some of her lead on the final circuit, winning in 1:24:03. Moving up were two-time Worlds relay winner Nicole Koller (SUI) and 2023 U.S. champion Savilla Blunck, who went 2-3, both in 1:24:07.

Britain's 2024 World Short-Track winner Evie Richards won the women's Short Track race on Saturday over Maxwell, 21:25 to 21:26.

● Diving ● China dominated the World Aquatics World Cup in Guadalajara (MEX), but the home team had some celebrations, too!

Paris Olympic silver winner Zongyuan Wang won the men's 3 m Springboard easily at 540.15, way ahead of Juan Celeya (MEX: 457.45); American Luke Sitz was 10th (384.75). On the Platform, Mexico scored big with Randal Willars scoring 547.70 to overwhelm everyone, ahead of China's Zifeng Zhu (468.65) and Zilong Cheng (463.80).

Mexico also got a win in the 3 m Synchro, as Celeya and Osmar Olvera scored 430.23 points to edge newcomers Yukang Hu and Jluyuan Zheng (413.16) and British veterans Anthony Harding and Jack Laugher (396.06). Sitz and Josh Sollenberger of the U.S. finished 11th (341.07).

The men's 10 m Synchro was a close win for China's Zilong Cheng and Zifeng Zho with 449.49 points to 435.45 for Mexicans Kevin Berlin Reyes and Willars. The American duo of Joshua Hedberg and Tyler Wills finished fourth at 388.71.

Jia Chen and Yiwen Chen went 1-2 in the women's 3 m Springboard, scoring 380.55 and 372.90, beating Australian Olympic silver winner Maddison Keeney (352.00); American Sophie Verzyl placed seventh (302.25).

Yani Chang and Yiwen Chen took the women's 3 m Synchro with 323.79 points to 296.08 for Lia Cueva and Mia Cueva (MEX) and Keeney and Alysha Koloi (AUS: 287.85) in third. Americans Kyndal Knight and Anna Kwong finished seventh in 237.60.

China's Paris Olympic runner-up Yuxi Chen and Olympic champ Hongchan Quan went 1-2 in the women's 10 m Platform, scoring 419.35 and 414.40, ahead of Britain's 2024 Worlds bronze winner Andrea Spendolini Sireix (337.70). Daryn Wright was the top American, in ninth (271.80). In the women's 10 m Synchro, Wei Lu and Minjie Zhang were clear winners at 347.58, ahead of Gabriela Agundez and Alejandra Estudillo (MEX: 316.62).

China – Zilong Cheng, Zongyuan Wang, Yiwen Chen and Yuxi Chen – won the Mixed Team event by 489.10 to 416.45 over Italy, with Germany third at 396.20. The U.S. was sixth at 372.20.

● Equestrian ● At the FEI World Cup Final in Basel (SUI), France's Julien Epaillard and Donatello d'Auge sailed through the first two stages with no fault and in the third stage on Sunday, had no faults in the first round and only one error (4 points) in the second to end with just four overall and the victory.

That was just better than Ben Maher (GBR) and Point Break, who had just seven total points, and Kevin Staut (FRA) and Visconti du Telman (also 7, but slower in the final round). Katherine Dinan was the top American (13), with Out of the Blue, in eighth. Epaillard moved up from silver in 2024.

The Dressage Grand Prix Freestyle saw familiar winners. Britain's Charlotte Fry, the Paris Olympic bronze medalist, won at 88.195% aboard Glamourdale, followed by German legend Isabell Werth – with DSP Quantaz – at 84.365%, with Isabel Freese (NOR, with Total Hope OLD) in third place at 81.850%.

Fry, Werth and Freese also went 1-2-3 in the Grand Prix Final a day earlier.

● Football ● The USA women met Brazil in a friendly at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on Saturday, in a re-match of last summer's Olympic final won by the U.S., but with a more emphatic outcome.

The Americans were on offense from the start, with immediate pressure. Midfielder Alyssa Thompson quickly found space, dribbling into the middle of the field and sent a lead pass to a cutting forward Trinity Rodman in front of the goal and she sent a right-footed toe-tap into the right side of the Brazilian goal at the five-minute mark. It was Rodman's first game since the Olympic final against Brazil in Paris last year, thanks to a back injury.

Thompson almost got a goal herself in the 17th, as her shot from the top of the box toward the far right side of the Brazilian goal was saved by keeper Lorena. The U.S. had more chances, from forward Ally Sentnor (18th) and Rodman (22nd), but Lorena was equal to those challenges.

Brazil had chances too, with striker Amanda Gutierres challenging U.S. keeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the 30th, but Tullis-Joyce handled it; she stayed busy throughout the half. Possession was 50-50 in the half, but Brazil ended with a 9-6 edge on shots.

The U.S. came out with more control in mind in the second half, but Brazilian midfielder Ludmila hit the U.S. goal post with a shot in the first minute. Brazil got off three more shots on Tullis-Joyce by the 62nd minute before the U.S. offense got going, and in the 66th, Ludmila tackled Lily Yohannes in the box for a penalty.

Midfield star Lindsey Heaps calmly shutter-stepped, then a right-footed smash (barely) into the left side of the Brazilian net for the decisive 2-0 lead. From that point, the U.S. maintained most of the control and the game finished at 2-0.

With better possession on the ball in the second half, the Americans finished with 55% of the ball and had 16 shots to 15 for the visitors. They will meet again on Tuesday in San Jose, California.

● Gymnastics ● At the FIG Rhythmic World Cup in Sofia (BUL), Ukraine's Paris Olympic ninth-placer Taisila Onofriichuk took the All-Around, scoring 114.450 across two rounds, ahead of Bulgaria's six-time Worlds medal winner Stiliana Nikolova (110.65) and Uzbek Takhmina Ikromova (109.850).

● Swimming ● The second Tyr Pro Swim Series meet of the year was in Sacramento, California, saw a headline performance from American Luca Urlando and a world-leading mark from Australian distance star Sam Short.

Paris Olympian Urlando won the men's 200 m Butterfly in a world-leading 1:52.37, moving him to no. 4 on the all-time list and no. 3 in American history. He said afterwards:

“That was so cool, I was not expecting that at all. The last 15 meters, I was tightening up a bit, so I was telling myself to just hold my stroke together.”

Short, the 2023 World Champion in the 400 m Freestyle, won three events, taking the 400 m Free in a world-leading 3:43.84, and the 800 m Free (7:46.99) and 1,500 m Free (15:03.87).

April 7 – The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has a busy month unravelling the qualification mess that FIFA's Club World Cup has become following the late barring of Club León from the competition over multi-club ownership rules.

On Friday CAS confirmed it has registered individual appeals by both Club León and Club de Fútbol Pachuca (Pachuca) against FIFA over the decision in March to remove Club León saying that Pachuca and Club León breached the Regulations for the FIFA World Cup Club 2025 (Art. 10.1) concerning multiple club ownership.

Mexican clubs Pachuca and Club León both qualified by right but are both owned by the Groupo Pachuca. The ownership conflict was known at FIFA, but with an absence of guidance Grupo Pachuca took steps to put in provisions similar to those in place for UEFA competitions that allow two clubs under the same ownership to play in the competition.

“The Parties are currently exchanging written submissions for these appeals in accordance with the arbitration rules governing CAS procedures. The appeals will be expedited and heard during the week of 5 May 2025,” said CAS. The Club World Cup kicks off June 14 in Miami.

If CAS rules that ultimately FIFA were correct to remove Club León, who fills their slot.

A separate appeal filed at CAS by Costa Rica's Alajuelense in February, claims that they should be given the slot ‘immediately'. Their case is based on an unofficial ranking and that Mexico and the US already have two teams from their nations qualified (a separate rule for the competition qualification).

However, even if Alajuelense were, the next highest ranked team, they would likely not automatically qualify as they have not won that right through the qualifying competitions.

FIFA's competition rules do not provide for the next highest ranked team to qualify in this instance, rather the issue is a matter of ‘exceptional circumstance' which ultimately means that FIFA has the final decision over who will participate if Club León lose their CAS appeal and remain barred from the competition.

In short it looks like Alajuelense's appeal has the look of the old two hopes adage – Bob and No. The club probably knew this when they made their appeal.

So ultimately it looks like FIFA – under the principle of ‘exceptional circumstance' – will have free reign to decide who enters their competition, and like the decision to award the discretionary slot to Inter Miami, it will likely be made on commercial pulling power.

That would include the power to add a third team from either the USA or Mexico. A single winner-take-all play-off between Major League Soccer's (MLS) LAFC and Ligue MX giant Club América, has been mooted.

“FIFA can confirm it is considering a one play-off match between LAFC and Club América for the right to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025,” a FIFA statement read.

Unless, of course, CAS rules that Club León can stay.

Emma Hayes earned her 16th win as the USWNT head coach as the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) celebrate victory over Brazil.



The U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) showcased a blend of youthful energy and strategic prowess in a commanding 2-0 victory over Brazil at SoFi Stadium. This match marked the first encounter between the two teams since the 2024 Olympic gold medal game, reaffirming the USWNT's dominance on the international stage.​

From the outset, the USWNT displayed aggressive intent. In the 5th minute, forward Trinity Rodman, returning from an eight-month injury hiatus, capitalized on a precise assist from Alyssa Thompson to net her 11th international goal. Rodman's swift finish into the lower right corner set the tone for the match.​

The team's momentum continued into the second half. In the 66th minute, 17-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes, who had been on the field for just five minutes, drew a foul in the penalty area. Captain Lindsey Heaps confidently converted the ensuing penalty kick, marking her 37th international goal and solidifying the team's lead.​

Defensively, the USWNT was bolstered by the debut of goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. The 28-year-old Manchester United player delivered a stellar performance, recording six saves and securing a clean sheet. Her composure under pressure underscores the depth of talent within the squad.​

Head Coach Emma Hayes' influence was evident throughout the match. Since her appointment, Hayes has prioritized integrating young talent with seasoned veterans, fostering a cohesive and dynamic team dynamic. Her strategic vision and emphasis on player development have been instrumental in the team's recent successes.​

The match drew a crowd of 32,303 fans, marking the first-ever women's professional sporting event at SoFi Stadium and the second-largest USWNT attendance in the Los Angeles area, excluding the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.​

American tennis has just enjoyed a phenomenal week, with success across both the ATP and WTA tours.

All Houston Open quarter-finalists were American, with Jenson Brooksby beating compatriot Frances Tiafoe in the final.

It was an important tournament for such players, with Sam Querrey shocked by the lack of American success on the ATP Tour in recent times.

And such shock is understandable, with Andy Roddick's 2003 US Open success representing the last time an American man won a Grand Slam title.

Another all-American affair took place on the WTA Tour meanwhile, with Jessica Pegula beating Sofia Kenin in the Charleston Open final.

American women have, of course, had more success than their male counterparts over the years, with Madison Keys only recently winning the Australian Open.

But there is an American man that is proving himself to be a real threat now that the clay season has arrived, with other ATP players likely to want to avoid Brooksby on the surface.

Not only was he a qualifying wildcard in Houston, but he took out the top three seeds en route to the title.

The 24-year-old beat third seed Alejandro Tabilo in the round of 16, before beating top seed Tommy Paul and second seed Tiafoe in the semi-final and final respectively.

The manner of his success was also hugely impressive, with Brooksby showing phenomenal fight and determination to win his first ATP title.

It is a run that should strike fear into many of his potential opponents on clay in the near future, with the French Open now rapidly approaching.

The American reached a career-high rank of 33 back in June 2022, but was later hit with an 18-month ban for an anti-doping rule violation.

That sanction for three missed tests was reduced to 13 months and lifted in March last year, with Brooksby then slowly building his way back up the rankings.

But such gradual momentum has rapidly changed after his superb run in Houston, with the 24-year-old climbing a remarkable 335 places to 172nd in the world.

And while he is likely not the key player in a potential American men's revival, Brooksby may just inspire the likes of Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton and Paul to finally end their nation's painful Grand Slam drought.

Rafael Nadal left tennis last year as a legend of the sport, with 22 Grand Slam titles on his honours list.

Nadal secured Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces at the 2009 Australian Open, although the majority of his success arrived on clay.

The Spanish legend won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles at the French Open, well ahead of any other ATP player.

Nadal also triumphed four times at the US Open, as well as winning twice at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

It is now the first clay season since 2002 without Nadal, who decided to call time on his glittering career late last year.

Casper Ruud can fly on clay in Nadal's absence, with the latter having beaten the former in his last-ever Grand Slam final.

The 2022 French Open champion was asked in his winning press conference that year if he was surprised by what he had achieved in his career, with Nadal replying: “Well, for sure surprise is surprise.

“If not surprised you win 14 Roland Garros or 22 Grand Slam, it is because you are super arrogant. Honestly, no, I am not this kind of guy.

“I never even dreamt about achieving the things that I achieved. Honestly, no, I never considered myself that good.

“So I am just honestly keep going step by step, practice by practice, and always with a clear goal to improve something.

“That's my mindset during all my tennis career, no? Go on court and every practice with the goal to improve something in my game. I don't understand the sport another way.

“With that philosophy probably and with a lot of help from a great team next to me and family and friends, everybody who support me and help me during all my tennis career have been important for me, no?

“All the coaches, all the people that have been next to me in some moments, no? I learned from every situation, and not only in a tennis world. I learned a lot in terms of life. So that's all the experiences help me to grow always.”

Ruud has certainly impressed on clay throughout his career, with the Norwegian now aiming for success on the surface at the Monte-Carlo Masters.

Two of his Grand Slam final appearances have come on clay, but Ruud was on the receiving end of defeats on both occasions.

He currently occupies seventh in the ATP rankings, dropping one spot and replaced by Jack Draper ahead of Monte-Carlo.

Nadal meanwhile of course reached number one in the world during his glittering career, with all 14 of his French Open finals going his way.

Comedian Andy Hamilton was one of the key figures taking part in Save Wimbledon Park's held their sixth public meeting in opposition to the mammoth proposed development of the former Wimbledon Park golf club.

The All England Tennis Club (AELTC) submitted ground-breaking expansion plans, which were approved by Merton council and rejected by Wandsworth council.

The GLA were asked to rule, and they passed the plans. That decision is now the subject of a Judicial Review, launched by Save Wimbledon Park earlier this year. The estimated legal costs of bringing such a challenge are £200k, for which a crowdjustice funding appeal is currently underway.

A capacity crowd at St Barnabas Church in Southfields, heard legal and environmental presentations about the nature of the judicial challenge and the impact to the area if it all goes ahead.

Special guest and local resident Andy Hamilton (A Have I Got News For You regular) gave an impassioned speech on the importance of green open spaces under threat.

Mr Hamilton said: “It's important that the community win this battle to stop the AELTC swallowing up valued green spaces in order to build an industrial scale tennis complex.”

Save Wimbledon Park say AELTC were invited but did not attend, with their place on the stage was taken by a tennis racquet bearing their name.

Meeting organiser Simon Wright said “Another sell-out meeting indicates the strength of local feeling that these are the wrong plans for Wimbledon Park.

“During the Q&A session, the audience made it very clear that they do not want 39 practice courts, vast maintenance hubs, concrete driveways and a stadium the size of the Royal Albert Hall to be built in Wimbledon Park.”

Among those speaking out against the planned expansion was Thelma Ruby, who said: “I am 100 year old actress, living overlooking Wimbledon Common golf course. I am appalled by the Wimbledon tennis plan to ruin my life by chopping down hundreds of precious trees and turning a glorious heritage landscape into a polluting building site.

“If I have to see the desecration of my view and polluting lorries passing my door every 10 minutes and hear chain saws cutting down the trees I love instead of the sound of birds and Canada geese, I would rather not be alive. I am prepared to chain myself to a tree to save it.”

School boy Gabriel, nine, of Bishop Gilpin Primary School, said: “I think the AELTC planning is a terrible idea. A few months ago I started a petition to save the trees in Wimbledon Park.  My friends and I spoke to the whole school, and put posters up, I have over 100 signatures.

“My petition is about the trees and wildlife because I care about the environment.  I also love tennis I even play every week at the Wimbledon Club, but I would rather keep the trees and quit tennis if it helped.  I think it is important to protect these trees at all costs.”

Matt Birch, headteacher at Bishop Gilpin Primary School said: ” Gabriel has devoted himself to ensuring that the school community knows and understands the Save Wimbledon Park campaign.

“Gabriel has worked tenaciously in his own time to share the message and has demonstrated his true belief in the cause and we are very proud of him.”

“Tennis is broken. Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent,” said PTPA's executive director Ahmad Nassar last month. The Novak Djokovic-led Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) had just filed a major lawsuit. Their target? The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA. One of the issues at hand is pay disparity. That move sent waves through tennis. Now, top stars like Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka, Novak Djoković, and more are speaking up, asking Grand Slams to increase their share of revenue. Jessica Pegula, the new World No. 3, is among them. What did she say?

Let's talk money. The Grand Slams do shell out big bucks, but how much exactly? The US Open in 2024 had the richest prize pot in tennis history at $75 million—a 15% jump from the previous year. Wimbledon wasn't far behind, handing out $65 million. The Australian Open saw a 12% rise, reaching nearly $60 million. The French Open followed closely, offering around $59 million—up 7.8% from 2023.

Transitioning from numbers to action, L'Equipe first reported that a letter demanding a major revenue share increase was sent to the heads of all four Slams—Craig Tiley (AO), Stephane Morel (French Open), Sally Bolton (Wimbledon), and Lew Sherr (US Open). According to the Associated Press, the letter was dated “March 21” and featured 20 handwritten signatures from top players on both the men's and women's sides.

Speaking at a UTS event in Nimes, World No. 6 Casper Ruud added fuel to the fire. “As a player, I don't feel like it's fair… If you compare with other major sports around the world, NFL, MLB, NBA, they are closer to 50 percent revenue sharing.” The numbers don't lie. As per the PTPA, professional tennis players only get about 17.5% of the total revenue generated by the sport. Compare that to NBA athletes, who receive nearly 50%. That's a massive gap. And it's not sitting right with the top players anymore.

After her win at the Charleston Open, Jessica Pegula spoke about the letter and the larger movement with Tennis Channel.

She said, “That was more about the Slams trying to secure higher revenue shares—revenue that would go towards prize money, considering how much money they're making. I think there are also other things, like player welfare, but more details will probably come out in a couple of months. I'm always pushing for that kind of stuff. It's amazing to see what Ben (Navarro) has done for tennis, especially in the U.S., and particularly for women. That's awesome to hear. There's a massive discrepancy. People often assume there's equal prize money across the board, but it's really only at the Slams—and maybe one or two of the 1000-level tournaments. There's a huge drop-off between the 250s and the 500s. So just starting that trend toward better equity is huge for us. It's amazing.”

With tennis players getting just 17.5% of revenue, is it time for a major overhaul?

Debate

Speaking of Ben Navarro, the father of World No. 11 Emma Navarro and owner of the Charleston Open, made a big move. His company, Credit One Bank, extended its title partnership with the tournament through 2031. Thanks to this, the Charleston Open became the first WTA 500 to offer prize money on par with ATP 500 events—well before the 2033 deadline.

Pegula walked away with $164,000 after her Charleston win. The total prize pool? $1,064,510. All WTA 500 and 1000 events are now expected to match ATP levels. From 2026, the pool will rise to around $1.15 million and continue to grow. Meanwhile, many ATP 500s already offer over $2 million. So there's still a long way to go.

Beyond the paycheck, Pegula's Charleston title was special for another reason—it was her first-ever clay-court win.

After losing the Miami Open final to Aryna Sabalenka just a week earlier, Jessica Pegula bounced back in style. She adjusted beautifully to the green clay in Charleston and won her second title of the year. This also marked the eighth singles title of her career. The 6-3, 7-5 victory over fellow American Sofia Kenin sealed the deal. At 31, the American finally conquered clay.

The win gave her 300 points, boosting her from No. 4 to No. 3 in the rankings, equaling her career best from October 24, 2022. It also knocked fellow American Coco Gauff to No. 4, though there's less than 40 points between them. With that, Pegula also became the No. 1 American woman in tennis. There's more good news.

Pegula had missed last year's entire clay season due to injury. But this year, she's heading into Madrid, Rome, and Roland-Garros with zero points to defend. That's a free shot to rack up more wins. And she's leading the WTA Tour in victories this season with 25, ahead of even World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who has 23.

Jessica Pegula is making moves on and off the court. Whether it's fighting for fair pay or collecting titles, she's showing up. Will this movement finally push tennis toward true equality—or is it just the start of another long rally?

Let the world know your perspective.

"I never wanted to put any pressure because I really care about Marat."ByMatt FitzgeraldPublished Apr 07, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 07, 2025

MONTE CARLO—Andrey Rublev always had the idea in his head to work with the champion he idolized.At the start of this month, that notion came to fruition when Marat Safin signed on to join the world No. 9's team alongside long-time coach Fernando Vicente—debuting last Friday at the UTS event in Nimes.“Yeah, it's different. It's not like… yeah. I have to really focus,” Rublev shared with me in Monte Carlo after I asked how having Safin in his ear on court compared to having conversations off it.

On Sunday, the two had their first practice together at an ATP event. Across the net trained good friend Daniil Medvedev and hours later, Rublev teamed up with another close buddy in Karen Khachanov to defeat Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus.“Today was a good day. Me and Karen, we played really well. I lost many times against Venus and Mektic and now we were able to beat them,” summarized the 27-year-old.Said Medvedev the day prior when I asked for his take on the new combination, the 2021 US Open champion said, “Big combination. I'm practicing with them tomorrow, so I'm gonna see with my eyes how it works. I think it's going to be very interesting, positive in terms of PR for other people, for fans to enjoy it, But also in terms of work.”

In 2024, Rublev revealed that he turned to Safin to “fix my head” after dropping his Wimbledon opener to Francisco Comensana. He was grateful that the two-time major winner made the time for him, and while Rublev hoped to soak up more of Safin's insights, the Moscow native didn't want to force the issue either.“Deep inside, I always wanted to work together, but I knew that he was not interested. And I never wanted to put any pressure because I really care about Marat. Later on, I found out that he's kind of ready to work in tennis or something like that, that he don't mind.And then I say, ‘OK, even if it's not gonna be me, at least I can ask.' I have nothing to lose if I ask. Then my agent ask, they talk and little by little we work for a couple of days together.”

As for what ultimately drove Rublev to make this decision going into the European clay-court season? It came straight from the heart.“It was my feelings. There was no logic, no explanation,” he said.“I know him since I was a kid, and he was my inspiration. Then, he knows me for many years as well. When I start to play better tennis, we start to get to know each other more. I find out that he's a really nice guy and then later on, during I guess his life, he was struggling with his own struggles and he was able to (come) through. And that's it.”Rublev, who lifted the Monte Carlo crown two years ago for his maiden Masters 1000 title, is seeded seventh. Looking to snap a three-match losing streak that followed a triumph in Dubai, Rublev will have to get past Gael Monfils. On Monday, the 38-year-old Frenchman stormed back to beat Fabian Marozsan, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1.

Jessica Pegula's Meteoric Rise and the American Tennis Revolution

In the realm of tennis history, where legends like Max Decugis, Suzanne Lenglen, and Chris Evert once reigned supreme, a new star is on the horizon – Jessica Pegula. Fresh off her victory at the Charleston Open, where she outshined the competition and secured her second title of the 2025 season, Pegula is making waves in the tennis world.

Defeating top players like Sofia Kenin, Pegula has now climbed to the No.3 ranking, surpassing fellow American Coco Gauff as the new American No.1. With her sights set on even greater achievements, Pegula is not just aiming for the stars; she's reaching for the heavens.

In a recent interview, Pegula reflected on the possibility of breaking records, particularly Rafael Nadal's astounding 14 French Open titles. With a glint of determination in her eyes, she remarked, “Hey, you never know. Honestly, we always say ‘never say never.' I mean, we always think records aren't supposed to be broken, but they're meant to be broken. So, it's really cool.”

While Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros may seem insurmountable, history has shown that records are made to be shattered. Just look at Novak Djokovic's 428 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 or Iga Swiatek's dominance on the clay court with four French Open titles under her belt.

But Pegula's success is not just about her individual achievements; it's also a testament to the resurgence of American tennis. With players like Madison Keys and Coco Gauff making their mark on the international stage, the American tennis scene is ablaze with talent and potential.

As Pegula gears up for more challenges on the court, the question lingers – will she be the one to break barriers and set new records in the world of tennis? The stage is set, the competition is fierce, and Jessica Pegula is ready to carve her name into the annals of tennis history.

 Alejandro Tabilo won a first-round epic on Monday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, where he prevailed in a topsy-turvy deciding set to deny a Stan Wawrinka vs. Novak Djokovic clash in The Principality. 

 Facing Wawrinka on Court Rainier III, Tabilo recovered from a slow start and held his nerve after squandering a 5-3 lead in the deciding set to eventually prevail 1-6, 7-5, 7-5.

 Wawrinka, 40, was making his 15th appearance in The Principality, the fourth most in the Open Era. The 2014 champion was trying to record just his second tour-level win of the season and looked impressive at times against Tabilo, taking large cuts from both wings to overpower the Chilean in the early stages. 

 However, Tabilo refused to go away. The 27-year-old won 52 per cent of points on the Wawrinka first serve in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and earned victory on his third match point, having squandered a chance at 4-5. 



 Tabilo had not won a tour-level match on clay since Rome last year, losing eight matches in a row on the surface.  His reward for getting over the line is a meeting with two-time champion and former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic. Their only previous meeting came in Rome in 2024, when Tabilo shocked the Serbian en route to the semi-finals. 

In other early action on Day 2, Jiri Lehecka overcame Sebastian Korda 6-3, 7-6(7). The Czech is competing on clay for the first time since he advanced to the semi-finals in Madrid last season. He will take on Lorenzo Musetti after the Italian battled back to defeat Buyunchaokete.

Musetti upset Djokovic en route to the quarter-finals in Monte-Carlo in 2023, but it looked like he would be exiting early at this year's event. However, from a set-and-a-break down, the 23-year-old earned a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win against the Chinese qualifier.

Gael Monfils continued his impressive season with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 comeback win against Fabian Marozsan. The Frenchman holds a 6-2 record at ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, having reached the third round in Indian Wells and the fourth round in Miami.

 

The 38-year-old, who won the title in Auckland earlier this season, made his debut in The Principality in 2005, losing to Rafael Nadal in the first round. Still going strong 20 years later, Monfils will play seventh seed Andrey Rublev in the second round.

Daniel Altmaier shocked Jannik Sinner at Roland Garros two years ago and earned another impressive win on clay Monday when he defeated 16th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(5), 6-3 to clinch his first main-draw victory at the event. The German qualifier will next meet Richard Gasquet.

American Marcos Giron improved to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Denis Shapovalov with a 6-3, 7-6(5) win.

Rafael Nadal's Unbelievable Triumph: The Epic Comeback That Shook the Tennis World

In a jaw-dropping reflection, Rafael Nadal revisited the 2022 Australian Open final showdown against Daniil Medvedev, where he stunned the world with a remarkable comeback. Admitting that he had doubts about his victory, Nadal showcased unparalleled resilience to clinch his second Australian Open title in a match that will go down in history.

The Spanish tennis maestro's journey to the final was nothing short of spectacular, conquering formidable opponents like Denis Shapovalov and Matteo Berrettini en route to his sixth final appearance in Melbourne. Despite facing setbacks in previous Australian Open finals, Nadal refused to let go of his dream of clinching the prestigious title.

The final match against Medvedev was a rollercoaster of emotions and intensity. Nadal found himself trailing by two sets but refused to back down. In a nail-biting turn of events, Nadal fought back from a precarious 2-3, 0-40 position in the third set, demonstrating his unwavering determination. With sheer grit and skill, he clawed his way back into the match, eventually triumphing over Medvedev with a final score of 3–6, 6–7(5), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5.

Nadal's victory not only secured his 21st Grand Slam title, propelling him to the top of the male major winners' list alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic but also solidified his status as a tennis legend. The intensity of the match was not lost on Nadal, who confessed to moments of uncertainty during the battle.

“I thought I was going to lose. But it was very important not to let myself go. I've been a player with a good capacity for self-control,” Nadal revealed. “The 4% was worth fighting for. That's always been my point of view.”

Following his historic win, Nadal embarked on a phenomenal 21-match winning streak at the start of the season, a testament to his unwavering determination and unparalleled skill on the court. His exceptional performance culminated in his 14th French Open title and 22nd Grand Slam trophy, further solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Nadal's unparalleled comeback at the 2022 Australian Open will be etched in the annals of tennis history as a testament to his indomitable spirit and unyielding resolve in the face of adversity.

                            2025 Charleston
                        


Greg Garber


Clutching the vibrant crystal trophy late Sunday afternoon, Jessica Pegula ran through the usual on-court thank-yous -- to Credit One Charleston Open owner, Ben Navarro, tournament director Bob Moran, the ball kids, the enthusiastic crowd.

And then she paused and shifted into a heartfelt reminiscence.

“I grew up in Hilton Head, South Carolina, going to Smith Stearns Tennis Academy,” Pegula said, voice cracking, tears appearing at the corners of her eyes. “I learned how to play tennis there on the clay, where the old Family Circle Cup used to be … then spent a couple of years training here on Daniel Island in my early 20s.

“To be able to come here this week after a long two weeks in Miami and take the title is just incredible.”

Indeed it was. In a transcendent, triumphant circular journey, the top-seeded Pegula won the first clay-court title of her career at the age of 31.

The 6-3, 7-5 win over Sofia Kenin was the final flourish in a breathtaking (literally) flurry by Pegula.

Pegula was serving, down 5-1 and on vapors after a taxing three weeks. Kenin worked her for three set points, but Pegula eventually escaped with the game. That was the turning point, because Pegula won the last six games and the final 10 points of the match.

Back on March 21, Pegula won her first match in Miami. She made it all the way to the final, losing to World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka but stayed committed to playing what she considers her hometown tournament. The victory over Kenin was her 10th in 11 matches -- in a span of only 17 days.

And so, Pegula finds herself the highest-ranked American, at No. 3, trading spots with Coco Gauff. And her 25 match-wins this year are two more than any other woman.

“Honestly, I always play well in Miami,” Pegula said. “I told myself, `You can play well here. You like the conditions here. Why not try and win the tournament?'

“I'm just happy because I have a lot of points coming up on the summer swing. So I'm glad that I was able to make up some ground early in the year. It takes a little pressure off.”

Pegula was around seven years old when she first started at Smith Stearns and spent more than five years there before moving to Florida.

“I always felt like that was where I learned to play tennis,” Pegula said. “The technicality of my strokes, which I feel like are a big advantage now that I look back. Everyone always praises me on my technique and my strokes a lot. Billy Stearns was able to instill that in me at a very young age. To teach me my strokes was very important. That is something that's really cool when I look back to the first couple of days of learning to play tennis.

“That's where I grew up a little bit. It was such a fun time in my childhood and living in Hilton Head and being in the Low Country and playing a lot of tennis. That's where I learned to play, so it's really cool to come back to Charleston and be able to take home the title.”

Afterward, Pegula fielded a few questions from wtatennis.com:

Second set, down 5-1, facing 3 set points … your thoughts?

Pegula: I think at that point I was thinking just to try and hold, try to get a little momentum going into the third. Hadn't held the entire second set, didn't want to get broken going into the third set. It was just stop the bleeding a little bit. That game in hindsight was a massive game. I think that kind of shifted the momentum.

Growing up in Hilton Head, what did you learn from Hall of Fame and two-time Grand Slam singles champion Stan Smith?

Pegula: Stan would always do a lot of serving stuff. Focusing on the toss, a lot of that technique stuff. My serve is something I've worked on a lot over the last couple of years. It's really cool … he's also a fellow Adidas guy, so we've gotten to shoot some cool Adidas stuff together. Him and Billy [Stearns] always text me after every match and every week and are always in touch. Stan texted me even yesterday and was like, `I watched your match and your perseverance is terrific.' He always says something nice, and I think that's really, really cool that he still is following my career. I tend to see him a lot, especially at the Grand Slams when he comes in for the second week. It's cool to keep that relationship.

You won 10 of 11 matches in a span of 17 days? Did you surprise yourself?

Pegula: A little bit. But I think that the fact I did so well at the end of last year had given me that confidence to be able to go on long streaks. I remember coming off Toronto, going into Cincinnati and the US Open I was like, `You know what? I can win these matches over two, three weeks and have a good record. I can be match-tough, and I can handle these situations if it's a different environment, different court, different conditions.' I think I was able to carry that into this week

You're scheduled to play the Billie Jean King Cup in Bratislava, Slovakia -- on Friday. Are you going to go and what are you looking forward to the most the next few days?

Pegula: As of right now, yes, I'm planning to go. Looking forward to having dinner with some of my friends tonight who are in Charleston. Sleeping tomorrow and then flying Tuesday to Slovakia, which is going to be tough. Honestly, I love team sports, and I'm going into the next few weeks not too seriously. Maybe take a breather, try to have fun with the team, try to get the win but not going to take a coach to BJK or Stuttgart, probably. Try to have a little bit of a more relaxed couple of weeks. I want to win and play some good tennis, enjoying it a little bit more.

Jenson Brooksby overcame the odds to lift his maiden tour title in Houston. Ranked at No. 507 in the world after injuries and a ban sidelined him for two years, the American needed a wildcard just to get into the qualifying event. Brooksby won two matches in qualies before storming through the main draw.

The 24-year-old beat the top two seeds back-to-back to be crowned the champion on Sunday, becoming the third-lowest ranked champion on the ATP Tour. Brooksby shot up the rankings as a result and now sits at No. 172

Brooksby was just starting to make waves on the professional circuit when he was forced out of the game for two years. The American reached a career-high ranking of No. 33 in 2022 and started the 2023 season on a high.

After earning his first top-three win over Casper Ruud at the Australian Open, he was sidelined by wrist surgery. Then, in October, Brooksby was hit with a ban for “whereabouts failures” - being accused of missing three doping tests in a one-year span.

Brooksby disputed the second missed test. The International Tennis Integrity Agency later reduced his suspension from 18 months to 13 months when “new information relating to the circumstances giving rise to the missed tests” was submitted. The ITIA concluded that his degree of fault “should be reassessed”.

It meant Brooksby was eligible to return in March 2024. But more physical setbacks meant he didn't return to competition until January this year.

The 24-year-old initially struggled when he came back, losing his first three matches in a row. But he gained momentum in Indian Wells, upsetting Felix-Auger Aliassime, and has now done the unthinkable in Houston.

Brooksby was ranked outside the world's top 500 entering the clay-court event, but organisers gave him a wildcard into qualifying, and he saved a match point to beat top seed Federico Gomez before taking out Patrick Maloney.

The American continued his fairytale run in the main draw, saving more match points in his second-round contest against Alejandro Tabilo and in his semi-final showdown with world No. 13 Tommy Paul.

On Sunday, Brooksby capped off his statement week by beating another top-20 player, Frances Tiafoe, 6-4 6-2 to claim his first title.

“The support has been amazing since round one of qualifying. Thank you, everybody. I've loved the support here and it's great to be back in Texas,” the newly-crowned champion said.

Brooksby later told the ATP: “It means the world. It was one of my biggest goals ever since I've been a professional tennis player.

“It just means a lot to have my first one. It really does. It's probably the best week of my life.”

Reflecting on all the match points he saved in Houston, he added: “I've had a lot of different life adversity, whether it's on the court or off the court.

“So I think it makes these situations… I still get nervous about them and somewhat tense for sure, but I think it gives you a different perspective once you've had to face other difficult things in life.

“And then also, I'm just someone who hates to lose and loves to win in general - obviously tennis being most important, but even in other games, and I think that's just how I'm wired as a person.

“I just really love winning, so that transfers over into when I'm in tough positions and maybe you should lose in those situations, that I'm able to at least find a way out of it sometimes.”

As the ATP Tour embarked on the clay season, the Italian players certainly didn't waste any time proving their skills on the surface as Fabio Cobolli and Luciano Darderi claimed all the honors in tournaments in Bucharest and Marrakech respectively.

Flavio Cobolli completed a remarkable turnaround week in an otherwise very difficult 2025 season to claim his first ATP Tour title on Sunday at the Tiriac Open in the Romanian capital. Cobolli got the better of Sebastian Baez, winning 6-4, 6-4 to complete a dream title run at the clay-court ATP 250 tournament.

Cobolli's triumph in Bucharest marked a stunning turnaround of the season for the Italian, who otherwise arrived in Bucharest on the back of an eight-match tour-level losing streak.

Despite losing the final, Baez could take heart from another deep run on clay in 2025. Baez has won more tour-level matches (79) on the surface since the start of the 2022 season than any other player.

Another Italian who arrived with a poor record before a tournament was Luciano Darderi who came to Marrakech with a 2-8 tour-level record for the season. But Darderi dropped just one set throughout the tournament and claimed his second ATP Tour crown by defeating top seed Tallon Griekspoor 7-6(3), 7-6(4) in the championship final.

On the women's WTA Tour, Jessica Pegula is enjoying a superb season, and it got even better on Sunday when she won the first clay tournament of her career by beating fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-3, 7-5 to capture the Credit One Charleston Open title. Pegula has now won 17 of her last 19 matches, and recorded her 25th win of the season against Kenin. She will overtake Coco Gauff as the top-ranked U.S. player, and rise to a career-high World No. 3.

A big question on the Women's WTA Tour is if we will ever see Greek contender Maria Sakkari back to her best. The former World No 3 had a dreadful past season struggling with mental fatigue and endured a frustrating year, with early Grand Slam exits and extended losing streaks before a shoulder injury ended her season prematurely when she was forced to retire in the first round of the US Open against Wang Yafan.

"The pressure, it was a lot, being constantly chased and having to prove something to everyone," Sakkari told WTA Insider. She has already suffered comprehensive defeats this year against Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek.

At Charleston, where she reached the semi-final last year, it did not mark a turnaround for Sakkari, who crashed out of the tournament already in the second round where she lost to the Olympic champion, Qinwen Zheng, 6-4, 6-1.

On the Men's circuit, Kazakhstan's 24-year-old Alexander Shevchenko, who made his ATP debut at the 2022 Generali Open in Kitzbühel, is struggling to find the form which in February last year catapulted him into No 45 in the world rankings, his best ranking ever.

Shevchenko struggled for form over the back half of 2024 and was unable to defend the points he had earned in Basel (did not play) and Metz (first-round loss), thus finishing as World No. 78. His record in 2025 is 4-7 and he also looked out of sorts in Marrakech where he lost in two sets to the Austrian Filip Misolic in the second round. He has now dropped to 106 in the rankings. 

It's unusual you bring a dog to a winning ceremony. Nevertheless, that was the case when Jessica Pegula celebrated her first title in the clay-tournament in Charleston by holding on to her dog Maddie, a miniature Australian shepherd, when she presented the trophy. 

Pegula and her husband, Taylor Gahagen, actually brought all of their three dogs to the tournament, and she apparently tries to bring her dogs to all of her tournaments when it is possible. 

In fact, Pegula's devotion is so profound that it's permanently inked on her skin. Among her collection of tattoos, one stands out—a delicate paw print. This isn't just any tattoo; it's a tribute to her furry companions. 

Pegula's passion for dogs extends beyond her personal life into her philanthropic efforts. She and her husband, Taylor Gahagen, who share a deep love for dogs, run a charity called *A Lending Paw*. The foundation's mission is to train rescue dogs to become service animals, thus supporting both dogs and people in need. 

Jenson Brooksby captured his maiden ATP title at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Sunday with a stunning win over 2023 champion Frances Tiafoe to cap off a superb tournament that he began as a wild card in the qualifying rounds. The American also came out on top in a breathtaking rally against Tiafoe, when he under intense pressure fired a double-handed backhand winner down the line. 

Veteran Richard Gasquet beat Matteo Arnaldi 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 on Sunday to reach the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters, but the Italian had the better of Gasquet in this duel, when he, seemingly having lost the point, scraped an incredible forehand winner past the discouraged Gasquet. 

The Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006, is the first of three ATP Masters 1000 tournaments played on clay.

Top seed Zverev and second seed Alcaraz are chasing their first titles in The Principality, while Djokovic seeks tour-level trophy 100. Stefanos Tsitsipas has fond memories of Monte-Carlo, having won three of the past four editions.

The tournament has always been a favorite for players and fans due to its magnificent location at the Monte-Carlo Country Club. 

Spain's Rafael Nadal is the ultimate king of the tournament, having won 11 titles at the event, including an Open-Era record eight successive titles between 2005-2012.

Women's tennis will, for the upcoming week, be dominated by the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers, which takes players across six countries, three continents and three different surfaces.

Defending champions Italy and hosts China are automatically qualified for the finals, which will be hosted in Shenzhen, China.

In the storied history of the French Open, several legends have left their mark at Roland Garros. Max Decugis dominated the pre-Open Era, winning eight French Championships, a tournament that was then exclusive to French club members. Then we have Suzanne Lenglen, who also excelled in that period, claiming six titles. Just when you think it couldn't be topped, in the Open Era, Chris Evert emerged as the most successful woman. She secured seven French Open singles titles that stood the test of time until Rafael Nadal broke the record in 2013. Nadal eventually retired with an astonishing 14 French Open titles, and while many would think that record is safe forever, Jessica Pegula disagrees.

On Saturday, Pegula clinched her second title of the 2025 season at the Charleston Open. In an exciting all-American match against the 2020 Australian Open champion, Sofia Kenin, the 31-year-old triumphed with a 6-3, 7-5 victory. This win bumped her up to the No.3 position in WTA rankings, a feat she last achieved in October 2022. But this time, she's surpassed Coco Gauff as the new American No.1.

Following the match, Pegula sat down with Tennis Channel and spoke about her Charleston Open run. However, they took a detour from tennis to discuss a recent feat made by NHL's Alex Ovechkin, who surpassed Wayne Gretzky to become the NHL's all-time leader in goals by scoring his 895th in a 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Sunday! This prompted the interviewer to wonder: Does Jessica think someone could “break Rafa's record one day” of 14 French Open titles?

Well, Jess definitely holds out hope for it! She said, “Hey, you never know. Honestly, we always say ‘never say never.' I mean, we always think records aren't supposed to be broken, but they're meant to be broken. So, it's really cool.” And it's a possibility! We have seen records that seemed impossible to break being broken before.

For instance, Novak Djokovic's impressive 428 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 overthrew Roger's 310 weeks, demonstrating his enduring excellence alongside his 24 Grand Slam singles titles, matching Margaret Court's record. While no one has come close to Rafael Nadal's record at Roland Garros yet, a few have made big strides in this Grand Slam.

Iga Swiatek has been proving her dominance on the clay court. She is the first Pole to win a major singles title and has won four titles at the Roland Garros (2024, 2023, 2022, 2020). Alongside her 2022 US Open win, she doesn't need to prove further that she's certainly in the running to break a few records.

Coming back to Jessica, the Charleston final was her fourth appearance in the finals this season. It also marked the first all-American final in Charleston in 35 years – a feat Pegula recognized as the rise of American tennis.

Is the American tennis scene poised for a new era of dominance with Pegula at the helm?

Debate

On Saturday in the Round of 4 at the Charleston Open, Jessica Pegula beat Ekaterina Alexandrova in a thrilling match that saw her come back from a second-set loss to win 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. This victory marked her second consecutive final, after Miami, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka.

As Pegula advanced to the final in Charleston, she couldn't help but feel thrilled about facing fellow American Sofia Kenin. This all-American showdown marked the first in a Charleston final since 1990, when Martina Navratilova (who became a US citizen in 1981 took down Jennifer Capriati.

Speaking to Tennis Channel post her semifinal match, Pegula exclaimed, “That's awesome. It just shows the depth that the Americans have right now, especially on the women's side. There are so many of us, it's annoying almost!”

She's right; the American women's tennis scene is buzzing with talent. Madison Keys, for instance, won her first Grand Slam title this year, marking a significant milestone in her career. Before that, Coco Gauff made history by winning the 2023 U.S. Open at just 19 years old. Pegula is proud to be part of this dynamic group, noting, “There's just every week there's someone to root for because there's usually somebody doing good, and I'm just happy I get to be part of it.”

American tennis once dominated the sport. Navratilova's nine Wimbledon crowns stand as a testament to her grass-court supremacy, while Bill Tilden's seven US Championships titles remain unmatched by any American man. Then, there's Pete Sampras, with 14 Grand Slams under his belt, while Chris Evert's seven French Open titles remain a benchmark for American women. Not to forget, Serena Williams, with 23 Grand Slams, is the epitome of success.

Carlos Alcaraz is now in the zone for the clay court season, with the Monte-Carlo Masters up first for the Spaniard.

Alcaraz can impress on clay this season, in what is the first such season since 2002 without his compatriot and legendary figure Rafael Nadal.

The former has been handed a bye in the first round of the Monte-Carlo Masters, with Fabio Fognini or Francisco Cerundolo up in round two.

WTA star Paula Badosa loves watching Alcaraz, but the ATP number three fell to David Goffin in his first match at the Miami Open.

Elsewhere in the Sunshine Double, Alcaraz lost in the Indian Wells semi-finals to eventual champion Jack Draper.

He has now shared a verdict on his season so far, which includes one title at the Rotterdam Open, with Alcaraz saying: “I am really happy with the way I am playing.

“Since I started the year I have been playing great tennis. Tennis is not just about hitting the ball. It is about more than that. It is about mentality, physical side.

“With my game I am really happy about it. If I don't win it doesn't matter if I play well or not. People are not thinking about the opponent, they are just thinking about me.

“If I lose something is going on people say. I don't think that is fair. I am just happy and ready to play well on clay.

“A lot of people might have said we should have played better tennis or won more tournaments but I don't think that is fair.

“I think the draw in every tournament is very open and a lot of players are playing good tennis and they deserve to be there.

“There are so many players who play well on clay and on all surfaces. In the clay season I think it is going to be interesting. I see a lot of players who are capable of doing great things on clay.

“I am really happy to be here. It is a tournament I have only played [once]. I want to come here and play great. I am really excited about practising here and getting ready for my first match.”

It is not Alcaraz but Nadal that has dominated the Monte-Carlo Masters over the years, with his 11 titles more than any other player.

Alcaraz meanwhile boasts 17 ATP titles throughout his stunning career so far, eight of those have arrived on clay.

But he is now set for just his second appearance at the tournamnet, having missed the last two editions due to injury.

And in his opening match of the ATP Masters 1000 event three years ago, he lost to American Sebastian Korda.

Jack Draper didn't play any tournaments last week, but he rises from No. 7 to No. 6 on the new ATP rankings today after Casper Ruud—who didn't play last week either—drops points from reaching the semifinals in Estoril during the same week last year, and dips from No. 6 to No. 7.It's a new career-high ranking for Draper, and with that, he joins a very exclusive list: he's just the second left-handed player this century to reach the Top 6 on the ATP rankings, after Rafael Nadal.Seems hard to believe, right?Well, there have been plenty of left-handed players in the ATP Top 10 since the start of 2000—eight of them in total, including Nadal and Draper—but none of the others made it higher than No. 7.Nadal, of course, spent 209 career weeks at No. 1.LEFT-HANDED PLAYERS IN THE ATP TOP 10 THIS CENTURY:Marcelo Rios [ranked as high as No. 7 in 2000]Mariano Puerta [career-high No. 9 in 2005]Rafael Nadal [career-high No. 1 in 2008]Fernando Verdasco [career-high No. 7 in 2009]Jurgen Melzer [career-high No. 8 in 2011]Denis Shapovalov [career-high No. 10 in 2020]Cameron Norrie [career-high No. 8 in 2022]Jack Draper [career-high No. 6 in 2025]The last time a left-handed player other than Nadal or Draper was in the Top 6 of the ATP rankings was the week of November 1st, 1999, when another Brit—Greg Rusedski—spent his last week at No. 6.

To add to the stat's uniqueness, Draper isn't even a lefty in real life, as he described after his semifinal win over Carlos Alcaraz at Indian Wells.“I think, weirdly enough, my leftiness is a big plus, but I think the fact that I'm actually a right-hander, I think that really helps me, because my forehand has been improving all the time,” he said. “My forehand is naturally the shot where, you know, I'm not as comfortable. It's always been my backhand that has been the shot, like, I can hit with my eyes closed, you know. I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand. Usually that's something where players struggle. But with me, that's a big strength of mine.“I think the mix of that is a big advantage.”The 23-year-old is the No. 5 seed in Monte Carlo this week, with a bye into the second round. He has nothing to defend at the first Masters 1000 clay-court event of the year, having fallen in the first round a year ago.

There are also a lot of notable ranking moves for Americans this week, starting with former No. 33 Jenson Brooksby, who soars from No. 507 to No. 172 after capturing the first ATP title of his career in Houston, where he came back from match point down in three matches en route to the final.On the WTA rankings, Jessica Pegula rises from No. 4 back to her career-high of No. 3—switching spots with Coco Gauff—after winning the first clay-court title of her career on the green clay of Charleston.Meanwhile, up-and-coming American lefty Robin Montgomery makes her Top 100 debut, rising from No. 105 to No. 100 after a second-round showing in Charleston, where she fell to Danielle Collins.And last but certainly not least, probably the biggest surprise of the week: 16-year-old Californian Julieta Pareja soars more than 200 spots from No. 550 to No. 335 after a breakthrough run in Bogota, Colombia, where she made it all the way to the semifinals in her first WTA main draw.She had been a wild card into qualifying, too.Pareja was the youngest player to reach a WTA semifinal since Coco Gauff won the first WTA title of her career as a 15-year-old in Linz in 2019.

Brooksby has pulled off upsets all week, saving match point in three matches after battling out of qualifying to beat top seed Tommy Paul in the semi-final.

But he was in control of the all-American final from the outset as he secured his first career ATP title in style.

The 24-year-old broke Tiafoe's first two service games to race out to a 4-0 lead, hitting a series of spectacular winners and although he gave up that lead and was pegged back to 4-4, he broke again to secure the set, winning with a pickup volley as he fell to the floor.

It was Tiafoe's third straight final at the event but the world number 17 was unable to claw his way back into the contest in the second set, a superb backhand passing shot from Brooksby allowing him to break for 4-2.

Brooksby won eight of the last ten games and converted on five of six break points.

Brooksby's promising career progress, which saw him reach a career high ranking of 33rd in 2022, was halted by a 13-month suspension for anti-doping violations, keeping him out of action until March, 2024.

He reached the third round at Indian Wells, allowing him to climb up from 937 in the rankings and his victory in Texas will see him return to the top 200.

"Thank you to my team. All the way from qualifying, match point down," Brooksby said during the trophy ceremony. "That's pretty intense, so thanks for sticking with it, every match, every day here for me."

In the summer of 2004, Anastasia Myskina lifted the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen and made history. By winning Roland Garros, she became the first Russian woman to claim a Grand Slam singles title. This milestone would open the floodgates for a new generation of talent from her country, including players like Maria Sharapova. But while others went on to global stardom, Myskina's time at the top was surprisingly brief.

Known for her quick footwork, aggressive baseline play, and feisty demeanor on court, Myskina started her pro career in 1999. By 2003, she cracked the top 10 and was seen as one of the leaders of a growing Russian movement in women's tennis.

However, when she arrived in Paris for the French Open in 2004, she was far from being considered the favorite to win the title. In her previous 16 Grand Slam appearances, she hadn't reached the last eight. However, in a formidable run, she defeated her compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in a tough match in the semifinals, before facing another Russian, Elena Dementieva, in the big final.

“I can't believe it!” she expressed after the final, after she made history. That year, she helped Russia secure its first Fed Cup title and reached the semifinals in the Olympic games. That season, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2. It was a successful season all around, and she was named, alongside Roger Federer, singles World champion by the ITF.

What followed her breakout year was a puzzling decline. In 2005, she suffered from a shoulder injury in Charleston, as well as off-court pressures, such as her mother being diagnosed with cancer, according to ESPN.

When it came to defending her French Open title, she became the first champion to lose in the opening round, after being defeated by Spain's Maria Sanchez Lorenzo 6-4, 4-6, 6-0. It was just one of many disappointing results, and she ended the season outside of the Top 10 for the first time in three years.

She later acknowledged how deeply this affected her ability and motivation to compete at the highest level. “I just have no confidence. I hit the ball and it just goes off the court… I have no explanation, really… no. Right now when the ball comes to me I just don't know what to do,” she told the press after being eliminated from the French Open, crying (via CNN).

The following year, she was attempting a comeback. “I give one more chance to myself this year to do well, and I have a goal,” she told the press in 2006, cited by ESPN. However, she suffered from a foot injury and couldn't make an impact.

By 2007, at just 25 years old, Myskina played her last match but never announced an official retirement. There was no farewell tour, no major announcement. One of the sport's most significant champions simply faded from view. In total, she won 10 WTA titles and $5.6 million in prize money. 

Since retiring, Myskina has kept a low profile. She has worked occasionally in tennis commentary for Russian television and has been involved in some coaching, as well as Fed Cup captain, and ambassadorial roles. But mostly, she has focused on her personal life, including raising her three sons.

“It's a very tough job, but you learn how to understand the needs and wants of a child. You know how to help them,” she said about motherhood to Indian Express in 2018. “You become patient and that always helps you deal with the problems a player goes through. The only thing is that you can help them only when they are off court.”

Still, her legacy remains. Myskina's win at Roland Garros signaled the arrival of Russian women's tennis on the global stage. Within a few years, Maria Sharapova, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Dinara Safina would all reach Grand Slam finals — with several winning titles of their own.

“Sometimes I think seven years was not enough, but they were a good seven years,” Myskina told Indian Express. However, she also acknowledged that she wasn't considering any comebacks.

In many ways, Anastasia Myskina's story runs counter to what we expect from champions. She didn't chase every record or extend her career for longevity's sake. She won big, then walked away. But for those who remember 2004 and her place in Russia's tennis tradition, Myskina's place in history is secure.

Yuki Tsunoda haaddressed Liam Lawson's Red Bull demotion during the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, insisting that he "will bounce back." 

Tsunoda stepped into the Red Bull seat alongside four-time champion Max Verstappen in front of his home crowd in Suzuka. The Milton Keynes outfit decided to swap Lawson with Tsunoda after just two races of the 2025 season.

The Japanese driver initially missed the opportunity to replace Sergio Perez in the top team when Red Bull chief Christian Horner and motorsport advisor Helmut Marko put their faith in the New Zealand rookie, Lawson.

However, Lawson was only given two race weekends in Australia and China before he was moved to the sister squad. 

While speaking to Sky Sports during the Japanese Grand Prix weekend, Tsunoda addressed Lawson's exit from Red Bull, stating:

“Well it wasn't easy for me as well at the end of last season. He did his best for sure. We all did our best and he got the Red Bull seat which was fair and I just had to accept it. He'll bounce back very strongly in the RB.

"RB is currently in good shape. The people there are amazing, very supportive. If we have all four cars fighting top 10, there's probably the best Red Bull result ever so we have to bounce back strongly.”

Although Tsunoda didn't bring home any points in Japan with a twelfth-place finish, Horner is confident he can take a step forward in the next few races. He commented:

“That race was totally dominated by qualifying, and probably 90% of the drivers finished where they qualified.

“He made one pass, and then we undercut Pierre [Gasly] during the pit stops, and then he was stuck behind Fernando [Alonso].

“So he's dialed himself into the car. He's dialed himself into the team and I think he should make a step forward, certainly over the next few races.”

Rami Malek is detailing how working with Paul Thomas Anderson on “The Master” inspired him to expand his filmmaking career outside the realm of acting. 

Malek, who appeared in the 2012 ensemble film alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jesse Plemons, and Laura Dern, said during SiriusXM's “Faction Talk” channel town hall that his dismay at a long monologue being cut led him to start producing his own films.

Malek executive produces “The Amateur,” a remake of the 1981 film, and stars as a CIA decoder who is on a mission to avenge the murder of his wife. Malek was accompanied by his co-stars Laurence Fishburne, Rachel Brosnahan, and Caitriona Balfe, plus director James Hawes, during the “Faction Talk” appearance, below.

“I remember doing a scene on ‘The Master' with Paul Thomas Anderson, and it was a long monologue and I labored over it for so long,” Malek said. “After we were done, I thought about it and thought about it. And of course, I went to see the film and it wasn't even in the picture.” 

He added, “I got a sense at that point that I'd love to at one point direct. I'd love to produce, I'd love to see this career evolve and I like to see things from start to finish. And it's been an enjoyable process. It's been a really challenging one as well. But no one here has been more invested than James [Hawes], I must say, in seeing this. All the way through from beginning to end. It's taken up quite some time for you. And I hope you're proud of it and you feel some sense of relief at this point.” 

Anderson said in 2017 that “The Master” was the film he was most proud of at the time.

“The first time we shot spherical was on ‘The Master,'” Anderson said. “It seemed like a good fit, evoking the old 50s films like ‘Vertigo' and ‘North By Northwest,' those large format films but in a boxy frame. It was a nice change from the earlier films. I wanna shoot scope again though…maybe next time.”

Anderson's next film “One Battle After Another” starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is set to hit theaters this fall.

As longtime Hallmark star Brennan Elliott and his family wade through deep grief following the death of his wife, Camilla Row, he's also dealing with scam artists trying to profit off his loss. 

Row died on March 22, 2025, after an eight-year battle with gastric cancer, leaving behind Elliott and their two children — Liam, 12, and Luna, 10. Elliott shared a heartbreaking Instagram post that day to share the sad news with his 76,000 followers. Two weeks later, on April 4, Elliott returned to his account to reveal how upset he was to learn that someone was posing as him on Facebook, where he does not have an account. 

Looking somber in a baseball cap and hoodie, Elliott captioned his selfie by writing, “I wanted to post something and make it very clear! Anybody following or in any interaction on Facebook with me is dealing with an imposter!!!  I do not have Facebook and never have. This POS person is acting as if he or she is me and trying to profit off of my families situation with my wife's death.” 

A post shared by Professional experiencer (@brennanelliott2)

Elliott ended his post by asking anyone who sees Facebook accounts posing as him to “report them asap.” Facebook lists over 30 fraudulent accounts claiming to be Elliott, including one with over 10,000 followers. Many of the accounts have lifted photos from Elliott's Instagram account and fabricated writings about Row and his children, pretending to be him. 

One fake post uploaded on April 7 featured a photo of Elliott and Row with a paragraph about her, written to sound like Elliott had penned it. Within two hours, nearly a thousand people had liked the post and written comments, thinking they were responding directly to the “His & Hers” star. 

Hundreds of fans flooded Elliott's post with words of support and shock, including one who wrote, “People make me sick pretending to be someone especially at this time if grief. Hope your family is doing well under the circumstances. Sending love & hugs. 💜💜💜”

Another commented, “This is just heartbreaking 💔 Brennan! Keeping you and your family in my thoughts and prayers!🙏🏻”

Elliott's struggles with social media scams is not new; in early 2024, EntertainmentNOW reported that the actor had to shut down his account on X (formerly known as Twitter) due to hackers and temporarily make his Instagram private due to scammers. In 2025, his only active social media account is his Instagram account, which has a verified blue checkmark.

Facebook says it has 15,000 content reviewers trained to spot posts and accounts that violate its standards, but imposters posing as celebrities is an ongoing issue there and across social media. Some, including those purporting to belong to Hallmark stars, have convinced fooled fans into providing personal information and sending money. 

In January, one such situation that made headlines involved a 53-year-old French woman who thought she was communicating with actor Brad Pitt. According to Variety, the fan was swindled out of $850,000.

Many Hallmark stars have addressed similar scams, noting that they will never reach out to fans asking for them to follow them, communicate with them or send money to them. 

On March 15, “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” star Victor Webster posted on Instagram that he'd just “blocked about 50 fake accounts.” 

“Those are ones that have my name in it,” he wrote. “But there are plenty of people pretending to be my publicist or manager or assistant etc. I can only do so much, people have to be savvy to this this day and age” 

Dealing with a similar issue, frequent Hallmark actress Catherine Bell posted a guide to her official social media accounts and wrote, “Please watch out for scammers and fakes! There are dozens if not hundreds and many of them are sadly asking people to DM them or sending them to Links where they're trying to take money and exchange for chatting with ‘me' or a meet & greet.”

Like Elliott, she asked that her fans “block and report” any posts or accounts that are not from her verified accounts, urging them, “Please don't be fooled! 🙏🏼”

	ESPN host Stephen A. Smith said Monday that he is “leaving all the doors open” to a potential presidential bid, as his name has been mentioned as a potential unconventional choice in the Democratic field for 2028.


	After appearing at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, Smith posted an article about the speculation and wrote on X:  “Time to stop messing around. Life is great. Especially at ESPN/Disney. Hate the thought of being a politician. But sick of this mess. So I'm officially leaving all doors open.”


	At the NAB Show, Smith talked extensively about the possibility and said he would “no longer close the door,” according to Forbes.

	











	Smith recently signed a five-year, $100 million deal with ESPN.

	There's a big gap between considering a presidential bid and actually launching one, as figures like Dwayne “The Rock” and Bob Iger have entertained the possibility, only to stay out of politics.


	Smith's name has come up in the aftermath of the Democrats‘ defeat. On The View last month, Smith was asked about polls that showed him among the contenders. “I make of it that citizens, particularly on the left, are desperate,” he said. He voted for Kamala Harris but has been critical of the Democratic Party, appearing on Fox news and shows like Real Time with Bill Maher. Smith also has attacked Donald Trump, lately over the president's across-the-board tariffs.

Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor is having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee. During a recent solo performance at the Spookala horror and pop culture convention in Tampa, Florida, the musician performed a stripped-back rendition of Chappell Roan‘s “Pink Pony Club” with a little rock edge.


	“I know you wanted me to stay/But I can't ignore the crazy visions coming from L.A./And I know that there's a special place/Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day,” Taylor sang, strumming an acoustic guitar and getting a few cheers out of fans in the audience. “I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee/Oh Santa Monica, I hear it calling me/Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene/She sees her baby girl, and then she's starts to scream.”

	Taylor performed 14 songs throughout the set, including covers of Nine Inch Nails' “Something I Can Never Have,” Foo Fighters' “Everlong,” Violent Femmes' “Add It Up,” Incubus' “I Miss You,” and the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song for good measure.

	He joins an extended list of musicians who have tried on Roan's pop hits. “Pink Pony Club” was the preferred selection for Kacey Musgraves, Blink-182, and Ed Sheeran, while others including Sabrina Carpenter, Miranda Lambert, Franz Ferdinand, Muna, and more have opted for “Good Luck, Babe.” 


	“Did you mean, ‘Your favorite artist's favorite artist?'” doesn't pop up anymore when you search for Roan on Google, but the sentiment stands true. In her Rolling Stone cover story, the 27-year-old noted the influx of musicians who reached out to offer their support during her overwhelming breakout year. “Not a lot of boys have been like, ‘Let me know if you ever want to talk about it,' ” she said at the time, noting that the few who had include Orville Peck, Troye Sivan, Noah Kahan, and Elton John. “It's been sick to have artists that I've looked up to for many years, sometimes my whole life, reach out.”

For Billboard's inaugural Indie Venue of the Month series, 9:30 Club owner Seth Hurwitz discusses how a smelly little club became a national touring destination.

	Taylor Mims


Writer


In the 1980s, it was considered a win when a small venue like the 9:30 Club only lost $100,000 in a year. Back in ‘86, when promoters Seth Hurwitz and Rich Heinecke (Hurwitz's former high school substitute teacher) purchased the six-year-old, rat-infested 200-capacity space from married couple Jon Bowers and Dodi Disanto, they knew it was more of an investment than a money-maker.  


	“The 9:30 was a loss leader,” Hurwitz tells Billboard, “but I needed to do the small acts so I could get them on the big stage like R.E.M., Smashing Pumpkins.” 


	Those were the rules of regional concert promotion before the giant national corporations like Live Nation and AEG entered the picture. Every region would have a closed network of promoters — “famously designed and perpetrated by Frank Barsalona and Premier Talent,” Hurwitz explains — and to make your way in, you had to start from the bottom.  




			Trending on Billboard		







	Hurwitz can't say for certain why he always wanted to put on concerts. He speculates that maybe it stems from his love of presenting music to others. In elementary school, he'd skip outside time during recess to play records he brought in, and, at home, he played disc jockey, setting up a little electronic kit where he could broadcast radio just far enough for his household to hear in other rooms.  


	More likely, he believes he got into the business to feel important and integral to the live music experience. “[I wanted to put on shows] probably so I could go anywhere in the show. In fact, I hate going to other people's shows because I get told I can't go here or there and I hate that,” he says.  


	In his teens, Hurwitz began booking shows at a local movie theater with a stage; he later moved up to larger shows with Heinecke's financial backing.


	“When it came time to put on a show, [Heinecke] had the money and I had been to New York to visit agents with the promoter Sam L'Hommedieu Jr.,” says Hurwitz of tagging along from D.C. with the co-founder (along with Jack Boyle) of the 162-seat club Cellar Door. “It was just one trip, but I learned a lot. Probably the most important thing I learned was how to pass [on booking an act], which is a lost art.” 


	In his early twenties, Hurwitz and Heinecke's promotion company, I.M.P., was working in tandem with Ian Copeland, who was emulating Barsalona's promoter network in the D.C. metro area. I.M.P. booked the smaller shows in the region at the Ontario and eventually the original 9:30 Club, where they became the exclusive bookers. By 1986, Disanto was done taking the financial hit of running a small club and sold it to I.M.P.  


	“She was like, ‘Here, you buy it. I'm sick of this.' And we did,” says Hurwitz of his first venture into venue ownership. By booking shows at the 9:30 Club, Hurwitz and Heinecke had been able to grow with acts as they progressed to money-making shows at arenas, and though he says he didn't have an interest in buying the club, Hurwitz knew they couldn't allow the entry point for their talent pipeline to dry up.  


	Until it did.  


	In 1993, Dante Ferrando and a group of investors that included then-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl opened the neighboring venue Black Cat, which could be scaled from 500 to 800 capacity.  


	“Now there was another [club] with a bigger stage, bigger dressing room, bigger capacity, and all our so-called friends walked,” says Hurwitz. “It was a hard lesson to learn.”  


	In order to compete, I.M.P. purchased another old venue in a neglected part of town and moved the 9:30 Club to its current location at 815 V Street in January 1996.  


	“We wanted to create the greatest club ever — never an argument again. No question where people would play,” says Hurwitz. “We invented the mega club. The challenge was at the 9:30 Club, we got all these acts, we got the history (which was honored at that time, not so much now) because we had the best small plays. We still needed the best small plays. We needed to have the best big club and the best small club.” 


	For the new V Street 9:30 Club, they created a moving stage that could shrink the room from 1,200 to 300 without anyone noticing. And they wanted to move away from the old rock'n'roll ethos of a smelly, dirty black box like the former space. The new 9:30 Club serves good food, has great sightlines, is never too hot (the venue invested in extra AC units to be sure) and the staff is always kind to fans.  


	Another point of pride for Hurwitz is the lack of sponsorship around the 9:30 Club. There is no signage with corporate sponsors. There is no VIP area, balcony seats don't sell for more money and, most importantly, they do their best to keep ticket prices low.  


	“It's an egalitarian sort of situation. It is not this velvet rope kind of thing. You go with your people, you're treated nicely, you're not uncomfortable and you have fun,” he says.  


	The current 9:30 Club opened in January 1996 with two sold-out shows by The Smashing Pumpkins and it's continued to build its reputation from there. In its nearly 40-year history, the venue has hosted such legendary acts as Tony Bennett, Bob Dylan, Adele, Iggy Pop, Drake, Justin Timberlake, James Brown, Lou Reed, George Clinton, Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson, Radiohead and countless more.  


	I.M.P. has grown with its artists and now also owns and/or operates the 1,200-capacity Lincoln Theater, the 2,500- to 6,000-capacity Anthem (both in D.C.) and the 19,000-capacity Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Md. In 2023, I.M.P. spent $10 million to build another small club, the 450-capacity Atlantis, which is a replica of the original 9:30 Club minus the smell. While Hurwitz says small clubs are still “a losing proposition,” The Atlantis helps feed bands to the 9:30 Club and I.M.P.'s larger clubs from day one via the company's promotion and marketing. “It's not just a placeholder,” he explains. “We want to make you bigger so that we will make more money next time.” 


	That strategy has panned out for I.M.P. through the lost art of the pass. “We do pass on things that we don't think are cool enough for the 9:30 Club. A lot of the acts that don't play us, we actually passed on. So, I'm sorry, but people count on us to curate,” says Hurwitz. “We don't have enough dates to do the acts we want to do. Why would I do something that I think sucks or has no potential?”

“Black Mirror” creator Charlie Brooker wants to sever cultural ties between his Netflix sci-fi series and Apple TV+ hit “Severance.” While both series have delighted audiences across various seasons, Brooker admitted that he knows he'll be “jealous” of “Severance” whenever he does decide to start watching it.

Brooker told The Hollywood Reporter that audiences have made him wary of beginning the acclaimed series. It turns out, people can't help but compare the two series. “There's certainly a show I haven't watched that's made me jealous,” Brooker said. “People keep telling me to watch ‘Severance,' and I haven't let myself do it because they also say to me, ‘Oh, you'll love it. It's a bit “Black Mirror”-y, but it's much better.'”

“Severance” just concluded its second season, while “Black Mirror” is back for Season 7 on April 10. The six-episode season includes the first sequel installment in the franchise, the “USS Callister: Into Infinity” with actors Cristin Milioti, Billy Magnussen, and Jimmi Simpson reprising their respective roles from the 2017 “USS Callister” episode. Brooker teased that “USS Callister: Into Infinity” could be the start of more sequel episodes for the franchise.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“There's a degree of freedom within the format,” he said. “We've done a sequel for the first time this season. We're now looking at old episodes and thinking, ‘How could you revisit that idea?'” Brooker added, “As long as it's interesting, I'm allowed to make it and people continue to fucking watch, I'd like to keep making the show.”

Brooker also credited Netflix for providing “tonal breaks” in the rollout of the anthology series, especially with the ordering of the episodes (“USS Callister: Into Infinity” will serve as the Season 7 finale.) “When we did the first season for Netflix, I thought ‘San Junipero' or ‘Playtest' should be the opener. Netflix was like, ‘No, we think it should be “Nosedive.”‘ I felt like it was, I don't know, quite gentle?,” Brooker said. “So, I tested it out by showing a friend of mine. About ten minutes in, she went, ‘Oh, my God. This is an absolute fucking nightmare.' Turns out it was accessible, and it was the best choice. But there's an element to ordering these that's like sequencing an album. You need tonal breaks.”

[Editor's note: The following article contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 8, “Amor Fati.”]

Mike White‘s characters aren't just complicated; they're contradictory.

Take Kate, whose every evocative smile is expressed by the luminous Leslie Bibb. Among her trio of old friends on a once-in-a-lifetime vacation, Kate is the polite peacekeeper. In the premiere, she gushes over how lucky they are to still be together after all these years, and in such a luxurious exotic locale at that. In the finale, she expresses sincere appreciation for the “blooming” garden that is her life, so bright with family, faith, and friendship.

In between, Kate partakes in the same private gossip her friends do whenever one of them is out of earshot (“And the vanity…. Did she sandblast her face or something? It's very waxy,” she says about her TV-star bestie), but she doesn't get off on stealing Laurie's crush, like Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), or calling out Jaclyn's adultery, like Laurie (Carrie Coon). “One person's ‘fake' is another person's ‘good manners,'” Kate says when Laurie prods her to speak her mind. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






It would be easy to see Kate as the most morally sound member of the group… save for one complication: She (very likely) voted for Donald Trump. Probably twice. Kate's near-confession stands in stark opposition to how she treats those closest to her. We see how much she cares about her friends first-hand, and we hear, per her own account, how active she is in her church back home. But her vote is incompatible with that identity. Supporting a president and a party who perpetuate suffering — by putting kids in cages, tearing families apart, and, well, I can't possibly list every example — doesn't jibe with Kate's consistent attempts to take care of everyone around her.

Perhaps that's why when she's asked if she voted for Trump, all she can muster is a smile. What she's done is so misaligned with how she acts that she can't speak it into existence, here, in front of her blooming garden. It's a thorn caught in her throat. 

In another show, with a lesser writer, such incongruities could be read as character inconsistencies, accidental oversights, mistakes. But with White, they're the whole ballgame, and in “The White Lotus” Season 3, they help illustrate the spiritual malaise plaguing our crisis-ridden cast of characters. How they act and what they believe aren't aligned. Their minds and bodies are out of sync. It's a neverending struggle, thrust into conflict by animal urges — for sex, for revenge, for money — that demand immediate satisfaction over long-term health.

 










You can see it in Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) when his unabashed quest for pleasure at any cost catches up with him. You can see it in Rick (Walton Goggins) when the time he's spent dwelling on a painful past overwhelms the fresh-faced happiness he's found in the present. But perhaps my favorite example, and the one that had me doubled over in dark groans of laughter as the credits rolled on Season 3, is when Timothy Ratliff (Jason Isaacs), a soon-to-be convicted criminal who nearly murdered his entire family with poisoned piña coladas, sails into the sunset believing himself a hero.

You see, the rich man about to lose everything finally realized that people are more important than things. He may have ruined his family's lives and forever tarnished his ancestral legacy — his grandfather was the governor — but he didn't kill his wife and children on vacation, so he feels pretty good! He can go home and face the music, knowing he did the right thing. Well, at least one right thing. Kind of. Maybe.

Not all of White's contradictions delivered the bleak humor or uncomfortable insights audiences have come to expect from “The White Lotus.” Despite IndieWire's enthusiasm for Season 3, it was clear by the time the finale aired that the trip to Thailand may need more sorting out than previous journeys. So in addition to Proma Khosla's weekly reviews, we've convened Executive Editor Ryan Lattanzio and myself, Ben Travers, for an emergency discussion about what worked, what didn't, and what's next for “The White Lotus.” Just don't expect us to agree.  

 










Ben Travers: Ryan, I suppose it was inevitable, yet I found myself surprised at just how polarizing “The White Lotus” became in Season 3. At first, complaints seemed to be rooted in over-familiarity: The characters are too similar to previous seasons, the structure feels too rigid, and the story may have moved to Thailand, but it isn't going anywhere new. OK, fine. What some may refer to as repetitive, I consider to be comfortable. Television is built on repetition, and anthology series in particular rely on recognizable set-ups to keep audiences on the same wavelength, season after season, new cast after new cast. 

But as the season progressed, the [shudders] discourse really went off the rails. Impatience breeds hostility, and the comparatively long, relatively tame road leading to Episode 5 set up an explosion of discontent — when incest once again popped up in HBO‘s Sunday night drama, and the takes turned truculent. The brotherly love was provocation for provocation's sake, except, no, it made perfect sense for these two particular siblings. It's a serious issue that should be taken seriously, but so long as you remember these are actors with no actual relation to each other, it was also kind of hot? Whoa, hold up, that's too far. We can't separate the artists from the art, not like this.

 










As someone who reviewed Season 3 based on six of the eight episodes, I wasn't shocked to see so many viewers mirroring Chelsea's (Aimee Lou Wood) stunned expressions over Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and Saxon's taboo three-way. I was just surprised to see how much vitriol accompanied it for the show as a whole, as if people had been waiting for an excuse to vent their frustrations with Season 3 and incest was their tipping point. The same bewilderment struck me again today, the morning after the finale premiered, when so many fellow critics took White's ending to task, if not everything that preceded it. Feeling pretty good about the finale (and season) myself, I have to ask: How were you feeling leading up to the finale, and how are you feeling now that you've seen it?

Ryan Lattanzio: This discourse over this season not only went off the rails, it also became really… dumb? While reflecting an audience that maybe has gotten dumber and that, between Seasons 3 and 2 of “The White Lotus” want to be told how to feel, to be pandered to more with more-of-the-same plot? To those who came away from episodes saying, “Nothing happened!,” that translated to “Nobody was fucking or dying.” Mike White, who proved himself something of a narrative edgelord in Season 2 with scenes designed almost expressly to make the gays gasp, sought this time to deliberately edge us — tease us with tantalizing moments of portent (like Leslie Bibb's early, awkward run-in with Parker Posey or, to another extent, the red herring of an incest moment between Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola) but then deny us their inevitable, plausible climax.

 










The discourse I'm referring to as dumb or dumbed-down has to do with the credulity-stretching interpretation, the too-close reading, that happens online, like this X user pointing out how Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Woods' floating corpses form the yin and yang symbol. Do they? OK then. Or similarly, users pointing out that the Ratliff children, when seated three abreast, resemble the three wise monkeys of see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil. OK? The thing about patterns in the clouds is they're there if you're looking for them. I'm not sure how such readings help us understand White's vision better — but also it may be because his vision was a little less fully cooked this time. The shootout in the finale felt ripped from another (lesser) series, Sarah Catherine Hook's monologue as Piper, now wanting to wash Thailand off her, just a bit of a pat cheat (and a more cynical White on display).

Ben, where do you stack up Season 3 against the other seasons? Do you agree with other criticisms of the finale? Alan Sepinwall particularly took Mike White to task in his Rolling Stone review. Mainly what did not work for me this season was, of all things, the theme song, stripped of its usual jaunty mischief. (And we now know what happened there, or at least one side of the story.)

 










Ben: I tend to agree Season 3 is the least streamlined of White's initial trilogy, but I don't share my colleagues' frustrations with the ending. And speaking of monologues, Carrie Coon's surprising final sentiment has to be one of the finale's pinnacles. 

As Jaclyn and Kate wax poetic about a dream vacation that never happened, Laurie's weary, silent glances seem to tee up an explosive confrontation. Their grudges and jealousies have been simmering just under the surface for seven episodes, and they can finally have it out! Not when Laurie is drunk and bitter. Not when Jaclyn is obstinate and over it. Not when Kate is receding into the background, like Homer Simpson into his hedge. Now, they're sitting calmly around the dinner table, about to head home, with no knowledge of when they'll ever see each other again. Their defenses are down, so let's get into it!

Instead, Laurie tilts even further into vulnerability. “All week I've just been so… sad,” she says, surprising her rhapsodic dinner companions and deflating the expectant tension in the audience. During their time together, she's looked back on the rest of her life and seen so little that lasts. Her devotion to work didn't pan out. Her marriage didn't either. But Jaclyn and Kate are still there. She's still part of something. Sure, they have their differences, but what are a few foibles compared to a lifetime of friendship?

 










Earlier, Laurie watched Jaclyn and Kate taking photos together in the pool. Every other time she saw them isolated from her, they were slinging mud behind her back (or, at least, it seemed like they were). Now she sees them enjoying each other, appreciating each other, and being present with each other. Instead of feeling excluded, she remembers why she's been included on this trip, in this trio, to begin with.

These kinds of reversals are White's bread and butter. He's created enough believable, human contradictions within his characters that's it's just as plausible to believe Laurie will express appreciation for her enduring friendships as it is to expect her to tear them each a new asshole. (And they, in turn, will tear her one, as well — Laurie ain't no saint.) Knowing the scene could turn either way adds immediate tension to the percolating tension of the episode, and it's a formula that works time and time again throughout the feature-length finale.

While we wait to find out who will die and why, we're also on pins and needles waiting to see if Rick will follow his demons down to a dark end (as he did) or run off with the white light of love he'd so recently embraced. We're waiting to see if Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) will stick to his beliefs or be enticed into violence for love and money. We're waiting to see if Tim will confess what he's done to his family or if he'll avoid the awkward conversation by murdering them. (Seriously, that man's a monster.) 

 










My biggest disappointment was where the tension went slack because the situation didn't make sense. I'm OK with Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) backing out of her plans with Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul) just like Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) backed out of her plans with Belinda — I mean, it's a pretty awful thing to do, but I believe she'd do it, given what the show has to say about the wholly corruptible influence of affluence. I just didn't buy how she got there. Season 3 worked overtime to make sure we saw how scared Belinda was of Gary/Greg (Jon Griess), but it didn't work hard enough to show that she was willing to risk her life and her son's life for a big payday. (When she allows Zion to take part in the negotiations, she must've known that if Gary/Greg decided not to pay up, her son would be a target, too.) 

Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with the finale. For a moment, I felt robbed of seeing the Ratliffs learn of their ensuing bankruptcy, but leaving that discovery to our individual imaginations is even better: Do you really think a man of means like Timothy is going to prison and his family will lose everything? If so, congratulations on maintaining faith in America's justice system despite ample evidence to the contrary. If not, it only makes Timothy's Buddhist epiphany that much more amusing. (He'd probably consider his unexpected freedom a reward for doing the right thing — aka not murdering his family — and devote his life to Buddhism… before backsliding the second his golf buddies gave him a weird look.) Piper's confession rang true to me, and Saxon reading a book — knowing it's not because he might get to have sex with the person who lent it to him — is all the evidence I need of just how impactful this trip has been for our favorite “soulless” sicko.

 










But I've prattled on long enough. Ryan, do you think the reaction to Season 3 will have any affect on what Mike White plans for Season 4? Do you hope so? 

Ryan: It can be to a show's true creative detriment when writers (in this case, there's just one of them) capitulate or bend a series too much toward the mercurial weather systems of online chatter; it can start to feel like narrative events in the show are no longer organically born from its universe but instead, indeed, from a room of people going by the internet. (Looking at you, “Yellowjackets.”) If anything, I think Mike White will continue to defy audience expectations, or at least the philistine ones' demands. Each week of this season was nothing but action-packed — that is, if furtive glances and freighted dialogue are action enough for you.

This week's finale hit a series high of 6.2 million viewers, up more than 2 million from the (very excellent and arguably even more viral) Season 2 finale. This only means more, more, more “White Lotus” will come to HBO (it's been renewed for Season 4), but Mr. White ought to stop and smell the roses a bit before diving headfirst into another season — that's when the best ideas happen. 

I recognize that Greg (Jon Gries) is the established villain in “White Lotus” mythology, but I am almost ready for White to blow up the series and start with an entirely new ensemble. Greg's just not that interesting a villain, and whatever Season 3 was doing with him didn't satisfactorily pay off or, at worst, felt like an extended setup for a Season 4. “The White Lotus” might be ready to move on from his milieu, especially knowing that the show is probably never going to off him in some grand, climatically coalescing fashion. (The Walton Goggins shootout felt like a direct rebuke of anyone expecting that.) It's chilling enough just knowing there's a Greg out there in the world, living his life, so can't that be that?

 










The potential successor to Jennifer Coolidge or Natasha Rothwell I'd love to see again? Parker Posey's Victoria Ratliff, years down the line, her life perhaps blown to bits after her husband's near-family annihilation and financial revelations, picking up the pieces, alone and boozing and pilling at another vacation destination. 

One thing's for sure by the end of this season: “The White Lotus” won't be driving Lorazepam sales the way I thought with Episodes 2 and 3.

“The White Lotus” is available on HBO and Max. The series has already been renewed for Season 4.

The singer is gearing up to release her next album this year.

	Lizzo is gearing up to release her next album Love in Real Life, and she's reflecting on the mental health break and journey she had leading up to the album.


	The star joined the On Purpose With Jay Shetty podcast, where she discussed taking a “gap year” in releasing music. “I don't feel like I've expressed myself fully in the last two years, like how I want to. I feel like I've been kind of holding my tongue and like staying to myself, but I think that it's for the best because you know, running your mouth these days,” she said. “Sometimes it's just unnecessary and sometimes it can get you into some stuff you wasn't even trying to get into because people will misinterpret it and run with it. I found when I was like, I'm taking a gap year, I'm protecting my peace. But like, people were like, wait, so what's that supposed to mean?”

	Lizzo has already released two songs from her upcoming album, “Still Bad” and the title track. Aside from “Pink” for Greta Gerwig's 2023 Barbie soundtrack, the first singles from the project mark the Yitty founder's first proper releases since 2022's Special, which reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and spawned two-week Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single “About Damn Time.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	It also marks her first album since the harassment lawsuit brought by three of her former dancers in August 2023.


	The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles by dancers Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams and Noelle Rodriguez, accuses Lizzo (real name Melissa Jefferson) and her Big Grrrl Big Touring Inc. of a wide range of legal wrongdoing and included dozens of pages of detailed allegations. Lizzo denied the claims in a response shared to Twitter, calling them “false allegations” and “sensationalized stories.”


	Lizzo told Shetty of public perception, “I think when it was out of my control and someone else could tell a story about me that wasn't true and people believed it, it crushed me,” before adding, “I think what I learned about fame is, even if that's really me, it just becomes kind of like a, a fictional story that you, it's a character, it's a brand, it's a thing that now doesn't belong to you anymore.”


	She continued, “Whoever Lizzo is to the world is not really even me. And that disconnect is depressing. And I think the only remedy to that is continuing to be myself. That's the time. I just have to continue to be me and people will see me for who I am.”

	











	Ultimately, Lizzo concluded, “I'm never gonna stop… If anything, I'm more careful now. I can't just let any author into my life who can make me a villain. I can't do that anymore. 'cause I'm the author and I. Taking back my narrative by continuing to tell my story from me, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to do that.”

The legendary group photo “proving” that Jack Nicholson‘s Jack Torrance never really left the Overlook Hotel in “The Shining” has been finally found in real life, 45 years later. 

Stanley Kubrick's iconic film was released in 1980, with Nicholson and Shelley Duvall playing two parents who relocate to a remote resort to look after the empty property during its offseason. As struggling author Jack descends into madness, the blood-soaked past of the Overlook Hotel infiltrates his tenuous understanding of the present. The final sequence in which the audience sees Jack in one of the old photographs at the Overlook is one of the most famous scenes of the film.

Now, New York Times reporter Aric Toler has sourced where the photo exactly was from, and who was really in it. Toler wrote in a thread on X that he worked with retired British academic Alasdair Spark for almost a  year to solve the “mystery” of the picture, wondering “where did the original photo from the end of ‘The Shining' come from, and where/when was it captured?” 

Toler discovered that the original photo was taken from the BBC Hulton Archive, which was later purchased by Getty Images. Murray Close, a photographer who worked on “The Shining,” confirmed to Toler that this is where the image was taken from, with Nicholson's face being “pasted on” on the body of famous jazz dance instructor Santos Casani. The photo itself is from a Valentine's dance on February 14, 1921 at the Empress Ballroom in the Royal Palace Hotel in London.

“The Shining” fans can recreate the image, in part, by visiting The Stanley Hotel, the real Colorado resort that inspired Kubrick. The resort was transformed into an immersive horror experience in 2024 from Peacock and Blumhouse. Producer Jason Blum is set to curate an ongoing horror cinema exhibit housed within the hotel in partnership with the Colorado Office of Film, Television, and Media.

The making of “The Shining” on location was also captured in 2024 documentary “Shine On — The Forgotten ‘Shining' Location,” as produced in partnership with the Stanley Kubrick Film Archive and the late auteur's estate.

"I'm grateful we can move forward," John commented about ending their decades-long feud.

	After two decades of snipes and barbed words traded back and forth, Madonna and Sir Elton John are here to report a groundbreaking piece of news — their feud is apparently over. 


	In a photo posted to her Instagram on Monday (April 7), the “Material Girl” singer is giving the “Rocket Man” star a side-hug, and reported that she and the star are on the same page at long last. “We Finally Buried the Hatchet!!!” Madonna wrote in her caption. “I went to see @eltonjohn perform on SNL this weekend!! WOW.”

	











	In the caption, Madonna revealed that seeing one of John's shows when she was in high school “changed the course of my life,” helping her realize that she wanted to become a pop sensation. So, when John publicly expressed his disdain for her, she says she felt wounded. “I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different —to stand out — to take the road, less traveled by,” she wrote. “Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn't understand it.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The pair's feud officially started in 2002, when John said that Madge's “Die Another Day” was “the worst Bond tune ever” and that the track “hasn't got a tune.” He continued to throw digs at the pop singer at the 2004 Q Awards, where he lambasted her winning the best live act award at the ceremony. “Madonna, best live act? F— off. Since when has lip-synching been live?” he asked. “I think everyone who lip-synchs on stage in public when you pay, like, 75 quid to see them should be shot.”


	The feud escalated in 2012, when both Madonna and John were up for best original song at the 69th annual Golden Globes — Madonna for “Masterpiece” from W.E., and John for “Hello, Hello” from Gnomeo & Juliet. When Madonna eventually won the award, John's husband, David Furnish, blasted her win on his Facebook account, claiming that her victory showed the awards had “nothing to do with merit.” Madonna, for her part, reacted to John and Furnish's comments backstage, saying “[John]'s been known to get mad at me, so I don't know. He's brilliant, and I adore him, so he'll win another award. I don't feel bad.”


	But on her latest Instagram post, Madonna revealed that when she went to go visit with John backstage at SNL on Saturday (April 5), the “Your Song” singer was immediately apologetic. “I needed to go backstage and confront him. When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, ‘Forgive Me' and the wall between us fell down,” she wrote. “Forgiveness is a powerful tool. Within minutes. We were hugging.”

	











	Madge even revealed that this reconciliation could potentially bear fruit. “Then he told me had written a song for me and he wanted to collaborate. It was like everything came full circle,” she wrote. “And you can tell everybody , This is Your Song……….”


	John thanked Madonna for “forgiving me and my big mouth” in the comments of the post, highlighting her work as an activist for the fight against HIV and AIDS as one of the many reasons he admires her. “I'm not proud of what I said. Particularly when I think about all the groundbreaking work you have done as an artist,” he wrote. “I'm grateful we can move forward.”


	The star added that he hoped the two of them could serve as an example to people around the world of what reconciliation looks like in a divided political landscape. “I'm increasingly distressed by all the divisiveness in our world at the moment. Both you and I have wholeheartedly been accepted and embraced by communities who are under threat around the world,” he wrote. “By pulling together, I'm hopeful that we can make great things happen for those who really need support.”

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


	After living a mostly low-key career after he and wife Jerusha launched with the Sundance sensation Napoleon Dynamite in 2004, director Jared Hess has come roaring back with A Minecraft Movie, a true sleeper from Warner Bros and Legendary that is outpacing the early returns of other WB releases like Barbie and The Dark Knight. Hess ponders ringing that elusive zeitgeist bell twice, why a Minecraft sequel is so much more plausible than Napoleon Dynamite 2 and why the movie overperformed when so many game-based films fail.


DEADLINE: You must be feeling pretty good today after a memorable weekend…











			Watch on Deadline		







JARED HESS: After being in New Zealand for a juicy stretch, it's just great to be home back, in dad mode.


DEADLINE: How old are your kids?


HESS: I've got two in college, and then my youngest are 14 and 12.

DEADLINE: Who sparked your interest in Minecraft?


HESS: That was my introduction to the game, right when it came out. They were in elementary school and just would have a riot playing the game, and so I had to jump in and join the party.


DEADLINE: In different ways, you touched the zeitgeist with Napoleon Dynamite and now again with Minecraft opening bigger than Barbie and The Dark Knight. What's that feel like, when you hit that vein an the oil comes spraying out of the ground?

HESS: That you just can't plan for stuff like this. For me, it's always just trying to make something that you're passionate about, that's funny to you, that you're interested in and to try to have that integrity as you're making it. That's the best you can hope for. You never ever know what's going to happen with anything, and you just feel immense gratitude that it's connecting.


DEADLINE: One of the things I liked about the Fox lot was that statue of Napoleon Dynamite on the lawn outside of the Fox Searchlight offices. Whatever happened to that silly bronze statue?


HESS: It got moved to the Fox Searchlight offices that are on the Disney lot. And so it's like, I want to say it's in this atrium, this courtyard where nobody can see it. I wish that it was out in the open, but maybe that would be sacrilege to put it next to Mickey. I remember when it was on the Fox lot, and people would dress it up all the time. When the pandemic hit, people would send me pictures of Napoleon wearing a mask. He was one of the first ones to jump in and urge people to be responsible, as he was one of the first to wear the Covid mask.

DEADLINE: Too ostentatious for you to buy that statue and put it on your front lawn?


HESS: Now that's terrifying, as it is when you look at it up close. The gums and the teeth are pretty remarkable. He's holding the tetherball. People would pull the tetherball and have him hold weird stuff. It was pretty great.


DEADLINE: Back to Minecraft, and the question is why, though it reminds me of the William Goldman quote that nobody knows anything…


HESS: I stand by that quote as the most truthful thing ever uttered about showbiz.


DEADLINE: Can I ask you to put your finger on a few reasons this film resonated, from appealing to those who, like you, played it with your kids when it came out in 2009?


HESS: It's one of those things. There was an immense audience that was so passionate about the game and for whom Minecraft was such a key part of their childhood adolescence, just something that they loved. The game itself is so creative, but it's also ridiculous and really funny and absurd in so many ways. That was so much of the appeal to me in adapting it. It was like, how can you just do a ridiculously fun and funny adventure movie in this world — all of those goofy, dorky things we just really tried to celebrate and were super conscious of while making it? When you're working with Jack Black and Jason Momoa and Daniel Brooks and Jennifer Coolidge and the whole cast, it's like we just spent a ton of time coming up with what really was funny to us. I think one of the things that people are responding to is how dead serious the characters are taking this ridiculous world. Jack is playing everything with so much passion. And when we were shooting, it'd be like, “You know what, Jack, let's put a little more mustard on that.” And he just takes everything to an 11, all the time. That absurd seriousness about such a ridiculous world is part of the vitality of the comedy. I think that is what people are celebrating. Literally right before you called, my nephew lives in New York, he's in high school, and he went twice over the weekend with friends — he literally Facetimed me from his classroom, and he's like, “Uncle Jared, Hey, hey dude, I've got some friends here. They got a question.” And I said, in Jack's voice, “Water bucket release!” And dude, that whole classroom just exploded. Then I said, “chicken jockey,” and it went bananas again. Once the marketing over the last couple of months really started to kick into gear, and people just really zeroed in on funny quotes in the materials that resonated, it just took on the life of its own. But you can't ever anticipate that.

DEADLINE: Jack Black is an interesting dude. I went and visited Francis Coppola on a night shoot in Atlanta for Megalopolis. There's this scruffy guy sitting quietly on a beach chair and someone says, there's Jack Black. I ask if he's in the movie, and the answer was no, he just wanted to watch Francis shoot. Then I see him on SNL this past weekend, bouncing off the walls. What is it about that guy that maybe people don't understand, from showing up to watch a great like Coppola shoot to being so combustible onstage at 30 Rock?


HESS: Here's the thing: Jack is the most genuine artist ever. I would put him on my list of top five greatest athletes of all time. The dude is so shredded, has so much energy, a crazy amount. He is one of the hardest workers ever, but he's also the most gracious and compassionate. Every single person on the crew, he knew all of their names. And there's hundreds of people. His presence on set just elevates everybody; he cares so deeply about people and his passion for life and people is so sincere and real, it comes through in everything that he does. I don't know, man, he's one of a kind. There will never be anyone else like him.

	











DEADLINE: I was at a dinner party years ago in Sundance and Jason Momoa joined us, just after he played the monosyllabic Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones. This guy just took over the whole table with his charisma, stories about Hawaii and all these movies he was going to make. Talk about putting these two big personalities together.


HESS: Jason is larger than life. He's the biggest hunk of our time, but he's a big nerd. Nerdy about motorcycles and movies, and he's got the biggest heart. He's so stinkin' funny. One of the great things is both of those guys had secret crushes on each other from afar. They'd never worked together. We just thought it would be so funny if these guys were trying to one-up each other and outdo each other, the whole movie, and finally come together in this epic romance, and people are really having a fun time with it.

DEADLINE: Obviously, they bought into this preposterous premise and world that you created here.


HESS: Totally. Our approach to the characters and the type of comedy in this: We never wanted it to be cynical in any way, just a ridiculous celebration of this world, creativity and friendship. Those are things that are key things of the game, too. But there was also physics and rules of the gameplay we applied to the movie, so anything that we built in the film that you fans could go back and create in the game. That was a super-important element, but we also wanted to push it as well and create a new experience beyond just the gameplay. I think Minecraft was the first IP to hit over a trillion views or something on YouTube. Over the years, so many content creators making videos and stories about the world, and that's something unique about the game. There is no story. It's an open-world game, and everybody that plays it brings their own story to the characters, to the worlds that they build and explore. We knew it was going to be a challenge, that people really are passionate about this and it's something very personal to them. Our approach always is like, look, we can never fit everything about the game into a movie, so we just have to go with our gut about what we love about it. This is one adventure of many, because people have made live-action videos, animation, all kinds of things for over a decade. And we were just like, look, we're going to celebrate what we love. We're going to pick the creatures that we love and build an epic adventure comic around us.


DEADLINE: This hopefully ends what has been an unenviable turn in the barrel for Warner Bros and its head picture pickers Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy. It's also another big IP hit for Legendary, a company name that might be becoming an adjective for its creative leader Mary Parent.


HESS: I've known Mary and Cale Boyter for years, and we had a number of projects that we were trying to do together. They call me in December of 2019: “Hey do you have any interest in Minecraft? Do you know what it is?” I'm like, “Oh my gosh, yeah. We're total dorks over here for that game.” And I immediately said, “You could make the most absurd adventure comedy in this world.” I dove in and went through the pandemic and the strikes and everything, but Mary and Cale have supported my voice since I've known them. The team at Warner Bros too, the development process with them and [gamemaker] Mojang and Microsoft. They'd had a longer development road with other directors and writers before I came along, and there were lots of different takes and different ideas that had been on the table. The hardest thing of the whole process definitely was when the first teaser came out. It did not provide a lot of context, and there was so much unfinished visual effects shots that we were still right in the middle of working on and a number of things. We definitely had to spend a lot of time recovering from that experience. But we all stayed the course. You can't go down the rabbit hole of every comment on Reddit and trying to let comments direct the look of anything. The great thing is we've been testing it, so we knew what was working and that was all we were armed with. Once we started putting out things that really truly reflected what the tone of the film was in the marketing, everything changed. And then it was just like, here we go.

	











RELATED: 5 Video Game Movies And Where To Stream Them


DEADLINE: Why did you never make a sequel to Napoleon Dynamite?


HESS: I don't know. There were just other things that I wanted to do, and what doesn't feel natural as an artist, I don't think you should do it. If you're doing it for the wrong reason. There was something special about the circumstances that it was made in. These were characters that Jerusha and I absolutely love and adore. So further installments would have to be warranted by the characters.


DEADLINE: You could have Pedro, voted in as school president, implementing tariffs?


HESS: A good one, but no.


DEADLINE: They aren't going to let you off so easy with the Minecraft sequel, not when the first put up such big numbers. Take me through that process and your desire to be part of it?


HESS: Oh, man. Well, it would be so much fun. We had so much fun making this movie, and it's such an expansive world in the game, and there were so many things that we didn't tap into that we wanted to. I would have a blast doing the sequel, and it seems like there's already talk about it happening, so I'm super excited. It'll be so much fun to go back into the world. The fans are just having such a good time. We  teased it in the end credits, and the fans seem to be going wild for it.


DEADLINE: Who's the new character driving the next Minecraft?


HESS: The character we teased is Alex, the other massively critical character in Minecraft. It's Steve (Black) and Alex, and so that's the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt.

The White Lotus Season 3 finale scored 6.2 million viewers across linear and streaming, according to the network, the best same-day audience ever for the HBO series. In fact, the episode surpassed last week's previous record viewership by an impressive 30%.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Yellowjackets” Season 3 through to Episode 9.]

“Nobody said ‘You're gonna bite a chunk out of Hillary Swank's arm' when they pitched the show to me,” Melanie Lynskey told IndieWire in a recent conversation about “Yellowjackets.” In a season that has seen her character Shauna “finally able to take control of the moment,” that moment in Episode 8 marks a point of no return.

“[In episode 3], I sweep everything off the counter in this fit of rage, but for me the interesting moment was afterwards, the fact that in Shauna's energy and body, I felt very settled,” Lynskey said. “So it was fun to play all that stuff in Episode 9 … finally she's able to take control of the moment and to allow herself to feel the rage that's always present, and then she's kind of relaxed.”

Season 3, Episode 9 had the “Yellowjackets” team collaborating for a third time with director Ben Semanoff, who helmed episodes 202 and 205 and worked with Lynskey on the limited series “Candy.” Being an episodic director comes with a known territory of challenges (like the episode picking up right where Episode 8 left off, with Lynskey and Swank wrestling on the floor), but Semanoff was able to jump back in knowing how the show and its cast work best.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“One of my favorite ways to to direct, especially performance, isn't even really to say anything. It's to pull out a prop that maybe the performer hadn't really imagined or thought would be part of the scene, and say, ‘What do you think about this?' That prop was those rubber gloves,” Semanoff told IndieWire in a joint interview with Lynskey. “Melissa's house is a really stark environment … so we have this white environment and these blue-green gloves, and blood that she's squeezing out into the sink. It was so delicious to watch that.”

Van (Lauren Ambrose), Taissa (Tawny Cypress) and Misty (Christina Ricci) walk into this bizarre tableau after apprehending Melissa (Swank). “When I watched the episode, I was like, ‘Oh, this is kind of a wonderful metaphor for her journey throughout the show,'” Lynskey said. “She's just been trying to be normal housewife — ‘Don't look at me. Nobody notice me. I'm just gentle and sweet and not a threat to you' — but she's actually really vicious, and that is where she's most at home. It's where she feels most like herself.”

 










“That divide of the island allowed us to sort of really put Melanie on on a stage and say ‘What is Shauna right now?' I don't think she's unraveled. I think she's unleashed,” Semanoff added.

That journey has been building through the entire season, if not the entire series. Lynskey said that “rage bubbling to the surface” has been a recurring theme in her conversations with writers over the years, and now she's harnessing it in both past and present.  

“When it flashes back to the wilderness, that's her and all her primal power,” Lynskey said. “Every decision she makes is powered by this very righteous energy that's flowing through her body, and how good that feels to her to just go with that. She's she's dulled in the present day until she has these moments.”

One of Semanoff's tasks in a “massive” episode for the wilderness timeline was portraying that rage through Sophie Nélisse as teen Shauna, at the height of her power — the feeling that Lynskey's version is chasing, even if she doesn't know it.

“There's a parallel between her and Melissa, [who] was trapped in that same sort of bubble that she had driven herself into,” he noted. “Sending that tape and that note to Shauna is a way of starting trouble that might allow for her to come out of that, and embrace that same thing that we see Shauna embracing. She wanted to be back in the in this feral wilderness environment that I think they all blossomed in.”

 










As much as Shauna's descent is central to the episode, Lynskey said “How the Story Ends” was mainly saying goodbye to Ambrose as Van — which was bittersweet for Semanoff as well after introducing her in Season 2's “Two Truths and a Lie.”

“Lauren Ambrose is one of the greatest actors in the world, and I was finally getting to work with her, which I've wanted to do since I was a teenager, and here we are, and it's been taken away,” Lynskey said. “There was a lot of processing for all of us, not to mention the fact that she's a really incredible person.”

Not for the first time, “Yellowjackets” depicts Van's death by putting her in a plane with her younger self from the wilderness (Liv Hewson). More than anything, it's that setting which betrays the finality of the moment.

“It was really interesting to watch those two actors both deal with the performance and with the weight of this moment,” Semanoff said. “There's this idea that you're speaking to yourself. But I always imagined it as a sort of inner monologue. … Liv is so great, and they got it when I explained, ‘I know you want to be sad, but you're just a voice in adult Van's head.'”

Uncertainty permeates the wilderness timeline, where outsiders have entered the Yellowjackets' camp but also caught them engaging in ritualistic cannibalism (oops!). There's Shauna's perpetual power trip, Joel McHale's Kodi (“Somebody you just love to hate”) ruffling feathers and meeting a grisly end, Travis (Kevin Alves) trying to kill Lottie (Courtney Eaton), and an escape attempt that feels like subterfuge and ultimately leads to heartbreak for Natalie (Sophie Thatcher).

 










“She has escaped such hardship in her real life before they got stranded in the wilderness, and all she wants to do is get home,” Semanoff said. “All she wants to do is guide her and her willing friends to essentially salvation, and to see her sitting on that log realizing that all hope is lost, and the snow just starting to come down, it's just crushing.”

“Sophie's face just crumbling, and the way she cried like a little child was so beautiful,” Lynskey added.

It may be the end for Van (and Kodi), and a proverbial end to Natalie's quest for now, but Semanoff and Lynskey are hoping for more “Yellowjackets” and a chance to collaborate again before the series ends.

“Coming back and getting to work with Melanie again and the entire ‘Yellowjackets' team, both in front of and behind the camera, was so wonderful,” Semanoff said. “My love for camera and my love for performers and my love for everything filmmaking comes down to story, and people that love story.”

And once again, the story put Semanoff in multiple meetings about the logistics of eating human flesh. “I've never bit a chunk of anybody's skin off. What does it even look like? Is it chewy?,” he recalled. “Hillary had to chew it and then spit out. When you chew flesh like that that's not cooked, does it break into pieces? We had so many conversations about what the material was, how would break up in her mouth, how would come out, what the spit would look like, how we would do the spittle. And so often you're in these meetings and you're just going, ‘Is this what we do for a living?'”

 










On “Yellowjackets,” it's just another day at the office.

“Yellowjackets” is now streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME. The Season 3 finale will be available to stream on Friday, April 11.

Jon Gieselman will oversee "product and the Xfinity brand strategy across connectivity, wireless and entertainment as well as sales, marketing, acquisition, retention and base management."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Comcast has hired former DirecTV and Apple executive Jon Gieselman to take on the newly created role of chief growth officer for the residential domestic businesses of its Connectivity & Platforms unit that reaches more than 64 million homes and businesses in the U.S. He'll be responsible for driving growth across the company's broadband, wireless and video products, as well as marketing for the conglomerate's Xfinity brand.


	Starting on April 28, Gieselman, who will relocate from San Francisco to Philadelphia, will report to Steve Croney, recently named chief operating officer of Comcast's Connectivity & Platforms division.

	“Gieselman will lead the teams responsible for Comcast's domestic residential businesses, including product and the Xfinity brand strategy across connectivity, wireless and entertainment as well as sales, marketing, acquisition, retention and base management,” Comcast said. “He has a track record of consistently delivering revenue and profit growth and a unique background that blends analytical, digital and consumer marketing expertise with breakthrough creative and simple, unified customer experiences.“


	The executive previously “led marketing, sales and consumer engagement at major tech and media companies,” including Expedia Group, Apple and DirecTV, it noted.


	“Jon is a bold and transformational leader who will bring fresh thinking to our product and growth strategy,” said Croney. “He has decades of experience managing world-class brands in highly competitive markets and is the perfect complement to our team. Whether competing with us at DirecTV or creating entirely new categories for growth at Expedia Group and Apple, Jon has consistently developed brands and marketing strategies that build loyalty with customers and deliver results.”


	Said Gieselman: “In the industry, Comcast has the most advanced products and services keeping customers connected to their daily lives and more people should understand why they're so much better off having all of them. When you also think about the incredible global assets of Comcast NBCUniversal, there's no shortage of creative ways we can drive our connectivity businesses.”


	He added: “I loved competing in this category for over a decade, so all I can say to my friends and former colleagues is look out, we're coming.”

	











	Most recently, Gieselman served as president, Expedia Brands, leading all of Expedia's consumer-facing businesses around the globe “where he was instrumental in unifying the company's go-to-market strategy and successfully driving its digital transformation,” Comcast said. 


	Prior to that, as vp of marketing at Apple, he helped drive subscribers across Apple Music, Apple TV+, the App Store, Fitness+, News+, Arcade, and Apple Card. Previously, Gieselman also served as senior vp of marketing at DirecTV for 10 years and also held leadership roles in retail, television and fashion.

As Hollywood Week continues on season 23 of “American Idol,” country superstar Jelly Roll will appear in his first full episode as the show's new artist-in-residence on April 7, 2025. 

Though he served as a guest mentor in Hawaii during season 22, Jelly Roll told Billboard on April 4 that while diving into the mix with the 40 remaining contestants during Hollywood Week, he witnessed another level of emotions, lots of disarray and a “plot twist” viewers won't see coming.

Following the Showstoppers round that aired on April 6, judges Carrie Underwood, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan ended the episode by throwing the contestants a giant curveball. Of the 62 remaining competitors, only four singers advanced to the Top 24, 18 were sent home, and 40 were left to battle it out in a new round of competition: the “Head to Head” duets. 

Tasked with picking a partner and preparing a duet to perform 24 hours later, the singers scrambled overnight, with Jelly Roll available to give advice and feedback. 

“Hollywood Week is even more chaotic than what you see on TV,” he told Billboard. “The episodes are pretty chaotic, but the camera can't catch all of the chaos.” 

“I can't wait for the world to see this,” he continued. “The show brings me in when the kids are picking their head-to-head songs, so I am in the trenches with these babies. I watch them pick their songs. I give them advice and I catch them picking their partners. Some of them probably picked the wrong partner.” 

Jelly Roll said the new round was perfect preparation for contestants who are truly serious about making it as musicians, telling Billboard, “I love it because it reminds me of the music business. It's real. They're not hazing these kids. This is stuff that happens in our business all the time.” 

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

On April 7, supervising producer Patrick Lynn posted an Instagram video of the scene backstage, which he also called “chaotic,” as contestants tried to choose partners and songs late into the night. Jelly Roll told Billboard that during that time, he did his best to advise the remaining contestants as they prepared for the Head-to-Head round, but not everyone took his words to heart. 

The “Hard Fought Hallelujah” singer explained, “There was one group of singers who didn't know how to communicate with each other, and I said, ‘This is the biggest decision you're going to make because this is the last time the judges decide who goes forward. I'm going to give y'all my advice right now. Take it or leave it and I won't be offended, but I think at this point your best bet is to pick a song that you feel safe doing together, not where one has to carry the other.'” 

One duo, Jelly Roll said, “picked a song that the girl knew really well, and the guy didn't know, and they thought it was the best for them. I said, ‘At this point, if y'all aren't going to change the song, then there's going to be a point where you're going to have to carry this song,' and that's exactly how it shook out. She ended up having to carry the song and then, as happens in ‘American Idol,' there's a plot twist, but I can't give that away.” 

Despite all the drama, Jelly Roll told “Entertainment Tonight” in early March that he's having such a blast, he hopes his role continues into future seasons. 

“What I want to do is get a permanent artist-in-residency there,” he told ET. “Okay? That's my dream right now — is that it never could be anybody but me and ‘American Idol' signs a lifelong contract for Jelly Roll to be the mentor artist-in-residence.”

Plus, Drake's "Nokia" bounds to No. 3 on the Hot 100 after the premiere of its official video.

Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” tops the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart for a seventh total and consecutive week. The single, whose title shouts out late R&B crooner Luther Vandross, who is sampled on the track, became Lamar's sixth No. 1 and SZA's third. Lamar and SZA each extend their longest career Hot 100 reigns with the song.


	Meanwhile, “Luther” links the longest Hot 100 command for a rap hit in more than four years, since 24kGoldn's “Mood,” featuring iann dior, led for eight weeks in 2020-21. The only longer domination for a rap hit this decade: 11 weeks, for Roddy Ricch's “The Box” in 2020. (Rap titles are defined as those that have hit or are eligible for Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart.)


	Additionally, “Luther” ascends to the top of the Radio Songs chart, becoming Lamar's third No. 1 – and first in a lead role – and SZA's second on the all-format airplay ranking.


	Plus, Drake's “Nokia” bounds 7-3 on the Hot 100 following the March 31 premiere of its official video. He rings up his record-extending 42nd top five hit (and record-padding 31st top three hit).

	“Luther,” on pgLang/Interscope/ICLG, totaled 61 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 5% week-over-week), 24.4 million official streams (down 7%) and 2,000 sold (down 13%) in the U.S. March 28-April 3.


	The collaboration rises a spot to the top of the Radio Songs chart, marking Lamar's third No. 1, and first in a lead role, and SZA's second. Lamar previously led as featured on Taylor Swift's “Bad Blood” (for five weeks beginning in July 2015) and Maroon 5's “Don't Wanna Know” (for eight weeks starting in December 2016). SZA's “Snooze” spent three weeks at No. 1 in October 2023.


	“Luther” concurrently holds for a sixth week atop Streaming Songs and dips 15-21, after reaching No. 4, on Digital Song Sales. “Luther” is the first hit to top Radio Songs and Streaming Songs simultaneously this year; Shaboozey last accomplished the feat with “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” last October (when it tripled up, also leading Digital Song Sales).


	Meanwhile, “Luther” makes for a win among rap hits atop Radio Songs, becoming an increasingly rare track to have hit No. 1 on both Radio Songs and Hot Rap Songs. Thirty titles topped both charts in the 2000s; eight did so in the '10s; and six have so far in the ‘20s. The previous five this decade: Jack Harlow's “Lovin On Me” (2023-24); Doja Cat's “Paint the Town Red” (2023); Harlow's “First Class” (2022); Latto's “Big Energy” (2022); and 24kGoldn's “Mood” (2020-21).


	“Luther” concurrently adds a 15th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts.


	Drake flips “Nokia” from No. 7 to a new No. 3 high on the Hot 100. It drew 21.5 million streams, up 11%, March 28-April 3, with its official video having premiered March 31. It's also up 45% to 15.4 million in airplay audience and 54% to 6,000 sold.


	The track becomes Drake's record-extending 42nd top five Hot 100 hit. Here's a look at the acts with the most such entries over the chart's 66-year history. (Upon its No. 10 debut in March, “Nokia” became his record-boosting 80th top 10.)


Most Top Five Hot 100 Hits:


	“Nokia” is also Drake's record-extending 31st song to hit the Hot 100's top three. Here's a look at the acts with the most gold, silver and bronze medals combined.


Most Top Three Hot 100 Hits:


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2, following five nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” slips 3-4 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July. It adds a milestone 40th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart (where only one hit has led longer: Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line's “Meant To Be”: 50 weeks in 2017-18).


	Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” keeps at its No. 5 Hot 100 best.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 – and became the year's No. 1 song – repeats at No. 6. It notches an 85th week on the survey overall, the fourth-longest stay in the chart's history, below only Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” (91 weeks, in 2021-22); The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (90 weeks, 2019-22); and Imagine Dragons' “Radioactive” (87 weeks, 2012-14).


	ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” ascends 10-7 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 3.


	Morgan Wallen boasts two songs in the Hot 100's top 10, back-to-back: “Just in Case” drops to No. 8 a week after it debuted at No. 4 and “I'm the Problem” lifts 11-9, after it launched at its No. 2 best in February.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” rises 12-10, after reaching No. 2. It tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a 35th week each.

Clairo is just living life freely. In a new cover story interview with Seventeen, the Charm star opened up about why she'd rather not place a label on her identity as a queer person.


	“I don't care for labels at all. I believe people should like who they want and no one should have a problem with it,” she told the magazine. “I've had a better experience with my queerness once I just shut the fuck up and let it happen to me. If I date a girl, I date a girl. If I date a guy, I date a guy.”


	She added: “I also understand that people benefit from drawing a hard line for themselves — having a clear path is also important. It varies person to person. Being queer is a huge part of who I am. I felt so free once I understood that I love anybody and everybody. I'll kiss anyone.”


	In the interview, Clairo joked about taking the “Am I gay?” tests and that she wished she could tell her younger self she doesn't “need a definite answer” on who and what she likes. “I can still be curious, date, and kiss who I want,” she said. “I don't have to wake up and decide who I am by a certain day. That was the first time in my life that I had to be OK with not having an answer.”

	In a response to a question about how her relationship with queerness has shifted over the years after she came out as bisexual in a 2018 tweet, Clairo told Seventeen: “It's really beautiful. It feels good to be queer.”

	 Several years later, the musician told Rolling Stone that she felt that “people knew that about me” already.”


	“I am not trying to take up tons of space in the community, so I don't always want to talk about it. That doesn't mean that my experience isn't important, it just means that someone can explain it with more grace and understanding than I can,” she said in 2021. “It's odd that I didn't really explore that very much in this record.”

Paul Schrader is speaking out about recent allegations of assault and harassment by a former assistant made public last week. The auteur previously denied the bulk of the allegations on April 4, but did confirm that two allegedly consensual kisses occurred with his then-26-year-old assistant between December 2023 and May 2024. On the morning of April 7, Schrader sent an email unpacking the allegations to various members of the press and other industry professionals and personal friends, which IndieWire has obtained. (You can read the full email below.)

 










The assistant filed a motion April 3 in New York State Supreme Court under the moniker “Jane Doe,” alleging that Schrader was in breach of contract for violating the terms of the settlement over the past assault accusations.

“You may have read that my former assistant filed a lawsuit making some allegations about me. I am writing because you are important to me and I want you to hear from me directly about this subject,” Schrader wrote. “Out of the blue, in the fall of last year, a lawyer I had never heard of, representing my former assistant, sent me a letter demanding that I pay my former assistant millions of dollars or she would go public with sensational, false, and misleading accusations about our relationship and my conduct via a lawsuit. I understood that the mere assertion of such accusations would be damaging and hurtful.”

He continued, “As a result, I nearly committed to settling the claims by paying a small fraction of the amount that had been initially demanded to avoid the hurt and harm that the publicity surrounding a lawsuit with these kinds of false and misleading accusations would cause, to say nothing of the cost of litigation. Upon reflection, I changed my mind, which I believe I was legally entitled to do, and declined to sign the written settlement agreement the lawyers had prepared. I refused to bow to the coercion created by what I regard as unwarranted and opportunistic claims and resolved to defend myself.”

As stated in the legal claim, Doe and Schrader's respective lawyers reached a settlement in February 2025, with the payment to be issued in increments across seven months. However, Doe's lawyer Menaka Fernando alleged that Schrader's attorney told their team that Schrader had done some “soul searching” after being ill and opted to not go forward with the payment to Doe for the amount agreed upon. 

 










Schrader now details how he believes Doe's lawsuit was filed “for a quick money grab.” He noted that Doe did not sue for sexual harassment, but instead took legal action to “enforce against me the settlement agreement I declined to sign — even though the agreement says clearly that it would not be effective unless both Plaintiff and I signed it.”

Schrader deemed the details of Doe's motion to be “gratuitous” in its inclusion of “sensational, false, and misleading accusations” ranging from alleging that Schrader “trapped” Doe in his Cannes hotel room while there for the premiere of his film, “Oh, Canada,” as well as wearing an open bathrobe with his genitals exposed. Doe worked as Schrader's production assistant from May 2021 to September 2024, when she was allegedly terminated (Schrader contests the details of this, below). The motion claims Schrader “used his position of power over Ms. Doe (who is 52 years younger than him) to force her to work in a sexually hostile, intimidating, and humiliating environment on a daily, if not hourly, basis.” 

He also added that after drinking together at Cannes, he did kiss Doe but after she “indicated displeasure,” he “never attempted to kiss her again” and apologized.

“I am not a mind reader, but I believe that the accusations were included as a tactic — to bully me into writing a check. If that is their plan, it will not succeed,” Schrader wrote. “The lawsuit labors to create a false impression about my character and my interactions with her. It also rewrites history, in a desperate attempt to transform our relationship of more than three years, which consisted of Plaintiff's diligent work and very willing non-sexual companionship, into something unwelcome, coercive and odious to her. Nothing could be further from the truth.”

 










He continued, “To be absolutely clear: I never had sex in any form with Plaintiff. Nor did I ever attempt such a thing — period. I never exposed myself to Plaintiff — at any time. Our most physically ‘intimate' experiences together consisted of two kisses on the lips, which occurred months apart. We also often kissed one another on the cheek in gestures of greeting and farewell. … Her lawsuit tries to paint a very different picture — one that isn't true.”

In the email, Schrader shared that Doe was not terminated, but rather demoted due to both his own reduced professional needs and her personal family leave. Schrader noted that, after having completed his most recent film, he did not need for a full-time assistant. (Schrader previously posted on Facebook in early 2024 to announce he was looking to employ an assistant for one feature.) According to Schrader, Doe had since relocated to Arizona to care for her ailing grandfather. 

Rather than eliminating Doe's position, Schrader reduced her pay by approximately 50 percent “even though she was not doing much work for me,” in hopes that Doe would return to full-time work on his next feature. “I also emphasized to her that if she was ready to move on in her career, she should do so and would have my unqualified encouragement,” Schrader wrote. “Within a few months of this reduction in pay, I heard for the first time about the grievances detailed in the demand letter, which have been partially published in the lawsuit papers.”

 










In contrast, Doe's motion alleges Doe was fired for refusing Schrader's advances.

Schrader concluded, “I understand that in the current climate a defendant accused of sexual harassment is often presumed guilty in the court of public opinion without the fairness of due process — unless and until the defendant proves his or her innocence. But that presumption is not always true. It is not true in this case. I have nothing to hide about my conduct — and that includes my decision not to yield to the pressure of my former assistant's threat to make her sensational allegations public, a threat that she and her lawyers have now executed. If this case ever makes it to trial, I will be honest with the judge and jury who I am confident will see the truth.”

You may have read that my former assistant filed a lawsuit making some allegations about me. I am writing because you are important to me and I want you to hear from me directly about this subject.

I refused to bow to the coercion created by what I regard as unwarranted and opportunistic claims and resolved to defend myself.
 










Plaintiff has now filed suit, apparently hoping against hope for a quick money grab. She hasn't sued for sexual harassment; she has sued to enforce against me the settlement agreement I declined to sign — even though the agreement says clearly that it would not be effective unless both Plaintiff and I signed it.

Although her lawsuit is for breach of the settlement agreement draft, it gratuitously includes some of the sensational, false, and misleading accusations that were contained in her demand letter. I am not a mind reader, but I believe that the accusations were included as a tactic — to bully me into writing a check. If that is their plan, it will not succeed. The lawsuit labors to create a false impression about my character and my interactions with her. It also rewrites history, in a desperate attempt to transform our relationship of more than three years, which consisted of Plaintiff's diligent work and very willing non-sexual companionship, into something unwelcome, coercive and odious to her. Nothing could be further from the truth.

To be absolutely clear: I never had sex in any form with Plaintiff. Nor did I ever attempt such a thing — period. I never exposed myself to Plaintiff — at any time. Our most physically “intimate” experiences together consisted of two kisses on the lips, which occurred months apart. We also often kissed one another on the cheek in gestures of greeting and farewell.
 










The first kiss was in December 2023 in a New York bar after we had both been drinking. She continued working actively with me thereafter. She did not indicate to me that she had been troubled by the kiss, much less that she preferred to change or end our relationship. She even co-wrote a script with me after this kiss.

The second kiss took place in May 2024 at Cannes where she had accompanied me for the premiere of my most recent film. Once again, after we had been drinking together, I kissed her. This time she indicated displeasure. I never attempted to kiss her again and I also apologized. Even after Cannes, Plaintiff expressed emphatically her desire to continue to work, dine and travel with me. She also expressed her desire to work with me on my next film, which was scheduled for production last fall. Finally, she participated in an interview and voluntarily made personal social media posts in which she chose to praise me.

Plaintiff was my Production Assistant from June 2021 until September 2024. During our more than three years of work together, she eagerly accompanied me to numerous work and social events as my guest. These events included small, private dinners with prominent celebrities in the entertainment industry. We also dined together in restaurants, drank together in bars, visited museums, and attended concerts, plays and film festivals. She never expressed any reluctance to attend these events or to join me in these one-on-one activities. If she was unhappy to participate in these activities, she didn't show or mention it. On the contrary, she repeatedly expressed to me enthusiasm about her participation. Her lawsuit tries to paint a very different picture — one that isn't true.
 










It is more than a little revealing that, throughout her employment, Plaintiff chose on her own to make flattering social media remarks about me, emphasizing her belief in my talent and her delight in my mentorship. I think it is at least as revealing that a number of her social media posts have been deleted since she engaged counsel and asserted her claims. The deletions include her reference to me as “my man”.

In the summer of 2024, having completed my most recent film, I had no need for a full-time assistant. Plaintiff was living in Arizona then, caring for her ailing grandfather, who subsequently passed away. Rather than eliminating her position, I reduced her compensation by approximately 50% even though she was not doing much work for me. I hoped that she would return to full-time work in the not-too-distant future when my next contemplated film project would create a need for an assistant. I also emphasized to her that if she was ready to move on in her career, she should do so and would have my unqualified encouragement. Within a few months of this reduction in pay, I heard for the first time about the grievances detailed in the demand letter, which have been partially published in the lawsuit papers.

I understand that in the current climate a defendant accused of sexual harassment is often presumed guilty in the court of public opinion without the fairness of due process — unless and until the defendant proves his or her innocence. But that presumption is not always true. It is not true in this case. I have nothing to hide about my conduct — and that includes my decision not to yield to the pressure of my former assistant's threat to make her sensational allegations public, a threat that she and her lawyers have now executed. If this case ever makes it to trial, I will be honest with the judge and jury who I am confident will see the truth.

Wes Anderson's new movie, The Phoenician Scheme, arrives in theaters on May 30, and today, Focus Features has unveiled the first trailer. It presents the story of Zsa-zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro), a rich businessman and “maverick in the fields of armaments and aviation” who enlists his daughter (Mia Threapleton), a nun, in a treacherous “land and sea infrastructure scheme.” Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Richard Ayoade, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Rupert Friend, Hope Davis, Mathieu Amalric, and Benedict Cumberbatch portray the cast of characters trying to assist or thwart them.

Jenna Ortega didn't leave Scream VII over her busy “shooting schedule.” In a new interview with The Cut, Ortega revealed that she exited the movie because things went awry after her co-star Melissa Barera was fired from the film for publicly supporting Palestine.


	“It had nothing to do with pay or scheduling,” Ortega told the outlet. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart.”


	She continued, “If Scream VII wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”


News of Ortega's departure from the film in November 2023 came just one day after Spyglass Media Group, the production company behind the Scream films, fired Barrera for her social media posts, which they deemed antisemitic.

	At the time, Variety reported that Ortega's departure was “apparently not influenced” by Barrera's firing. Still, speculation grew that her exit was due to the production company's treatment of her co-star, since Ortega, too, has been vocal about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

	At the time, Scream VII director Christopher Landon deleted a statement on X that read, “Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.” He later stepped away from the movie, saying the film had become a “dream job that turned into a nightmare.” Kevin Williamson, the film's original screenwriter, took over directing duties and ended up welcoming Neve Campbell back to the franchise.


	“I'm very happy and proud to say I've been asked, in the most respectful way, to bring Sidney back to the screen and I couldn't be more thrilled!!!” Campbell wrote on Instagram at the time. “Well, actually I could.”

	In 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery was named as a co-defendant when an extra in the film Arthur sued Russell Brand for sexual assault. In the case, Jane Doe alleged that Brand “exposed his penis to me on the set and in full view of the cast and crew,” adding that the actor later “assaulted me as a member of the production crew guarded the door from the outside.” Brand denied the allegations at the time. When her identity was revealed to him under seal, he claimed to have no recollection of ever interacting with her. But a recent progression of the case finds Warner Bros. offering to submit hours of unseen footage from the set for evidence.


	According to The Times, Patrick Lamparello, an attorney who represents Warner Bros, said the company is in possession of “four or five hours, it could be more, around eight,” hours of outtake footage from Arthur. The film was released in 2011 and was shot in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Department is not currently investigating Brand. Last week, the actor was charged with rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault in connection to incidents involving four women in the U.K. between 1999 to 2005. The Jane Doe assault case was submitted in New York.

	











	In the lawsuit, the actress alleged that Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Discovery, Bender-Spink, and Langley Park Pictures —the co-defendants in the case — either had employees on set the day she was allegedly assaulted, or at least bear some responsibility for what she claims transpired. Warner Bros. also denied the allegations at the time.

	Brand's legal representatives have expressed concern about the overlap in these assault cases, stating there is “reasonable belief criminal prosecution is possible in the US based on allegations tantamount to criminal sexual misconduct occurring in the US, of which he has been falsely accused both by this civil plaintiff and several others through the media.” Last week, Judge Shlomo Hagler rejected a request from Brand's legal team to delay proceedings in the New York case. 


	“I've always told you guys that when I was young and single before I had my wife and family … I was a fool, man,” Brand said last week in response to the U.K. charges. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict, and an imbecile. But what I never was, was a rapist. I've never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.” He is expected to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 2.

Good news for fans devouring “The Chicken Sisters” as Hallmark Channel airs its first season, which premiered exclusively on Hallmark+ in the fall of 2024. On April 7, 2025, the network confirmed via Deadline that the star-studded series has been renewed for a second season. Not only that, but the show has a new home and a new Hallmark hunk on board. 

A post shared by David James Elliott (@djameselliott)

As previously reported, the series renewal is no surprise to the cast of “The Chicken Sisters” — led by Lea Thompson (Nancy), Wendie Malick (Gus), Schuyler Fisk (Amanda), and Genevieve Angelson (Mae). They have already reunited in Vancouver to film the new season. On April 4, Angelson posted a photo in her Instagram Stories while getting her hair and makeup done, writing, “and we're back!” 

But according to Deadline, they'll be joined by a new cast member for season 2 — actor David James Elliott, best known for the decade he spent, from 1995 to 2005, starring on “JAG” opposite another Hallmark star, Catherine Bell. Elliott, 64, will play a man from Gus' past who returns to the fictional town of Merinac, Kansas. 

He joins a handful of Hallmark hunks who are part of the cast, including “Ruby Herring Mysteries” alum James Kot, who plays Amanda's husband and new restaurant owner Frank Jr. The first season cast also included “Ride” alum Jake Foy and Ektor Rivera, who co-starred with Lacey Chabert in 2022's “Groundswell,” but their casting for season two hasn't been confirmed yet. 

Based on KJ Dell'Antonia's popular book of the same name, “The Chicken Sisters” follows the drama between two fried chicken restaurants in the same small town, Mimi's and Frannie's. 

The townspeople's loyalty is deeply divided over the restaurants, owned by separate families with complicated ties to each other. The drama is only exacerbated by the arrival of a production crew for the reality TV show “Kitchen Clash.” 

Months after the first season of “The Chicken Sisters” premiered on Hallmark+, where it's still available to stream, the series made its Hallmark Channel debut on March 30, airing on Sunday nights through May 18. According to Deadline, the second season will premiere on Hallmark Channel, with each new episode available to stream the day after it airs. 

In another interesting shift behind the scenes, series co-creator and season one showrunner Annie Mebane has been replaced by Erin Gibson, who was a writer on the first season. 

Samantha DiPippo, senior vice president of programming for Hallmark Media, told Deadline, “We're grateful to Annie Mebane for creating the series for television and expertly bringing to life the town of Merinac and its colorful characters in K.J. Dell'Antonia's beloved book. The show is in great hands with Erin Gibson taking the reins as showrunner this season and we know that our stellar cast … will serve up something special for viewers.”

After Hallmark Channel aired the first episode on March 30, Fisk shared some behind-the-scenes details in her Instagram Stories, including gushing about her castmates. The daughter of Hollywood legend Sissy Spacek, Fisk said it's “a dream to get to act alongside the incredible wendie malick” and called Angelson “the best tv sister” and “the bessssst friend.” 

Of her TV mom, Thompson, Fisk wrote, “i sat next to @lea_thompson at our first table read for the show after basically just meeting her. i was (still am) so in awe of her. she has a poise and strength and a vibe that you just want to be around.”

Robert De Niro will receive the Cannes Film Festival‘s honorary Palme d'Or at the opening night ceremony of the 78th edition, the festival has confirmed.


	As part of the honor, De Niro wil also give an onstage masterclass in the Debussy Theatre for festival-goers on May 14.


	De Niro has been a frequent presence at Cannes over the years. He was last on the Croisette in 2023 to debut Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. De Niro was president of the Cannes jury in 2011. 


	“I have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,” De Niro said in a statement provided by the festival. “Especially now, when there's so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together — storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It's like coming home.”

	De Niro is one of contemporary cinema's most beloved figures. His history at the Cannes Film Festival is stacked. In 1976, he starred in two competition films, Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, which won the Palme d'Or. 


	He opened the festival in 1982 with Scorsese's The King of Comedy, and the next year presented Once Upon a Time in America, Sergio Leone's last film, before returning to the Croisette with Roland Joffé's The Mission, which also won the Palme.


	De Niro was last seen onscreen in Netflix's political thriller Zero Day and Barry Levinson's Alto Knights. 


	This year's Cannes Film Festival runs May 13 to 24.

	“To all my international JLovers, I'll be doing a few select show dates over the summer,” the Nuyorican artist expressed in an Instagram post. “I can't wait to get back out there to see all of you.

	The five-date trek will kick off July 8 at Parque de Tafisa in Pontevedra and wraps July 16 at the Bilbao Exhibition Centre in Bilbao. The “Waiting for Tonight” singer will also make pit stops in Cádiz, Málaga and Barcelona that same month. Ticketing information for the shows will be announced soon, according to the press release.

	











	News of the summer tour comes on the heels of J. Lo announcing her upcoming film venture, Office Romance, in which she will join forces once again with Edward James Olmos — the actor who portrayed Selena's father, A.B. Quintanilla, in the 1997 Selena biopic, which starred the “On the Floor” singer as the late Queen of Tejano Music. “From ‘Selena' to now, this journey has come full circle,” the “Let's Get Loud” singer captioned the then and now photos of her and Olmos in a recent social media post.

Warner Bros.' kid-friendly movie blew past all expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, with final numbers coming in more than $12 million ahead of Sunday's already historic estimates.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The box office blues have been banished in historic fashion.


Warner Bros.' A Minecraft Movie, made with help from Legendary Pictures, struck gold with a record-shattering $163 million opening domestically and $150.7 million overseas for a global start of $313.2 million, according to final weekend numbers. Thanks to a huge Sunday, that's up more than $12 million from Sunday's domestic estimate of $157 million and $144 million overseas for a global haul of $301 million.




	The film came in tens of millions ahead of expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, besting the $146.4 million three-day launch of Universal Pictures' The Super Mario Bros. Movie over Easter weekend in 2023. (Opening on a Wednesday, Mario Bros. earned $204 million through Easter Sunday.)

A Minecraft Movie easily boasts the top start of 2025 to date, and is the biggest domestic launch since Deadpool & Wolverine in July 2024 ($211 million). Just as noteworthy, it came in ahead of Barbie ($162 million) to mark Warners' biggest domestic opening since 2016 when Batman vs Superman debuted to $166 million. Saturday's gross of $60 million is the biggest in the history of Warners, not adjusted for inflation. Legendary put up 25 percent of the $150 million production budget (that doesn't include marketing costs).


	The star-studded, high-wattage ensemble pic couldn't have come at a better time. The 2025 box office has seen its fortunes fall off dramatically in recent weeks. Minecraft is just the shot of confidence Hollywood studios and cinema owners needed after pics including Disney's Snow White bit the poisoned apple. 


	It's also a needed victory for embattled Warner Bros. movie studio chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, and for the studio overall. Ditto for Legendary, whose movie chief Mary Parent — known for her deft handling of big IP — is a credited producer and is given major props for suggesting that Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre) be hired to direct the pic.


	“We're absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world,” Abdy and De Luca said in statement thanking all involved, from Hess to the cast to Legendary and Vertigo, another producing partner. They also thanked their marketing and distribution teams. “A Minecraft Movie's decade long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP's Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.”

	











Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Jennifer Coolidge and Danielle Brooks star in the PG-rated film, as well as Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen. The movie, based on the Mojang Studios video game of the same name, centers around four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they must master their new reality's quirks while embarking on a quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, as Black steps into the shoes of the iconic character Steve.


	Warners global distribution chief Jeff Goldstein said the film worked everywhere, from small towns to the biggest cities. And, reached in London, Parent said the opening is a both a reflection of the mandate to celebrate the world of Minecraft in a joyful way, and the singular experience that only theatrical can offer. “This game is a global phenomenon,” she said.


	She's not spinning. Minecraft is the the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold. By some estimates, there are 125 million active daily players. (Microsoft bought Mojang in 2014).


	On Saturday morning, based on Friday's huge haul of $58 million, insiders at Warner Bros. projected a $135 million domestic start, up from an expected $60 million-pls. Some rival studios thought it had a shot at as much as $150 million, but massive walk-up business saw the final tally come in even higher.


	Not even so-so reviews or a B+ CinemaScore dinged A Minecraft Movie (moviegoers under 18 gave it a perfect A). 

	











	Exit polls from PostTrak did the best job at explaining the movie's out-of-this world start: Teens between ages 13 and 17 made up 35 percent of the audience, while the largest quad was between ages 18 and 24, according to those with access to the data. Those are the demos best known for repeat viewing. Families also turned out in force, while males — as expected — dominated at 65 percent to 67 percent of the audience. General audiences and parents/kids gave the movie four out of five stars on PostTrak, while kids delivered five out of five.


	Overseas, A Minecraft Movie is even showing promise in China, where it topped the weekend chart with $14.6 million, the best showing of any Hollywood title this year. Legendary East is handling the film in China.


	“This was lightning in a bottle,” said Goldstein.


	The next-closest film was A Working Man, which came in No. 2 with $7.3 million. Distributed by Amazon MGM Studios in the U.S., the pic has earned $27.8 million in its first 10 days of release. Fathom's screening of part two of The Chosen: Last Supper followed closely with $7.2 million.


Snow White, now in its third weekend, placed No. 4 with $6.1 million domestically for a tepid global total of $168.4 million.

In a stunning scientific development, the prehistoric canines made famous in the hit HBO show have been announced as the world's first de-extinct animal.


							By 

	Degen Pener


Deputy Editor


	Immortalized in Game of Thrones and on the crest of House Stark, the dire wolf is walking the Earth again and even howling after going extinct nearly 10,000 years ago.


	As announced today by genetic engineering company Colossal Biosciences, the long-extinct canine — or at least a very close approximation of it — has been successfully brought back to life. The process was accomplished via DNA extracted from two fossils as well as 20 edits of the genetic code of a gray wolf, the species' closest living relative, according to research carried out by Colossal, sometimes known as the De-Extinction Company.

	Colossal says it has whelped three dire wolves and — using CRISPR technology — decided to select fluffy white fur for their coats, based on its new analysis that the original species had snow-colored fur. (A previous study, published in Nature in 2021, found evidence that dire wolves were not closely related to gray wolves.)


	The Colossal company has named its two new male dire wolves — a pair of six-month old adolescents — Romulus and Remus, after the mythological twin founders of Rome, who were said to have been raised by a wolf. And in an homage to Game of Thrones' Daenerys Targaryen, it's christened a female puppy Khaleesi.


	The trio are now living in an enclosed preserve of more than 2,000 acres at an undisclosed location. They are expected to mature at 130 to 150 pounds — by contrast, a typical gray wolf clocks in at about 80 to 100 pounds.


	 “Our team took DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull and made healthy dire wolf puppies,” says Colossal CEO and co-founder Ben Lamm in a statement. “It was once said, ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' Today, our team gets to unveil some of the magic they are working on and its broader impact on conservation.”


	In a twist that could only have been dreamed up by Hollywood, filmmaker Peter Jackson and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin collaborated with Colossal Biosciences on today's reveal of what the company is trumpeting as the first-ever de-extinction of an animal.


	Jackson — who is an investor in the biotechnology company — loaned Colossal the official touring 330-pound Iron Throne prop that was used in promotions for the Game of Thrones series. Prior to today, it wasn't known that Jackson owned it, as it sold last year in a bidding war for $1.49 million to a then-undisclosed bidder. For a glam photo shoot, Colossal flew Romulus and Remus to Dallas, Texas, and snapped them lolling on the fictional seat of power.

	











	Colossal reached out to Martin after it started work on its dire wolf de-extinction project. Not only did he sign on as a Colossal Biosciences cultural adviser and investor, Martin also flew to meet Romulus and Remus at their private preserve (which Colossal says has been certified by the American Humane Society).


	Says Martin, in a statement, “Many people view dire wolves as mythical creatures that only exist in a fantasy world, but in reality, they have a rich history of contributing to the American ecosystem.” 


	While many fans of Game of Thrones likely think that dire wolves as fantasy beasts, they are in fact an actual animal that lived in the Americas and likely went extinct due to the disappearance of the large herbivores on which they preyed. At L.A.'s famed La Brea Tar Pits, fossil remains from more than 3,600 dire wolves have been discovered and the adjacent museum devotes an entire wall to displaying around 400 dire wolf skulls.


	In tandem with genetically engineering its three dire wolves, Colossal has cloned two litters of red wolves, the most critically endangered wolf in the world, as part of its overall goal of pairing conservation efforts with its de-extinction efforts. The company, founded in 2021, has previously announced that it plans to bring back the woolly mammoth, the Tasmanian tiger and the dodo bird from extinction and says that its work on the dire wolf is a proof of technology. “This massive milestone is the first of many coming examples demonstrating that our end-to-end de-extinction technology stack works,” says Lamm, who co-founded Colossal with Harvard geneticist Dr. George Church.

	











	Colossal — which claims that it has now set the record for the most-ever genetic edits in a living species — says it plans to restore the dire wolf as a viable species and secure ecological preserves for it on Indigenous land in North America.

The Aussie pop queen's Tension Tour rolled into New York City over the weekend. 


													By
												

	Joe Lynch


Executive Digital Director


	Even though her career kicked off with a Hi-NRG bang 37 years ago when her cover of “The Loco-Motion” hit No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, Kylie Minogue achieved a historic first over the weekend. On Friday (April 4), she headlined New York City's iconic Madison Square Garden venue for the first time. (She had performed at MSG as part of the Z100 Jingle Ball lineup in 2002 when “Can't Get You Out of My Head” returned her to the Hot 100's top 10, but this was her first time delivering a full concert as the top-billed act).


	During her Saturday (April 5) night show at MSG, the Australian pop legend was still pinching herself: “Tonight, I get to say the last time I did a full-scale show in New York City was last night. Because you sold out two nights at Madison Square Garden,” she said, beaming.


	“It's wild,” she told Billboard last October when asked about headlining the Garden for the first time. “It feels slightly like an out of body experience.”


	While Minogue is always energetic and upbeat on stage, she seemed particularly effervescent as she treated her rabid fanbase to a career-spanning selection of hits and deep cuts, everything from 2023's viral breakthrough “Padam Padam” to 2003's sensual “Slow” to 1994's trip-hop foray “Confide in Me” – and of course, a healthy selection of songs from her most recent albums, Tension and Tension II (it is the Tension Tour, after all).


	From surprise songs she sang as part of an audience request section to her final encore, here are seven fabulous moments from Kylie Minogue's MSG show on Saturday night.


	Minogue told Billboard that a vocal tube is one of her touring musts, and from start of the show, you could tell that she's been taking very good care of her pipes. Minogue has always been a stronger singer than some give her credit for, and during the evening's second song, “In Your Eyes,” she belted out a long note that made her vocal precision abundantly clear.  


	After years of mixed feelings about her breakout hit (“it's so uncool” she told Billboard), Minogue has learned to embrace “The Loco-Motion.” “Let's take it back to where it all began, a time and a place known as the '80s,” she said before launching into the Stock Aitken Waterman version of the song, camping it up by making train motions with her arms and toot-tooting her way through the dated but delightful hit.


	During the audience request section, Minogue sang bits of “Wow,” “Golden” and, fittingly, “New York City.” But the standout was “Story,” with Minogue and her backup singers sounding marvelous on the rushing, poignant pop song. “Thank you so much for requesting that,” she told the fan who had their setlist wish fulfilled.  


	“Who's my wild rose tonight?” Kylie asked before singing a snippet of her Nick Cave duet, “Where the Wild Roses Grow,” with one lucky audience member. “The rose chooses, not me,” she said, holding out a long-stemmed rose that decided upon a man named David. As she knelt down to serenade him, he greeted her with a huge smile and a cell phone in her face. “You don't have to film this,” she said, eliciting a round of laughter from the crowd. “Everyone else is recording.”


	Before performing a sparkling, four-song medley from her fantastic pandemic LP Disco, Minogue sat down next to her guitarist to sing a heartfelt “Say Something,” which had all the phone flashlights swaying throughout the arena. “This particular moment is a dream come true,” she said from a square-shaped platform in the middle of the crowd. “I wanted to sing this in a round.”


	“Padam Padam” was always going to be a highlight, but the dramatic staging made it feel like a capital-m Moment. As her dancers undulated on a red light-drenched stage, an extended intro built up the (yes) tension until Minogue emerged, rising up from a fog-filled hole in the floor. While folks were singing along throughout the night, it seemed like the entire arena joined in on every word of Padamdemonium.


	Her final song, “Love at First Sight,” felt like a much-deserved victory lap for the dance-pop queen. While her band jammed on an extended outro to the Fever single, Minogue danced with an infectious, joyful abandon. Before leaving, she seemed to take a mental photo of the crowd, pausing to soak up all the love and energy radiating throughout the famed venue.

The studio hopes that "Great American Stories" will become an anthology franchise, ripped from the pages of literary classics like John Steinbeck's novel.



		By Tony Maglio, Alex Weprin 

	April 7, 2025 7:01am	




	If you're one of those people who prefer a good book to the boob tube, AMC is about to make you feel conflicted.


	On Monday, AMC Networks announced it is developing a new TV franchise produced by AMC Studios and “built on iconic American stories.” Up first: John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.




	“Each season of the anthology series will be devoted to a different celebrated work, historical moment, or individual narrative celebrating and highlighting the American spirit,” the company said. The Great American Stories anthology will air on the AMC cable channel and stream on AMC's primary streaming service (out of a bunch), AMC+.

	If you want to Anne Rice-ify classic American literature, who better to adapt the novel than Rolin Jones, who did the same thing with Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire (and Friday Night Lights, and Boardwalk Empire)? Jones will take on Grapes and then “manage the franchise” from there, “working with acclaimed creative talent connected to individual seasons,” per AMC.


	“I actually look at it as big and epic as what we've seen with Walking Dead, the Anne Rice universe and Dark Winds,” says AMC chief commercial officer Kim Kelleher in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “Even if you haven't read the book since high school, there's a lot of expectation and build up around this. And I feel like the roster of talent he's put around it is going to do it justice.”


	Kelleher says that the company is planning to roll out a new edition of the anthology each year, based on different tales, though she declined to comment on any future literary inspirations.


	Jones, a playwright and television writer, will have some help in the form of Mark Johnson, who oversees the entire Anne Rice Immortal Universe. Johnson's got the résumé, his film and TV-producing credits include Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Natural, Rain Man, Diner, Donnie Brasco, The Notebook and a bunch more.


	“For more than a year we have been searching for the perfect story to launch our next big television franchise, and we found it in The Grapes of Wrath, which is as timely and relevant today as it was when first published in 1939,” Dan McDermott, the president of entertainment for AMC Studios and AMC Networks, said in a statement to press. “Our country is built upon so many unforgettable historic and dramatic moments, tales of bravery and courage, classic novels, short stories, and chronicles well known and never-before-told. As a network that began its life as American Movie Classics, this is the franchise we're destined to bring to the screen.”

	











	“We're thinking about Great American Stories like one of those resolute car factories in Michigan — bring in visionary creators, give them an assembly line of singular talent to build the thing, hand them the keys and get the hell out of the way,” Jones added. “This is Dan McDermott's big, bold, torpedo bat swing at AMC. He's hired me to roll a beauty off the factory floor every year. I hope to never have another job for the rest of my career.”


	A timely “torpedo bat” reference there out of Jones; clearly an MLB fan.


	“Never have I felt more professional pressure than in accepting this challenge to help translate some legendary American stories to the television screen,” Johnson said. “I am utterly grateful to AMC for this invitation and truly indebted to Rolin for his trust in me. What a terrifying opportunity!”

EXCLUSIVE: Even as he is deep in postproduction on his next film Death of Robin Hood at A24, Michael Sarnoski and the studio are already eyeballing their next project together. Sources tell Deadline that Sarnoski will write and direct the live-action adaptation of Hideo Kojima's genre-defying video game Death Stranding, with A24 and Kojima Productions producing. Lars Knudsen and Ari Aster's Square Peg will also join as producer.


	The film will delve into the game's mysteries surrounding the “Death Stranding” — a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.

Death Stranding captured the imaginations of millions of gamers, played by more 19 million worldwide. Originally launched in November 2019 for PlayStation 4, it boasts an all-star cast including Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, Guillermo del Toro and Margaret Qualley. Players assume the role of Sam Porter Bridges, a character tasked with reuniting a divided America, rebuilding hope, and re-establishing connections among the last remnants of humanity.

	The news follows on the heels of a number of Kojima Productions announcements at SXSW including a launch date for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (June 26), debuting a new trailer, confirming a worldwide concert tour based on the franchise, and a collaboration with luxury watchmaker Hamilton. The game sees the return of Reedus, Seydoux, Nicolas Winding Refn and Troy Baker, who will be joined by Luca Marinelli, George Miller and Elle Fanning.


	The project gives Sarnoski another high-profile IP to add to his resume after his critically acclaimed 2021 breakout pic Pig. The film starred Nicolas Cage and put Sarnoski on the map as a rising star in the director ranks. The project landed him the high-profile A Quiet Place spinoff, A Quiet Place: Day One, which bowed this past summer grossing more then $250 million worldwide.


	Sarnoski most recently directed Death of Robin Hood at A24 starring Hugh Jackman and Jodie Comer. He is represented by WME, Range Media Partners and Derek Kroeger.

	If anyone knows her way around protests, it's Daryl Hannah. The actress and director has been arrested a half-dozen times protesting for environmental causes. But even she can have a hard time getting her head around the almost daily chaos of the second Trump administration.


	“There are too many horrible things to even talk about,” she says from California, where she's been helping her family deal with the loss of their home from the L.A. fires. “A lot of my focus has to do with the environment and the potential destruction, considering what we've been facing already with these fires, floods, hurricanes, and global devastation. To not take that seriously and start going in the other direction is just so fucking stupid. Sorry for my French, but it's just so short-sighted on behalf of all living things.” And don't get her started on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who once joined Hannah in protesting the Keystone XL oil pipeline (both were arrested). “So disappointing,” she says, “because he was such a good, powerful environmental advocate for so long. The fact that he would be part of this administration is shocking to a lot of people.”

	











	How does she make sense of it all? “We've taken to not watching the televised news so much because it can be way too overwhelming,” she says. “We just choose our reliable outlets, because it definitely is better for our mental health.”


	By “we,” Hannah means herself and her husband, Neil Young. More than just Young's partner, Hannah has also taken an active in role in his work, working on his stage backdrops and album covers and documenting his music. In the roughly decade since they became a couple, Hannah has made a movie about the making of his Barn album with Crazy Horse, has filmed all his tours for his archives (including every show on last year's tour with the Horse), and even made what she calls an “improved imaginary goofball home movie” (2018's surreal Western Paradox, starring Young, Promise of the Real, and Willie Nelson).

	Her new film, playing in theaters April 17 with a possible wider distribution after, offers another perspective on Young and his life. Filmed on the bus, backstage, and onstage during his 2023 run of solo shows on the West Coast, Coastal provides a pretty intimidate look at Young on the road during his first tour in four years. Filming the bus scenes on her iPhone, Hannah captured him just before and after shows interacting with his son Ben (who was born with severe cerebral palsy) and his small crew. “It's not even a new iPhone,” she says. “It's not the latest model. But I didn't want to have a big camera or anything, because I didn't want to make Neil feel self-conscious at all. I wanted to him forget about it.”

	











	Hannah says she'll be filming this year's run of Young shows with the Chrome Hearts, but has no plans to turn that into a doc at the moment. Instead, she's shopping around her first feature script, what she calls “a homage to Sunset Boulevard, but kind of more a dark comedy instead of a film noir”; she also hopes to direct herself. “Because this [Trump 2.0] is so overwhelming, it's actually quite important to focus on the things we love, because that's what keeps you refueled,” Hannah says. “It's important not to just get lost in the depression and the fear and all that. It's really important to stay focused on the things that bring you joy.”


You've been filming most of Neil's recent tours. What made you want to turn this particular footage from 2023 into a doc?Well, usually I film the tours so Neil has archival footage. I don't necessarily make them into documentaries. I usually film everything, tours and recording sessions. That's how the Barn documentary happened as well, because I was filming it. A lot of that was shot on my iPad, but they were like, “You can't be seen!” Crazy Horse is very, very private when they're making music. They don't want to be self-conscious at all.

How did you get around that?Hide? [Laughs.] Neil says that sometimes I just become a camera lump. I fold into my sweatshirt and just turn into a little lump with my iPad.


	This [2023 run] was a solo tour. I've been thinking for a long time that I would like to show certain aspects of what it's like for him. Even friends of mine will be like, “Oh, can I come to the party after the show?” I'm like, “Party? We get on the bus and start heading to the next town.” If people think it's a rager, I wanted to share how sort of human it really is, at least for us. I wanted to show that it's very solitary and kind of almost, you know, normal existence in some ways.


	I especially was kind of stunned myself by the fact that after a show, he almost can't talk. He's drained. He has to just sit there and stare out the window for a while, and re-enter his body. I think, in the end, I kind of somehow miraculously got what I was hoping to get, which was sort of a mix of  almost the loneliness of being on a solo tour,  where you have a little moment of pensive, maybe even melancholy after the show, or just sort of a drained feeling. I kind of wanted to dissuade people of their notion of what rock & roll tour is.

	











The closest we get to backstage guests are shots of Joni Mitchell and Lukas Nelson at one show.That was the first show in L.A. Joni and my mom and Lukas came. That was the only time we had people backstage. My mom and Joni are both in their eighties. It was so funny, because when my mom was saying, “I was singing at the end,” Joni was like, “I was singing louder! I was the loudest!”


What was it like to go back on tour with him after four years?He was really nervous, actually. He talks about it in the film. He said, “I don't know if I can do this — we'll see.“ But he's been obviously making music for so many decades that it's kind of in his DNA at that point. So even though he was nervous, it was very second nature once he got onstage and started to play. It's hard for him to not be playing music in some way, shape, or form. I don't think there was ever a concern that he was never going to tour again. I don't think it's possible. He's so engaged with music, I just don't think there's some point where he's going to say, “That's it for me.”


Many of his peers are doing farewell tours now.  He's not that person. The venues may change. I don't know how things are going to evolve, but he's never going to not play music. I can't ever foresee a moment where he'd do something like that.


When you said you “miraculously” got what you needed for this film, what did you mean?We placed the cameras [at the concerts] in front of the instruments we thought he might play and some nights he would never use them. [Laughs.] Neil never has a set list. He just plays what he feels in the moment. Well, there's no way to accommodate that, so some nights we'd set the cameras for one of the three pianos on stage, or for a certain guitar and the organ maybe. And he wouldn't play any of them! So there were great versions of certain songs I would have liked to have used, but we didn't even capture them because he didn't even go to those instruments the whole night. We would have literally nothing for an entire night sometimes, you know, because of him choosing to do different songs.


Were you allowed to get mad at him over that?Well, that's his forte, you know. That's just who he is. I'm not going to start saying, “You have to play …!” [Laughs.] That would be horrible, right? He only listens to his muse. That's kind of what he's known for in some ways, because it has to be authentic for him, or he won't do it. So I'm not going to mess with that.

	











	I was absolutely determined to have “I'm the Ocean” at the beginning and “When I Hold You in My Arms” at the end. Those are really the heart of it to me. “I'm the Ocean,” even though it was written a long time ago, for that record with Pearl Jam, resonates with all of the shit we're facing today and all of these crises. And even in the ways we have to stay positive and remember that we don't need to focus on all the negativity all the time too.   


	With “When I Hold You in My Arms,” once again, it's one of those songs that resonates with what's going on in the world today: “New buildings going up/Old buildings coming down.” And how important it is to lean on someone you love or someone you care about to have that refuge. The fact that he plays both the electric guitar and the piano in that song, I've never seen him do that. And I've been around for a while. [Laughs.]


Given you're both the filmmaker and the spouse here, what are the challenges of making a movie like this in terms of what you do and don't include?  You even slipped in a few scenes of Neil addressing you behind your iPhone and saying he'd missed you.That was a little bit hard, because I really wanted to make a cinema verité film; that's my favorite style of documentary. And when I was in the editing room, I really was fighting those kind of moments because I didn't want to have myself or the camera acknowledged in order for it to be true cinema verité. You're supposed to be a fly on the wall.  


	But all of those moments, when he's looking in the camera, even when he's talking to Ben, I find them really moving. So, even though I fought it and fought it for months during editing, I finally decided to put them in because there was an aspect that you would never catch otherwise. When Neil looks in the camera, there's such a beautiful openness and vulnerability and charm. You really see so much more into his soul.


At one point, we see Neil talking to Jerry, his bus driver, about how the fans want to hear the hits because those are often the only songs they know. That's an unusual comment to hear in a movie like this.But it's pretty true. People go to a show and want to hear the song they're familiar with, their favorite song played at their wedding or whatever. So I think that's kind of true for everybody, but Neil specifically decided on this tour that he was going to do songs he'd never really played before, “hidden by hits,” as he calls it. It was like people were hearing them for the first time, and in many cases, they really listened. I mean, you could hear a pin drop in all of those theaters.

	











Does Neil have any sort of approval over the finished film?He doesn't get any approval. Another thing that is specific to him is that if he sees something, he gets attached to it. So if I showed him the film in an earlier form and then changed something, he'd be like, “What happened to that part?” So I didn't show it to him until I was really done with it, because I don't want him to lock in on something, and then I've changed it.


	But he really liked it. I was a little bit nervous because I don't think we've ever filmed him with Ben before. I said to Neil, “Are you going to be comfortable with that?” But he absolutely loved it. 


	Sometimes I film a lot of things for him, like messages to people for when someone's getting celebrated for something and they want him to film a video message. I did one for Paul McCartney, since he was receiving some kind of award, or maybe it was his birthday. We did one take, but the birds in our backyard were really loud. And I was like, “Could you do it again?” And Neil's like, “Nope!” He does not do a take two.


The film is black and white, but at the very end, as we see the next highway in front of the bus, it turns to color.My favorite movie in the world is The Wizard of Oz.  I have to do something from that in every one of my movies, something a little magical.


In the end, what do you think you captured about him that's not in other documentaries, even the ones he's made?People generally think of him as a sort of kind of inscrutable guy. It's funny how many people are intimidated by him; they go, “Scary!” Before I knew him, I was like, “Oh, God, he's so scary.” So I wanted to dissuade people of that notion. And those moments of intimacy really show something that I don't think I've ever seen before in any documentaries.


At the Oscars last month, you presented the editing award and gave a shout-out to Ukraine: “Slava Ukraine!” Was that spontaneous?I'd been planning it, but I didn't want to tell anyone. I didn't know until I got there that night that they had a 10-second delay so they could bleep people. So I was trying to sneak it in there so they wouldn't bleep me. I didn't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Neil. I didn't want anyone to try to talk me out of it. I was just trying to disguise my intentions until the last second. I'm not sure why they didn't bleep me, but I'm glad they didn't. I think possibly it was because people cheered, and then people [watching] would have thought, “Why are they cheering?”

	











Afterwards, many people wondered why more presenters that night didn't say similar things.I 100 percent agree. It was weird, especially because it was just a few days after that horrific meeting in the Oval Office. You'd think more people would have wanted to send a little bit of love to the Ukrainians. I went to Ukraine many years ago for a film festival, in 2014, and I cried when I left, because I fell in love with those people. They have a great sense of humor. They're full of heart and soul. Even then, people in Ukraine were struggling economically and there were still bullet holes in some of the buildings. It was not a super-groovy, wealthy country. But people were happy and full of love. I really have a beautiful, deep connection with the people of that country. And I'm just horrified at the decisions that are being made now on behalf of us.


Neil announced a free show in Ukraine but then canceled.Yeah, everybody wanted to go, the whole band. But [authorities] just said they could not possibly allow it to happen because of the danger, to the audience as well as to us and the band members. When many people gather in one place it just becomes the obvious target. We were both really disappointed. But we will definitely try to go at some point.


When you were at the Oscars and once more in such a Hollywood scene, did you flash back to your life in the Eighties and Nineties, when you starred in so many hit films?    No! [Laughs.] Well, kind of. You have to go to a rehearsal, where they show you where to stand and whatever. I brought my sister and told her I was going to change the script. Not the part about Ukraine, but I rewrote the whole part about editors too, because they had me saying something I didn't feel reflected editing. I really have a lot of respect for editors and for the process and how important and challenging that work is, and how it really is where the film is created.


	But I was really, really nervous. My sister was with me in the Eighties and Nineties, when I would do those [shows]. And when I would even suggest changing an “and” or an “if,” they would give me hell! I'd be called into the producer's office and they would berate me. It was intimidating. Sometimes even the other actors I was co-presenting with would join in on the berating and say, “Well, I'm absolutely fine with all of that. You don't have to change a thing for me!” Thanks a lot for the support, mother …!


	But this time it  was really interesting, because, first of all, I noticed the backstage was full of women. I've never seen that before. There was not even one woman that I remember ever [in the past shows]. Also, all the writers were women. So when I told them I wanted to change one line, they were like, “Fine.” When I told them I wanted to change the whole thing, they were like, “Great.” I was shocked. To a certain degree, a lot of that patriarchal, misogynistic style of producing that show seems to be gone. I didn't expect it at all, because I obviously have a lot of bad flashbacks from things I experienced in my career. I love, love making movies and I love the work, but the other parts of it can be really a nightmare. A lot of the personalities you have to deal with, and certainly the sort of old-school, misogynistic structure of the industry, especially when you're a young girl, you're drowned in it.

	











Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you'd decided to play the game and keep taking roles in films like Steel Magnolias and such?I don't even think that's a possibility. In a certain way, I'm very similar to Neil. I am who I am. I'm not going to be able to fake it. That was part of the problem for me, too, when I had to do a lot of press and stuff. If I had a bad experience on a movie, I couldn't do the press. I can't really say, “Oh, it was so great!” It's not possible for me. I'm not that good at lying. I'm not good at self-promotion either. I love the idea of disappearing into a character. But I want it to be about the character, not about me and my daily life. That was the reason I wanted to do movies in the first place, to disappear into these fantasy worlds.


Speaking of which, did the makers of Splash Too offer you a part in that sequel?They did. And I don't think any of us really liked the script, but I particularly didn't. A lot of times, they'll try creating sequels just to try to squeeze a little more juice from the stone, see if they can get some more money out of it. And it's not organic to the story. 


You went public about your terrifying experiences with Harvey Weinstein in The New Yorker in 2017, talking about how he was pounding on your hotel room door and later asked to touch your breasts.That was the tip of the iceberg. I experienced stuff like that in almost every movie. It was gnarly to be a young woman in those times. I never had an agent or a publicist or anything like that. So I was really kind of not protected.


You've worked since Kill Bill, on TV and indie movies, but that seems to be the last major film we saw you in.It totally was. It was my last real movie. I mean, I'm fine with it. But I never really got any offers after that either. I was offered one other movie that was not a very good part, but that was [makes a sound like a car stopping]. I think some of it definitely had to do with Harvey, because he was like, “Oh, she's difficult,” or whatever he said.

	It was pretty gnarly blowback. We were going to the Cannes Film Festival, and I had agreed to host some charity events. This was right after he tried to come into my hotel in in Rome. He took off on the plane with all the other actors and left me there. I not only had to find my own way, my own flights back and forth, but I still had to go to Cannes — and they'd canceled my hotel room and there was nothing available. He canceled everything, the hair and makeup, everything. So I had nothing. I arrived in order to do all these things, and I was dragging my suitcase on the cobblestones, trying to go from person to person's room, sleeping on people's couches each night. It was really a screwed-up situation. It was a bad time.

	











	So it was probably a combination of that and the fact that I turned 40: an “oh, my God, how dare I turn 40!” thing. Who knows, but it's just the way it is. I've never been comfortable with being a known personality. I put my creative energies elsewhere, and I've been directing for years now, and I love it. At least I'm still making films, but it doesn't have to be about me.

	The three-decade history of Blink-182 is marked by epic highs and miserable lows. At the peak of their popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, they were selling out arenas all over the globe and scoring hits like “What's My Age Again” and “All the Small Things.” But there were also two extremely ugly band splits that played out before the public, near-death experiences due to a plane crash and a cancer battle, partial reunions, and long periods where it looked like the band would never return. The only constant member from their formation in the San Diego suburbs to the present day is singer and bassist Mark Hoppus. Here are 10 of the juiciest revelations from his new memoir, Fahrenheit-182.


	Raynor was in the band from the very beginning, and plays on their first two records, including breakout single “Dammit.” But, in 1998, Raynor was told he had to either quit drinking or quit the band. Unhappy with the ultimatum, he chose the latter. They moved on with new drummer Travis Barker, and didn't hear from Raynor for another year when he suddenly called. “He ran through a laundry list of grievances, both real and imagined, cursed me and Tom [DeLonge], called us hypocrites,” Hoppus writes. “I said I was sorry, this was just the way things were. We sat in long silence. Then we hung up. That was the last time I talked to Scott.”

	The three members of Blink were given a chance to shoot cameos in 1999's original American Pie as a high school band (with a monkey) who watched Jason Biggs' fumbling attempt at sex with Shannon Elizabeth on a webcam. They were instructed to merely look shocked at what they saw on a computer screen while a professional actor said, “That guy's in my trig class.” Hoppus blurted out “Go, trig boy. It's your birthday.” The improvised line made the final cut. When the movie became a massive hit, strangers started to yell “Go, trig boy” at him in public. “It was a quick, throwaway gag,” Hoppus writes. “I have no idea why it caught on as a popular quote. Maybe it's because the entire movie is quotable. Keep in mind, this is the movie that immortalized the phrase, ‘This one time, at band camp…'”

	“[That's] always the most fun,” he writes. “Everyone's on top of the world. Nothing can touch them. Doors open wherever they go. People kiss their rings and do any favor they ask. No one ever stops to worry what might be waiting for them around the corner in the third act. Life is too good to worry about how they might end up stuffed into a car's trunk or hanging in a meat locker.”


	At the peak of Blink's success, a woman began parking her car outside their homes. Using binoculars and a telephoto lens, she kept a journal that listed their license plates, when they typically arrived home each day, and the times they turned off their lights at night. She wasn't technically breaking any laws, but it made all of them deeply uncomfortable, and Hoppus eventually moved to a house behind a gate to get away from her. Months later, she showed up at a San Diego record store where they were signing copies of their new album. Mark and Tom quickly signed her album and avoided eye contact. Travis did not. “I'm not signing that shit,” he said. “You hang around our houses? You stalk us? You follow our wives? Get the fuck out of here, I'm not signing shit.”


	When the new band released their first LP in 2001, Hoppus shrugged it off in public. Things were very different behind the scenes. “What the fuck is going on? I asked myself,” Hoppus writes. “It was a big conspiracy against me. I questioned everything about myself: Am I bad musician? Do people think I'm a dick? What is it about my personality that's making everyone so fucking eager to do something else without me?”

	The tour came at a time when Blink-182 were ascendant and Green Day were at a low point right before American Idiot. “I got the sense that Green Day fucking hated that they'd been reduced to opening for us,” Hoppus writes. “It must have been a difficult pill to swallow. There was a lot of tension on that tour. Some nights we drank together like old war buddies. Other nights we got into screaming matches with their manager in the hallways.” They haven't toured together again despite some overtures from Blink's camp. “We keep asking for a rematch and they keep refusing,” Hoppus writes. “They're the rival gangs across town who both despise and respect each other.”

	











	DeLonge's decision to sever any direct communication made the situation even more painful.  “Everything had to go through lawyers and management,” Hoppus writes. “My best friend of more than a decade, and I had to have my people call his people. I was paying a lawyer top dollar to communicate with the kid I used to break into abandoned buildings with to skateboard…I didn't just lose my best friend. When Blink fell apart, I lost everything.”


	After DeLonge left the group, Hoppus and Barker attempted to carry on making music together under the name +44. “People knew the name Blink-182,” Hoppus writes, “but the who the hell was +44? It felt like I was giving the world a math problem.” At this same time, Hoppus feels that DeLonge's group, Angels and Airwaves, was not living up to their hype. “Tom had over-performed and under-delivered,” he writes, “which might've made people skeptical towards another post-Blink project. We had to work twice as hard for everything. All the supports and safety nets we had in place were suddenly gone. Radio stations used to roll out the red carpet for a new Blink album, but now we had to play the game and kiss ass for airplay crumbs.”

	The band got back together shortly after Travis Barker's plane crash in 2008. They cut a new LP and toured the globe, but old tensions remained. “Tom arrived as late as he could, walked directly to his dressing room, and closed the door,” Hoppus writes. “Showtime came and we did what we do. The second the show ended, he was in his car back to the hotel, never to be seen.” They had plans to tour in 2015 until DeLonge decided he didn't want to do it. “It was ridiculous,” Hoppus writes. “Tom was out of control. Pretty soon we were speaking to each other solely through management. All fighters retreated to their corners to sulk as the saddest millionaires punk rock ever suffered. Did we really get the band back together only to end up running it into the ground, reverting to petty arguments about schedules? Again?”


	Tom became my best friend again,” Hoppus writes. “Some days I just wanted to waste away on a couch feeling sorry for myself. But Tom wouldn't let me. Every day he sent me a new joke. Or an old photo of us rocking out. Or just a dick pic .The past was never mentioned. All that mattered was right now.”

From the nostalgic and scene-setting intro of “Toronto's Window” to the groovy “1999,” the 13-track debut album gives fans a look inside the head (and heart) of one of K-pop's brightest stars. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	“I never thought I could dream in detail,” NCT's Mark Lee begins his newly released song, “Toronto's Window,” expertly kicking off his debut solo album, The Firstfruit.


	The 25-year-old K-pop star, known simply by his stage name Mark, debuted nine years ago as a member of SM Entertainment's mega-group NCT and is still learning new things about himself creatively. “I really got to find myself while creating this album,” Mark tells The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom from Seoul, South Korea. “Now that it's done, it even put me on the idea of my second chapter.”

	As one of the busiest working performers in the world of K-pop — Mark is a member of NCT subgroups 127 and Dream and has worked in supergroup SuperM, along with other NCT formations — the Canada-born singer and rapper has never shied away from a challenge. On The Firstfruit, Mark gets vulnerable and open like he never has before. “Toronto's Window” serves as an almost origin story to listeners before jumping into the album's title track, “1999.”

	In its totality, the 13-track album is a clear window into the mind of one of the genre's brightest (and arguably most earnest) stars. Below, Mark digs into The Firstfruit with THR, explaining the process of making the album, what his father said to him after listening for the first time, how much this album has aged him and why it had to start in Toronto. 


What was the process of making The Firstfruit like? Do you have a favorite or most challenging part of the process?


	It took almost a year to create everything, but I think the most important part of the process — every part was important but — after “200” came out there was a turning point for me to realize that “I need to change everything that I've been working on.” That was the start of The Firstfruit. I had an idea of another album, but it wasn't The Firstfruit but after “200” came out, things weren't adding up. There was a specific turning point that I realized I had to start everything from scratch again. That was the hardest and the most challenging part, but it was the most important part of the process.


You previously said you put a lot of yourself in this album. Do you feel it has changed you now that you're on the other side of it?












	Absolutely. I have been trying to put my finger on what this feeling actually was, and then I realized. I think this album helped me find myself, and I hope that it can help my listeners to find themselves if they haven't yet. I think that's the point of this album for me.


On the album, “1999” is really such a cool track. It's a very different direction than I would've thought you were going with this, which is exciting. Why did you feel this was the sound to kick off this new version of you?


	The first time I heard it, I wasn't like, “This is the one.” We had other options. Among all the other options, this was the one that captivated me the most because I was working on it with [the producer] Dress. He came with the beat and with the hook. Before that, though, I've always been proud of my falsetto. I've always been confident about my falsetto. I just left it as that. One day he just came with the song and the hook itself is all falsetto. Then we looked at the other options and I just felt like, “No, I think it has to be this one.” After we put the “1999” theme into the song, it really brought everything to life and it was the one. I'm really proud how it really knocks people off on the first [listen]. I think all my group members said the same thing as well. Everyone was like, “I did not expect something like ‘1999.'” I think it's a good thing.


Between solo work and the many groups you've been in, you have a big music catalog. Do you find yourself wanting to surprise people because you've done quite a bit already?












	Just because I wanted to. I did want to as well, but just me as an artist, I realized that there were so many different types of genres that I could have pulled off to be my title track. It was actually harder for me to choose which genre. I realized that's just what I have in me. I guess just meeting the right meaning and meeting the right objective of the song, it makes it easier for me to choose the genre.


Do you feel that this album or even the work you've put in over the last few years has changed the way you view performing and making music? Or do you find it's evolving as you get older yourself?


	I think it's both. I grow as this album made me grow at least five years, I feel like. I get to know what type of an artist and performer I imagine myself being on stage. That's why for “1999,” too, we usually use headsets, but I imagine myself using a handheld mic. When it comes to actually singing live and all these different performing elements, it's a mixture of strategy and also just my growth.


Do you have a favorite track on the album yourself?


	I love all of them. Did you hear “Mom's Interlude?” I think that's my current favorite because I can't believe I actually put that on the album. I can't believe it made it on the album. It's so vulnerable and it's not even a song, it's just me talking with my mom, but I just love it so much.


Between that and “Toronto's Window,” which I saw that you posted a video today of it that was very cinematic and cool. That's not something you typically get to do on an album. Is it exciting to get to do that in this space?












	Every aspect of this album feels like it's something that I've never done. “Toronto's Window,” too. I got that beat from [producer] Code Kunst and to put that on the first track of the album…. I feel like it's easier putting it this way. [On] all of the albums I've released before, I don't think I've ever seen an intro track like this one before. I think that's the feedback that my group members told me as well. It really just sets the mood for the album in the most perfect way. So this album, it's like an autobiography, so it has to start with Toronto because that's where it all began.


Did you find yourself anxious to show this music to your group members or other people in your life? You said it's very personal to you, so did you feel a little bit more precious with it?


	I felt like it was very, very precious, but at the same time I was kind of worried if this would be the right choice. I actually had a conversation with my dad, who said, “I'm actually very surprised on how honest and vulnerable you made this album and it actually kind of inspired me as your dad.” That conversation made me realize this was the right choice. I was kind of proud of myself, too.


Is there anything else you think is important to mention about The Firstfruit?


	I just want to say that I'm not asking for the world to love this album, but I am in a way requesting for the world to take the moment to listen to this album from start to finish at least once because then they'll get to know me better.

Sixty-two came in and now 42 will have to face off in a new head-to-head round to earn the 20 remaining spots.

	Gil Kaufman



	Like gladiators entering the arena, 62 aspiring American Idol contestants survived the first round of Hollywood Week only to run into the buzzsaw of Sunday night's (April 6) Showstopper rounds. Performing live for the first time in front of an audience at the Orpheum Theatre, as judges Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie worked to trim 38 aspiring stars from the roster, the singers had to turn things up a notch to make the cut.


	In the end four made the first cut.


	Gabby Samone wowed the room with her passionate, jazzy cover of Nina Simone's “Four Women,” which showed off her towering range and emotional maturity on the powerful 1966 anthem that tracks four Black women's journey from slavery to the present. “My skin is black/ My arms are long/ My hair is wooly/ My back is strong,” Samone sang over subtle piano accompaniment before climbing into a crystal-clear high note that had Richie up on his feet in amazement.

	The youngest singer in the competition, Eagleville, TN's Mattie Pruitt, has rolled through the competition so far despite saying in her opening package that she sometimes has had trouble finding her place in a family with 12 siblings. Though feelings of self-doubt continue to creep in — “I'm not pretty enough, I'm not good at singing” — the high schooler said the Idol stage is the first time she's felt truly comfortable in her skin.


	She proved she belongs in the mix with a cover of James Brown's “It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World,” making the 1966 soul classic her own by slowing it down to a funky stroll and luxuriating in the notes like a seasoned pro used to having crowds in the palm of her hand.


	Another early favorite, 17-year-old aspiring preacher Canaan James Hill, also proved that age ain't nothin' but a number with his roof-raising cover of Marvin Sapp's “Never Would Have Made It.” The teen poured some Al Green grit on the gospel great's 2007 ballad, again inspiring Richie to hop up and testify to some powerful vocals. “Go on man, go on do what you gotta do!” Richie said, shaking his head in wonder, with Bryan saying “he is one of the best singers I have ever seen!”


	The last of the four to make it through was Zaylie Windsor, who squeaked by in an earlier round, only to prove that she'd definitely earned her spot with a mesmerizing cover of Billie Eilish's “Happier Than Ever.” The Radiohead-like acoustic take featured Windsor's emotional vocals, climbing from a near whisper to a roar, filling the theater with ecstatic joy as she wailed the final notes. “Welcome to the Zaylie show!” Underwood said afterwards.

	











	While those four made the cut and will go to the top 24, Jmarie, Will Carter, Santina Madden, Isaiah Moore, Samantha Ray and Jazzy Mae were sent home and the remaining 42 singers will have to fight it out on Monday night (April 7) in head-to-head rounds; that round airs at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.


	Check out the four performances below.

HGTV star Tarek El Moussa is sharing how is dynamic with his ex-wife Christina Haack has improved. 

While speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025, Tarek El Moussa, who shares his older children Brayden, 9,  and Taylor, 14, with Haack, said filming the series, “The Flip Off,” alongside his ex-wife bettered their relationship. The HGTV series, which premiered in January 2025, featured Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, competing against Haack to see who could make a better profit when flipping a house. Haack's estranged husband, Josh Hall, was originally her partner until he left the series following their July 2024 split. 

Tarek El Moussa said filming the series “was more fun than [he] thought it was going to be.” 

“It was better for our family. It was better for our relationship. It brought everybody closer and, in the end, it did such amazing things for our family. I wouldn't change a thing,” said Tarek El Moussa to the publication. 

He also said that he and Haack were able to positively communicate with each other during the production of the show. 

“The show gave me and Christina an opportunity to apologize for things we did to each other. It gave Christina and Heather an opportunity to bond even closer. I mean, we're going to dinners now. So, honestly, it's just about working together, spending time together and creating some really fun TV together,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview.

Tarek El Moussa spoke about filming with Haack for “The Flip Off” during a January 2025 Us Weekly interview, alongside his wife. He said he was not worried about working with his ex-wife again because they have “been in a really good place” for “the last couple of years.” 

“It took us almost 10 years to get there, so going back into shooting together, it's a lot more of an intimate relationship. There were some reservations. But as the show has gone on, we've realized it's just business,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

He also said that he and Haack did argue while filming the HGTV series. According to Tarek El Moussa, he took issue with Haack “because she always wants to get her way.” 

“She doesn't want to have rules,” said Tarek El Moussa to Us Weekly.

Heather Rae El Moussa also shared that he and Haack's dynamic is similar to how siblings fight.

During a November 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Haack said Hall took issue with her dynamic with Tarek El Moussa while filming “The Flip Off.” 

According to Haack, Hall viewed her relationship with her ex-husband as flirty. She said, however, that she views Tarek El Moussa like a sibling.

Actor Kevin Bacon has not spoken much about Bernie Madoff since he and his wife were victims in the Ponzi scheme that led to Madoff's arrest in 2008.

However, in an interview with Esquire that was published on April 4, they asked if it was okay to discuss Madoff.  

“There's not that much to say, really,” Bacon answered. “If it seems too good to be true, then it's too good to be true.” 

The interviewer followed that up by noting that Bacon and his wife, Kyra Sedgwick appeared to be not “too jaded from the experience”

 “No, not jaded,” he answered. “More careful. But not jaded.”

“I go to this gym. It has a few machines and only a handful of people there at any given time. There's no showers, it's very bare bones,” he added. “But there's a leg press machine. A leg press can be brutal… The machine is right next to a window, and when I look out that window, I'm looking right at the building where Madoff was.” 

“I'm in excruciating pain, doing the leg press, staring out that window,” Bacon continued. “It's perfect, in a funny way, because I also have to think, I can get through this. And that's how we felt about Madoff.

Bacon has never revealed the exact amount he lost to Madoff, but Madoff's Ponzi scheme is said to have defrauded people of an estimated $64.8 billion total. 

While it was a very tough time for Bacon after they learned they had been defrauded by Madoff, he leaned on his family to help him get through it. 

“It sucked, and we were certainly angry and all the things,” Bacon explained to Esquire. “But then we woke up the next day and said, ‘What do we got? We love each other. We love our children. We're healthy. No one took away our ability to make a living.' So we got back to work.”

A post shared by Kevin Bacon (@kevinbacon)

In 2022, Bacon appeared on the Smartless podcast, hosted by Jason Batemen, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes, and opened up about how he was impacted by Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. 

Specifically, Bacon revealed that he and Sedgwick “had most of our money in Madoff” and admitted that he received a “portion” of the losses returned, but not everything.

“Certainly, you get angry and stuff, but I have to say, there were a lot of people who were much worse off than we were – old people, people whose retirement funds were completely decimated,” Bacon said on Smartless. “So there's always going to be somebody that's going to have it a lot worse than you.”

For the first time ever, more than three dozen “American Idol” contestants will go head-to-head in a season 23 Hollywood Week battle round, set to air on April 7, 2025. 

At the end of the two-hour Showstopper Round on April 6, judges Lionel Richie, Luke Bryan, and Carrie Underwood sent home 18 singers, advanced four contestants to the coveted Top 24, and then informed the 40 remaining hopefuls that they'll duke it out vocally in pairs, just 24 hours later, with their “Head-to-Head” duets. 

After 62 performances during the Showstopper Round, the judges chose four singers to leapfrog the next stage of the competition, securing their place in the Top 24. That means these four powerhouse singers are automatically going to the next round, performing in Hawaii. 

The youngest “American Idol” contestant of the season, Pruitt wowed the judges with her rendition of James Brown's “It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World.” After her song, Bryan told his fellow judges that the high schooler from Eagleville, Tennessee, is “probably a massive star. Like, sneaky star.” 

Richie agreed, telling him, “I'm with you. We just got a show right there.”

The Dallas-based content creator and aspiring preacher took the crowd to church with his soulful performance of “Never Would Have Made It” by Marvin Sapp. Underwood continually remarked that she couldn't believe he's only 17, and Richie told her and Bryan that it was “the greatest performance I have ever seen.”

Hill was the judges' third platinum ticket winner, so he got to skip the first round of Hollywood Week and will now get to skip the final round, too, as he advances to the Top 24. 

When Windsor walked onto the Showstopper stage, Bryan — who was the one judge not to vote her through to Hollywood after her initial audition — told Richie and Underwood that she needed to prove herself. With her version of Billie Eilish's “Happier Than Ever,” the Safford, Arizona, singer did just that. Bryan declared afterward that she'd shot up to the Top 10 in his mind. 

Samone got a standing ovation from the judges for her take on Nina Simone's “Four Women” as Bryan told them, “She just came roaring to the front of the competition.” 

They're not the first to notice the Baltimore singer's immense talent. “Idol” alum Jennifer Hudson saw Samone singing on Instagram and invited her on her talk show, then kept in touch with her. When Samone asked her whether she should audition for “Idol,” she told producers that Hudson encouraged her to go for it.  

In another two-hour episode airing on April 7, the 40 remaining hopefuls will have to choose partners overnight, select a song to perform as a duet, and then sing it in front of the judges less than 24 hours later. The judges will then decide which contestant from each duo will advance, though some pairs may both go forward while other pairs both get cut. 

The one silver lining is that they can lean on Jelly Roll, who was introduced at the end of the Showstopper episode as the show's first-ever artist-in-residence. He will work with the contestants behind-the-scenes throughout the season, beginning with preparing them for the battle round. 

“We thought that we would bring in a little extra support,” Richie told the contestants before revealing who it was. “He's going to be with us all season long to navigate the ups and the downs of what you are about to go through. Jelly Roll!” 

The country superstar then walked out on stage as the group cheered, and said, “Glad to be part of the ‘Idol' family the rest of the season!”

The “American Idol” head-to-head battles air on April 7 starting at 8 p.m. Eastern time. The Top 24 will then advance to perform in Hawaii with additional celebrity mentors Ashanti and Josh Groban. Those episodes will begin airing on April 13.

The sketch had the pair, plus Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, singing up in the air.

	A couple is ready to “take it the next level” after a nice date in the “Making Love” sketch that aired on SNL Saturday night (April 5). Silk pajama-clad lovers-to-be (Jack Black and Sarah Sherman) turn the night into a musical performance, with a little help from Bowen Yang and Brandi Carlile — and with all four of them flying.


	Black, the host of Saturday Night Live‘s latest episode, and Sherman are lifted up as they sing (and making swimming motions in the air). 


	“First we do things to me for a while,” Black sings, “and then we do things to you for not that long.”

	They try to incorporate some dirty talk, and get the champagne flowing — right into Sherman's eyeballs.


	“That was so romantic,” Sherman musters, to which Black agrees: “For me as well.” Together, they harmonize: “Because we're making love.“


	“Then without even saying a word, we both know it's time to bring in a third,” they sing.


	“Hello, I'm here to fix your problems,” croons Yang, who appears out of nowhere. “And this will definitely end well.”


	Spoiler: Black panics, feels weird for inviting a guy from work to join them, and decides the way to make things all right and “dandy” is “to bring in a fourth … and the fourth is Brandi.”


	Watch the “Making Love” sketch below to hear the always-cool Carlile croon her words of wisdom while mid-air.


	Elsewhere on Saturday night's show, the singer-songwriter fulfilled her duties as musical guest with Elton John, performing “Little Richard's Bible” and “Who Believes in Angels?” from their new album released this week. Carlile and John's collaborative project, Who Believes in Angels?, was released on Friday (April 4).

I am not a fan of The Conjuring films. I laughed my way through Paranormal Activity. These previous experiences with the supernatural world were why I had low expectations of Conjuring Tapes. But, after starting off with a disturbing dream sequence, this new found footage anthology becomes more bizarre after the discovery of old videotapes by two young women. 

The term “conjuring” refers to the act of performing tricks or illusions, often involving the appearance or disappearance of objects, typically for entertainment purposes. It can also mean summoning supernatural forces or entities. Conjuring Tapes does an impressive job of not only creating various scenarios where malevolent forces are invoked but also presents itself as almost an anthology of paranormal stories woven together in several videotapes with a curious commonality: the two women watching actually appear in every VHS tape as different people! How unsettling, yet so intriguing.

While both claim to be unfamiliar with each scenario—such as a double date over a Ouija board or scary possessions of the duo in an abandoned office building—the one source of sinister control is derived during an evil cult gathering that ultimately determines their frightening fate.

Each piece of found footage is more malicious than the last, and yet we all become intoxicated by the sheer phenomenon of where this inexplicable story is taking us, rather than trying to escape the madness. You may want to look away, but trust me, you'll be sorry if you do.

Conjuring Tapes is a fresh perspective on the ongoing fascination with paranormal activity. There are no contrived performances or inorganic reactions to the fear presented before these young women. They watch with natural bewilderment, uncertainty, and apprehensive terror. How would you feel after seeing yourself interact with (what you believe to be) strangers, demons, and a scary-ass prophet who holds your life in their hands? The best part of the entire chronicle is that it's all intended for your own interpretation. Do with it as you will. I chose to enjoy this crazy trip.



Summary

‘Conjuring Tapes' is a surprisingly spooky found footage anthology that takes you on one wild ride.

The classified Kosmos satellite trio has sparked intrigue in space-tracking circles.

A trio of secretive Russian satellites launched earlier this year has released a mysterious object into orbit, sparking interest among space trackers and analysts.

The three satellites, designated Kosmos 2581, 2582 and 2583, launched on a Soyuz-2.1V rocket from Plesetsk cosmodrome early on Feb. 2 (GMT). Since then, the satellites, whose purpose is unknown, have displayed interesting behavior, while in a near-polar orbit roughly 364 miles (585 kilometers) above Earth.

In March, the satellites appeared to be conducting potential proximity operations, or maneuvering close to other objects in space, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and spaceflight activity tracker.

Following this, the U.S. Space Force cataloged a new object in orbit, which was possibly released by Kosmos 2581 on March 18.

Russia has provided no details about the satellites and their mission. Many Kosmos missions are classified.

The released object could be used for a number of objectives, including military experiments, such as satellite inspection or target practice, testing technology for docking or formation flying. It may also be a scientific payload or even the result of an unintentional fragmentation, though this would usually result in numerous pieces of debris.

The Kosmos (or Cosmos) designation has been used by the Soviet Union and later Russia for a very wide range of military and scientific satellites since 1962. The satellites have covered a range of apparent uses, some of which are experimental, secret, or part of military programs, including early ASAT (anti-satellite) tests and satellite inspection, reconnaissance and electronic intelligence.

Satellite trios flying in formation in orbit is not unusual. Both the United States (for example, the Naval Ocean Surveillance System) and China (Yaogan) have launched numerous sets of satellite triplets, many of which are thought to be for electronic intelligence purposes, along with other satellite series.

However, it remains to be seen what the three Kosmos satellites and their new companion will get up to in orbit.

What could technological advancements in AI, declining birth rates, psychedelics, and UFO sightings possibly have to do with Donald Trump's political rise and reshaping of modern conservatism? Ross Douthat is on a mission to find out for The New York Times.

Interesting Times With Ross Douthat, a new podcast from the Times Opinion section, isn't aiming to be an explicit foray into the conservative podcast ecosystem, according to the host. Instead, “It's trying to be a window from The New York Times into a changed world with a conservative guide,” Douthat tells Vanity Fair. Each Thursday, starting April 10, the conservative opinion writer will explore the New Right through discussions with newsmakers in an attempt to offer a place within the Times that “tries to engage with a world that has been deeply unsettled.”

The new podcast will serve as a place where this “strange new world meets the concrete realities of politics,” Douthat explains in an interview, telling me that the podcast will touch on the modern conservative movement, political party realignment, organized religion, technology, pop culture, and even aliens. Douthat, who often writes about religion, said he plans to explore “the weirder edges of religion right now—from psychedelics to UFOs. Not just what's going on with Catholicism, but what's going on with unidentified flying objects and people having wild spiritual encounters while taking ayahuasca,” he says.

“The conceit of the show is that these weird things have some kind of real connection to what's happening in normal politics,” he adds. “We're going to be trying to make that connection clear.”

Douthat, 45, joined the Times in 2009 after a stint at The Atlantic and with two books already under his belt: Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class and, with Reihan Salam, Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream. Douthat's since been one of the Times' most reliable conservative voices on the Opinion page, providing an intellectual perspective from the right that's surely more palatable to Times readers than a MAGA firebrand. Douthat's also knocked out five more books in that time and cohosted the paper's Matter of Opinion podcast, which typically featured columnists from varying political points of view. It's on Matter of Opinion where Douthat also flew solo this year in interviews with conservative and contrarian voices like Steve Bannon, Chris Rufo, and Marc Andreessen.

“We knew pretty much immediately after the election that we wanted to do a show like this,” Kathleen Kingsbury, the Times opinion editor, tells me. “What we were trying out in the last few months, and you saw this a little bit with those interviews, was trying to figure out what the format should be.” According to Kingsbury, those interviews performed particularly well with Times readers consuming the content in all forms—audio, video, and transcript. “People were hungry for understanding and guidance for this moment, in a way that just blew us away,” she says.

Trump's return to power has sparked a fresh wave of calls for a better understanding of the right, with California governor Gavin Newsom, for one, kicking off his new podcast with Charlie Kirk, followed by Michael Savage and Bannon. Douthat tells me his podcast was green lit following the success of his interviews with figures on the right, which he said are a “good example of what the show wants to do,” while ensuring me that's “not going to be all that the show is, by any means.”

“It wasn't something we decided a year ago or something. It was much more in the last few months, where there was just sort of this sense that after the election, the landscape had shifted and I might be a good person to help Times readers understand what was going on,” he adds. While he is “slightly intimidated” to transition from Matter of Opinion cohost to the host of his own podcast, Douthat says that opinion leadership has been “very enthusiastic about the idea.”

Kingsbury, who took over the Opinion section in 2020, says she's been “committed to bringing a broader range of viewpoints into the section, and that particularly includes conservative voices.” Douthat, she says, “has long been a brilliant voice in text for Opinion, and I feel even better that we're going to be able to bring this show around him, his interests, and his ideas going forward.”

While the Times has built out their opinion offerings by bringing writers with varying political views together via roundtables, the paper sees a niche for Douthat in the audio space, pushing him to the forefront of his own show, using similar tactics that allowed for the success of the Ezra Klein Show, one of the Times' fastest-growing podcasts.

Douthat's show will also be available as a video podcast on YouTube, a strategy that has been particularly successful for Ezra Klein, an opinion columnist who, like Douthat, cut his teeth in the aughts political blogosphere, albeit from the left. “We're basically making that show video first, knowing that we find a larger and different audience on YouTube than we do if we just continue to publish on site,” Kingbury says. “We're really focused on figuring out how to think more broadly. I think Opinion is the part of the Times that has probably made the most inroads in this, but you see it across the Times. We're trying to figure out how to offer our audiences more and more ways to interact with our journalism and engage with it.”

“Like a lot of big successful organizations, the Times is not a dominant presence on YouTube, or anything like that,” says Douthat, adding that “there's certainly room for Times audio to grow.”
