Exclusive: Richard Harpin pauses donations in move insiders say will result in closure of party's northern HQ

 UK politics live – latest updates

One of the Conservatives' biggest donors has stopped funding the party in a move insiders believe will result in the closure of its northern HQ, the Guardian can reveal.

Richard Harpin, the founder of the home repairs business HomeServe, has ended his donations to the Conservatives, according to two Tory sources.

The decision is a blow to Kemi Badenoch, who is presiding over a diminished and cash-strapped party that is facing intense competition for donations from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.

Harpin gave the Conservatives nearly £850,000 in 2024, Electoral Commission records show, and has donated £3.8m to the party since 2008, £2m of which was in cash. Rishi Sunak used a helicopter owned by Harpin for campaign stops in the run-up to last year's general election.

A source close to Harpin said that while he had paused his donations, he remained a strong supporter of the Conservatives.

Until recently, Harpin, who grew up in Northumberland, made a monthly £33,000 cash donation to the party, which paid for its northern HQ in Leeds. This has now ended and the Leeds HQ is likely to close as a result, two Tory sources said.

The Tories announced their plan to establish a northern HQ in October 2020, almost a year after Boris Johnson's landslide election victory, in which dozens of “red wall” seats in the north of England flipped from Labour to Conservative. The new offices were opened by Oliver Dowden, then party chair, in the spring of 2022 on the outskirts of Leeds city centre.

Labour won back most of those red wall constituencies last summer, and there has since been speculation that the northern Tory HQ was slated for closure as the party faced financial difficulties.

A Conservative party source said Harpin had agreed to fund the Leeds office for an extra year to cover the general election period after an initial two years. The source said that although the party was reviewing its properties, there were no plans to shut down operations in the north.

Despite cash woes, the Conservatives outperformed other parties' fundraising efforts at the end of last year – raising nearly £2m in the last three months of 2024, which was twice as much as Labour and seven times more than Reform. A Conservative party source said they were expecting a strong showing in the first quarter of 2025 too.

One Tory insider said Harpin took his decision to stop donating after a meeting with party co-chair Dominic Johnson, who has faced some internal criticism, but sources close to the HomeServe founder and the party denied this.

The Guardian reported in February that Tory staff numbers had fallen from 200 to about 60 and that there were not enough funds to hire political advisers for some shadow cabinet ministers. There is speculation that the party will move out of its headquarters in Westminster to cut costs.

Last spring, the Conservatives were fined nearly £11,000 for under-reporting the value of non-cash donations received from Harpin for three years. On top of his cash donations, he funded the secondment of an employee to the party.

Harpin, who began his career as a brand manager for Procter & Gamble in Newcastle upon Tyne and stepped down as chair of HomeServe in January. He and his wife secured a reported £500m in 2022 after he sold the company to a Canadian firm for more than £4bn. The Sunday Times rich list placed him as the Britain's 242nd richest person last year, with a worth of £670m, up £40m on the year before.

During the run-up to the election in July several Conservative donors including the Phones 4u founder, John Caudwell, and the carpet tycoon Philip Harris switched to support Labour.

In the past six months, several other Tory donors including the billionaire property developer Nick Candy have been wooed by Reform. Candy is now fundraising for Farage as party treasurer.

Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk, now in Guatemala, had racked up large tax debt at Stedsans forest retreat

A Danish chef couple who attracted international acclaim with a “forest resort” in Sweden have been tracked down to Guatemala after apparently going on the run from tax authorities, leaving behind 158 barrels of human waste.

Flemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk founded their purportedly eco-friendly retreat, Stedsans, in Halland, southern Sweden, after claiming to have “felt the call of the wild” in Copenhagen, where they ran a popular rooftop restaurant.

Stedsans, formed of 16 wooden cottages looking out on to nature, attracted praise from influencers and reviewers, who described it as “magical” and “enchanting luxury”.

But a few months ago it was discovered that the couple had vanished, leaving multiple animals behind and 158 barrels of human waste, an investigation by newspapers Dagens Nyheter and Politiken has found. It also found that wastewater was left to run into the forest.

Staff said multiple animals – including ducks – had died as a result of being left outside through the night by the couple, and others were left abandoned after the owners vanished.

Stedsans was declared bankrupt in March and the couple reportedly registered themselves as living abroad before Christmas.

According to the investigation, they left the Danish capital, where they owed millions of kroner in debt to Danish tax authorities, in 2016 to move to Sweden. There they set up Stedsans, but started accumulating debt to Swedish tax authorities, which reportedly amounted to 6m SEK (£470,000). They have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.

In a message posted on their website, they said: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.”

They added: “When you read this we have probably been declared bankrupt by the Swedish tax authorities. All we ever wanted was to be a part of creating a more beautiful planet.”

Local authorities described their actions as “environmental crime”. Daniel Helsing, head of building and environment for the local county, Hylte, told Dagens Nyheter: “Voilà. Over 150 barrels of human shit.”

Hansen denied any problems with handling animals when approached by the newspaper. He described Swedish tax authorities as a “narcissistic entity” and said he believed he owed them “over 7m” SEK. He also claimed he was now “sentenced to a life in poverty”.

The Guardian contacted the Danish and Swedish tax authorities. The Danish tax agency said: “We have no comments here subject to confidentiality.” The Swedish tax agency did not comment on the case.

The Guardian has contacted Hansen and Helbæk for comment.

Ministers and more than 70 MPs attended photo call with Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed whose travel ban was called unacceptable

Cabinet ministers and more than 70 parliamentarians staged a show of solidarity with two MPs who were detained and barred from entry to Israel in what was the first time British MPs had been banned from the country.

The health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, joined the photocall in Westminster Hall on Monday with the MPs, along with Hamish Falconer and housing minister Rushanara Ali. It was organised by the Rochdale MP Paul Waugh.

In a statement in the Commons, Falconer said both were given clearance for entrance by Israeli before travelling and said the ban “appears to have been taken on the basis of comments made in this chamber”, calling the treatment “unacceptable and deeply concerning”.

He said the UK government had made that clear at the “highest level” in Israel and praised Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed for their dignity.

Yang and Mohamed both rose in the house to cheers. Mohamed said her treatment was “unprecedented” and the views she had expressed in the House of Commons were “legitimate political opinions which are firmly aligned with international laws”. She said many Israeli people and charities had also called for change in a similar manner.

“This was not about security, this was about control and censorship,” Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, said, adding that she “desperately wants to see a two-state solution, desperately wants to see peace”.

Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, said she had been heartened by the solidarity shown by other MPs from across the Commons. Yang said she had understood the risks of travelling the region but “I did not anticipate the risks of detention and deportation by a British ally”. She said: “If my experience has proved anything, it is that what we say in this chamber matters.”

Falconer said the MPs had initially believed they were going to be detained overnight without their phones and were eventually released after intervention by both him and the foreign secretary, David Lammy, who spoke to his Israeli counterpart.

“All members should be worried about what this decision means and the precedent it sets. We have warned that actions like this only damage the image of the Israeli government in the eyes of honourable members across the house,” Falconer said.

The minister also condemning the killing of 15 paramedics in a convoy of ambulances near Rafah, calling it an “outrage” and demanding a return to ceasefire negotiations. “This conflict cannot be won by bombs and bullets but by diplomacy, he said.

At the photocall in support of the MPs, Streeting told the Guardian he had been on a similar visit led by the Council for Arab British-Understanding (Caabu) and Medical Aid for Palestinians – and questioned why the two had been targeted.

“The way that two really excellent colleagues were treated was totally unacceptable,” he said.

“I think this is really important that this is understood in the context of two highly respected Labour members of parliament held in high regard across the parliamentary party who were going on a delegation just like the one I was on with Caabu and Medical Aid for Palestinians – without the sort of challenges they had.

“In the context of what is going on in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the moment, having insight, meeting a range of voices is really important. It's highly regrettable the Israeli authorities have acted in this way.”

MPs joining the show of solidarity included the chair of the foreign affairs select committee Emily Thornberry, the Treasury select committee chair, Meg Hillier, Melanie Ward, the Labour MP who was the former chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians, and the former development minister Anneliese Dodds.

Caabu has taken a total of 161 MP and peers to the region since 1997, including Streeting, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, the former education secretary Kit Malthouse and the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey.

Other high-profile politicians who have visited as part of their delegations include former ministers Nick Herbert and the late Tessa Jowell and the Lib Dem MPs Alistair Carmichael and Christine Jardine.

Speaking in the chamber, Falconer condemned the comments of the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, who said on Sunday that the two MPs were not allowed entry because the Israeli authorities “did not believe they were going to comply with Israeli law”. Falconer said that was not the reason that the Israeli officials gave, adding: “The leader of the opposition should apologise.”

UK index loses nearly 4.5% as Trump's team dismiss rumours of a 90-day pause on tariffs as ‘fake news'

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.

Elsewhere, Germany's DAX is down 4.3%, France's CAC is down 4.8%, Italy's FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain's IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs.

In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday's session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.

The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.

Monday's session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.

Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.

“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.

Elsewhere, Germany's DAX is down 4.3%, France's CAC is down 4.8%, Italy's FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain's IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs.

Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump's tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders' share prices.

The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country's largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.

While Trump's tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.

The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.

Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts. That could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first quarter results, which are due later this month.

After holding relatively stable during last week's global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.

Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound, AP reported.

Bitcoin's prices haven't been this low since just after president Donald Trump's Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin's price broke $100,000 in December.

Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year.

London's FTSE 100 is set to close and is likely to see another significant fall.

We will bring you the final figures once we get them.

President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs on China if Beijing does not withdraw retaliatory measures, increasing trade war concerns.

On his Truth Social network, Trump posted:

Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.

Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.

Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Richard Branson has posted on X describing Donald Trump's tariffs as a “colossal mistake” and has called on the president to reverse his decision.

America could be left “facing ruin for years to come”, he said.

He posted:

The ongoing market response to last week's US tariff announcement was both predictable and preventable.

Even if you agree with the premise of these tariffs, every reasonable effort should be made to give US companies sufficient time to adapt.

The billionaire added:

This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course.

Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come

A quick recap…

It's turning into another very volatile day in the financial markets, as investors grow more fearful that Donald Trump's trade war will trigger a recession.

European stock markets are in the red in late trading, with the FTSE 100 index down 2.5%, or 205 points, at 7849 points.

Germany's DAX is down 3.5% in early trading, while France's CAC has lost 4%.

It's been a roller-coaster rise on Wall Street – stocks initially plunged, but then rocketed higher following a report that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to many of his new tariffs.

However, that rally fizzled out as the White House denied this claim.

So was that 90-day tariff pause tweet (now proven entirely false) the largest fake news-driven market swing in market history?

Goldman Sachs added to the pressure on the White House, by raising the chances of a US recssion to 45%.

JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned that it may be “hard to reverse” the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs, which he said would drive prices higher and make a US recession more likely.

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

The turmoil in financial markets today has overshadowed a co-ordinated push by UK regulators to show they are responding to chancellor Rachel Reeves' demand for them to help spur economic growth.

On Monday, the FCA announced it was planning to loosen rules for more than 600 hedge funds, private equity and venture capital firms in a move that it says will “make it easier for firms to enter the market, grow, compete and innovate.”

The City regulator said it was looking to raise the threshold at which funds are subject to main rules for the sector, meaning they will only apply to those with more than £5bn under management (compared to €100m previously).

That will mean take the number of firms facing more burdensome administrative from around 699 to just 64, its consultation paper suggested.

It comes as regulators come renewed pressure to support UK growth. In the City, this has so far meant easing rules on the financial services sector, with Reeves having also encouraged more risk-taking across the industry.

The CEO of private equity lobby group, the BVCA, welcomed the move, saying:

“More effective, less burdensome regulation will make the UK private capital industry more globally competitive and help it to boost investment from the UK and international investors into growing British businesses.

Elsewhere, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cheered the fact that new consumer protection rules had come into force, which ban fake reviews and drip pricing - where fees are added to the displayed price. The CMA will also be able to decide whether laws have been breached, and decide on compensation and fines, without having to go through the courts.

Ofwat, too, has tried to have a moment in the sun, telling water companies to build new reservoirs and other major projects more quickly in the coming years. In a letter to water company bosses, the watchdog said they must find ways to “deliver (projects) more efficiently, effectively and achieve earlier completion”.

Here's a chart showing how US stocks jumped following that dubious report that Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause to tariffs, but then fell back as the reports were dismissed.

🚨 BREAKING: CNBC is reporting that headlines of President Trump considering a tariff pause are FALSE.S&P 500 -$2 trillion over the last 10 minutes. https://t.co/h50axecrvl pic.twitter.com/F6u3gbQI8W

The White House says any suggestion that President Donald Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs is “fake news,” CNBC reports.

We've just seen a wild few minutes in the financial markets, following a confusing report about a possible delay to Trump's tariffs.

After plunging in early trading, Wall Street surged into positive territory. A few minutes ago the S&P 500 index was UP by 1.76% at 5,163 points, a gain of 89 points. However, that rally has now petered out again.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped too – it was briefly up 1.44%, or 551 points, at 38,866 points, having been DOWN over 1,000 points in early trading.

But that rally has fizzled out too, leaving the Dow down 747 points (for the next few seconds, anyway).

This dizzying roller-coaster follows a suggestion on CNBC that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has, apparently, suggested that Donald Trump is considering a 90 day pause on tariffs for all countries other than China.

That would obviously be a game-changer for the markets, and bolster hopes that negotiations might lead to reductions in the large tariffs announced by Trump last week.

However, we haven't yet managed to stand up exactly what Hassett has said on this point. He WAS asked about the possibility of a 90-day pause on Fox News earlier, but he didn't explicitly say it was under active consideration.

Stocks had briefly bounced back in London too, but the FTSE 100 is currently down 214 points or -2.6% today at 7842 points.

The chief executives of some of the world's biggest banks have reportedly held private talks about the carnage in financial markets and the global economy precipitated by President Donald Trump's new tariffs.

Sky News has learnt that bosses from lenders including Bank of America, Barclays, Citi and HSBC Holdings held a call on Sunday to discuss the ongoing chaos as plunging equity markets reflect fears of a worldwide recession.

Thet add:

Sources said that Sunday's call was convened by the Bank Policy Institute, a Washington-based public policy group.

Brian Moynihan of BoA, Barclays' CS Venkatakrishnan and Georges Elhedery of HSBC were among those who took part in the call, according to one overseas bank executive.

The current stock market turbulence is “a huge worry”, Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool's Management School, tells us.

Prof Milas suggests there's a possibility that central banks might need to take action, if the market turmoil continues, which would set an unfortunate precedent …

From a historical point of view, investors react to periods of high uncertainty (like the current one) by reducing their exposure or fleeing the stock market altogether and investing in government debt (the so-called “flight to quality“ or “flight to safety“).

This means that stock market liquidity will soon dry up and company investments will freeze. If the stock market turbulence continues throughout this week, the Fed, Bank of England and ECB might be forced to act together by cutting interest rates before the Easter break.

If this was what Trump wanted, then he will get the message that he can always get his way towards dictating interest rates through, for instance, tariff threats...

Follow:


Speaking to reporters Sunday on Air Force One, President Donald Trump defended his new global tariffs with a familiar series of false claims about tariffs and trade.
    


            As he has before, Trump wildly exaggerated the US trade deficit with China — describing it as more than three times higher than it actually is. He repeated his frequent false claim that China paid the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency on imported Chinese products; these payments were made by US importers. And he once again falsely described trade with Europe, wrongly saying the continent doesn't buy “anything” from the US. In reality, the European Union purchased about $649 billion worth of US exports in 2024.
    


            Trump's Sunday remarks also included inaccurate assertions about other subjects, but we'll stick to tariffs and trade in this article. Here is a fact check.
    


            Trump said Sunday that the US has a trade deficit with China of $1 trillion or more.
    


            “We have a tremendous deficit problem with China. They have a surplus of at least a trillion dollars a year. I think it's like a trillion-one,” he said.

Markets plunge on Trump's tariffs as Netanyahu visits White House



            As we've noted in previous fact checks, those numbers are not close to accurate. In fact, official federal statistics show the 2024 trade deficit with China in goods and services trade was about $263 billion. Even if you exclude the services trade, at which the US excels, and count only trade in goods, the 2024 deficit with China was about $295 billion.
    


            The US has never approached a $1 trillion trade deficit with China. The deficit in goods trade alone hit a record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.
    


            Trump repeated his regular assertion that China paid the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports during his first presidency, wrongly declaring, “I took in, during my four year(s), hundreds of billions of dollars from China.”
    


            In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments to the US government, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump's first-term tariffs on China. It's easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.
    


            Trump made a series of false claims about trade with Europe, all repeats from previous comments.
    


            He said Sunday: “They don't take our cars. They don't take our food products. They don't take anything. And we take their cars: Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW. You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm product. They don't take anything. “
    


            None of this is correct.

            “They don't take anything” is far from the truth. While the European Union certainly has some trade barriers that make it harder for US companies to export products there, the official federal statistics show the US exported about $649 billion worth of goods and services to the European Union in 2024.
    


            It's similarly false that “they don't take our farm products.” While the EU does have some trade barriers that impede US agricultural exports, the US Department of Agriculture says the EU bought $12.8 billion worth of US agricultural exports in 2024, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind Mexico, Canada and China.
    


            And while US automakers have often struggled to succeed in Europe, Trump went too far when he said, “They take no cars.” According to a report last month from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, “164,857 US-made cars were exported to the EU in 2024,” valued at about $8.4 billion at current exchange rates. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.)

Live Updates


            • Trump meets with Netanyahu: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to meet with President Donald Trump today at the White House, marking his second visit since January. The leaders are expected to discuss Trump's new tariffs on Israel, the war with Hamas and other key issues. The top White House adviser said it will be Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate the tariffs announced last week.
    


            • Markets tumble: The meeting comes as US stocks have been extremely volatile today as traders search for any sign Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted. US stocks tumbled for the third straight day Monday, and the S&P 500 entered bear market territory. Stocks in Asia and Europe also plunged, though more sharply in Asia.
    


            • Trump's trade war: Trump urged patience this morning and defended the state of the US economy. With the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation, fears of a global recession are mounting. The European Union is “ready to negotiate” with the US and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, the president of the European Commission said.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday he's ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing's retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets.
    


            He said the additional tariffs would take effect midweek if China doesn't remove its 34% retaliatory tariff by Tuesday.
    


            He also said meetings China had requested would be canceled, though he said other countries would begin negotiating on trade immediately.
    


                    “Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            “Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he went on.
    


            “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”
    


Some context: Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10% additional duties on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US. Last week, Trump announced an additional 34% on all Chinese goods, which is set to take effect Wednesday. If his latest threat of an additional 50% went into effect, Chinese goods arriving in the US would effectively be subject to tariffs of 104%.
    


This post has been updated with additional details. 



            A federal appeals court declined on Monday to put on hold a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.



            The decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals comes just hours before the administration faces an 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US.
    


            The ruling came minutes after the administration asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to lift the preliminary injunction issued late last week by US District Judge Paula Xinis.
    


            It's not every day that financial markets go from deep in the red to well into positive territory and then back down to the red again — all in the span of minutes.
    


            But that's exactly what happened on Monday.
    


            With banners flashing on CNBC and posts piling up on social media that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs with the exception of China, investors breathed a huge sigh of relief. But then it turned out that they got a little too excited.
    


            A White House official told CNN any such reports are “fake news.”
    


            Much of the reporting traced back to an interview President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, had on Fox News this morning. Hassett was asked if Trump can call a “90-day timeout” on tariffs.
    


            Hassett responded: “I think the President will decide what the President is going to decide.” Several news networks took that to mean Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. However, there was no official reporting on that.
    


            White House director of communications Steven Cheung also denied reports of a 90-day pause being under consideration. He reposted a NewsMax post on X post of Hassett with his own comments: “Not true. Nobody can point to a transcript …  because it was never said.”
    


            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court today to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.
    


            The emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court on a short fuse: A lower court judge has ordered the Trump administration to return him to the US by 11:59 p.m. Monday.
    


            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.

            The wild swings in financial markets on Monday morning underscore how badly investors want President Donald Trump to pause the trade war.
    


            US stocks surged off their lows and even briefly turned positive on rumors of a 90-day pause. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced.
    


                    “That was a good example of what would happen if we actually got some rational thought mixed in with the ignorant tariff policy,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview Monday. “The stock market vigilantes have spoken loudly that we need rational thought mixed in with this trade policy. And there is none so far.”
                





            Oversold markets desperate for good news are subject to wild swings that can quickly reverse, Hogan added.
    


            The European Union is “ready to negotiate” with the United States and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Monday.
    


            “These tariffs come first and foremost at immense costs for US consumers and businesses but, at the same time, they have a massive impact on the global economy,” the head of the EU's executive arm said at a news conference in Brussels.
    


            Following US President Donald Trump's announcement of hefty tariffs on dozens of countries last week, EU exports to the US face a 20% “reciprocal” tariff, while its steel and auto industry face a 25% tariff. Von der Leyen said the tariffs, which have caused a global market rout, represent a “major turning point” for the US.
    


                    “Nonetheless, we stand ready to negotiate with the United States. Indeed, we have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners, because Europe is always ready for a good deal,” she said.
                





            Asked when the EU tabled the zero-tariff offer, von der Leyen said the offer was made “long before” Trump's latest tariff announcement and “repeatedly, for example, in the automotive sector.” She stressed that the EU has long gone “zero for zero with other countries that also have a strong automotive sector.”
    


            At the same time, the EU is willing to play hardball: Although the EU would prefer to strike a “negotiated settlement,” the bloc is also “preparing a potential list (of US imports) for retaliation,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, the head of the EU's executive arm said the bloc would explore new opportunities, citing deals it has already made with Mexico and Switzerland, as well as new trade agreements it is exploring with India, Indonesia and other countries in the Indo-Pacific.
    


            “We will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States – vast opportunities – and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners,” she said at a news conference in Brussels.

            US stocks were extremely volatile Monday as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.
    


            Markets around the world had tumbled over concerns about how Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth. US stocks opened the day in bear market territory but surged an hour later on rumors that the Trump administration may pause tariffs – perhaps for several months.
    


            That rumor turned out to be just that, it seems. And the Dow, which had risen nearly 900 points, was back down once again.
    


            The Dow was lower 500 points, or 1.3%. The broader S&P 500 edged lower. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% lower.
    


            At the open, the S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory – a decline of 20% from a recent peak – before pulling back. The decline in US stocks came after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.
    


            The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic).
    


            Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday's meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump will be the first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate on the tariffs announced last week.
    


                    “Israel is the first meeting today,” Hassett said, alluding to all the countries trying to negotiate. “President Trump has talked to world leaders all weekend.”
                





            “I'm sure they will talk about trade policy and Middle East policy as well,” Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.
    


            Hassett emphasized that the US is prepared for a “good deal.”
    


            The US imposed a 17% tariff on Israel, according to Trump's announcement last week.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that “countries from all over the World” are talking to the United States after he announced reciprocal tariffs last week and that “tough but fair parameters are being set,” specifically mentioning the Japanese prime minister sending negotiators.
    


                    “Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things.'”
                





            Trump also highlighted China as a particular focus, suggesting that trade relations with China need significant changes.
    


            “It all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!”
    


Asian markets dip: Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.
    


CNN's Juliana Liu and John Liu contributed to this report. 



            Last week Vietnam offered to lower its tariffs on American exports to 0% in exchange for the same treatment, according to a report published by the Vietnamese government on Friday. That came after President Donald Trump spoke with Vietnam's General Secretary Tô Lâm on Friday in a call Trump labeled “productive.”
    


            But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday that Vietnam's offer is not being taken seriously.
    


                    “Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said in a CNBC interview on Monday.
                





More context: Vietnam is among the nations set to see the highest “reciprocal” tariff rates of 46% come April 9, according to the new tariff regime the Trump administration unveiled last week. Vietnam was the United States' sixth-largest source of imports last year, according to US Commerce Department data.
    


            The tariffs Trump is set to impose could raise the price for a slew of goods which the US relies heavily on from Vietnam, including electronics, apparel and footwear
    


            US stocks opened lower Monday as markets around the world tumbled over concerns about how President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth.
    


            Markets opened in bear market territory – a decline of 20% from a recent peak – after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.
    


            The Dow fell 1,200 points, or 3.2%. The broader S&P 500 was 3.4% lower and opened in bear territory. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.96%. The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has surged to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic as investors fret over the market's next move. CNN's Fear and Greed Index has slumped to its lowest levels this year.
    


            President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on trading partners could derail the global move toward green energy, aimed at preventing the worst impacts of climate change.
    


            The tariffs will likely make key green technologies more expensive and could also force governments to divert resources from addressing the climate crisis into propping up their economies.
    


            China is the world's largest producer of many of the materials that are crucial for clean energy technologies. Among others, it exports vast amounts of lithium and lithium batteries as well as the materials used to build wind turbines and solar panels.
    


            The E3G independent climate change think tank said in a research paper that the tariffs will increase the cost of manufacturing of low-carbon technologies and could eventually result in higher prices for consumers — at a time when prices were going down, encouraging faster transition.
    


            Climate policies are already being changed because of the tariffs.
    


More context: The UK government on Monday scrapped some electric vehicle sales targets, specifically quoting the “new era of global insecurity” as one of the reasons. While the government kept the 2030 deadline to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars, it gave companies more flexibility up until then, and it also slashed the fines for those who don't meet the targets.
    


            After the Canadian government scrapped the consumer carbon tax last month, some Canadian provinces followed suit and stopped other carbon levies, quoting the US tariffs among the reasons.
    


            To avoid the worst of the climate crisis, the world needs to quickly transition to clean energy. With governments and businesses facing economic pressures, resources could be diverted away from green projects. That will likely backfire as failing to invest in emission cutting now will make more costly to deal with the consequences in the future.
    


            President Donald Trump urged patience and warned against becoming “panican” in a post Monday ahead of markets opening in the United States.
    


                    “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!),” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he went on.
                





            Trump was writing as markets traded sharply lower in Asia and Europe, and a US futures tumbled. Earlier this morning, Trump defended the US economy and claims tariffs will boost revenue
    


            White House national economic council director Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump's tariffs on Monday, responding to billionaire Trump supporter Bill Ackman who criticized and said the “economic nuclear war” is triggered by tariffs.
    


            “I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease the ease off the rhetoric a little bit,” Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.
    


                    “I think a lot of us at the White House think that these are these economic responses are exaggerated by critics, even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP as the idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,” Hasset said responding to Ackman.
                





            Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president, said Sunday that America was heading toward a self-inflicted “economic nuclear winter” because of Trump's tariff policy rollout.
    


            Hassett also responded to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has issued a bunt warning about Trump's tariff policy. Dimon said America's “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's “America First” foreign policy could undermine that standing.
    


            “Trump came into office with the biggest debt to GDP that we've seen in the US ever since World War 2,” Hassett said. “And what we're doing right now is we're fixing that,” he added in response to Dimon.
    


            Trump's announcement last week, targeting nearly all the US trading partners last week, including a 10% tariff on all imports and higher tariffs on certain countries, triggered a sharp and ongoing decline in global markets, with several nations imposing retaliatory tariffs on goods.
    


            The global market rout sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs deepened in Asia and Europe on Monday, with the US bracing for a further slump when its markets open shortly.
    


            Although the president has doubled down on his trade policy, members of his administration failed to offer a coherent message about his strategy over the weekend. Some of Trump's billionaire backers are now calling for a return to freer trade.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            • Asian markets plummet: With trading now over for the day, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% down – its worst day since 1997. The city's financial markets had been closed Friday for an annual festival.
    


            • Europe also slumps: Stocks indexes in Europe are down around 5% halfway through the day's trading. Meanwhile, European Union trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a response to Trump's tariffs.
    


            • US markets set to open: If the US stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration that a bull market has turned into a bear market in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.
    


            • Dimon sounds alarm: JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump's tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America's standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.
    


            • Trump doubles down: After his trade policy wiped trillions of dollars off global markets last week, Trump told reporters late Sunday that he doesn't want “anything to go down,” but that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” On Monday morning, Trump defended his policy in a Truth Social post, saying tariffs would bring in billions of dollars in revenue.
    


            • Musk breaks rank: Elon Musk has said he would be in favor of a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU, after the man he helped elect as president imposed a 20% tariff on the bloc. Bill Ackman, another of Trump's billionaire backers, has also criticized the president's trade policy.
    


            • MAGA's mixed signals: Top Trump administration officials offered mixed messaging over whether countries can negotiate their way out of tariffs, or if the levies are here to stay. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama, said the administration “doesn't have a coherent message on why it's implementing the largest tax increase” seen in the US in 50 years.

            President Donald Trump's trade plan could cause a repeat of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs from 1930 that worsened the Great Depression, former Federal Reserve official James Bullard warned on Monday.
    


                    “This has dramatically raised the risk of a Smoot-Hawley type outcome,” Bullard, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told CNBC. “Global trade collapsed and the Great Depression was on. That's what really has people worried about this.”
                





            Economists widely blame the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act with making the Great Depression worse than it had to be. The act surged tariffs on US imports to protect workers. A half-century later, the infamous legislation was featured in an iconic scene in “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.”
    


            Bullard, who now serves as dean of Purdue University's Mitch Daniels School of Business, told CNBC that Trump's tariffs are setting up a situation where “you could get a dramatic downturn in the economy.”
    


            Bullard added, however, that this does not have to be a repeat and noted that it's not clear the tariffs will even stay in place.
    


                    “What's the chance this will stick through the courts? Because I think this is probably executive overreach,” Bullard said, arguing that the executive branch likely needs the support of Congress to make these kinds of sweeping decisions on trade. “Who wants to invest when you don't know what the rules are going to be?”
                





            President Donald Trump took to social media Monday to argue that the US is in a strong economic position, despite the fact that the US and global markets have tanked.
    


                    “Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow-moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            The president claimed that the country will earn billions of dollars from the tariffs he placed on other countries, even as the stock market faces its worst start to a presidential term in modern history.
    


                    “This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate. They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA! Our past “leaders” are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump's post continued.
                





            Trump on Sunday aboard Air Force One said he does not want “anything to go down,” but stressed “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” with the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation.
    


            The sweeping tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump last week are set to add to the pain inflicted on US farmers by the tariffs imposed during his first term, a union boss has warned.
    


                    “It's not fun, we still haven't recovered from the last tariffs that the president put on,” Bob Kuylen, Vice President of the North Dakota Farmers Union, told CNN Monday.
                





            He added that farmers “haven't gotten (those) markets back yet and now he's picking on Canada and Mexico and China.” Farmers are being “held down to almost surf levels, just barely getting by,” he said.
    


            “We raise thousands and thousands of acres of corn and soybeans and wheat and other products and we export just about half of what we raise in the United States,” he said.
    


            Farmers often receive government funding to protect them when prices fall due to weather or market fluctuations – but in 2018 they needed bailing out to protect them from the Trump administration's trade policies. During Trump's first term, the government spent billions of dollars bailing out farmers feeling the pinch from the president's trade war.
    


            Over the weekend, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was unable to clearly state whether Trump's new tariffs are here to stay, or whether there was room for deals.
    


            Rollins indicated there could be support for farmers affected by the most recent tariffs, pointing to the previous relief during Trump's first term.
    


            JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about President Donald Trump's tariff policy: It threatens to raise prices, drive the global economy into a downturn and weaken America's standing in the world.
    


                    “The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” Dimon warned in his annual letter to shareholders. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”
                





            Dimon said America's “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's “America First” foreign policy could undermine that standing.
    


                    “If the Western world's military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken over time,” he said.
                





            Despite a recent plunge in markets, stocks could tumble much farther still, Dimon argued. The US stock market is set to open in bear market territory after hitting a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19 – the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).
    


                    “Even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high,” Dimon said. “These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious.”
                





            US President Donald Trump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the precipice of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history.
    


            If the stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration a bull market has turned into a bear in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.
    


            These same tariffs may also take a booming economy and turn it into a recession.

            We know there's a lot of chatter about the impact of the tariffs, and one word being thrown around is recession.



            So, what is a recession? And why are economists concerned the world may be impacted by it?
    


            The traditional (and official) definition of a US recession is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”
    


            That's according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organization has a very important role, when it comes to these downturns: Its Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of peaks, troughs, expansions, contractions — and yes, recessions — in the business cycle.
    


            The committee, in making its recession determination, uses three criteria: depth, diffusion and duration.
    


            This is where it gets a little squishy.
    


            While each of those need to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions in one of those areas can offset weaker conditions in the others.
    


            Also, it's often the case that the US already is in a recession by the time the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially deems it so.
    


            Prognosticators have turned to other gauges as potential recessionary indicators; however, they don't always prove true.
    


            The biggest rule of thumb or nonofficial recession indicator is the technical notion of back-to-back quarterly contractions in real gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity.
    


            As the European Union seeks to respond to the punishing 20% tariff the White House has placed on its exports, the bloc could negotiate with the United States on issues of energy security and military trade, a Latvian official said Monday.
    


            Artjom Uršulskis, parliamentary secretary of Latvia's foreign ministry, hinted at where the EU is looking to negotiate with the US, in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting of EU trade ministers.
    


                    “It could be energy security, it could be military trade, it could be new technologies – but we should really focus on that to find a common ground, because the trade wars are never favorable for everyone,” Uršulskis said.
                





            One area the EU could target is US services, rather than just goods – which would punish US tech giants. But Uršulskis said this would be the wrong focus.
    


                    “I don't think that we should target services,” he said. “Once again, it's much more needed to find some positive agenda and to show our partners that we can find common ground and not start new wars and new battlefields.”
                





            Goldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street bank to warn that US President Donald Trump's trade war could crash the US economy into a damaging recession.
    


            As financial markets plunged, Goldman Sachs economists delivered a report to clients titled “Countdown to Recession” that slashed their 2025 GDP forecast to 0.5% and raised their 12-month recession probability from 35% to 45%.
    


            The investment bank cited the “sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed.”
    


            The new recession warning from Goldman Sachs is lower than the 60% recession forecast from JPMorgan Chase last week. But that's because Goldman's forecast hinges on an assumption that Trump won't allow all his threatened tariffs to kick in.
    


                    “If most of the April 9 tariffs do take effect, then the effective tariff rate will rise by an estimated 20 percentage points once those increases and likely sectoral tariffs take effect, even allowing for some country-specific agreements at a later date,” Goldman Sachs economists wrote. “If so, we expect to change our forecast to a recession.”
                





            In other words, if Trump doesn't blink, Goldman Sachs believes a recession is likely on the cards.
    


            The bank now expects the Fed to cut rates starting in June (versus July previously) followed by twice more later in the year. If a recession becomes more likely, Goldman said the Fed would likely slash interest rates by two full percentage points over the next year.
    


            After Elon Musk said he was in favor of “zero tariffs” between the United States and European Union – in opposition to policies of the US president he helped elect – Germany's economy minister said Musk was showing signs of “weakness” and “fear.”
    


            “Yes, I read what Elon Musk said,” Robert Habeck said Monday, referring to Musk's comments this weekend that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU.
    


            “I think it's a sign of weakness and maybe of fear, because the acting politics are completely different,” Habeck said as he arrived at a meeting of EU trade ministers.
    


                    “If he has something to say, he should go to his president and say, ‘Before we're talking about zero tariffs, let's stop the nonsense, the mess you have just made in the last week,'” Habeck said.
                





            “This is ridiculous, and the only interpretation I have is that he now sees that his own companies, but even the economies are going to crumble because of the mess they have made, so he's afraid,” he added, referring to Tesla's tanking stock price.
    


            Habeck called for a return to the policies of globalization that had “served all economies” around the world, and especially the US.
    


            Markets are notoriously unpredictable – it's not easy to pinpoint the mood on the Street.
    


            That's why a little over a decade ago, journalists at what was then called CNNMoney created the Fear & Greed Index — a kind of Wall Street vibe check that's been garnering extra attention in recent days as global markets have tumbled in response to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.
    


            The index is an easy-to-read barometer of investors' risk appetite on a 100-point scale, from extreme fear (0) to extreme greed (100).
    


            It was designed to give a sense of how much markets are being driven by fear (selling stocks, buying safer assets like Treasury bonds) or greed (buying stocks, loading up on risk).
    


            On Friday afternoon, in the middle of a massive global selloff, the index was at a 4, firmly in “extreme fear.”
    


            The story of the index begins in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis.
    


            “So, March 2009, the market bottoms, and there's some sense of recovery, but we were all trying to figure out how to measure where we were, beyond just the daily ups and downs” Lex Haris, former executive editor of CNNMoney, said in an interview. “And I was just very drawn to this concept of these two emotions driving the market.”
    


            When the index launched in the spring of 2012, CNNMoney's executive editor at the time, Chris Peacock, said it “captures in an eye-blink the underlying forces driving investors' money moves.”
    


            US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a colossal set of tariffs on America's trading partners is tantamount to “economic nuclear war,” according to billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president.
    


            In a post on X Sunday, Ackman said “business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets” if many of the new levies come into force on April 9. “We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,” he added in the post viewed 8.9 million times.
    


            Trump's baseline 10% tariff went into effect Saturday, while many countries are bracing for higher levies still, due to kick in Wednesday.
    


            The CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management called for a 90-day “time out” in which Trump could negotiate with trading partners and “resolve unfair asymmetric tariffs deals” and warned that “the president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe.”
    


            “This is not what we voted for,” he wrote.
    


            Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% lower on Monday, making it the worst single one-day drop since 1997, according to the index's website listing its biggest daily losses.
    


            The city's financial markets were closed on Friday for the annual Tomb Sweeping Festival.
    


            The Hang Seng index includes stocks from some of Hong Kong's and mainland China's largest listed companies, such as Alibaba, HSBC, Tencent, Meituan and Xiaomi.
    


            Chinese tech champions Alibaba and Tencent closed nearly 18% and more than 12.5% lower, respectively. Banking corporation HSBC plunged 14.8%, Chinese delivery giant Meituan plummeted 15% and consumer electronics firm Xiaomi finished down 20.6%.
    


Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, has called for swift action in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs that has caused global markets to plummet.
    


                    “The situation on the international equity and bond markets is dramatic and threatens to deteriorate further. It is therefore more urgent than ever for Germany to restore its international competitiveness as quickly as possible,” Merz told Reuters Monday.
                





                    “The issue must now be at the center of the coalition negotiations,” Merz said, referring to ongoing talks in Germany over the formation of its next government following February's election, which was won by his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
                





            As a member of the European Union, Germany has been hit by a 20% “reciprocal” tariff on all exports to the US, while its steel and auto industry faces a separate 25% tariff.
    


            Since February's election, Germany's parliament voted to cancel its historic “debt brake” – a constitutional mechanism designed to limit government borrowing. The move will enable the usually fiscally conservative country to spend hundreds of billions of euros on its infrastructure and defense.
    


            Although analysts had hailed the attempt to revive Europe's largest economy, Trump's tariffs are set to inflict further economic pain on Germany, halting its hoped-for recovery.
    


Oil prices plunged Monday, with investors worried about the economic fallout from Donald Trump's decision to impose massive tariffs on America's trading partners.
    


            Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, plunged 3.5% to trade at $63.30 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, also fell 3.5% to $59.84 by 4.16 a.m. ET. Both are trading at their lowest levels since early 2021 when the world was still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.
    


            The falls in prices come after OPEC+, the coalition of the world's top oil producers, surprised investors last week by deciding on a much bigger boost in oil supply than planned earlier: Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of the group agreed on larger production increases starting in May than previously announced.
    


            As Trump's tariffs rock global markets, countries are scrambling to negotiate concessions – but China is taking a different approach.
    


            Their message is clear: China is well prepared to weather a trade war, and come out stronger on the other side.
    


            “US tariffs will have an impact (on China), but ‘the sky won't fall,'” a commentary in the ruling Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily said Sunday.
    


            “Since the US initiated the (first) trade war in 2017 – no matter how the US fights or presses – we have continued to develop and progress, demonstrating resilience – ‘the more pressure we get, the stronger we become,'” read the commentary, which was also on the front page of the paper's Monday edition.
    


            Just 48 hours after Trump's shocking announcement, the world's second-largest economy swiftly retaliated with its own punitive measures on US goods and firms, signaling that it's prepared for the long haul.
    


            Read the full analysis here.
    


            US stock futures plunged before market open Monday after US President Donald Trump intensified his global trade war last week, prompting retaliation from China.
    


            Dow futures were 5.5% lower and S&P 500 futures 6% down at 4.01 a.m. ET. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, was set to open 5.8% lower.
    


            The massive declines in futures follow the worst two-day stretch for stocks in five years – since the pandemic.
    


            And market analysts said investors aren't done selling yet.
    


            “Last week's brutal selling pressure is set to continue on Monday, as the market is telling us that investors still lack clarity on the implications of tariffs, tariff retaliation and are worried that economic growth is likely to slow to a complete stall or recession,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research.
    


            When US President Donald Trump unveiled his “reciprocal” tariffs chart, trade economists were flummoxed.
    


            Near the top of the list was Vietnam, which had imposed a 90% average tariff on US goods, according to the chart – far higher than the actual rate.
    


            But the crude methodology used by the White House to calculate the “reciprocal” global tariffs quickly became clear, as was first pointed out by financial journalist James Surowiecki.
    


            The Trump administration used a simple formula: It took each country's trade deficit with the United States, divided it by the value of that country's exports to the US, then divided this figure by half, in a gesture of “kindness.”
    


            Let's take this step by step, using official US data.
    


                    In 2024, Vietnam sold $136.6 billion worth of goods to the US.
                





                    Because Americans want to buy things like Nike shoes a lot more than Vietnamese want to buy things like Ford cars, the US sold just $13.1 billion of goods to Vietnam that year.
                





                    This gave Vietnam a trade surplus of $123.5 billion with the US. But one man's trade surplus is another man's trade deficit – which Trump finds unpalatable, akin to being “ripped off.”
                





                    Dividing $123.5 billion (Vietnam's trade surplus) by $136.6 (Vietnam's exports) gives 0.90, or 90% when translated into tariffs. In a supposed act of “kindness,” Trump nearly halved this, meaning Vietnam will now face a tariff of 46%.
                





            And so Trump's tariffs were designed to punish countries for having trade surpluses with the US – not for imposing actual tariffs
    


            US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of selloffs that wiped away more than $5.4 trillion in market value. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under President Barack Obama, joined CNN's Jessica Dean to discuss the chaos.
    


            As White House officials offered mixed messages Sunday on whether tariffs are here to stay or a negotiating ploy, Summers wrote on X that he has “never seen as much incoherence and irrationality” from Trump administration officials.
    


                    “This Administration doesn't have a coherent message on why it's doing the largest tax increase the country's had in 50 years. Usually when you do something consequential, you have a clear rationale that's consistently delivered, and we're not getting that,” Summers said.
                





            Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs, downplaying severe market volatility.
    


            US President Donald Trump has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture.
    


            More than 50 countries – including Vietnam, India and Israel – have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs, officials said Sunday.
    


            That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”
    


            But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


                    “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,” he told Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
                





            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also could not say whether tariffs are here to stay.
    


                    “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
                





Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a key aide to US President Donald Trump, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States.
    


            Musk's comments – in a video interview Saturday with Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini – are the strongest sign of splits within the Trump administration over the president's tariff announcement that sparked a global market rout.
    


                    “At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said, in contrast to the trade policy of the US president he helped elect.
                





            Musk has seen Tesla sales plunge in recent months amid his controversial cost-cutting role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Sales fell 49% in Europe alone in the first two months of the quarter, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
    


            Musk's comments come as questions swirl about his future in the White House. Last week, Politico reported – citing MAGA insiders – that Musk had overstayed his welcome in Washington and could be ousted within weeks. The White House called the Politico report “garbage” and Musk dismissed it as “fake news.”
    


            Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by US President Donald Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs.
    


            Germany's Dax opened down 9%, while London's FTSE was about 5% lower. European markets were, on the whole, faring better than Asian markets in early trade. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.
    


            In mainland China, where markets reopened after a public holiday, the Shanghai Composite Index closed more than 7% lower. The blue-chip CSI300 index also lost about 7%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index last traded just under 12% lower. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent were each down more than 14% and 10% respectively.
    


            Trading volumes in Hong Kong surged on Monday, which she said was “a clear sign of widespread forced liquidations and what can only be described as a full-blown panic.”
    


            Asian markets are tracking the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of sell-offs that wiped away over $5.4 trillion in market value.
    


            US stocks fell sharply on Friday after China retaliated fiercely, imposing a 34% tariff on all US goods, raising fears of an escalating and damaging trade war fueled by continuing trade tension between the world's two largest economies.

            Despite his tariffs wiping away trillions from the market value of global stocks, US President Donald Trump appeared untroubled late Sunday evening.
    


            “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
    


            In his “Liberation Day” announcement last week, Trump claimed that the US has been “ripped off for more than 50 years,” saying this is “not going to happen anymore.”
    


            Although Trump's tariffs were billed as “reciprocal,” the levies were calculated to punish countries like Vietnam and Cambodia with whom the US has large trade deficits.

It's hard to say if the president truly knows what he's doing. But there is a precedent for the US causing short-term chaos and reaping long-term gain

It's less than a week since Donald Trump's sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world's trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies such as Japan and South Korea have been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit with tariffs in excess of 45%. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.

Global stock markets have tumbled as panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has already retaliated with 34% tariffs, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.

Trump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.

His Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “global economic reordering” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US's elite. Trump's new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote a lengthy paper, A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US's power as the world's largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.

After decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily from China, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world's reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.

There are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve, drove up interest rates to a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.

But by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker's “independence” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.

More decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of the US economy Volcker's interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China's extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.

Few would have bet on Volcker's world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement. The S&P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more on servicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.

Over the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that there would be no climbdown on the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US's continuing economic power. The administration has claimed 50 other countries have also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.

Perhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places.

Nearly 40 students report canceled visas over minor infractions as Trump intensifies crackdown on universities

Lisa was eating takeout at a friend's place when the email from her university landed. She clicked into her inbox and skimmed the message:

“ISS [International Student Services] is writing to inform you that your SEVIS record was terminated …”

The wording felt unfamiliar. She read it again, but it still sounded like a scam – absurd and unreal.

Lisa is an international student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, just one month away from graduation. She asked to use a pseudonym due to concerns about retaliation and an ongoing legal case.

Before going to bed, she found someone posted a similar notice on social media. It was through these posts that Lisa understood what the email had actually meant: with her Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record terminated, she was now considered out of status in the US. Staying could mean violating immigration laws.

The Department of Homeland Security maintains the Sevis database that tracks international students and scholars on F, M and J visas. Once a Sevis record is terminated, a student's legal status becomes immediately invalid. They must either leave the US within the grace period, typically 15 days, or take steps to restore their status. Otherwise, they risk deportation and future visa restrictions.

She dug through comment sections. Joined group chats. Searched for patterns. One emerged: most of the affected students had been fingerprinted. Some had been cited for non-criminal offenses, but the messages they received said they had criminal records.

That's when she remembered: a year ago, she was driving home when she got two speeding tickets: one for speeding and another for failing to stop. She hadn't seen the police car behind her until it was too late. To get the charges dismissed, she showed up in court, where she was fingerprinted.

Lisa is one of several students across states who found their legal status revoked by the US government on 4 April, without prior notice or clear explanation. University statements show that at least 39 students have been affected, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, Stanford, Ohio State, the University of Tennessee, the University of Kentucky, Minnesota State University and the University of Oregon.

An online self-reported data sheet created by affected students suggests the issue may be more widespread. Students from 50 universities reported their visas were canceled around 4 April, with many noting that they had prior records, some limited to citations or non-criminal offenses.

This secret wave of revocation came a few days after the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced the revocation of 300 or more student visas. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,” he said at a news conference on 27 March, referring to students he described as national security threats.

Lisa's university had included a screenshot of her Sevis record in the message. Termination was logged on 4 April by a system administrator, with a note: “Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”

Shenqi Cai, a California immigration attorney and managing attorney at Lashine Law, said she got the first call from a student on 3 April. “At the time, we thought it was a one-off. It seemed strange.”

But by Friday, more cases kept coming in. She contacted designated school officials at several partner universities and confirmed that the terminations were visible in the Sevis system.

Cai said this round of Sevis terminations appeared to be unprecedented. “Students weren't given any chance to explain their situation. As long as the system flagged them, what we believe is a kind of criminal screening trigger, they were terminated under one broad directive.”

Based on the information collected so far, Cai said about 90% of the affected students had been fingerprinted. But she explained that the criteria used to flag students can vary by state. “Each state defines these triggers differently. The thresholds are inconsistent. A student may be arrested in one state, but that doesn't mean they'll be convicted, because the power to decide guilt or innocence lies with the judge.”

David, a Chinese student who completed his undergraduate degree, was immediately unable to continue working. He requested a pseudonym due to fears of retaliation and an ongoing legal case.

In 2024, David was reported to police after a verbal argument with his partner. When officers arrived, they were still arguing, but there was no physical contact, he said. Because of a language barrier, his partner couldn't clearly explain what had happened. David was detained overnight and later ordered to appear in court.

“My partner wrote a statement to the prosecutor explaining it wasn't domestic violence,” he said. The charge was eventually dropped. Court records show the case was dismissed with prejudice, and the judge ordered the arrest record and biometric data to be destroyed.

Three years later, David received a Sevis termination notice.

Unlike enrolled F-1 students, David is working under Optional Practical Training, a work authorization linked to the Sevis system. Once a Sevis record is terminated, that authorization ends and is nearly impossible to recover.

David was nearing the end of his first year of employment when he got the notice on Friday. He scheduled a lunch meeting with his manager, who said the company would try to help him relocate to Canada. But because the termination took effect immediately, he was subjected to the 15-day departure rule.

“I told my family, and they felt just as powerless,” he said. “But we don't come from wealth, and there's not a lot they can do.”

Bill is facing the same dilemma. He graduated in December 2024 and is currently job-hunting. He asked not to use his real name due to a pending case.

In early 2025, Bill hit another car while making a turn. At the time, his driver's license had just expired. Police cited him for driving with an expired license. After renewing it, he followed the instructions and appeared in court.

“I went with a temporary license. The court staff were friendly,” he said. “One even joked, ‘This is no big deal, handsome,' while taking my fingerprints and photos. It felt like a scene out of a movie.”

His initial appearance only involved ID verification. When he asked if the hearing could be held that day, a staff member told him it was scheduled for May and suggested he come back then.

“I thought it was fine. My license was updated, I just had to show up again.” But on 3 April, he suddenly received a notice from the school that his Sevis record had been terminated.

Now, Bill has no idea what to do. Legally, he should leave the country immediately, but his case is still open and he's required to appear in court in May. He doesn't know whether showing up would put him at risk of detention.

On 4 April, he met with his university's international office. Staff there were willing to help, he said, but had few tools. They asked him to write a personal statement, which they promised to pass along to university leadership. The only formal support offered was a referral to a discounted lawyer – $150 an hour.

“The dust of history falls on me, and it becomes a mountain. That's all there is to it,” he said.

By Sunday evening, the panic had spread. Three hundred students joined a Zoom info session hosted by Brad Banias, a federal court immigration litigator and former justice department trial attorney. Questions poured into the chat box: “Should we leave our apartments right now in case ICE shows up?” “Will an unpaid parking ticket be a problem?”

Banias called the terminations a political move, not a legal one. “It makes me angry to see 19-year-olds just trying to study, and suddenly a parking ticket they didn't even know about shows up on a criminal background check,” he said. “Don't let them convince you it's reasonable to leave the country over a parking ticket.”

For Lisa, the future was just starting to take shape. She is about to graduate in one month, with a job offer and grad school acceptance. But now, she said she wasn't even sure if she should go to class on Monday.

Back in April 2024, she was pulled over in Madison for speeding. She hadn't noticed the patrol car behind her right away, and by the time she stopped, two officers approached. One told her not to worry – it was her first offense, and all she needed to do was pay the fine. But the other issued two citations: one for speeding, the other for failing to stop.

They told her it was just a miscommunication, something she could clear up in court.

But that never really happened.

“My first court date was just for ID,” she said. “They fingerprinted me, took a photo, measured my height. The judge barely said anything. No hearing, just a new court date.”

She asked if the case could be resolved sooner and was told to schedule an online meeting. She did. During that meeting, the case was dropped. No record. They asked if she accepted. She said yes.

Everything after that went smoothly: her work visa was approved, the company background checks cleared, and she had no trouble leaving and re-entering the country. She thought it was behind her.

Then the email came.

“I don't know if I'm still allowed to graduate,” she said. “If I don't get my degree, does the grad school still take me? Does the company push back the offer? Worst case, I don't graduate. I go home and start college again. Four more years. And then what?”

Billionaire fund manager tries to persuade US president over tariffs, which have wiped $6tn off US stocks

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

“The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out,” Ackman said on Sunday in a post on X, to resolve trade issues via negotiation.

“If, on the other hand ... we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.”

Though Trump made imposing tariffs a part of his victorious 2024 electoral campaign, which Ackman endorsed, the billionaire fund manager's X post said: “This is not what we voted for.”

Ackman's post came after Trump's tariffs wiped $6tn off US stocks. Asia and Europe's markets slumped, too.

The Trump tariffs are 10% across the board, with higher rates aimed at about 60 countries.

Late Sunday on Air Force One, Trump told reporters he had spent the weekend speaking to leaders from Europe and Asia who tried to convince him to lower his tariffs – some that are as high as 50% and are due to take effect this week.

But Trump said that those counties would need to pay “a lot of money on a yearly basis” for him to reconsider.

In his post, Ackman also said: “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.”

Staying the course would mean “heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down”, Ackman's post also said. “May cooler heads prevail.”

There were no immediate indications that pleas such as Ackman's would persuade Trump. During his Air Force One talk with reporters on Sunday, he said: “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court on Monday to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.
    


            The emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court hours before the 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline established by a lower court judge to return him to the US.
    


            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.

            The Justice Department told the Supreme Court ordering officials to return the man is “unprecedented” as it sounded now familiar themes arguing that federal courts are overstepping their power.
    


            “Even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable,” recently confirmed Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in the filing Monday. “The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.”
    


            “While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was an administrative error … that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight,” Sauer added.
    


            Abrego Garcia was in the country illegally, but an immigration judge in 2019 – after reviewing evidence – withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.”
    


            For the next six years, court records show, Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland, checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime.
    


            But Abrego Garcia wound up on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15. Several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump's invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act – an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia, the administration has said, was deported under different authorities.
    


            On Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis explained in an opinion why she had ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday.
    


            White House officials have publicly mocked the judge's order and assert they have no ability to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.
    


            “Marxist judge now thinks she's president of El Salvador,” Trump adviser Stephen Miller posted to social media on Friday.
    


            But under oath, the Justice Department has been far less clear about the removal. Pressed by Xinis last week about why the US couldn't return Abrego Garcia, DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni said he didn't have an answer.
    


            “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” Reuveni responded.
    


            The Department of Justice has since placed Reuven and his supervisor on leave.
    


            The request to the Supreme Court came minutes before a ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denying DOJ's request to lift the lower-court order.
    


            The panel rejecting the appeal was: Judge Stephanie Thacker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, and Judge Robert King, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.
    


            Thacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the “United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process.”
    


            “The Government's contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” she wrote, adding later that the “irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to Abrego Garcia every minute he is in El Salvador.”
    


            “And the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the Government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the United States,” she added.
    


            In a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning, Wilkinson said he thinks it is “legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate' the plaintiff's return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law.”
    


            “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” he continued. “Thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.”
    


            But Wilkinson said he read Xinis' order “as one requiring that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia's release, rather than demand it.” He said that reading it as a requirement for the administration “would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far.”

Economist Warwick McKibbin says ‘economic and policy flexibility' puts Australia in better position to escape fallout from Trump tariffs

A global trade war will not drive Australia's economy into recession, new Treasury modelling suggests, even as Jim Chalmers says he is realistic about “substantial” risks to growth from Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.

The treasurer sought to soothe Australians rattled by Monday's dramatic share market plunge – the worst in five years – saying the country was “better placed and better prepared” than others to weather the coming storm.

As fears grow that America will suffer a deep downturn that could reverberate around the world, Chalmers unveiled updated departmental modelling that showed the trade shock would trim just 0.1% off Australia's economic growth in 2025 and add 0.2 percentage points to inflation.

“We expect more manageable impacts on the Australian economy, but we still do expect Australian GDP to take a hit and we expect there to be an impact on prices here as well,” he said on Monday.

“I can assure people that in a world of volatility and uncertainty, Australia is better placed and better prepared than our peers.”

In contrast, the US economy would be 0.8% smaller by the start of 2027, with most of the damage in this year, the modelling showed; and Americans would suffer a 1.4 percentage-point spike in inflation this year. China would also be hit hard, with the economy 0.6% smaller than otherwise.

“This is one of the many reasons that we describe the tariff decision to be ill-considered and unwarranted,” Chalmers said.

The official modelling reflected sanguine forecasts in Treasury's pre-election budget update, which revealed no change in Australia's economic outlook since the 25 March budget.

While Australia's economy was expected to continue to grow, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) document highlighted that “the increase in tariffs announced over the past few days have been more significant than expected”.

“The potential magnitude and persistence of the economic effects of these announcements has resulted in greater-than-usual uncertainty around the outlook,” PEFO said.

Investors, however, were less assured.

The Australian dollar briefly dipped below 60 US cents on Monday, after dropping 3 US cents late last week – including its biggest single-day drop in more than 15 years.

Reflecting the potential for local fall-out from Trump's one-man war on the global trading system, financial markets were now, according to ANZ, pricing in four rate cuts over the coming four Reserve Bank board meetings.

That included the chance of a double rate cut of half a percentage point on 20 May.

As JP Morgan lifted its estimated chance of a US recession to 60%, the director of the ANU's Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis, Warwick McKibbin, agreed that Australia could navigate a worst-case trade war scenario relatively unscathed.

“While the ‘liberation day' tariffs are damaging to the world economy, Australia is impacted relatively less than other countries, except for sectors exposed to China such as mining,” McKibbin said.

“Just as Australia escaped a recession during the Asian financial crisis, Australia's economic and policy flexibility, such as the capacity of RBA to respond, puts Australia in a better position than many countries,” he said.

As China and the EU threatened to follow Canada and retaliate against Trump's so-called “reciprocal tariff”, due to kick in on 9 April, McKibbin modelled the impact of a trade war on a range of countries.

The yet-to-be-released analysis shows Australian growth would be about 0.2 percentage points lower this year under this worst-case trade scenario, before rebounding in 2026.

As in the Treasury modelling, the impact on inflation would be negligible.

McKibbin, who travelled to Washington DC to do the economic modelling for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said “the flexibility of the exchange rate and capacity to expand exports into the rest of the world minimises the losses”.

“The Australian government not responding with additional tariffs is the right response. It is better to focus on open and expanded trade with the other 80% of the world economy.”

The modelling – which reflected more of a worst-case scenario than the Treasury analysis – showed the hit to the US from a global trade shock would be severe.

Assuming the rest of the world retaliates against Trump's reciprocal tariffs, McKibbin's modelling finds American consumers will suffer a nearly 3 percentage point spike in inflation this year.

There will be a 0.6 percentage-point hit to US economic growth in 2025, extending to 1.6 percentage points next year. By that time the American economy will be 2% smaller, the analysis shows, despite a series of deep rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.

While McKibbin's modelling shows Australia escaping unscathed, preliminary modelling by KPMG showed a much larger hit to our economy from a global trade war – highlighting the inherent uncertainty in modelling.

            The start of a rugby game in France was delayed on Sunday after a parachutist became entangled in the stadium roof prior to kickoff.
    


            The parachutist was part of a pre-match ceremony that was tasked with carrying the match ball to the field ahead of the European Rugby Champions Cup game between Toulouse and English club Sale.
    


            However, after his fellow parachutists had landed safely on the pitch, one unfortunate dardevil ended up delaying the game by 40 minutes.
    


            The man, reportedly a French army parachutist, had been following his colleagues and was seen descending quickly into the stadium before getting snagged on the roof.
    


            As he dangled over the stands, stadium officials – as well as the Toulouse team mascot dressed as a lion – raced to create a makeshift crash mat by using inflatables found nearby.
    


            Eventually, footage showed fire services reaching the parachutist and bringing him down to safety on a crane, sparking huge cheers inside the Stadium de Toulouse.
    


            It appeared as though the man was unhurt from the experience, as he lapped up the reception.
    


            CNN has reached out to European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) – the governing body which organizes the European Rugby Champions Cup – and Toulouse for comment.
    


            “Following the incident at the Stadium de Toulouse, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to all involved at the stadium, both clubs and the emergency services for safely returning the parachutist to the ground,” EPCR chairman Dominic McKay said in a statement on social media Sunday.
    


            The players, who had initially returned to the dressing room, came back onto the pitch before Toulouse won 38-15. The French side will now play RC Toulon in the quarterfinals.
    


            Toulouse posted an Instagram video about the pre-match drama, joking: “We know seats are going fast but you're forcing it here.” It also thanked the emergency services for saving the day.

Wall Street swings in and out of red as turmoil from US president's assault on world trade enters second week

Extreme volatility plagued global stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as Donald Trump defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new US tariffs to medicine.

A renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.

On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped by as much as 4.1% – entering bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its most recent peak, in February – before launching an extraordinary reversal to turn positive.

While markets were fleetingly boosted after Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, signaled that Trump was open to considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries but China, the relief did not last long. By late morning, the S&P was trading down 1.4%.

As the turmoil headed into a second week, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2%.

The FTSE 100 shed 4.6% in London, after the Nikkei 225 slumped 7.8% in Tokyo.

Trump, who has previously used market rallies as a barometer of his success, tried to brush off the sell-off this weekend. “I don't want anything to go down,” the US president said on Sunday. “But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

He stood firm on Monday. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid!”

As China prepares to retaliate, Trump threatened to further increase US tariffs on the country – an additional rate of 50% – if it hits back. All talks with Beijing over potential meetings have been “terminated”, he said.

Major share indices have fallen dramatically since he unveiled his controversial plan to overhaul the US economy last week. The Trump administration imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imported goods this weekend, and is set to follow with higher tariffs on products from specific nations from Wednesday.

While senior figures in corporate America have been reluctant to criticize Trump since his inauguration in January, a handful have started to sound the alarm in recent days.

The JPMorgan Chase boss, Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, warned on Monday that Trump's tariff plan was “likely” to exacerbate inflation. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.

Dimon added: “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.”

The billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump's campaign for the presidency, has also demanded the administration reconsider its plan. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Peter Navarro, Trump's top trade adviser, insisted in a television interview on Monday morning that the market would find a bottom. Less than hour later, when New York opened for trading, the search continued.

The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite started the day down 4.3%, before briefly turning positive. By mid-morning, it was down 1%. The VIX “fear index” of volatility rose as high as 60 for the first time since August.

Oil prices also came under pressure, with Brent and WTI benchmarks stooping to their lowest levels in four years, as growing economic tensions between Washington and Beijing stoked fears that a global downturn would challenge demand.

Sir Richard Branson, co-founder of Virgin Group, argued the “predictable and preventable” market chaos would have “catastrophic” implications for people in the US and around the world, and claimed companies were already going bankrupt as a result of the weaker dollar and higher costs.

“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course,” Branson wrote on X. “Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come.”

            Two former top federal labor protection officials were reinstated to their posts Monday by the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals – at least for now – amid a lengthy legal dispute over President Donald Trump's ability to fire leaders from independent government agencies.
    


            In a 7-4 decision, the full appeals court wiped away a previous ruling from a three-judge panel that allowed Trump to fire the officials: Cathy Harris, the chairwoman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal firings and can reinstate wrongly terminated employees, and Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board.
    


            With these two officials returning to their posts, a quorum has now been restored at the NLRB and MSPB, allowing them to function at full strength and process cases involving federal employment disputes. These agencies are a critical bulwark against Trump's efforts to rapidly reduce the size of the federal workforce and fire thousands of employees.
    


            Both officials are Democrats appointed by former President Joe Biden whose statutory terms weren't set to expire for years. Federal law says they can only be dismissed for cause, but Trump is trying to fire them anyway, and the Justice Department has argued that it's unconstitutional to restrain the president's firing powers.
    


            This is not the final say in the matter, which many legal observers believe is eventually headed to the Supreme Court.
    


            The full DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday wiped away an emergency order from the three-judge panel letting Trump fire the officials while the appeals play out. But a smaller three-judge panel is still set to review the underlying merits of the case, and a hearing is scheduled for May 16.
    


            “The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,” the DC Circuit majority wrote in its ruling Monday.
    


Previous Supreme Court rulings about presidential firing powers, which the Trump administration wants to overturn, “remain good law” and are still “in place,” the judges wrote, citing earlier cases.
    


            All seven of the DC Circuit judges who supported reinstating the labor officials were appointed by Democratic presidents, and the four dissenting judges who opposed it were appointed by Republicans.
    


            CNN has reached out to the MSPB and NLRB for comment.
    


            Both women challenged their firings in court, and trial judges concluded that their terminations were unlawful. The Justice Department then appealed those decisions and later secured a court order letting Trump fire the officials on a temporary basis while the appealed played out. That temporary order was vacated Monday, reinstating the officials.

Combatants' testimonies describe how areas were destroyed to create ‘a death zone of enormous proportions' 

Israel's military razed huge swathes of land inside the perimeter of Gaza and ordered troops to turn the area into a “kill zone” where anybody who entered was a target, according to testimony by soldiers who carried out the plan.

Israeli combatants said they were ordered to destroy homes, factories and farmland roughly 1km (0.6 miles) inside the perimeter of Gaza to make a “buffer zone”, with one describing the area as looking like Hiroshima.

The testimonies are some of the first accounts by Israeli soldiers to be published since the latest war started in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israel. They were collected by Breaking the Silence, a group founded in 2004 by Israeli veterans who aim to expose the reality of the military's grip over Palestinians. The Guardian interviewed four of the soldiers who corroborated the accounts.

Titled “The Perimeter” and published on Monday, the report said the stated purpose of the plan was to create a thick strip of land that provided a clear line of sight for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to identify and kill militants. “This space was to have no crops, structures, or people. Almost every object, infrastructure installation, and structure within the perimeter was demolished,” it said.

Soldiers were “given orders to deliberately, methodically, and systematically annihilate whatever was within the designated perimeter, including entire residential neighbourhoods, public buildings, educational institutions, mosques, and cemeteries, with very few exceptions”, the report added.

The ultimate result, however, was the creation of “a death zone of enormous proportions”, the report said. “Places where people had lived, farmed, and established industry were transformed into a vast wasteland, a strip of land eradicated in its entirety.”

It stretches along the frontier with Israel, from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the strip's south-east corner next to Egypt.

A sergeant in the combat engineers corps said that once an area in the perimeter “was pretty much empty of any Gazans, we essentially started getting missions that were about basically blowing up houses or what was left of the houses”.

This was the routine, they said: “Get up in the morning, each platoon gets five, six, or seven locations, seven houses that they're supposed to work on. We didn't know a lot about the places that we were destroying or why we were doing it. I guess those things today, from my perspective now, are not legitimate. What I saw there, as far as I can judge, was beyond what I can justify that was needed.”

Some soldiers testified that commanders viewed the destruction as a way of exacting revenge for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which sparked the current war when Palestinian militants killed hundreds and kidnapped Israeli and foreign citizens.

While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is fighting allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”.

The IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the report and combatants' accounts.

One of the soldiers who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity said their unit was told to shoot anyone in the perimeter area on sight. The mentality in their unit, they said, was that there was no such thing as a “civilian” and everyone who walked into the perimeter would be considered a “terrorist”.

Rules on who can be killed on sight appeared to vary for different units, according to the accounts.

A sergeant in the armoured corps said that in 2024 he was given “shoot to kill” orders for any male adult who entered the perimeter. “For women and children, [the order was] ‘shoot to drive away', and if they come close to the fence, you stop [them]. You don't kill women, children, or the elderly. ‘Shoot to drive away' means a tank fire,” he said.

But a captain in an armoured corps unit who operated in Gaza earlier in the war, in November 2023, described the border area as a “kill zone”, saying: “The borderline is a kill zone. Anyone who crosses a certain line, that we have defined, is considered a threat and is sentenced to death.”

Another captain said there were “no clear rules of engagement at any point” and described a “generally massive use of firepower, especially, like with tanks”. They added: “There was a lot of instigating fire for the sake of instigating fire, somewhere between [wanting to produce] a psychological effect and just for no reason.

“[We] set out on this war out of insult, out of pain, out of anger, out of the sense that we had to succeed. This distinction [between civilians and terrorist infrastructure], it didn't matter. Nobody cared. We decided on a line … past which everyone is a suspect.”

How Palestinians would know they were crossing an invisible line was not made clear to them, the soldiers said. “How they know is a really good question. Enough people died or got injured crossing that line, so they don't go near it.”

Before the latest war, Israel had previously established a buffer zone inside Gaza that extended to 300 metres, but the new one was intended to range from 800 to 1,500 metres, according to the testimonies.

Satellite imagery has previously revealed the IDF destroyed hundreds of buildings that stood within 1km to 1.2km of the perimeter fence, in a systematic demolishing act that rights groups say may constitute collective punishment and should be investigated as a war crime. Last week, Israel's defence minister said the military would seize “large areas” in Gaza in a fresh offensive.

The perimeter accounts for just over 15% of the Gaza Strip, which is entirely off-limits to Palestinian residents. It represents 35% of the strip's entire agricultural land, according to the report.

Despite shoot-to-kill orders, a warrant officer stationed in northern Gaza said Palestinians kept going back to the area “again and again after we fired at them”.

The officer said the Palestinians appeared to want to pick edible plants growing in the area. “There was hubeiza [mallow] there because no one went near there. People are hungry, so they come with bags to pick hubeiza, I think.”

Some got away with their food and their lives, the officer said. “The thing is that, at that point, the IDF really is fulfilling the public's wishes, which state: ‘There are no innocents in Gaza'.”

In an interview with the Guardian, the same officer said the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 made many Israelis feel the “need to pick up a gun”.

“A lot of us went there, I went there, because they killed us and now we're going to kill them,” they said. “And I found out that we're not only killing them – we're killing them, we're killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs. We're destroying their houses and pissing on their graves.”

            Nintendo found what works — and it's not turning back.
    


            That's the impression the company gave last week when it introduced the Switch 2, which launches June 5 and costs $450 — substantially more than its $300 predecessor.
    


            Nintendo's next-generation console is a significantly upgraded version of its popular gaming device from eight years ago, a testament to the Switch's popularity but also a gamble that its success will endure for the better part of the next decade. While the 2017-era Switch introduced gamers to the concept of a home console that also serves as a portable game machine, the Switch 2 doubles down on that idea — amid growing competition from PC rivals like Valve and Lenovo that have emerged over the last three years.
    


            Nintendo is also launching its most important product in years at what may be the worst time — just before President Donald Trump introduced a slew of tariffs on foreign goods, which heavily target Asia, where many tech supply chains are based. As a result, the gaming giant on Friday postponed its April 9 US preorder date to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”
    


            “As you look at the prices that were announced … they factored in previous tariffs and how they had been administered, and where they had been administered,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CNN ahead of the company's decision to delay US preorders. “… We're currently actively assessing what steps we may need to take, and what may be next.”
    


            Sticking with the same formula is a bold move for Nintendo, which rarely does the same thing twice. But if you ask Bowser, the Switch 2 continues what could be a long line of Nintendo devices that mix stationary and mobile gaming.
    


            “We do believe that this idea of having a singular device that you can play as a handheld on the go, that you can set up in tabletop … and play with a friend, or that you can dock at home and play as a console-like device — we think that resonates with players,” he said when asked whether Nintendo would consider a new style of device in the future.
    


            The Switch 2 is entering a much more competitive environment than its predecessor did in 2017. Just about every major gaming brand has introduced a handheld console, with Valve's Steam Deck being the most popular.
    


            The Steam Deck launched in 2022 as an answer to the Switch for PC gamers, allowing players to access their library of computer games on a dedicated mobile gaming device rather than a laptop or desktop. Since the Steam Deck's launch, a handful of other computing giants, such as Asus, Lenovo and Logitech, have introduced their own handheld game machines.
    


            Valve — also known as the developer of Team Fortress, Dota and other popular video games — is the leader among these PC rivals with 48% of the PC handheld market in 2024, according to the Verge, citing data from the International Data Corporation.
    


            Still, those statistics indicate the market is far behind Nintendo, with just under 6 million units shipped compared to the 150 million Switches that have been sold thus far. Nintendo sold 15.7 million hardware units in its fiscal year that ended in March 2024 alone, according to its earnings statement.
    


            It's an indication that Nintendo is onto something — and one of its biggest rivals has taken notice, too.
    


            Sony launched the PlayStation Portal in 2023, a handheld device that can stream games from a PlayStation 5, so that gamers don't have to hog the living room TV when playing. Microsoft, meanwhile, has pushed the idea that any device can be “an Xbox” by streaming games from its cloud service.
    


            With the Switch 2, Nintendo is bridging some of the gaps between its older handheld console and its competition. It has more powerful hardware, including more storage, 4K support, a larger screen and an improved cooling system. Plus, the new Joy-Con controllers can be used like a computer mouse, perhaps another indication that Nintendo is looking to woo the computer gaming crowd.
    


            “While the form factor is the same, everything inside has completely been either upgraded or enhanced or is new,” Bowser said.
    


            However, hardware is only half the story. Nintendo is best known for its universe of exclusive games and iconic characters, from Mario to Zelda and Kirby. But it's making a much bigger push into third-party software with the Switch 2, as evidenced by the slew of popular titles — such as Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077 — showcased during Nintendo's presentation last week.
    


            That could potentially prevent consumers from having to choose between a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, the latter of which typically offers a much wider variety of non-Nintendo games.
    


            “It's about appealing to the broadest set of players that we possibly can,” Bowser said when asked whether the focus on third-party titles was intended to court Steam Deck fans.
    


            In addition to its hardware and software, the Switch 2's higher price also puts it in closer competition than ever before with rivals from Sony, Microsoft and Valve, among others. The Switch 2 starts at $450, while Sony and Microsoft offer certain editions of their PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles for $400 and $450, respectively. The Steam Deck starts at $399.
    


            Games are also seemingly getting a price hike, with Mario Kart World costing a whopping $80.
    


            The higher price arrives in a challenging economy in which consumers are struggling to afford everyday items, let alone game consoles and more competition. But Nintendo is banking on its signature charm and quirkiness to distinguish the Switch 2 as a worthwhile investment.
    


            For example, one of the Switch 2's hallmark new features is a social system called GameChat, through which players can share their screen while chatting and use dedicated camera to see each other while playing.
    


            Nintendo is also experimenting with new ways to use the Joy-Con controllers, such as by dragging them across a surface to move characters on screen.
    


            And then of course, there's Mario. Nintendo didn't reveal a new mainline Mario title during its Switch 2 announcement, but Bowser hinted that it may only be a matter of time.
    


            “Stay tuned,” he said. “You know, we have a long, long catalog, and a long list of (intellectual property) that I'm sure will make its way to the platform.”

Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan echo president and key ally as experts express fears for ‘bedrock constitutional principles'

As Donald Trump and Elon Musk widen their radical attacks on US judges who have stalled some of Trump's executive orders and Musk's slashing of federal agencies, they're gaining backing from top House Republicans and other politicians, including some to whom the tech billionaire made big campaign donations.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump's attacks on judges, and a judiciary subcommittee hearing on 1 April explored “judicial overreach” and ways to curb judges who have stymied some Trump orders or Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and its draconian cuts to the federal government.

Veteran Republican consultants say the hefty campaign-spending muscle of Musk, the world's richest person, who spent about $300m helping Trump win last year, is likely to boost many Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.

“Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Musk to make a lot of donations to them in 2026,” said longtime Republican consultant Charlie Black. “But it's likely that such donations will be coordinated with the president's preferences.”

The verbal assaults on judges by Trump and his allies have been fueled by multiple rulings adverse to some Trump executive orders, including major court decisions in March that sought to halt deporting Venezuelan immigrants and blocking penalizing law firms that Trump deemed political enemies.

Washington DC judge James Boasberg incurred Trump's wrath for trying to halt the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison with a nationwide injunction challenging the tenuous legal basis for the administration action. Boasberg's ruling spurred Trump to falsely label him a “radical left lunatic”, urge his impeachment, and then call for him to be disbarred.

Musk has repeatedly used X, the social media platform he owns and on which he has over 200 million followers, to urge impeaching judges whose rulings he doesn't like. “The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,” he said on 25 February.

Legal scholars say Trump and Musk's radical threats of impeachment or disbarment for judicial rulings that stall or block administration moves undermine the rule of law.

“Trump and Musk are playing with fire,” said retired Massachusetts judge Nancy Gertner, who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “They're undermining bedrock constitutional principles.”

She added: “You can't shut down a court just because you disagree. The judges have done nothing wrong or inconsistent with their oaths, and nothing outside their judicial roles.”

Trump's call for impeaching Boasberg drew a sharp and broad rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who last month said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.

Further, contrary to Trump's baseless charges against Boasberg, the judge's rulings have hardly been one-sided. One example: Boasberg sided with Trump in 2017 to stop the IRS from sharing his tax returns which a long-shot lawsuit sought.

Besides Boasberg, three other Washington DC judges last month ruled against Trump executive orders targeting law firms he viewed as political foes for retribution, which the judges argued were on dangerous or dubious legal ground.

Among other things, the Trump orders seek to take away security clearances for some of the law firms and sharply curtail their government business.

To ratchet up pressures on judges, after judge Beryl Howell issued a decision in March to temporarily block Trump from penalizing the law firm Perkins Coie, the justice department, in a rare move, tried to have Howell removed from the case, alleging she was biased.

In a blistering response, Howell wrote: “This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented.”

Two other DC judges in March backed law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which sued the administration on first amendment grounds to block executive orders aimed at hurting the firms financially for their separate ties to key lawyers who led a special counsel inquiry into how Russia worked to help elect Trump in 2016.

Judge John Bates, an appointee of George W Bush who issued a restraining order blocking Trump's sanctions against Jenner & Block, called Trump's punitive move “disturbing” and “troubling”, noting the order targets the firm's and its lawyers' rights under the first amendment, and due process.

Legal scholars and former judges are raising alarms about the rising dangers to the rule of law and the physical safety of judges sparked by the attacks from Trump and his congressional allies.

“While the threats to impeach federal judges based on their decisions are largely performative, they are also designed to foment disrespect for the judiciary and the rule of law,” said former federal judge John Jones, who is now the president of Dickinson College.

“In addition, many of the calls for impeachment are accompanied by the unconscionable disclosure of personal information about individual judges that jeopardize the personal safety of those judges and their family members.”

Other legal experts worry that Trump's judicial attacks, which some congressional allies are parroting even though the odds of impeaching judges are long, could spark violence.

“The real risk comes not from Congress, but the fringe elements in Trump's camp, who might be stirred up to threaten or actually inflict harm on the targeted judges,” said former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman.

“Judges are rightly worried about their safety, and the measures in place to protect them may prove inadequate if the dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from the Trump camp continues.”

Despite such fears, many of Trump's hardcore loyalists in Congress are jumping on board to further fuel Trump's attacks on judges, while benefiting from Musk's campaign largesse.

At least seven Republican members, including Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Brandon Gill of Texas, who echoed Trump's call for impeaching Judge Boasberg, or advocated other “action” against judges who ruled against Trump orders, received checks from Musk for $6,600, the maximum he could donate.

Although Republican leaders have suggested that impeachment of judges won't happen because they don't have the votes, their public efforts to bolster Trump's war on judicial independence has been accelerating, with allies exploring other avenues to curb judges.

Johnson turned up the heat on judges on 25 March when he vowed that “desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act”. One option eyed by Trump's Republican allies came up at a judiciary subcommittee hearing last week that focused on banning nationwide injunctions by judges. A House bill to ban such injunctions is expected to pass in coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Charles Grassley, the senator who leads his chamber's judiciary committee and has received a donation from Musk, held a hearing that also explored bans on nationwide injunctions by judges; Grassley in March introduced a bill that would end the “practice of universal injunctions”, but Senate passage is deemed a long shot.

Some former Republican congressmen are highly critical of Trump's congressional allies for amplifying his attacks on judges, and predict that the House GOP will try to “monetize” Trump's fury at a growing number of judges.

“The investigation into judges by Chairman Jordan, and calls by Gill and Ogles for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against Trump, are more examples of blind loyalty to Trump by a bunch of sycophants,” said former Michigan member Dave Trott.

“It would not be such a big deal except for the fact that their conduct is helping create a crisis involving the constitution they swore to uphold.”

Trott added: “And just in case these sycophants suddenly decide to stand up to Trump, Elon is using his billions to help Republicans get re-elected. This will ensure the GOP stays in line. The concentration of great wealth and power is a problem that will have serious consequences for our country.”

Other ex-Republican members voice similar concerns.

“I think this is a talking point and a fundraising tool,' said Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, adding that members will attack judges for “impeding Trump's agenda, and they'll try to monetize it for campaign purposes”.

Some former prosecutors say the judicial attacks by Trump and his GOP allies jibe with Trump's broader blitz to expand his powers

“Trump has, believe it or not, a strategic plan to disable all opposition,” said former prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig.

Part of that plan “involves eliminating internal oversight, like inspectors general, and cowing external opposition, by threatening law firms. The final piece is to eliminate the last independent check on his authority – judges. To do this he is falsely accusing them of bias and enlisting his sycophantic supporters, like Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, in the effort.”

            The CIA is reviewing its authorities to use lethal force against drug cartels in Mexico and beyond as the Trump administration moves to make taking on the cartels a major priority for the intelligence agency, according to a US official and three people briefed on the matter.
    


            The review does not indicate President Donald Trump has ordered the CIA to take direct action against the cartels. But it is designed to help the agency understand what kinds of activities it could legally undertake and what the potential risks would be across the suite of options, the sources said — underscoring how seriously the Trump administration is considering the possibility.
    


            It also highlights some US officials' concerns that using traditional counterterrorism tools against cartels — as the Trump administration has said it intends to do — carries a much higher risk of collateral damage to American citizens than similar operations conducted in the Middle East, far from US soil.

            Among the issues agency lawyers are examining is the CIA's and its officers' liability if an American is accidentally killed in any operation, according to one of the people briefed.
    


            Agency officials are “cautious” about using “assets traditionally going after what were seen as military targets now being employed against cartel targets,” the US official said.
    


            The Trump administration earlier this year designated a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations — a maneuver some current and former US officials believe is designed to build a predicate for lethal action — and the CIA is already flying surveillance drones that are capable of being armed over Mexico.
    


            The CIA declined to comment.
    


            CNN was not able to determine whether the effort was ordered by the White House or CIA Director John Ratcliffe, or whether it was undertaken as a prudent planning measure by agency staff in response to clear signals from the Trump administration that it wants national security agencies to ramp up pressure on the cartels.
    


            “If any administration is pushing us to do something that has potential significant adverse ramifications for the agency, [the CIA] is going to want to double and triple check: ‘Is it legal?' and ‘Do we have extraordinarily clear policy direction to do what we're going to do?'” said one former CIA official with experience building this kind of review.
    


            “Just because something is legal under [the law of armed conflict] doesn't mean it's something you should do,” this person said, referring to protocols regulating the conduct of states during war. “There's an ethical component. There's a practical component. There's a pragmatic component.” 



            The CIA has the legal authority to either conduct lethal strikes itself or provide targeting information or other support to another nation to carry out a lethal strike, as long as it's properly authorized by the president and abides by the interlocking constellation of US laws and regulations that govern armed conflict.
    


            But to do so against cartel actors in an area where there are, comparatively, far more US-born citizens and green card holders — people who might have the standing to sue the US government if they are harmed — is novel for the CIA.
    


            “It's not a question of whether they can or cannot use lethal force. They can,” said one of the people briefed on the review. “It's more about the implications of Americans being potentially injured or killed based on their broader presence in the space.”
    


            Collateral damage could also blow back on any partner nation that either allows the CIA to conduct direct action inside its borders or that accepts intelligence support from the agency to conduct its own lethal operations, the US official noted. If the CIA support creates a political problem for the partner nation — Mexico, for example — its government could refuse to allow the agency to operate there going forward.
    


            Former officials have also warned about the risks of retaliation by cartels, some of which maintain a presence inside the United States.
    


            “Mexican cartels are not merely criminal organizations; they operate as paramilitary entities with deep financial resources, global supply chains, and sophisticated logistical networks that extend into the United States,” Doug Livermore, a specialist in irregular warfare and a former Defense Department official, wrote in a recent study for the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank. “Cartels are highly likely to retaliate” and “possess a substantial capacity for terrorism that, when coupled with their established presence within the United States, could escalate conflict.”
    


            One of the people briefed on the review said it reflected a deep institutional memory of the George W. Bush administration's “enhanced interrogation” program, which lawmakers and the Obama administration subsequently deemed to be torture. In that instance, former officials said, the agency pushed its operations to the limit of what they believed the law could bear. Critics, of course, contend the agency and the administration went beyond what was legal, and in the years following, the CIA and its officers were put through a series of public and high-profile investigations into the propriety of their actions.
    


            This sort of review, the people briefed on the matter said, reflects an understanding that the agency may be called to account for any action it takes against cartels — especially if there is blowback. And especially if the agency conducts operations that are ultimately seen as disproportionate to the threat from cartels — key criteria that lethal action must meet under the law of armed conflict.
    


            The US intelligence community's annual threat assessment, published last month, led with the threat from drug cartels for apparently the first time in the report's nearly 20-year history. Many current and former national security officials, however, have repeatedly argued that while cartels are a serious problem, they are not an existential threat to the country.
    


            “I think it's very understandable that people are mindful of [the history of “enhanced interrogation”] to the extent that they actually don't believe we're in a crisis,” said one of the former officials.

Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian-American teenager and wounded two others in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night, according to Palestinian officials, after the Israeli military said it targeted a group throwing stones at cars.
    


            Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam said the 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot dead by Israeli troops in the village of Turmusaya. Two other Palestinian-American boys, ages 14 and 15, were injured in the incident, according to the mayor of Turmusaya, Lafi Shalabi.
    


            The Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire during a counterterrorism operation in Turmusaya when they saw three “terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.”
    


            The soldiers killed one and hit the other two, the military said.
    


            The military shared a blurry video purportedly showing the incident, in which three figures are seen. At the end of the short clip, one of the figures appears to hurl an object. The Israeli military said it would continue operating in the West Bank “to protect the residents in the area.”
    


            The injured boys were shot in the abdomen, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
    


            One severely injured boy and another with minor wounds were taken to a hospital in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said.
    


            The killing of a Palestinian-American teenager came just hours before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in the United States to meet President Donald Trump. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
    


            The killing or detention of American citizens in occupied Palestinian territories by Israelis and concerns about a lack of accountability date back years. In 2003, American activist Rachel Corrie, 23, was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer while trying to block it from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Nine years later, an Israeli civil court ruled her death an accident.
    


            In spring 2022, prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while reporting in the West Bank. That November, Defense Minister Benny Gantz confirmed that Israel would not cooperate with a US probe into her death. A CNN investigation suggested that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces, despite wearing a vest marked “Press.”
    


            In February last year, Florida-born US citizen Mohammed Khdour, 17, was killed by Israeli forces who shot him in the head while he was in his car. The teenager was taking the car out during a study break, snacking on chocolate waffles, posing for Instagram.

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) referred questions about Khdour's case to the Israeli Security Agency, known as the Shin Bet, which did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Three weeks before Khdour's death, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old Palestinian-American who grew up in Louisiana, was also shot in the head by apparent Israeli gunmen. The IDF told CNN they received a report that an off-duty police officer and an Israeli civilian shot at a Palestinian “suspected of throwing stones” – which his family vehemently denied – and that the Israeli Police were investigating the shooting.
    


            Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank have intensified since late January following the launch of an expanded military campaign there almost immediately after the Gaza ceasefire began. Since then, roughly 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes.
    


            The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, but Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner consistent with collective punishment. In late February, Israel deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.

Transport secretary says overhaul in response to Trump tariffs supports car firms and climate goals

Labour's changes to electric vehicle (EV) rules in response to Donald Trump's tariffs will have a negligible impact on emissions, the transport secretary has said.

Keir Starmer has confirmed plans to boost manufacturers, including reinstating the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.

But regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will also be altered, to help companies in the transition, and new hybrids will be on the market for a further five years.

Heidi Alexander said the taxes on imports announced by the US president last week, which spurred reciprocal action by some affected countries, “are bad news for the global economy, because it's bad for global demand, it's bad for prices and it's bad for consumers”.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast about the impact on carbon emissions of the government's changes to electric vehicle rules, she said: “The changes we are making have been very carefully calibrated so as not to have a big impact upon the carbon emissions savings that are baked into this policy. In fact, the impact on carbon emissions as a result of these changes is negligible.”

Under the measures, luxury supercar companies such as Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond 2030 because they manufacture only a small number of vehicles a year.

New hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars will be allowed to be sold until 2035. Petrol and diesel vans will be able to be sold until 2035, as well as all hybrid models.

The Green party MP Siân Berry said: “The government is wrong to apply the brakes on the sale of EV cars.

“This is just the latest in a series of boosts the Labour government has given fossil fuel industries. We've also seen the green light being given to airport expansion and a new road tunnel under the Thames.

“This suggests Labour is weakening its climate commitments, and its health-related policy goals because all these moves will have a detrimental impact on air quality.

“Slowing down the move away from fossil-fuelled transport makes no economic sense either, since green sectors of the economy are growing three times faster than the overall UK economy.”

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “In weakening the mandate elsewhere by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of standard hybrids between 2030 and 2035, the government risks reducing the competition it has stimulated between manufacturers, meaning prices for families seeking an EV might not fall as fast, and sales could slow.

“The growth of the secondhand EV market, where most of us buy our cars, would in turn be stunted, leaving millions of families stuck in petrol and hybrid cars paying a petrol premium of hundreds, and even thousands, of pounds a year.”

Alexander said the government had “struck the right balance” between protecting British businesses and cutting carbon emissions.

Asked if the retention of a 2030 target for the phasing out of all pure petrol and diesel cars would restrict free markets at a time when the car industry was on its knees, she said: “It is an opportunity for the car industry to remain at the cutting edge of the transition to EVs, but it's right that we're pragmatic.

“It's right that we are looking at how we can be flexible in the way in which car manufacturers make this transition, because we want cheaper EVs to be available for consumers. We want people to be able to benefit from those lower running costs as well.

“And so it's important that, as a government, we do everything that we can – not only to support British businesses and manufacturing to grow the economy, but also to cut those carbon emissions, and I think we've struck the right balance in the package that we're announcing today.”

Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if Starmer was prepared to use the relationship he has built with Trump to ask him to change course, she said: “Obviously when the prime minister has discussions internationally with allies he will be honest about what is in the best interests of the British people.”

Challenged that the EV measures were planned before the announcement of the tariffs and were a tweak to policy rather than dramatic change, she told Today: “These are significant changes to the car industry. You are right to say we started the consultation on Christmas Eve and that we closed the consultation in the middle of February.”

She said Trump's imposition of tariffs meant the UK government had to look at its EV plans with “renewed urgency”.

The value of one Australian dollar dropped to a low of 59.64 US cents, its lowest point since April 2020

Consumers and travellers will face higher prices after the Australian dollar fell to Covid-era lows, as markets reel from Donald Trump's “liberation day” tariff plan.

Fears of a global recession dragged the Australian dollar sharply lower on Monday against the country's major trade partners and to its lowest point against the Euro, pound and US dollar since 2020.

A lower Australian dollar will translate to higher prices for customers buying overseas goods, even if prices settle in coming weeks, according to Kelly Slessor, an e-commerce expert.

“The cost of a dress or something overseas yesterday is significantly more expensive today, [especially] if you're buying it from the US,” she said.

“Temu, Shein and stuff like that will probably hold for a little while but their prices may go up over the next couple of weeks.”

The value of one Australian dollar fell to a low of US59.64c, its lowest point since April 2020, on Monday. This was down more than 6% on last week's 64c level before Trump's tariffs were unveiled.

While Australians import goods from all over the world, the prominence of the US dollar could make it hard to avoid higher prices, according to Mark Baartse, a retail consultant.

“A lot of transactions are pegged to US dollars, regardless of where you buy from,” he said.

Shoppers could turn to local Australian businesses or make their purchases sooner before trade-exposed businesses hike their prices, Baartse said.

Overseas travel will also be more expensive after the Australian dollar lost value in top destinations including New Zealand, Indonesia and India.

Nearly a million Australians travelled to Japan in 2024, helped by a strong exchange rate of over 100 yen to the dollar, but Monday's sell-off resulted in it falling below 90 yen for the first time since 2023.

The Australian dollar's value is tied to demand for commodities such as iron ore, which would suffer if economic activity slowed around the world, and especially in China, as a result of a global trade war.

My Bui, an economist at AMP, said investors bought the Australian dollar when they expected a global boom and sold it when they feared a crash.

“When there is concern about a global slowdown, and particularly from the tariff and global trade war, then there is less demand for our commodities,” Bui said.

Other global currencies were performing better against the US dollar as markets placed bets on where Trump's tariff regime would have the heaviest impact.

The Euro and Japanese yen rose against the US dollar, while India and South Korea suffered falls.

Australian markets have grown increasingly fearful of a global recession, with the share market shedding $160bn in value early on Monday as China and the European union make plans to retaliate against US tariffs.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič says bloc in a ‘tough spot' with 70% of exports being subjected to tariffs 

Šefčovič says the EU is “in early stages of discussions” with the US, complicated “because the US view tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure.”

But he says that “ while the EU remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not weigh endlessly until we see tangible progress.”

The EU has prepared a “robust list of countermeasures” on steel and aluminium after receiving feedback from over 600 stakeholders.

“After carefully reviewing all of it, we have worked to table a robust list of countermeasures, while balancing the burden across all member states, we will be sending the final list and tariff levels to them later today,

The vote is set for 9 April, with the final list adopted on 15 April, and then duties on products will kick in on that day for the first set of measures, and on 15 May for the remaining ones.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said the EU-US trade was “in a tough stop” but he hoped the EU and EU would “sooner or later” end up at a negotiation table, as he hoped for a negotiated solution to prolonging uncertainty surrounding US president Donald Trump's tariffs (16:18).

But the Slovak politician admitted that “until now, despite of efforts … we haven't seen the real engagement which would lead to the mutually acceptable solution” from the US side (16:12), as he warned that the Trump administration seemed to be determined to send an ideological signal to markets (16:30).

Šefčovič also spoke about a “clear difference of opinion” on figures in EU-US trade, arguing it it is wrong to look at trade in goods in isolation, without services, mutual investment, and other instruments.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen earlier said that “Europe is always ready for good deal,” but signaled the bloc was “also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests” (15:00).

Outgoing German economy minister Robert Habeck offered a brutal takedown of the US tariffs, saying the underlying calculations were “nonsense,” and “wrong,” as he urged US to “stop the nonsense … the mess you have made in the last week” (11:12).

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

British prime minister Keir Starmer spoke about US tariffs this afternoon too, warning that global consequences of Trump's move “could be profound.”

Nobody is pretending that tariffs are good news. You know that better than anyone – 25% tariffs on automotive exports and 10% on other goods, that is a huge challenge for our future, and the global economic consequences could be profound.

Starmer said we live in a new era, where the old assumptions don't apply any more, that he calls the age of insecurity.

For more on his comments and the UK's plans, see Andrew Sparrow's UK live blog here:

In response to the final question of the conference, Šefčovič says the EU and the US have “a clear difference of opinion” about the figures as he says it is wrong to look at trade in goods in isolation, without services, mutual investment, and other instruments.

In a hint at a potential US vulnerability, he adds: “I'm not even going into the direction of billions the US companies are generating from online advertising and different digital services that they're offering in Europe.”

He eventually says that the actual deficit that would need rebalancing is not higher than 50 billion euros.

“If we know that this is the issue, I think then we can sort it out very quickly. 

But my feeling is that at this stage it is more of a, I would say, decision of US administration to … transform the global trading system, and they see the tariffs as a corrective measures for many of the political goals, which I'm sure the US administration can describe much better, much better than I [can.”

They conclude the press conference here.

Šefčovič says he sees today's market reactions as “a kind of black day for the markets … all over the world,” saying ministers described it “as the most important paradigm shift in global trading patterns since the second world war.”

“This introduces a lot of uncertainty, lack of predictability, inflation fears and the fact that tariffs are, in the end, the taxes which will be paid by the businesses, but especially by the final consumers,” he says.

He says the tariffs prompted fears among consumers on spending, inflation, jobs, and future prospects.

“So these are the I would say the debates which are now taking place, I would say all across the world … and I'm not even going to tell you [about] the distressed phone calls we are getting from emerging economies and from the developing countries,” he says.

He repeats that the EU will be “careful” and respond in a “measured and well calibrated way.”

“We know what kind of impact this might have on the real economy and on the people, and therefore you see that we are really progressing step by step in this regard. 

But I wouldn't dare to speculate if it would have an impact on decision making across the Atlantic.”

On a slightly more upbeat note, Šefčovič says that he hopes that “sooner or later, we'll be sitting at the negotiating table … and I hope that we'll be able to arrive at the mutually acceptable compromise, which would restore our close trading relationship.”

He says the focus in any such talks would be on “looking at the ways how to lower or get rid of the tariffs … on cars and industrial goods in February, and we would focus our efforts on that effort, how to create this transatlantic marketplace for industrial goods, for the technologies of the future and for the good cooperation between two transatlantic allies.”

Šefčovič says the EU remains “prepared to engage” and says the bloc's preference would be to find a negotiated solution.

But he then says that “until now, despite of efforts … , we haven't seen the real engagement which would lead to the mutually acceptable solution, because it has to be fair for both sides.”

He says that there are questions from the US on VAT – which was repeatedly criticised by Trump – but he says the EU would not be prepared to change its rules.

He then adds that:

“We are ready to discuss, to look at things, but it has to be a mutually advantageous solution.”

EU trade commissioner Šefčovič says the EU's timeline on countermeasures on steel and aluminium is driven by legal analysis.

But he adds “it is not possible now to delay the entry into force” as some countries, such as Italy, appeared to be asking for it.

“We expect the vote on Wednesday and if the vote is positive, then we will proceed with 15 April,” he says.

More broadly, he says “we are ready to consider all options.”

“All options are on the table, and we will consult with the stakeholders and with our member states, how to use all the instruments we have at our disposal,” he says.

Šefčovič gets asked about the proposed “zero-for-zero” tariff deal with the US, and the reception it got from the US.

The Slovak politician says it was floated in his first meeting with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

He says the US focus appears to be on “Big Five” areas: cars, pharmaceutical, metals, lumber and semiconductors.

Šefčovič says the EU was ready to change rules on personal vehicles and find a deal, with a “zero-for-zero” deal, and potentially extending it to other industrial products.

“I hope that in future we would be ready to come back to this discussion, not now. [but] I believe that in the future this would be still the possibility,” he says.

Šefčovič says that while the focus so far has been on finalising steel and aluminium countermeasures, the announcement of the new “so-called reciprocal tariffs … forces us to look at additional steps.”

“We got some valuable input from the member states, from the ministers, which we of course, evaluate, and we will proceed, as always, in the close consultations with our member states and with the key stakeholders,” he says.

Šefčovič says the EU is “in early stages of discussions” with the US, complicated “because the US view tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure.”

But he says that “ while the EU remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not weigh endlessly until we see tangible progress.”

The EU has prepared a “robust list of countermeasures” on steel and aluminium after receiving feedback from over 600 stakeholders.

“After carefully reviewing all of it, we have worked to table a robust list of countermeasures, while balancing the burden across all member states, we will be sending the final list and tariff levels to them later today,

The vote is set for 9 April, with the final list adopted on 15 April, and then duties on products will kick in on that day for the first set of measures, and on 15 May for the remaining ones.”

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič says that the EU's trade situation with the US is “in a tough spot.”

He says that “70% of our total exports are facing tariffs of 20% of 25% or even higher.”

He acknowledges recent meetings with his US counterparts, as he says the two sides agree that “the EU-US trade relationship could benefit from a fresh look and a boost in strategic areas,” noting both markets “face similar challenges.”

He repeats von der Leyen's comment from last half hour that the EU “we have offered zero for zero tariffs for cars and all industrial goods.”

Opening the briefing after the ministerial council on trade, Polish deputy economy minister Michał Baranowski says “the message that came out from the council is very much a message of unity.”

“It's very clear that there are no winners, and this was something that was emphasised by all the member states. All of us would prefer a negotiated solution that takes us away from the potential trade war that can lead to a loss of jobs, lead to loss of wealth,” he says.

He says that the EU has a “prepared response” on steel and aluminium which will be put forward “soon”, but stressed that, at the moment the bloc is not focusing on “the so called reciprocal tariffs.”

He says he describes them as “so calls reciprocal tariffs” as “the methodology used by the US side is not yet entirely clear to us.”

As we wait for the press conference after the ministerial meeting, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen shared her views on US tariffs, as she welcomed Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre to Brussels.

She said that the US tariffs “come … at immense costs for US consumers and businesses,” as she insisted the EU “stand ready to negotiate with the United States.”

“Europe is always ready for good deal. So we keep it on the table,” she said, adding the EU “offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods, … because Europe is always ready for good deal.”

But she added the EU was “also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,” as it looked to step up its protection against “indirect effects [of] trade diversion.”

Von der Leyen said she engaged with key industrial stakeholders across the bloc to consult on next steps.

She also stressed that the EU should work on “strengthening our single market [by] getting rid of remaining barriers” in response to tariff disruptions.

            Rats don't always have the best reputations, but one named Ronin with a super sense of smell is working to change that.
    


            Ronin and his landmine-sniffing rat pack are making a name for rodents everywhere by saving innocent civilians from hidden explosives.
    


            The African giant pouched rat recently set a new world record for the most landmines detected by a rat. Between August 2021 and February 2025, Ronin uncovered 109 landmines and 15 other pieces of unexploded ordnance in a region close to Siem Reap in Cambodia, according to Guinness World Records.



            “Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of rats,” his main handler Phanny told the Guinness publication.
    


            Landmines are a major issue in former conflict zones. The explosive weapons, hidden in the ground, are designed to injure or kill anyone who passes over them. In Cambodia alone, they have caused more than 65,000 deaths and injuries since the fall of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.



            Their use is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and the threat they pose for decades after a conflict has ended, killing and maiming and hampering land development in war-ravaged areas.
    


            They are also notoriously difficult and dangerous to detect. That's where rats come in;  their high intelligence, speed and keen sense of smell make them adept at identifying explosives. They are also too light to trigger landmines.
    


            It's crucial work. An estimated 110 million landmines are still buried in over 60 countries around the world, said landmine detection nonprofit APOPO. In 2023, landmines caused 5,757 casualties globally — 37% of which involved children, according to the 2024 Landmine Monitor.



            Ronin is one of more than 100 rats trained by APOPO to detect the scent of the explosive chemicals and point landmines out to their handlers.
    


            The rats are highly versatile and have also been trained to detect tuberculosis in medical settings, helping to prevent the spread of infectious disease.
    


            The Belgian nonprofit's team of landmine-sniffing rats can search an area the size of a tennis court in 30 minutes – something that could take a deminer with a metal detector up to four days.
    


Ronin, who is 5 years old and was born in Tanzania, is much larger than your average pet rat. He is more than 2 feet long – about the length of a cat – and weighs 2.6 pounds, according to APOPO.
    


            Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, where Ronin was deployed has one of the highest landmine densities in the world following decades of conflict in the 20th century, including heavy bombing by the US during the Vietnam War.
    


            The US dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance – including cluster bombs and submunitions – in a four-year carpet-bombing campaign in Cambodia. Up to a quarter of the cluster bombs failed to explode, meaning they stayed active and dangerous but out of sight, according to a 2019 report by the US Congressional Research Service.
    


            Despite years of demining efforts, there are still an estimated 4 to 6 million unexploded landmines in Cambodia, according to APOPO.



            Ronin claims the world record from Magawa, another rat trained by APOPO who identified 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance during his five-years of service. Magawa passed peacefully in January 2022.

            Two U.S. border inspectors in Southern California have been charged with taking thousands of dollars in bribes to allow people to enter the country through the nation's busiest port of entry without showing documents, prosecutors said.
    


            U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were assigned to immigration inspection booths at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. They were charged after investigators found phone evidence showing they had exchanged messages with human traffickers in Mexico and discovered unexplained cash deposits into their bank accounts, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.
    


            Surveillance video showed at least one instance in which a vehicle with a driver and a passenger stopped at a checkpoint but only the driver was documented as having entered the country, prosecutors said.
    


            Prosecutors said the officers waved dozens of vehicles carrying people without documents. They said both men were paid thousands for each vehicle they waved through.
    


            It wasn't immediately known if Almonte has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.
    


            Rodriguez's attorney, Michael Hawkins, said the case was still in the “infant stages” and that Rodriguez has the presumption of innocence.
    


            “We look forward to working through the current situation,” Hawkins said in an email in which he described Rodriguez as hardworking and loyal.
    


            The investigation on Almonte and Rodriguez started after three migrant smugglers who were arrested last year told federal investigators they had been working with U.S. border inspectors, federal prosecutors said.
    


            While Almonte was in custody, investigators allegedly seized nearly $70,000 in cash they believe his romantic partner was trying to move to Tijuana. Prosecutors wrote in a court filing that Almonte is potentially facing additional charges for money laundering and obstruction of justice, The San Diego Union Tribune reported.
    


            “Any Customs and Border Protection agent who aids or turns a blind eye to smugglers bringing undocumented immigrants into the U.S. is betraying their oath and endangering our national security,” Acting U.S. Attorney Andrew Haden told the newspaper in a statement.
    


            There have been five U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers assigned to the San Diego area to face similar corruption charges in the last two years.
    


            Last year, former U.S. border inspector Leonard Darnell George was sentenced to 23 years in prison for taking bribes to allow people and drug-laden vehicles to enter the country through the San Ysidro border crossing. Two other former border officers at the Otay Mesa and Tecate ports of entry were charged last year with similar charges. They are expected to go on trial this summer.

London gallery's competition marks 200th anniversary and opening of Sainsbury Wing after two-year overhaul

As far as sleepovers go, it's a one of a kind: an overnight stay in a luxury bed in the middle of the National Gallery's exhibition rooms, dreaming under the world's greatest paintings.

Perhaps you'll be inspired by the venerated artworks to pick up a paintbrush, or you'll have a surreal experience like Ben Stiller in Night at the Museum, whose character – a night security guard – finds its exhibits come to life after sunset. You could even unearth a long-buried conspiracy, and find your discoveries adorning the pages of the next Dan Brown novel.

For the first time in its history, the National Gallery in London is offering an overnight stay to the lucky person who wins its new prize draw, which has been launched before its public reopening next month.

Marking the gallery's 200th anniversary, the competition will select the first member of the public to enter the gallery's Sainsbury Wing after its two-year closure and experience the biggest rehang of the entire collection, entitled CC Land: The Wonder of Art.

Anyone over 18 who subscribes to the National Gallery's newsletter will be entered into the draw to sleep in the bed, which will be on the “bridge” that connects the Sainsbury Wing with the rest of the gallery. The competition is open until 6pm on 28 April, and the winner will be randomly selected.

According to the gallery, the evening will start with a dinner for two at its soon-to-be-opened restaurant, Locatelli; then, once the gallery's doors are closed to the public, the winner will receive their own private tour of the exhibition with Christine Riding, National Gallery director of collections and research.

As they make their way through the gallery, they will see more than 1,000 works of art, which trace the development of painting in the western European tradition between the 13th and 20th centuries, from familiar masterpieces to paintings that have never been seen in the National Gallery.

“This is the first time that we have had such an exciting opportunity to rethink, and refresh, how we present one of the greatest art collections in the world, under one roof,” Riding said. “Our visitors will discover anew some of the most famous and iconic works of art ever created, alongside personal favourites and recent discoveries and acquisitions.”

The next morning, the winner will also receive a breakfast hamper before having the gallery to themselves to explore before the first public opening of the Sainsbury Wing at 10am on 10 May.

The National Gallery's rehang is its most extensive in years. The gallery's 200th anniversary celebrations this year also include the opening of a supporters' house, for members and other supporters, and a learning centre.

The National Gallery is no stranger to overnight events. In January, it opened its doors for 24 hours for the final weekend of its sellout Van Gogh exhibition, which was visited by more than 200,000 people. It was the second time in its history the gallery stayed open overnight (the first being for Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan in 2012).

Sir Gabriele Finaldi, the director of the National Gallery, said: “Our bicentenary provides the perfect opportunity to consider a new way to tell the story of the incredible paintings in our collection, and include some exciting surprises.

“So we feel it is fitting that through this prize draw one of our visitors should receive a first look at the newly transformed National Gallery and Sainsbury Wing and have these wonderful pictures to themselves for one special night.”

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are careening through a manic Monday after President Donald Trump threatened to crank his tariffs higher, despite a stunning display from Wall Street showing how dearly it wants him to do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was down 0.8% in late trading, but only after a shocking day of heart-racing reversals as battered financial markets try to figure out what Trump's ultimate goal is for his trade war. If it's to get other countries to agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if it's to remake the economy and stick with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may need to fall further.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 563 points, or 1.5%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% lower. 

All three indexes started the day sharply lower, and the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a gain of nearly 900 points. The S&P 500, meanwhile, went from a loss of 4.7% to a leap of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The sudden rise followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news.” Stocks then turned back down. That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on tariffs.

But soon after that, Trump threatened to raise tariffs further against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products. 




It's a slap in the face to Wall Street, not just because of the sharp losses it's taking, but because it suggests Trump may not be moved by its pain. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling.

On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he does not want markets to fall. But he also said he wasn't concerned about a sell-off, saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them. 

Still, indexes kept swerving between losses and gains Monday, even after Trump threatened to raise his tariffs, because hope still remains in markets that negotiations may still come.

“Could things get worse? Of course they could,” said Nate Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. “We're not calling the all-clear at all, but when you have this type of volatility in the market, of course you're going to have back and forth” in markets not just day to day but also hour to hour. 

“We're all waiting for the next bit of information,” he said. “Literally a Truth Social tweet or an announcement of some sort about real negotiations could dramatically move this market. This is the world we live in right now.”

All that seems to be certain is that the financial pain hammered investments around the world on Monday, the third straight day of steep losses after Trump announced tariffs in his “Liberation Day.” 

Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week.

Nike dropped 4% for one of the larger losses on Wall Street. Not only does it sell a lot of shoes and apparel in China, it also makes much of it there. Last fiscal year, factories in China made 18% of its Nike brand footwear. Vietnam made 50%, and Indonesia made 27%.

Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.

It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero by slashing interest rates during downturns. 

But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because the conditions are so much different. That's cheifly because inflation is higher at the moment than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. Expectations for inflation are already swinging higher  because of Trump's tariffs, which would likely raise prices for anything imported.

“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”

In the bond market, Treasury yields rallied Monday to recover some of their sharp drops from earlier weeks. Some of the big move may have been because of reduced expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Fed. Some analysts also said it could be due to investors outside of the United States wanting to pare their U.S. investments. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.14% from 4.01% late Friday. 

Earlier in the day, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 20% below its record set less than two months ago. If it finishes a day below that bar, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that's moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious. 

The S&P 500, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, is coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are swinging in a manic Monday after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariffs, despite seeing how much Wall Street wants him to do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was up 0.3% in afternoon trading, coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020. The index, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, has been flirting with a drop of 20% from its record set less than two months ago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 184 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:37 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.8% higher. 

Earlier in a heart-racing morning, the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points shortly after trading began, following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a leap of nearly 900 points. The S&P 500 went from a loss of 4.7% to a gain of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The sudden rise for stocks followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news.” Stocks then turned back down.

Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week.

On Wall Street, roughly 65% of the stocks fell within the S&P 500. The index is being lifted by gains from several big technology stocks, whose pricey values tend to give more heft to the market's direction, whether up or down. Nivida rose 4.6%.

Nike dropped 4% for one of the larger losses in the market. Not only does it sell a lot of shoes and apparel in China, it also makes much of it there. Last fiscal year, factories in China made 18% of its Nike brand footwear. Vietnam made 50%, and Indonesia made 27%.

Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.

It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero during downturns. By slashing interest rates to make borrowing easier for U.S. households and companies, along with several untraditional moves to juice the economy, the Fed helped the U.S. economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID crash and other bear markets.

But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because the conditions are so much different. For one, instead of a coronavirus or a system built up on too much belief that U.S. home prices would keep rising, this market downturn is mostly because of economic policy from the White House.

Perhaps more importantly, inflation is also higher at the moment than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. Expectations for inflation are already swinging higher  because of Trump's tariffs, which would likely raise prices for anything imported.

“The idea that there's so much uncertainty going forward about how these tariffs are going to play out, that's what's really driving this plummet in the stock prices,” said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at the Asia Group.

If the S&P 500 finishes the day 20% below its record, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that's moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious. 

Nathan Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said more countries are likely to respond to the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs. Given the large number of countries involved, “it will take a considerable amount of time in our view to work through the various negotiations that are likely to happen.”

“Ultimately, our take is market uncertainly and volatility are likely to persist for some time,” he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are falling in a manic Monday after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariffs, despite seeing how much financial markets would love to see him do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was down 1.4% in midday trading, coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020. The index, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, has lost nearly 20% since setting a record less than two months ago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 744 points, or 1.9%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.1% lower. 

Earlier in a heart-racing morning, the Dow fell as many as 1,700 points shortly after trading began, following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a leap of nearly 900 points before pulling back lower. The S&P 500 at one point went from a loss of 4.7% to a gain of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The whipsaw swings shook the market as a White House account on X said a rumor circulating that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs was “fake news.” That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how hard investors are straining to see hopes that Trump may let up on his stiff tariffs, which have started a global trade war.

Within less than an hour of that “fake news” announcement, though, Trump threatened to raise tariffs further against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products.

BRUSSELS (AP) — America's trading partners wrestled with responses to U.S. President Donald Trump's blast of tariff hikes and some planned to send negotiators to Washington, while the head of the European Union's executive commission offered mutual reduction of tariffs - while warning that retaliation was an option too.

“We stand ready to negotiate with the United States,” said commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Indeed, we have offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners. Because Europe is always ready for a good deal.”

But she warned that “we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests.”

China has already hit back against the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs and similar actions from Europe and elsewhere remain a significant possibility.

The U.S. and the EU had a zero-for-zero deal on wine and spirits from 1997 to 2018, and reducing many tariffs to zero was a goal of complex negotiations for a US-Europe free-trade deal before negotiations stalled in 2016. 

Yet there was little indication Trump is ready to deal. The EU trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, spoke for two hours with Trump administration Friday and would say only that “we stay in touch.” 

And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports would not lead to a pullback on the the newly announced 46% levy on its imports to the U.S. 




“Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said on CNBC

Major trade partner China was taking a tougher line and accused the U.S. of “bullying” after imposing a 34% tariff on Friday on all US goods, the exact same rate Trump slapped China with in his latest round of new import taxes.

Several other countries said they were sending trade officials to Washington to try to talk through the crisis, which has cast uncertainty over the global economic outlook, hammered markets and left U.S. allies wondering about the value of their ties with the world's largest economy. 

European Union trade ministers were closeted Monday in Luxembourg to weigh possible steps that could include taxes on U.S. tech companies like Google, Apple and Amazon. The European Union's executive commission - which handles trade issues for the 27-country bloc - is set to impose tariffs on Jeans, whiskey and motorcycles on Wednesday in response to Trumps increase in steel and aluminum tariffs.

But it hasn't decided a response yet to Trump's “reciprocal” tariff of 20% on European goods announced Wednesday and a 25% tariff imposed on autos from everywhere. French officials have raised imposing tariffs on services like internet commerce or financial services, where the U.S. sells more than it buys from Europe and is in theory more vulnerable than in goods trade. 

Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, was defiant as he arrived, saying the premise of the wide-ranging tariffs was “nonsense” and that attempts by individual countries to win exemptions haven't worked in the past. 

It's important for the EU to stick together, he said. That “means being clear that we are in a strong position — America is in a position of weakness.” 

So far the European approach has been to selectively target politically sensitive goods rather than impose sweeping retaliation since like most economists officials they view tariff wars as a lose-lose game. 

China, which hit back Friday at Washington with 34% tariffs on U.S. products and other retaliatory moves, sharply accused the U.S. of failing to play fair. “Putting ‘America First' over international rules is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,” Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.

The ruling Communist Party struck a note of confidence even as markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai crumpled. “The sky won't fall,” declared The People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece. “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of U.S. taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal.”

China's Commerce Ministry said officials met with representatives of 20 American businesses including Tesla and GE Healthcare over the weekend and urged them to take “concrete actions” to address the tariffs issue.

During the meeting, Ling Ji, a vice minister of commerce, promised that China will remain open to foreign investment, according to the readout by the ministry. 

South Korea's Trade Ministry said its top negotiator, Inkyo Cheong, will visit Washington this week to express Seoul's concerns over the 25% tariffs on Korean goods and discuss ways to mitigate the damage to South Korean businesses, which include major automakers and steel makers. Asian countries are among the most exposed to Trump's tariffs ranging from a baseline 10% to 50% since their export-oriented economies send a lot of goods to the U.S. 

Pakistan also planned to send a delegation to Washington this month to try negotiate over the 29% tariffs on its exports to the U.S., officials said. The prime minister ordered Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to assess the tariff's potential impact on Pakistan's fragile economy and draw up recommendations. 

The U.S. imports around $5 billion worth of textiles and other products each year from Pakistan, which heavily relies on loans from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. 

In Southeast Asia, Malaysia's Trade Minister Zafrul Abdul Aziz said his country will seek to forge a united response from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to Trump's sweeping tariffs.

As chair of the 10-nation body this year, Malaysia will lead a meeting Thursday in its capital Kuala Lumpur to discuss broader implications of the trade war on regional trade and investment, Zafrul told reporters.

“We are looking at the investment flows, macroeconomic stability and ASEAN's coordinated response to this tariff issue,” Zafrul said. 

He said that he had met with the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia to try to clarify how the U.S. came up with its 24% tariff. 

Indonesia, one of the region's biggest economies, said it would work with businesses to increase its imports of U.S. wheat, cotton, oil and gas to help reduce its trade surplus, which was $18 billion in 2024. 

Coordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto told a news conference that Indonesia will not retaliate against the new 32% tariff on Indonesian exports, but would use diplomacy to seek mutually beneficial solutions. 

Some Southeast Asian neighbors, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, face tariffs of over 40%, giving Indonesia a slight advantage, he noted.

“For Indonesia, it is also another opportunity as its market is huge in America,” Hartoto said. He said Indonesia would buy U.S.-made components for several national strategic projects, including refineries.

JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan has criticized the revocation of U.S. visas for all its nationals as unfair and said it was based on an incident that didn't involve one of its citizens but another African national. 

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that the decision to revoke all visas for South Sudanese came because the country's government failed to accept the return of its citizens being removed from the United States “in a timely manner.”

South Sudan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that the deportee who was denied U.S. entry on Friday was found to be a Congolese national and he was returned to the U.S and all supporting evidence shared with American officials.

“The government deeply regrets that despite this history of collaboration and partnership, South Sudan now faces a broad revocation of visas based on an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national,” the statement said. 

South Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told The Associated Press on Monday that the U.S was “attempting to find faults with the tense situation” in the country because no sovereign nation would accept foreign deportees.

The U.N in March warned that South Sudan was teetering on the edge of renewed civil war. T he country's vice president and main opposition leader Riek Machar remains under house on charges of incitement after an armed group allied to him overrun an army camp and attacked a U.N helicopter.




It was not immediately clear how many South Sudanese hold U.S. visas. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on social media the dispute centers on one person, certified by South Sudan's Embassy in Washington, that Juba has refused to accept. That person was not named.

No new visas will be issued, the U.S. said, and “we will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi on the judicial system's handling of executive power cases, controversy surrounding alleged MS-13 Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia's deportation, the Luigi Mangione case and chatter about President Trump seeking a third term.

A federal appeals court voted en banc Monday to block President Donald Trump's firings of two federal board members, reversing an appellate court ruling and clearing the way for the Trump administration to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

Judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit voted 7-4 Monday to restore the positions of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) member Cathy Harris – two Democratic appointees who were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration earlier this year. 

The majority cited Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey's Executor and Wiener v. United States as the backing for their decision, noting that the Supreme Court had never overturned or reversed the decades-old precedent regarding removal restrictions for government officials of "multimember adjudicatory boards" – including the NLRB and MSPB.

They noted that the Supreme Court has not yet overturned these precedents, or instructed lower courts to act otherwise.

"The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it," judges noted in their opinion. 

Monday's ruling from the full panel means that both Wilcox and Harris can return to their positions, at least for now. It is likely to spark intense backlash from the Trump administration, which has lobbed accusations of so-called "activist judges" that have slowed or halted some of Trump's executive orders and actions.

Also on Monday, the appeals court rejected the Trump administration's request for an administrative stay, which would have allowed their removals to remain in place while the challenge continued to play out in federal court.

The panel found that the administration had not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its appeals, nor did it show irreparable injury if they did not grant the stay – the legal requirements needed to satisfy an emergency court intervention. 

The en banc ruling reverses a decision reached just 10 days earlier by a three-judge panel for the same appeals court. That panel ruled 2-1 in favor of the Trump administration and allowed the firings to proceed, prompting plaintiffs to file a request for the appeals court to hear the case again en banc, or with all appellate court judges present.

The appellate court's decision to hear the case again, even after a three-judge appellate panel from the same court ruled on the issue late last month, is likely to be met with intense scrutiny by Trump and his allies. 

It also all but ensures that the Trump administration will move quickly to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court for emergency review.

Since taking office, Trump has signed more than 300 executive orders and actions, including sweeping personnel moves, the restructuring of federal agencies, and the creation of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE – a temporary agency that has drawn scrutiny for its broad oversight powers and access to sensitive government data.

Critics argue that the flurry of early executive actions warrants an additional level of legal scrutiny, and judges have raced to review a crushing wave of cases and lawsuits filed by terminated employees or brought on behalf of agency employees. 

The Trump administration has appealed its early losses to the Supreme Court – a strategy it appears poised to continue in the NLRB and MSPB terminations.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — During the final sweet moments of UConn's 12th national title, Geno Auriemma and Paige Bueckers embraced after the star guard departed her final game with the Huskies.

It was the moment they wanted all along.

“They've all been gratifying, don't get me wrong,” Auriemma said. “But this one here, because of the way it came about and what's been involved, it's been a long time since I've been that emotional when a player has walked off the court.”

Bueckers, Azzi Fudd and Sarah Strong led the way as UConn returned to the top of women's college basketball by rolling to an 82-59 victory over defending champion South Carolina on Sunday.

Fudd, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, scored 24 points. Strong had 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Bueckers scored 17 points for UConn (37-3).

“Well, it's amazing to have three players, three people like that on the same team,” said the 71-year-old Auriemma, who became the oldest coach in major college basketball to win a championship. “And Sarah, you would think Sarah was graduating the way she plays, right? All three of them complement each other so well. They all have such unique skill sets.”

Bueckers capped her stellar career with the Huskies' first championship since 2016, ending a nine-year drought for the team. That was the longest period for Auriemma and his program without a title since Rebecca Lobo and Jen Rizzotti led the Huskies to their first championship in 1995.

Since then the Huskies have had dominant championship runs, including in the early 2000s led by Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, 2009-10 with Maya Moore and finally the four straight from 2013-16 with Breanna Stewart. All were in attendance in Florida on Sunday to see the Huskies' latest title.




“You just never know if you'll ever be back in this situation again,” Auriemma said. “And there were so many times when I think we all questioned, ‘Have we been here too long? Has it been time?' And we kept hanging in there and hanging in there and that's because these players make me want to hang in there every day.”

Bueckers, the expected No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft on April 14, delivered for the Huskies throughout their championship season.

Winning a title was the only thing missing from an incredible UConn career that was slowed by injuries. She was the first freshman to win AP Player of the Year before missing a lot of her sophomore season with a tibial plateau fracture and meniscus tear. She then tore an ACL before the next season.

“It's been a story of resilience, gratitude of overcoming adversity and responding to life's challenges,” Bueckers said. “I wouldn't trade it for the world.”

UConn closed the first half up 10 points and then put the game away in the third quarter, with Fudd, Strong and Bueckers combining for 23 of the team's 26 points in the period. UConn was up 50-39 with 3:21 left before closing with a 12-3 run.

Fudd and Strong got it started with back-to-back 3s, and the rout was on. Auriemma subbed Bueckers, Fudd and Strong out with 1:32 left in the game.

UConn's leading trio finished the tourney with 368 points, including an NCAA freshman record 114 for Strong. It was the highest point total for three teammates in a single NCAA Tournament, according to Stats Perform. Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randell scored 363 points for Tennessee in the 1998 women's tournament, and Glen Rice led the way for a trio of Michigan men that had 366 points in 1989.

The UConn trio proved to be way too much for South Carolina.

Dawn Staley's team was trying for a third title in four years and fourth overall. It would have tied her with Kim Mulkey for third most behind Auriemma and former Tennessee Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt, who had eight.

“Our kids gave it all they had. When you can understand why you lost and when you've been on the other side of that three times, you understand it,” Staley said. “You can swallow it. We lost to a very good basketball team.” 

UConn had reached the title game only once during its drought since 2016. The Huskies had been eliminated by heartbreaking last-second losses in the Final Four on buzzer-beaters. The Huskies' last title game appearance came in 2022 when Staley's team beat UConn to start the Gamecocks' current run of success, a game that ended Auriemma's perfect record in title games.

There seemed to be no nerves early for either team as the game got off to a fast start. The teams traded baskets for the first few minutes before the defenses started to clamp down. The Huskies led 19-14 after one quarter and then extended the advantage to 36-26 at the half. Fudd had 13 points and Strong added eight points and 11 rebounds.

            As the world's appetite for computers, smartphones and other electronic devices grows ever bigger, the other side of the coin — e-waste — is raising alarms.
    


            According to a UN report released last year, 62 million tons of e-waste was generated in 2022, enough to fill 1.5 million trucks that would circle the equator if lined up bumper to bumper. Most of the e-waste went to landfills or incineration, with potential negative consequences for the environment and human health, as e-waste can contain toxic substances such as mercury or lead.
    


            There's also a staggering economic loss, as $62 billion-worth of recoverable resources such as rare earth elements are lost in the process. Currently, just 1% of the world's demand for these elements, which are essential to modern electronic devices, is met by e-waste recycling, the report says.
    


            With e-waste rising five times faster than recycling rates, new solutions to the problem can't come soon enough. Aquafade could be one — a fully water-soluble plastic that dissolves completely in about six hours when placed in a container of water. It could be used to encase electronics such as computers or keyboards and dissolved when the device is no longer wanted, making it easier to recycle or recover the most valuable components and reducing the amount of e-waste.
    


            “For most electronic products, when they're being recycled, it's the disassembly that's the real hassle, and really labor intensive,” says Samuel Wangsaputra, one of the inventors of Aquafade. “I think the brilliant bit with Aquafade is that a lot of that process is decentralized, and simply done at home.”
    


            The inspiration for Aquafade comes from an unlikely source: “One night I was doing the dishes, and I was looking at a dishwasher pod,” Wangsaputra says, adding he was intrigued by the water-soluble, transparent film that replaced traditional wrappers. “And I thought, this must be some form of polymer. But where does it go? So I tried one, just in a cup of water, and it fully disappeared.”
    


            To find out more, Wangsaputra and his co-inventor Joon Sang Lee — with whom he founded UK-based startup Pentaform, a maker of low-cost and accessible computers, in 2019 — teamed up with Enrico Manfredi-Haylock and Meryem Lamari, two material scientists at Imperial College London.
    


            “We found a material which is like a glue stick, called PVOH or polyvinyl alcohol. One of the criteria is it has to be food safe, if kids are licking the product, and it has to be fully biodegradable in the sewage system,” he adds.
    


            Wangsaputra realized that PVOH could be the key to removing a bottleneck in e-waste recycling — transportation, which raises costs and creates carbon emissions. That's in addition to the fact that most e-waste isn't even recycled. Removing the plastic casing at home would be beneficial, he thought.
    


            The idea has funding from the UK government and the four are working on the project at London's Royal College of Arts, going through a series of iterations. “We are creating something that is water soluble, but also waterproof. The challenge was making a (waterproof) coating that is biodegradable, but also very resistant.”
    


            This coating, also made of a plastic polymer, is only applied to the outer shell, making the product water resistant up to five meters for 30 minutes, which covers accidental spills or humid weather. “But once you take off just one screw from the product, that creates a leak. That's when you submerge it in water. Five to six hours later, it will dilute, and what's left is milky water and the most valuable parts of the product (the electronics),” says Wangsaputra. The milky water can simply be poured into a sink or toilet, and Wangsaputra says it will further decompose in the sewage system.
    


            The first commercial application for Aquafade is likely to be as the casing for LED wristbands worn at concerts: “After just one use, thousands of people just throw them away. They are simple to build, and we're in talks with one of the largest providers of these wristbands,” says Joon Sang Lee.
    


            Next up is a mini PC made with an Aquafade shell that will be released on the Pentaform website. But the duo are thinking about applications beyond electronics: “It would work for any product that is injection molded, or any plastic that is a hard shell, so even luggage, car interiors, watches, sunglasses, even furniture” says Wangsaputra, hinting at the possibility of licensing Aquafade to third parties.
    


            For now, Aquafade is double the cost of regular ABS plastic, which it would replace. But Wangsaputra says that that amounts to 5 to 10% of the overall cost of an electronic product, and that mass production will make it cheaper.
    


            Peter Edwards, emeritus professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Oxford, who's not involved with Aquafade, calls it “an interesting development,” but wonders whether the dissolved plastic will persist in the environment and ultimately end up as microplastic. The Aquafade team acknowledge that they have not yet fully investigated how the solution would biodegrade in the long term.

            Michael Shaver, a professor of Polymer Science at the University of Manchester, who's also not involved with Aquafade, shares some reservations about its sustainability, noting that there are questions around the mechanism, safety and rate of biodegradation, but adding that in waste water systems in the developed world, this is generally well controlled when it comes to PVOH, which is well known from dishwasher and laundry pods.
    


            However, he adds, the impact of the waterproof coating on this degradation needs more clarity. “The devil is in the details here — electronics have high specifications for their plastics. Some need to be very good (electrical) insulators or they may need to be fire retardant,” he says. “And they certainly all need to have an exceptional weathering performance to ensure a long life — I can see this being the biggest technical hurdle.”

            The big question as global stock sell-offs point to another week of plunging markets in the US is how much pain President Donald Trump is prepared to inflict to test his tariff theories.
    


            Trump said Sunday evening that he's “open to talking” to world leaders about new deals as he put a brave face on the chaos unleashed by his trade wars after a weekend playing golf at his exclusive Florida properties. Trump also claimed that he'd spoken to “many countries” and that despite fury abroad over his “Liberation Day” trade attacks, “They're being very nice.”
    


            But as he flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One, stocks tumbled at the opening in Tokyo, leading Asian markets downward, and US futures suggested more huge losses are likely on Wall Street on Monday.
    


            “What's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it'll be a country like no other,” Trump said, while downplaying stock losses that have damaged the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
    


            “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said.

            With markets closed over the weekend after days of pummeling losses, the administration had the chance to take stock. But there is no fresh clarity over its strategy as the political stakes become more fraught.
    


            Top officials sent conflicting signals Sunday over whether Trump sees the economic warfare he unleashed last week as a lever for near-term dealmaking — or whether he's serious about a bid to remake the world economy that could take years.
    


            The confusion came against a backdrop of rising discomfort among some Republican lawmakers about the trade onslaught and as massive crowds across the country held anti-Trump protests in the largest show of dissent of his second term.
    


            The president and his senior aides also seem oblivious to anxiety in the country over the possibility his policies could cause a recession — or feel so sure in their views they don't really have to care. Trump posted a video of himself teeing off in Florida, and the White House put out a bizarre statement noting his win in a golf club championship match.
    


            It was a reminder that Trump and his millionaire and billionaire friends don't share the worries of regular American families, who are concerned about their retirement savings and how they'll afford groceries and cars when tariffs hike prices. While the president insists his plans for tax cuts will leave everyone more prosperous, he's still taking a gamble after winning a second term in part because voters felt the Biden administration did a poor job tackling inflation.
    


            The rationale for Trump's tariffs on 185 nations and territories is that the rest of the world has spent decades ripping off America and that the most aggressive protectionism in decades will return jobs to hurting US industrial heartlands.
    


            It's true that the profits of globalization — which saw many US jobs disappear overseas — have not been equally shared. But the United States is the richest, most powerful nation in history, and profited most from the free trading system Trump seeks to destroy.
    


            And the impact of his bigger-than-expected tariffs threatens to cause so much disruption that it throws the US and the world into a recession, causing huge job losses and wrecking the finances of millions of people. Such fears are partly behind the meltdown on global markets last week and fears that worse is to come.
    


            It was left up to Trump's Cabinet on Sunday to try to explain the method behind his tariff warfare, an approach he's long wanted to implement but that many economists regard as foolish and dangerous.
    


            CNN's Jake Tapper asked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins how long the tariff chaos would last and whether it was a negotiating tactic. Her answer laid bare the policy contradiction that is causing deep uncertainty and haunting stock markets.
    


            “This is a national security issue. This is about reshoring thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs,” Rollins said on “State of the Union,” seeming to confirm that Trump is bent on a fundamental reordering of the global economy with an attempt to re-create the manufacturing strength of the height of the industrial era.

            But Rollins then said that 50 countries were “burning the phone lines into the White House” and implied the tariffs were meant simply as leverage. “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government,” she said.
    


            This was consistent with Trump's later remarks on Air Force One that he was willing to talk to China and the European Union about reducing trade deficits with the United States. The comments might be seen in some quarters as an attempt to limit the damage expected to hit stock markets Monday.
    


            Bilateral negotiations with scores of countries could conceivably yield new trading conditions that could improve the position of the United States. But such an approach would not be sufficient to re-create the late 19th century golden age of manufacturing that Trump is promising. And it's questionable whether the gains would justify the economic destruction the president is wreaking.
    


            The administration seems to be interested only in the kind of “deals” that would require other countries to embrace total capitulation. “This is not a negotiation,” Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” He warned that offering the US a zero tariff wouldn't be sufficient, and signaled nations must cede to White House demands on other issues, including non-tariff barriers and currencies.
    


            While Trump's concern for Americans left behind by the 21st century economy is laudable, his obsession with trade deficits and the trade in goods represents an archaic worldview. It ignores how the US economy has become a tech and services behemoth and how it will never be able to produce basic goods such as clothes as economically as lower-wage economies abroad. Making basic goods in the United States would cost more, would raise the cost of living and would harm the prosperity of many Americans.

Trump's ‘reciprocal' tariffs aren't quite what they seem. Here's the real story



            While Rollins seemed to be following the example of Trump last week by suggesting tariffs were leverage, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dug in on Sunday.
    


            “There is no postponing,” he said of the duties due to come into force Wednesday. “They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,” Lutnick said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” He added: “The president needs to reset global trade. … The countries of the world are ripping us off, and it's got to end.”
    


            Lutnick appears to be betting that US strength can force weaker nations to fold. He told CNN's Pamela Brown last week that it would be unwise to retaliate. “If you're angry and you fight back to the greatest customer in the world, you're going to lose. We are the sumo wrestler of this world.”
    


            Such is the power of the US that it might triumph in one-on-one showdowns with most other nations. But the administration rarely talks about the impact of multifront tariff retaliation simultaneously from all the great trading powers. China, for instance, now faces a cumulative 54% tariff on its imports to the US, which means that buying power of US shoppers will be severely constrained since — despite Trump's insistence that other countries pay for tariffs — consumers will foot the bill. This could hammer US retailers and squelch consumer confidence, setting up the conditions that could lead to a recession. China also imposed a 34% tariff on US imports, making a tough-to-crack market even more difficult for American firms.
    


            Enormous losses on US stock markets last week — the Dow and the S&P 500 were both down by more than 5% on Friday alone — alarmed millions of Americans whose retirements depend on their 401(k) plans.
    


            But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted there didn't need to be a recession and dismissed the long-term impact of stock market losses, using words like “choppiness” and “adjustment process” to explain the panic. And speaking on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Bessent rejected the idea that people who want to retire soon had taken a serious blow. “Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening,” Bessent said. He added: “The reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.”
    


            Technically, Bessent is correct, and over years and decades, stocks have been a sound investment, through market corrections and recessions. But his comments were the latest remarkably tone-deaf commentary from a multimillionaire Cabinet member. Bessent is a wealthy former hedge fund manager.
    


            Such attitudes raise the question of whether the president's strategy will cost him public support — especially if the tariffs remain in place for months and price hikes begin to really punish families. Recent national surveys from The Wall Street Journal, CBS News and Marquette University Law School, all taken before Trump's “Liberation Day” announcement, found majorities of Americans disapproved of the president's tariff policies.
    


            Some Republican senators are already nervous. Several have signed on to a measure backed by GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley to require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would have to approve them within 60 days or they would expire.
    


            Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat co-leading the effort with Grassley, said Sunday that bipartisan momentum was growing behind the bill and that seven GOP senators were now listed as co-sponsors in an unusual break with Trump.
    


            “I'm sure they listen to their constituents. Consumer challenges are already starting to surface, and certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people,” Cantwell said on CBS. The measure, however, faces a far harder path in the House, and it's doubtful at this point it could amass veto-proof majorities.
    


            After months of mourning their November loss, Democrats are showing signs of life. A liberal candidate won a wide victory in a race for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat last week. And the size of protests against Trump and Elon Musk in many cities Saturday may augur an awakening of a resistance movement more a year and a half before the 2026 midterm elections.
    


            But Trump is showing no sign of a course correction. He wrote on his Truth Social network on Saturday that “we have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,' but not any longer.” The president added: “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH.” The next day, he was back on the golf course.

Patricia Heaton shared her thoughts on the message behind her new faith-based movie "The Unbreakable Boy."

Some know me as Debra Barone, others as Frankie Heck. To my four boys, I am simply "Mom" — the name I cherish most. Though they are now grown, I will never forget the first time Sam, John, Joe and Dan first said it. That single word, a milestone, formed a bond only a parent and child can understand. Yet, for many women facing infertility, that same word carries a pain only they can truly know. 

There has been much discussion lately about the importance of having children. But if the conversation stops there, we miss the bigger picture. It is not just about having kids — it is about having a sense of family. If we overlook that truth, we risk turning a deeply personal experience into a divisive debate. 

Family has always been at the heart of my life and career. Portraying mothers on screen and raising four sons with my husband, David Hunt, has given me profound insights into the joys and challenges of parenthood. Playing characters like Debra Barone in "Everybody Loves Raymond" and Frankie Heck in "The Middle" allowed me to explore the complexities of motherhood and family — its humor, chaos, and love — reflecting the diverse experiences that so many women navigate daily.

Off-screen, my greatest role has been being "Mom." My life is permanently enriched by my sons — through the endless soccer games, band practices, school dances, Thanksgivings with kids running wild, summer vacations, bedtime stories, road trips, science fairs, driving lessons, pillow and blanket forts, college applications, playing catch in the back yard, school plays and so much more. But I know this journey to parenthood is not the same for everyone.

April marks National Infertility Awareness Month. Here in the United States, approximately 12% of women aged 15 to 49 — more than 10 million — struggle to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term. The weight of infertility can feel overwhelming, made heavier by the assumption that becoming a parent is something that simply happens.  

The heartbreak of infertility is often lived in silence, which is why my husband, David, and I produced the feature adult comedy "Unexpected," a film about a couple navigating infertility and finding their unique path to family.

Infertility is more than a medical condition. It is an emotional journey that tests identity, relationships, and faith. The societal expectation that parenthood is a given can make this journey even more isolating. But families are not defined solely by biology. Adoption, for instance, brings approximately 135,000 children into new loving homes each year.  

Yet, when discussing children in our culture, we rarely discuss what it means to build a family. The conversation often focuses on birth rates, fertility rates and the economic impact. But these numbers miss the real human experience. Every child deserves a loving home, and every hopeful parent deserves to know that there are many paths to creating a family — paths that deserve just as much recognition and support as traditional childbirth.

My family, friends and audience members who have seen "Unexpected" and experienced infertility firsthand have shared how lonely it can be. For too long, they have felt overlooked in conversations about parenthood, as if their journey matters less. But it does matter. David and I hope "Unexpected" offers hope, reminding viewers that while the road to parenthood may be uncertain, the destination — a loving family — is possible in many ways.

If we truly value family, we should recognize that building one is not a one-size-fits-all journey. A family's strength is not measured by how it is formed but by the love, commitment and faith that hold it together. 

From Debra Barone to Frankie Heck to Patricia Heaton, the throughline of my life has always been family. To those experiencing the uphill battle of building a family, I hope you find support to walk this path with others and faith to believe that your dreams of family — however they unfold — are possible. 

Patricia Heaton is an actress, producer and author best known for her roles in "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "The Middle." She and her husband, David Hunt, co-produced the film "Unexpected," which David directed – a story about infertility, adoption and the many ways families come to be. It is available on Amazon Prime and other streaming companies.

A new study from the Network Contagion Research Institute follows an uptick in political violence in the wake of Luigi Mangione's alleged killing of UHC CEO Brian Thompson. (US the Story)

A disturbing new report reveals that violent political rhetoric online, including calls for the murder of public figures like President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, is being increasingly normalized, particularly on the left.

The report, from Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), found that a growing number of people are willing to justify and even applaud killing in the name of politics and a warped sense of social justice. The chilling change appears to have accelerated in recent months.

"What was formerly taboo culturally has become acceptable," Joel Finkelstein, the lead author of the report, told Fox News Digital. "We are seeing a clear shift – glorification, increased attempts and changing norms – all converging into what we define as ‘assassination culture.'"

The NCRI study traces the cultural shift back to the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson by Luigi Mangione in December 2024. What followed, researchers say, was a viral wave of memes that turned Mangione into a folk hero. 

According to the study, these memes have sparked copycat behavior targeting other figures associated with wealth and conservative politics.

NEW STUDY FINDS DEI INITIATIVES CREATING 'HOSTILE ATTRIBUTION BIAS'

"It's not just Luigi anymore," Finkelstein said. "We're seeing an expansion: Trump, Musk and others are now being openly discussed as legitimate targets, often cloaked in meme culture and gamified online dialogue."

A ballot measure in California, darkly named the Luigi Mangione Access to Health Care Act, is just one real-world outgrowth of this online movement.

In this chart, over half of left-leaning respondents said killing Donald Trump would be at least "somewhat justified," according to NCRI's national survey. The study found that 55% of self-identified left-of-center participants justified Trump's assassination to some degree, while 48% did the same for Elon Musk. Researchers say the findings reflect a growing tolerance for political violence among ideological extremists. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

NCRI conducted a nationally representative survey of more than 1,200 U.S. adults, weighted to reflect national census demographics. The findings were stark: Some 38% of respondents said it would be at least "somewhat justified" to murder Donald Trump, and 31% said the same about Elon Musk.

When counting only left-leaning respondents, justification for killing Trump rose to 55% and Musk to 48%. 

"These are not isolated opinions," the report states. "They are part of a tightly connected belief system linked to what we call left-wing authoritarianism."

"Trump represents the perfect target for assassination culture. He's powerful, he's rich and he's provocative," said Finkelstein to Fox News Digital. "That puts him on the highest shelf for those who glorify political violence."

"Trump represents the perfect target for assassination culture. He's powerful, he's rich and he's provocative. That puts him on the highest shelf for those who glorify political violence."

When asked whether destroying a Tesla dealership was justified, nearly four in 10 respondents agreed it was, to some degree. Among self-identified left-of-center participants, support for vandalism and property damage was significantly higher.

"Property destruction wasn't just an outlier opinion, it clustered tightly with support for political assassinations and other forms of violence," said Finkelstein. "This points to a coherent belief system, not just isolated grievances."

Among left-of-center respondents, a large share rated the murder of Trump and Musk as either "somewhat" or "completely justified," according to this histogram. The chart highlights the skew in support for political violence along ideological lines, with far-left participants scoring highest across all metrics. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

"Tesla has become a stand-in for broader frustrations about capitalism, tech power and conservative politics. Burning down a dealership isn't just a protest, it's a performance, a signal of belonging to a radical in-group."

Finkelstein said that while some level of violent sentiment exists on the right, "What we found was a statistically higher endorsement of political murder on the left, 41% more than among right-leaning participants."

The report singles out BlueSky, a social media platform favored by progressive users, as a major amplifier of extremist ideation. 

"BlueSky was modeled as a safe alternative to Twitter for the left, but what it's become is an extremist platform," Finkelstein said. "It functions today much like 4chan or Gab once did for far-right ideologies. These platforms are now lead indicators of violent real-world trends." 

This correlation matrix shows that support for assassinations, property destruction and Mangione are all tightly linked, forming a belief system NCRI calls "assassination culture." The study finds that left-wing authoritarianism was the strongest predictor for all categories of political violence. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

According to NCRI's open-source analysis, BlueSky saw a spike in engagement on posts referencing Mangione, Trump and Musk, crossing over 200,000 posts and 2 million engagements in just months. Reddit currently hosts pro-Mangione communities with tens of thousands of members.

Finkelstein believes the psychological roots of "assassination culture" are a mix of ideological radicalism and feelings of powerlessness, particularly in the aftermath of electoral losses.

"When people feel like they have no say, no future and no leadership offering vision, they become susceptible to radical ideation," he said. "And that's when the memes turn into permission structures for real violence."

Multivariate regression analysis reveals that far-left ideology, the use of BlueSky and a sense of powerlessness (external locus of control) are the leading predictors of support for political violence. The chart breaks down which psychological and demographic traits most strongly align with justifying the murder of Musk and Trump or attacks on Tesla dealerships. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

A key predictor identified in the study is external locus of control, which is the belief that one's life is governed by outside forces.

"Combine that with extreme partisanship, and you get an explosive mix," Finkelstein said.

Finkelstein does not believe censorship will end "assassination culture," but strong leadership just might.

"We are not an anti-free speech organization," said Finkelstein. "But we know what a threat is. And what's happening online on platforms like BlueSky represents a significant threat to American democratic values. If leaders on the left explicitly condemn these trends and reassert moral norms, they can dismantle this culture quickly," he said. "It's about reminding people there is a future worth striving for that doesn't involve glorifying political violence."

"It's about reminding people there is a future worth striving for that doesn't involve glorifying political violence."

The NCRI report ends on a sobering note: The normalization of assassination ideation is already spilling into real-world violence. Whether it's attacks on Tesla dealerships or assassination attempts on public officials, the NCRI warns that political violence is no longer fringe but culturally fashionable in some corners of the internet.

"With economic instability and ideological echo chambers feeding radicalism, the threat environment is shifting beneath our feet," Finkelstein said. "But recognizing that – hearing the sirens – is the first step to stopping it."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Network Contagion Research Institute describes itself as a "neutral and independent organization whose mission is to identify and forecast cyber-social threats and report on them in a timely fashion."

Fox News Digital spoke with Jon Brewton, the founder and CEO of Data2 and a U.S. Air Force veteran, about immigration at the northern border.

A "quiet crisis" is emerging at the U.S.-Canada border, as one expert proposes an unconventional solution to fight human smuggling: leveraging advanced technologies like artificial intelligence.

While national attention is largely fixed on the southern border, an increasingly concerning situation is unfolding along the country's northern border, said Jon Brewton, the founder and CEO of Data2 and a U.S. Air Force Veteran.

"U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has seen a fairly alarming increase in illegal crossings, drug trafficking, and even encountering individuals on the terrorist watch list," he told Fox News Digital. "And as difficult as securing the southern border has been, the northern border is twice as long."

While the vast majority of illegal crossings happen at the southern border, officials have been warning for years that the northern line has seen an increase.

During testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Kash Patel told lawmakers last week adversaries such as China and Russia have started to target the northern U.S. border with Canada.

"The enemy adapts," Patel said.

The Trump administration has overseen a dramatic shift at the U.S. southern border since taking office in January, with the number of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded encounters plummeting by 90% in most sectors compared to the same time period last year. The administration has poured in resources to stop the spiraling immigration situation at the southern border.

The sudden silence there came after record-setting numbers of illegal crossings during the four years of the Biden administration, a trend that also saw a dramatic increase in attempted crossings by immigrants outside of North and Latin America.

Chinese nationals were among the most likely to attempt illegal crossings, with the number of crossings from citizens of the country rising to over 24,000 in 2023, a more than 5,200% increase from the 450 encounters just a year earlier, according to CBP data.

Overall, Patel told lawmakers that between 2022 and 2025, roughly 178,000 Chinese nationals attempted to cross the southern border.

CBP's Swanton Sector, which spans 295 miles of the border with Canada and covers all of Vermont and parts of upstate New York and New Hampshire, has seen more apprehensions in the last fiscal year than the previous 13 years combined.

According to a report on CBS 19, the sector has seen 15,000 apprehensions in the 10 months of fiscal year 2024, the largest volume ever recorded by the sector, over 14,000 more than was recorded in fiscal year 2024.

The report noted that migrants from 85 different countries have attempted to illegally cross in the area.

Brewton said that there are unconventional ways that technology can be used to secure the 5,525 miles of border between the U.S. and Canada.

"And so there are some non-traditional ways that we can use technology as a capability multiplier," he said. "That's just something a little bit different than just hiring more agents and building physical processes in what is a really substantial amount of land that is rocky in territory, cold and snowy and hard to manage."

"I think that is where AI can help change our trajectory and success on the northern border."

Brewton explained that AI could play a powerful role in border security – enhancing surveillance, radar systems, and open-source intelligence, while also helping agents monitor water crossings more effectively.

"And using radar systems to understand the full scope of intelligence that's at our disposal, but using really, really smart tools to combine that intelligence in a smart way and use it at scale," he said. 

Traditional security systems operate in silos – each collects and processes data separately – but using AI models could give a full, connected picture, he explained.

People often misunderstand border security as just invasive surveillance, Brewton said, but when done right – especially with well-designed AI – it can actually improve both security and privacy by being smarter and more targeted.

"A lot of people really assume border security primarily means privacy, invasive surveillance, like facial recognition and biometrics and the roles that they can play within sort of pattern recognition. It's really about identifying suspicious behaviors and connecting different pieces of intelligence to individuals that we're monitoring," he said.

Brewton emphasized that citizens should have both strong safety measures and strong protection of their rights.

"Well-designed AI delivers enhanced protections for Americans and our communities while maintaining the transparency and accountability that our citizens, and quite frankly, our government, require," he said. "So if we're smart about what we do, we can make really, really impactful changes to what we're doing on the northern border and the southern border."

The Trump administration has pressured Canada to enhance its border security to stop the upward trend of the flow of migrants and fentanyl by implementing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10% tariff.

"I know that the president's agenda has really been to try to understand how we can work with Canada and seek concessions from our neighbors to the north to help secure the border in both directions," he said. "The government really needs to use all of its tools at its disposal."

The U.S. military's Central Command has released video showing fighter planes taking off for operations against Yemen's Houthi rebels. The U.S. administration has linked its airstrikes on the Iran-backed Houthis to an effort to pressure Tehran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.

The strikes in Saada killed two people and wounded four others, with footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showing a strike collapsing what appeared to be a two-story building.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Suspected U.S. airstrikes over the weekend targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least six people, the group said Sunday, while a bombing video posted by U.S. President Donald Trump suggested casualties in the overall campaign may be higher than the rebels acknowledge.

A strike Sunday night in Sanaa, the rebel-held capital of Yemen, hit a house, killing at least four people and wounding 16 others, the Houthis said. Their al-Masirah satellite news channel showed images of the damaged home and people receiving care in a hospital. 

The strike on the house in Sanaa's Shu'ub district allegedly targeted a Houthi leader, part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders. The intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters — related to the Israel-Hamas war — has killed at least 73 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis.

Earlier Sunday, the Iranian-backed Houthis said other suspected U.S. airstrikes killed at least two people in the rebel stronghold of Saada and wounded nine others. Footage aired by al-Masirah showed a strike collapsing what appeared to be a two-story building. The rebels aired no footage from inside the building, which they described as a solar power shop.

The Houthis have not acknowledged any casualties among their security and military leadership — something challenged after an online video posted by Trump.

Early on Saturday, Trump posted what appeared to be a black-and-white video from a drone showing over 70 people gathered in a circle. An explosion detonates during the 25-second video. A massive crater is left in its wake.

“These Houthis gathered for instructions on an attack,” Trump claimed, without offering a location or any other details about the strike. “Oops, there will be no attack by these Houthis! They will never sink our ships again!”

The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees Mideast military operations, has not published the video nor offered specific details about the strikes it has conducted since March 15. The White House has said over 200 strikes have targeted the Houthis.

The rebel-controlled SABA news agency in Yemen, citing an anonymous source, described the bombing as targeting “a social Eid visit in Hodeida governorate.” Muslims around the world just celebrated Eid al-Fitr at the end of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. SABA had published images of other commanders meeting fighters during the holiday, though not any high-level Houthi officials.

“Those present at that gathering had no connection to the operations carried out by the (Houthis), which are implementing the decision to ban navigation on ships linked to the American and Israeli enemy,” the SABA report said, adding that the attack killed and wounded “dozens.”

The Houthis previously have not acknowledged any strike on Hodeida during that time with such a high casualty count. The SABA report also did not describe those killed as civilians, suggesting they did have ties to the rebels' security or military forces. Hodeida has been a site of Houthi attacks into the Red Sea.

Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister for Yemen's exiled government opposing the Houthis, claimed the strike killed some 70 Houthi fighters and leaders, as well as “experts” from Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. He offered no evidence for the claim, though Iran has backed the Houthis. 

Neither the Iranian government nor the Guard has acknowledged the attack. However, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, said Saturday that “no Iranian individual has been martyred” in Yemen and described the claim of fatalities as “psychological warfare.” 

Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert of the Basha Report risk advisory firm, cited social media condolence notices suggesting a colonel overseeing police stations for the Houthis in Hodeida had been killed in the strike Trump highlighted, alongside his two brothers.

“The strikes have expanded significantly, hitting multiple governorates simultaneously, alongside telecommunications infrastructure, command nodes, properties tied to senior Houthi leadership and previously untouched tunnel networks in mountainous areas,” al-Basha told The Associated Press.

“We've also seen direct targeting of Houthi force gatherings, indicating a more aggressive and evolving shift in the targeting strategy,” al-Basha said.

An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.

The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.

The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.

The attacks greatly raised the profile of the Houthis, who faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers in Yemen amid a decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.

President Donald Trump said Sunday that he won't back down on his sweeping tariffs on imports from most of the world unless countries even out their trade with the U.S., digging in on his plans to implement the taxes that have sent financial markets reeling.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that he won't back down on his sweeping tariffs on imports from most of the world unless countries even out their trade with the U.S., digging in on his plans to implement the taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he didn't want global markets to fall, but also that he wasn't concerned about the massive sell-off either, adding, “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” 

His comments came as global financial markets appeared on track to continue sharp declines once trading resumes Monday, and after Trump's aides sought to soothe market concerns by saying more than 50 nations had reached out about launching negotiations to lift the tariffs.

“I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,” Trump said. “They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.”

The higher rates are set to be collected beginning Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said unfair trade practices are not “the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” The United States, he said, must see “what the countries offer and whether it's believable.”




Trump, who spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, posted online that “WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy.” His Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. 

“There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?” Bessent said. “What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”

U.S. stock futures dropped on Sunday night as the tariffs continued to roil the markets. S&P 500 futures were down 2.5% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.1%. Nasdaq futures were down 3.1%. Even the price of bitcoin, which held relatively stable last week, fell nearly 6% Sunday.

Asian shares, meanwhile, nosedived. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost nearly 8% shortly after the market opened. By midday, it was down 6%. A circuit breaker briefly suspended trading of Topix futures after an earlier sharp fall in U.S. futures. Chinese markets also tumbled, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping 9.4%, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 6.2%.

Trump's tariff blitz, announced April 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of global trade. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the U.S. He is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision.

Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly.

AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on more U.S. airstrikes in Yemen.

Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are “angry and retaliating,” and, he said, “by the way, coming to the table.” He cited the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks.

Adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting American allies and adversaries alike, including Israel, which is facing a 17% tariff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House and speak at a press conference with Trump on Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with Trump along with the war in Gaza and other issues.

Another American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. Trump said Vietnam's leader said in a telephone call that his country “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” And a key European partner, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump's move but was “ready to deploy all the tools — negotiating and economic — necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. 

“The tariffs are coming. Of course they are,” he said, adding that Trump needed to reset global trade. But he committed only to having them “definitely” remain “for days and weeks.”

In Congress, where Trump's Republican Party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease.

Several Republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said Sunday that he would introduce a House version of the bill, saying that Congress needs to restores its powers over tariffs.

“We gave some of that power to the executive branch. I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake,” said Bacon, adding that getting a measure passed would be challenging unless the financial markets continue to react negatively and other indicators such as inflation and unemployment shift.

Wyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 member of the Senate's GOP leadership, said Trump is “doing what he has every right to do.” But, he acknowledged, “there is concern, and there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets.” 

“There'll be a discussion in the Senate,” Barrasso said of the tariffs. “We'll see which way the discussion goes.”

Trump's government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, had been relatively silent on Trump's tariffs, but said at a weekend event in Italy that he would like to see the U.S. and Europe move to “a zero-tariff situation.” The comment from the Tesla owner who leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency drew a rebuke from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.

“Elon, when he is on his DOGE lane, is great. But we understand what's going on here. We just have to understand. Elon sells cars,” Navarro said. He added: “He's simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do.”

Trump indicated he disagreed with Musk, saying Sunday of the European Union, “They want to talk, but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.”

Lawrence Summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said Trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. 

If other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the U.S, does, too, he said, “it's just making a deal, then we don't raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the United States. If it's a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the United States, then we're going to have these tariffs permanently. So the president can't have it both ways.”

Bessent was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Hassett and Summers appeared on ABC's “This Week,” Lutnick and Barrasso were on CBS' “Face the Nation” and Navarro was interviewed on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”

            Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs, framing the move as a necessary economic reset and downplaying severe market volatility and uncertainty.
    


            President Donald Trump has long cast himself as a dealmaker — and has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture about the possibility of relief.
    


            Trump last week announced tariffs of at least 10% across all countries, with rates going even higher for 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders.” The universal 10% rate went into effect Saturday, while the customized rates will take effect Wednesday.
    


            More than 50 countries have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs in the aftermath of Trump's announcement, officials said Sunday.

            That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”
    


﻿Though the president has previously paused tariffs to allow for negotiation in other situations, Lutnick made clear that the administration plans to follow through on the tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday.
    


            “There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious. The president needs to reset global trade,” he said, adding, “He announced it, and he wasn't kidding, the tariffs are coming.”
    


            Meanwhile, Trump said Sunday evening that he has been fielding calls from tech executives and world leaders over the weekend on tariffs.
    


            “I've spoken to many countries. … Every country is calling and being very solicitous, very, very nice,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.
    


            Trump indicated Sunday he was open to negotiating — if countries address their trade deficits with the US.
    


            “I do want to solve the deficit problem we have in China, with the European Union and other nations, and they're going to have to do that. And if they want to talk about that, I'm open to talking,” the president said.
    


CNN has reported that the Trump administration is in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about the possibility of bespoke trade deals, with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to meet with Trump at the White House on Monday for direct talks.
    


            But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


            “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,” he said during an appearance on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
    


            Navarro added, “But I want to just say to the world here: If you want to come and talk to us, don't say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it. It's the non-tariff cheating. Stop manipulating their currency, stop dumping stuff in.”
    


            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was also unable to clearly state whether tariffs are here to stay or whether there was room for deals.
    


            “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

Elon Musk hopes for ‘zero-tariff situation' between US and EU



            And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump has “created maximum leverage for himself.”
    


            “It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks,” he told NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Elon Musk, one of Trump's most influential advisors and the face of the administration's Department of Government Efficiency, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States, indicating room for negotiation.
    


            “At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said in a video-link interview with Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister and the leader of the far-right League party, during a League congress in Florence.
    


            On Sunday, the administration officials repeatedly downplayed the economic upheaval rocking markets. By the time the market closed Friday, the Dow had posted its biggest back-to-back losses since March 2020, during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening, and stocks were set to open sharply lower Monday.
    


            Navarro urged American investors to “sit tight” and “not to panic.”
    


            “The smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in. Because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we've ever seen under the Trump policies. … People should just sit tight — let that market find its bottom. Don't get shook out by the panic in the media, and life is going to be beautiful under Donald John Trump,” he said.
    


            With economists escalating concerns about the possibility of recession, Bessent said he rejected the assumption.
    


            “There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity,” he said.
    


            Goldman Sachs analysts in a note last week said economic growth driven by Trump's fiscal policies would not be able to make up for the damage done by his massive tariff plan.

Trump's ‘reciprocal' tariffs aren't quite what they seem. Here's the real story



            Rollins took issue with the characterization of the markets crashing and characterized it as an adjustment.
    


            “As the economy, the market, begins to adjust, we will see a more positive — as we move, I believe, very quickly,” she told CNN.
    


            Rollins also indicated there could be support for farmers impacted by the tariffs, pointing to previous relief during Trump's first term.
    


            “We have to be prepared that if there is longer-term damage … we will make sure that we have the funds in working with the senators and working with the appropriators, that we can do what we did last time,” she said.
    


            For his part, the president returned to familiar patterns as anxious Americans watched their retirement accounts plummet, spending each of the past four days at one of his South Florida golf properties.
    


            As protesters assembled to demonstrate against Trump's tariff policies across the country — including in West Palm Beach — the White House offered an official statement announcing that the president won a golf tournament at his club Saturday.
    


            “The President won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, FL, and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow,” the statement said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California told NBC's “Meet the Press” that the split-screen image “may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency”
    


            “That is — the president out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames,” he said.

The storm system resulted in at least 16 deaths by early Sunday, with overnight tornado and flash flood warnings setting up more severe weather that forecasters say could cause rising waterways for days to come. Drone footage showed the severe extent of the flooding in the Kentucky towns of New Haven and Dawson Springs.

FRANKFORT, Kentucky (AP) — Rivers rose and flooding worsened Sunday across the sodden U.S. South and Midwest, threatening communities already badly damaged by days of heavy rain and wind that killed at least 18 people.

Even as the rain moved out of some of the hardest hit areas in Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky, water levels crept up in some communities, swirling into homes and businesses and submerging roads. 

In Frankfort, Kentucky, rescue crews checking up on residents in the state capital traversed inundated streets in inflatable boats. Workers erected sandbag ramparts to protect homes and businesses and turned off utilities as the swollen Kentucky River kept rising.

“As long as I've been alive — and I'm 52 — this is the worst I've ever seen it,” said Wendy Quire, the general manager at the Brown Barrel restaurant in downtown Frankfort.

AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports on the weekend's heavy rains and floods across the U.S. South and Midwest and what affected areas can expect for the rest of the week.

The river's depth had risen above 47 feet Sunday and was expected to crest above 49 feet Monday morning to a potentially record-setting level, according to Frankfort Mayor Layne Wilkerson. The city's flood wall system is designed to withstand 51 feet of water.

Forecasters said that flooding could persist as torrential rains lingered over several states. Tornado watches were in effect through much of the day Sunday in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Florida.

For many, there was a sense of dread.

“This flooding is an act of God,” said Kevin Gordon, a front desk clerk at the Ashbrook Hotel in downtown Frankfort. The hotel was open Sunday and offering discounted stays to affected locals, but Gordon said it could eventually be forced to close.

The 18 reported deaths since the storms began on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee. A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky was caught up in floodwaters while walking to catch his school bus. A 5-year-old boy in Arkansas died after a tree fell on his family's home and trapped him, police said. A 16-year-old volunteer Missouri firefighter died in a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.

The National Weather Service said on Sunday dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a “major flood stage,” with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.

In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking River. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.

The storms come after the Trump administration cut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.

A northwestern Tennessee town of about 200 people that flooded after a levee failure in February was almost entirely underwater on Sunday after the Obion River overflowed. Domanic Scott went to check on his father in Rives, Tennessee, after not hearing from him in a house where floodwater had reached the doorsteps.

“It's the first house we've ever paid off. The insurance companies around here won't give flood insurance to anyone who lives in Rives because we're too close to the river and the levees. So if we lose it, we're kind of screwed without a house,” Scott said.

For others that fled to higher ground, grabbing the essentials also meant taking a closer look at the liquor cabinet.

In Kentucky, with water rising up to his windowsills, Frankfort resident Bill Jones fled his home in a boat, which he loaded with several boxes filled with bottles of bourbon.

As of early Sunday, Memphis had received 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain since Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. West Memphis, Arkansas, received 10 inches (25 centimeters).

The rain and fierce winds moved further east on Sunday, felling trees in Alabama and Georgia.

Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.

            An image of and quote from Harriet Tubman have been removed from a National Parks webpage about the “Underground Railroad,” following several prominent changes to government websites under the Trump administration.
    


            The National Parks Service webpage for the “Underground Railroad” used to lead with a quote from Tubman, the railroad's most famous “conductor”, a comparison on the Wayback Machine between the webpage on January 21 and March 19 shows. Both the quote and an image of Tubman have since been removed, along with several references to “enslaved” people and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.
    


            The Washington Post first reported on the changes. The webpage now leads with commemorative stamps of various civil rights leaders with text including the phrase “Black/White Cooperation.” Whereas previously, the article started with a description of enslaved peoples' efforts to free themselves and the organization of the Underground Railroad after the Fugitive Slave Act, the article now starts with two paragraphs that emphasize the “American ideals of liberty and freedom” and do not specifically mention slavery.
    


            Tubman's removal from the “Underground Railroad” page “is both offensive and absurd,” Fergus Bordewich, a historian and the author of a book about the Underground Railroad, told CNN Sunday. He described the new webpage as “diminished in value by its brevity.”
    


            “To oversimplify history is to distort it,” Bordewich went on. “Americans are not infants: they can handle complex and challenging historical narratives. They do not need to be protected from the truth.”
    


            Janell Hobson, a professor of women's studies at the University at Albany, State University of New York, described Tubman as “one of our greatest American heroes and definitely the greatest liberator in this nation” in an email to CNN.
    


            “I hope that National Parks Service realize they owe it to her and other heroes like her to stand in the truth of what this history has been,” she said.
    


            There is a separate National Park Service webpage dedicated to Harriet Tubman, who was born into slavery in Maryland before fleeing to Philadelphia. She returned to Maryland over a dozen times to help free other slaves, guiding them through the “Underground Railroad,” a secret network of routes and safe houses. The park service webpage on Tubman does not seem to have been changed since January 28, 2025.
    


            CNN has reached out to the National Park Service for comment.

            The past few months have also seen other controversial changes to government websites as the Trump administration enacts a campaign to eliminate DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion. The removal of the words “transgender” and “queer” from a National Parks Service webpage about Stonewall Monument in New York City triggered protests in February.
    


            In March, the Pentagon seemingly took down a page about Jackie Robinson, the trailblazing baseball player who became the first Black Major League Baseball athlete in the modern era, before restoring it.
    


            Articles about topics seemingly unrelated to DEI – including the Holocaust, cancer awareness, and sexual assault – have also been removed from Pentagon webpages. Pentagon officials were instructed to search for keywords like “racism,” “ethnicity,” “LGBTQ,” “history” and “first” when identifying articles and photos to remove, multiple defense officials previously told CNN.
    


            In his second term, President Donald Trump has taken multiple steps to take control of American cultural and historical institutions, gutting the board of trustees at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC and targeting the Smithsonian Institution in an executive order in late March.
    


            In his order, Trump specifically identified the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum as carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.

Elon Musk's younger brother, Kimbal, took to X on Monday to lambaste President Donald Trump's tariffs, calling them a "structural, permanent tax on the American consumer." He also said Trump appears to be the "most high tax American President in generations."

"Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things," Kimbal Musk wrote on social network X, one the companies in his brother's extensive portfolio.

The younger Musk owns a restaurant chain called The Kitchen, is a board member at Tesla, and former director at SpaceX and Chipotle. He has also co-founded and invested in other food and tech startups, including Square Roots, an indoor farming company, and Nova Sky Stories, a creator of drone light shows that he bought from Intel.

Elon Musk is a top adviser to Trump, overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an effort to drastically cut federal spending, largely through layoffs, and consolidate or eliminate agencies and regulations. However, his relationship with some key figures in the Trump administration has been showing signs of strain in recent days as the president's sweeping tariffs have led to a dramatic selloff in stocks, including for Tesla, which is down 42% this year and just wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Over the weekend, Elon Musk took aim at Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, disparaging his qualifications in a post on X.

"A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing," Musk wrote, after Navarro told CNN on Saturday that, "The market will find a bottom" and that the Dow will "hit 50,000 during Trump's term." It's currently at about 38,200.

Musk also said that Navarro hasn't built "s--t." Navarro told CNBC on Monday that Musk is, "not a car manufacturer" but rather a "car assembler," dependent on parts from Japan, China and Taiwan.

Tesla was seeking a more moderate approach to trade and tariffs in a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative.

According to Federal Election Commission filings, Kimbal Musk this year has contributed funds to the Libertarian National Committee and Libertarian Party of Connecticut. Last year, while his brother became the biggest financial backer and promoter of Trump, Kimbal donated to Unite America PAC, a group that markets itself as a "a philanthropic venture fund that invests in nonpartisan election reform to foster a more representative and functional government."

A representative for Kimbal Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Monday that many business leaders believe the United States economy is already in a significant downturn.

"Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink said at an event for the Economic Club of New York.

"One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already," Fink added.

The asset management executive also said that he thinks the tariff policies of President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation and make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, as the central bank often does during recessions.

"This notion that the Federal Reserve is going to ease four times this year, I see zero chance of that. I'm much more worried that we could have elevated inflation that's going to bring rates up much higher than they are today," Fink said.

Pricing in the fed funds futures market currently suggests that traders expect the central bank to lower its benchmark interest rate by at least 1 percentage point by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which could be four cuts of 0.25 percentage point.

BlackRock as a firm held more than $11 trillion in assets as of the end of 2024, spread across public and private investments.

Fink's comments were broadcast on Bloomberg Television.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Trump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden.

Trump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the acquisition again to assist "in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate," according to a presidential action issued by the White House.

U.S. Steel shares spiked about 9% in reaction to the decision.

— Spencer Kimball

Restaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending.

Investors pulled back across restaurant segments, from fast food to full-service dining.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

"Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk," Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Read the full story.

— Amelia Lucas

U.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say.

The industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. And airline stocks have fallen as investor concerns have grown about Trump's tariff policies, among other things.

"The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be the reality six months from now," Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said.

TD Cowen, in a note Friday wrote, "We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist U.S. to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines."

"We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers," TD Cowen said.

— Leslie Josephs and Michele Luhn

A large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC — 69% — said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump's sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week.

And more than half of them said they expect that the downturn will come this year.

"This is the Trump recession," said one of the 22 CEOs who received the flash survey.

"Disappointingly stupid and illogical," another CEO said of the tariffs.

— Kevin Breuninger

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy.

"Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters," Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." 

Those non-tariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said.

Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a "small first start."

— Jesse Pound

Tech stocks wobbled after Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans.

Apple shares have tumbled more than 5%, Tesla shares are down about 4% and Microsoft shares have slipped more than 1%. Shares of Google are mostly flat, but Amazon, Nvidia and Meta are all up around 1%.

The Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff last week. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onset of the pandemic and entered a bear market.

--Ashley Capoot and Samantha Subin

Trump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News.

Trump's golf rounds in Florida are like "going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery," the official said.

"The economy will be fine," the official said.

— Dan Mangan

Trump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports.

Trump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the "reciprocal" duties unveiled at the White House last week.

Trump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand.

China's action came "despite my warning" that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs "will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set," Trump wrote.

"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"

— Kevin Breuninger

Two Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Union President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU.

"Let's take that deal," Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen's offer. "Much to gain."

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., replied in a tweet, writing, "Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee."

"At some point you have to take YES for an answer," Johnson wrote.

- Dan Mangan

U.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump's latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella.

Trump announced blanket 34% tariffs on Beijing last week, which come on top of existing 20% duties on Chinese imports.

Trump's latest tariff action would slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods, unless China drops its 34% retaliatory tariff on the U.S.

— Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella

Billionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. "will face ruin for years to come" if the Trump administration does not immediately "change course" on its tariff policies.

"The US government can still turn things around, but it must act in the next few hours," the Virgin Group co-founder wrote on X.

"This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come," he wrote.

— Kevin Breuninger

The White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days.

"Fake news," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council.

Trump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, "Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening."

"President Trump is not going to bend," Bartiromo said in the video.

- Dan Mangan

Trump writes that it's "not sustainable" for the U.S. to "lose $1.9 trillion on trade" in a post just now on Truth Social.

Trump's post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can't lose money on trade "and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations."

— Erin Doherty

Tesla shares are trading around 20% lower than they were when Lutnick urged people to "Buy Tesla" last month.

Lutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News.

"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap," Lutnick said. "It'll never be this cheap again."

As it turns out, it would be.

— Dan Mangan

Canada filed a dispute with the the World Trade Organization concerning Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts imported from Canada into the U.S.

Canada requested WTO dispute consultations with the U.S. concerning the new levies, the global trade organization said. The WTO says the request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the organization.

Consultations will give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO.

Canada claims the measures are inconsistent with the U.S.' obligations under various provisions of the "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade" of 1994.

— Michael Wayland

People who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November's election — and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market.

CNBC's All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters. 

And of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock.

— Dan Mangan

Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk's swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO's trade views and those of the Trump administration.

Navarro told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro "ain't built s---."

Musk appeared to delete that post.

But Musk kept up another post that said "a PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing," a shot at Navarro's alma mater.

"I'll probably see him today in the Oval. It's no big deal," Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk's comments.

Navarro praised Musk's work with DOGE on slashing government spending.

However, he then took a swipe at the billionaire.

"When it comes to tariffs and trade," Navarro said, Musk "is a car manufacturer — but he's not a car manufacturer, he's a car assembler."

Navarro noted that parts of the Tesla cars assembled at its Texas plant are from overseas.

"What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis," he said.

— Kevin Breuninger

"Countries from all over the World are talking to us," Trump wrote on Truth Social, and "tough but fair parameters are being set."

Trump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and "he is sending a top team to negotiate."

"They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs," Trump says in the post, adding, "it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!"

— Erin Doherty

Europe will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariffs.

"Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing.

"So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners." 

Von der Leyen mentioned existing deals with Mexico and Switzerland, and potential deals with India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Europe stands ready to respond to Trump's aggressive tariff agenda with counter measures if necessary, she said, but the region still stands "ready to negotiate" with the U.S. if possible.

— April Roach

Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump's plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all.

"Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won't take long," Navarro said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

He then pointed to the first Trump administration securing protective equipment faster than expected at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

"So don't tell me that America doesn't have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff," he said.

A CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more.

— Kevin Breuninger

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump's tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.

Dimon addresses the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, which has become closely read.

"Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, there are some – or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects," Dimon writes.

 "We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products."

"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," he adds.

Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.

His remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should "get over" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.

— Hugh Son

Elon Musk posted a video on X of Milton Friedman advocating for free trade, in one of the strongest examples yet of the billionaire SpaceX founder's break with Trump on tariffs.

Over the weekend, Musk publicly criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro.

He also said said he hopes Europe and the U.S. can move "to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone," during a virtual appearance at a meeting of Italy's far-right League party.

Musk's comments were at odds with Trump's hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports.

Musk is Trump's biggest campaign donor and the leader of DOGE, Trump's massive effort to slash the federal workforce.

Trump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months. 

— Erin Doherty

Markets across the globe continue to crash for a third day as a result of Trump's tariffs.

— Adam Jeffrey

Ackman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being "indifferent" to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it.

"It was unfair of me to lash out at @howardlutnick," writes Ackman.

"I don't think he is pursuing his self interest. I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don't know how the sausage was made."

The new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.

"I just figured out why @howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes," Ackman wrote Sunday night.

"It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It's an irreconcilable conflict of interest."

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump is touting the steep drop in oil prices — driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession — as a policy win.

"Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place," Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post.

"This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate," he writes. "They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!"

Trump also blames America's past leaders for "allowing this" to happen.

— Christina Wilkie

Trump has two significant public events on his schedule today.

11:00 a.m. ET: Trump will host the World Series-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House, according to his official schedule.

2:30 p.m. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House. 

The last time Netanyahu visited the White House was in February, as the U.S. worked to finalize the second phase of a cease fire deal in Gaza. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza.  

CNBC's latest CEO survey finds that a majority of the CEOs polled say they now expect a recession before the end of the year. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate.

One in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump's tariff policies.

Traders rushed to buy protection against dollar swings, pushing the cost of hedging to the highest level since Donald Trump's election last November.

The cost of one-week option contracts tied to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed for the third day in a row, and the eighth time in the last nine trading sessions, suggesting traders are positioning for more volatility ahead. The one-month hedge also rose.

In this article

Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

"We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand," UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

"Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk," Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped more than 2% and 3%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell close to 1% and shares of Wingstop sank 3%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.

Few restaurant stocks were in the green. Shares of Dutch Bros., a fast-growing rival of Starbucks, rose more than 3% in morning trading after tumbling nearly 10% on Friday. Cava gained more than 3%, while Domino's Pizza rose slightly.

Investors should look to the S&P 500's 200-week moving average for a potential support level as the market continues hemorrhaging, according to BTIG.

Jonathan Krinsky, the financial services firm's chief market technician, pointed to the S&P 500's 200-week moving average of 4,674 as a key level to watch. That is nearly 8% below where the large-cap stock index closed on Friday and would mean the index giving back all of last year's gain and falling to levels last seen in 2023, when it finished at 4,769.

Krinsky's insight comes as the S&P 500 has cratered on concern that President Donald Trump's imposition of higher tariffs is sparking a global trade war that will slow economic growth and shrink corporate profits. The S&P 500 has fallen more than 10% in just three trading days, bringing the benchmark index close to a bear market decline of 20% since the February all-time high. In response, multiple Wall Street firms have slashed their year-end targets for the S&P 500.

"We won't rehash all the extreme statistics of last week, but many metrics are at panic levels associated with meaningful bottoms over the past 40 years," Krinsky wrote to clients in a Sunday note. "The issue is when you get into the capitulation zone, markets often move beyond what many think is likely or possible."

A key reason for expecting that buying may emerge is the fact that the S&P 500 has seen sustained breaks below its 200-week moving average only two times over the past four decades, Krinsky said. Both took place during bear markets tied to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000-01 and the Great Recession of 2008-09.

No other declines over the past 40 years pushed the index to a point below the 200-week average, the chart watcher said.

In the 1987 crash, Krinsky noted that the S&P 500 bottomed around its 200-week moving average at the time. Back then, it would have "paid to buy into" the 200-week moving level, he said.

"We don't know if we get there, but if we do, history suggests it holds, at least initially," Krinsky said.

Apple has triumphed over an effort from the U.K. government to keep details secret of its appeal against an order to create a "backdoor" to iPhone users' data.

The U.K.'s Investigatory Powers Tribunal on Monday published a ruling dismissing the government's attempt to prevent details from a hearing on the appeal from being made public. The government had tried to keep the information secret on the grounds it posed risks to national security.

Judges Rabinder Singh and Judge Jeremy Johnson said in their ruling that the U.K. government's request to keep details of the hearing private "would be the most fundamental interference with the principle of open justice."

"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place," they said.

Britain's Home Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

The ruling relates to an appeal made by Apple against a demand from the U.K. government to allow officials to access iPhone users' encrypted data via a technical "backdoor."

This backdoor would allow the government to access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, which applies end-to-end encryption to a wide range of iCloud data.

Governments in the U.S., U.K. and EU have long expressed dissatisfaction with end-to-end encryption, arguing it enables criminals, terrorists and sex offenders to conceal illicit activity.

In the U.K., the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 empowers the government to compel tech companies to weaken their encryption technologies through so-called "backdoors" — a heavily controversial policy for both the tech industry and privacy campaigners.

Apple — which is known for its pro-privacy stance — has pushed back on efforts to weaken its encryption tools, saying this would undermine its security and put users at risk.

As a result of the government's order, Apple withdrew its ADP system for U.K. users in February. In a blog post at the time, the tech giant said it has "never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will."

"We are deeply disappointed that our customers in the UK will no longer have the option to enable Advanced Data Protection (ADP), especially given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple said in the post.

"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and we are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom."

In this article

Technology stocks teetered in volatile trading Monday as President Donald Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans following last week's devastating selloff.

The Magnificent Seven stocks —  Nvidia, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet — were largely lower after briefly rallying amid a short-lived broader market attempt to stage a rebound. Stocks temporarily  jumped on speculation of a possibly delay in the tariffs, but the White House later dismissed talk of a pause.

The technology sector is coming off a brutal week. The Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onslaught of the pandemic and entered a bear market.

Trump held firm on his aggressive global tariffs plans over the weekend, with an initial unilateral 10% tariff going into effect Saturday. Wall Street hoped for progress on negotiations between the administration and other countries or news of a possible delay in reciprocal tariffs slated for April 9.

The plan has already received widespread backlash in corporate America. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that the new levies will hike prices on domestic and imported goods and pressure the slowing U.S. economy. Many car companies have already announced a pause in shipments, price hikes and other measures. Trade groups have also warned of higher prices at the grocery store and hikes on electronics such as personal computers.

"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, downplaying the recent market meltdown.

Other technology stocks also looked to build on last week's pain. Oracle and Palantir Technologies declined more than 2% each.

Some semiconductor stocks also struggled as investors fretted over potential demand destruction stemming from the tariffs. Advanced Micro Devices was last down about 4% each, while Intel declined more than 2%.

In a wide-ranging letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he saw "stagflation" dangers slowing the economy as the stock market dropped in response to President Donald Trump's trade wars.

"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in the 58-page letter, which was released Monday and addressed various topics, including immigration and the state of civil discourse.

"While inflation has come down," he wrote, "most of what I see in the future is inflationary: continued high fiscal deficits, the remilitarization of the world and the need for infrastructure investment, including the green economy and the restructuring of trade and tariffs."

Dimon said he expected rising costs to create a "tug-of-war" over the direction of interest rates, with long-term borrowing costs ultimately heading higher. "All things being equal, the slower the growth, the lower the interest rates, and the higher the inflation, the higher the interest rates," he said.

He even referenced "stagflation," a term popularized before the turn of the century to describe an unpleasant cocktail of high inflation, high unemployment, and tepid economic growth.

"This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates," he wrote.

Dimon stopped short of saying the economy is headed for a recession. Following a two-day stock sell-off last week, the dreaded R-word has been on everyone's lips.

He also suggested that the stock market pain may not be over.

"No matter how you measure it, equity valuations are still well above their historical averages," he said, adding: "Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure."

The CEO's much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders comes as the leaders of corporations seek to understand where the economy — and the nation — is headed under Trump, who has bold plans for reorganizing the federal government and US foreign policy.

Dimon used his letter to opine on various problems facing the US, as well as prospective solutions.

"To be able to attack our problems at home and abroad, we must be strong. And our core strength is based upon our commitment to our values, as well as our ability to work hard and think intelligently about our problems," Dimon wrote, adding that he supported some policy positions of both Democrats and Republicans.

The letter also touched on what he deemed "common sense" solutions to the nation's problems, including tightening security at the border and doing away with special interests, or what he called "selfishness on the part of our citizens and elected officials."

Some Wall Street watchers have long suspected that the billionaire banker — a regular pontificator on world events — has harbored ambitions to seek public office, though he said last year that he would not seek a position in the Trump administration.

Dimon bemoaned the increasingly acrimonious tone infecting the public discourse. Indeed, he said that Americans are "meaner to each other" and that "a little more kindness and understanding would go a long way."

Dimon added: "I am a firm believer that we should constantly talk with each other, air our views, hold each other accountable and try to respect all sides of an argument." He said social media algorithms had amplified the problem.

JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion in profit in 2024 and has since called employees back to the office five days a week, a mandate that has led some employees to explore their options, including unionization.

Last year, the bank also earned a record $58.5 billion in net income, up from $49.6 billion the year before, it said in its earnings filings. The firm's stock is up about 6% over the past year, trading as of early April at about $210 a share.

Tesla fans are still waiting for a new Roadster — and now two ex-Tesla employees are launching an EV startup that could steal Elon Musk's thunder.

Musk promised the updated Tesla Roadster would be "the fastest production car ever made, period" when he unveiled it in 2017, but eight years later, the $200,000 rocket-boosted EV is nowhere to be seen, leaving some reservations holders with a serious case of buyers regret.

Daniel Davey and fellow Tesla veteran Mark Tapscott are looking to fill that void.

The two electric car enthusiasts founded British EV startup Longbow in 2023 along with Jenny Keisu, the former CEO of electric boat maker X Shore, and are now looking to disrupt their former employer with a range of lightweight electric sports cars.

Longbow's first vehicle will be the Speedster, a limited-production £84,995 ($112,000) open-top sports car that the company describes as a "statement of intent," with deliveries beginning next year.

That will be followed by the Roadster, a £64,995 ($85,500) production vehicle that serves as a nod to Elon Musk's infamously delayed supercar.

"The Tesla Roadster was announced in 2017. On the day, people were paying deposits by credit card there and then for $250,000. It was called the Tesla Roadster 2020," said Davey.

"We will deliver a Roadster before Tesla delivers a Roadster. And ours will be lighter and cooler," he added.

Davey and Tapscott joined Tesla in the early 2010s and helped launch the Roadster and the Model S, the brand's first two vehicles, in Europe — a process that was far from smooth.

"I was employee 650, spent some time in California, then came Europe with the Roadster back when there was no charging infrastructure, no one knew who Tesla or Elon was, and all of it was uphill," said Davey.

Tapscott says he joined Tesla after being wowed by the original Roadster. After contacting Musk and former Apple exec George Blankenship, he was tasked with selling the first two Model S vehicles in the UK.

"I was driving up and down the country, showing those cars to everybody, charging at whatever pub or hotel you could stop off at," said Tapscott, who worked for Tesla for seven years.

"The first ever test drive with the Model S in the UK, the guy turned up in his Ferrari, crashed the car, and pretty much wrote it off," he added.

The two Tesla veterans went on to work with a whos-who of EV companies, including Lucid, Hyundai, and Chinese automakers like BYD.

Davey, who returned to Tesla in 2018 to launch the Model 3 in Europe ("Elon was sleeping on the sofa, no one else at the company had any sleep," was how he described that period), told BI that harnessing their wealth of experience would be key to avoiding the fate of other failed EV startups.

"We have done this multiple times, and all our peers who could do this are moving their way up to Vice President/Senior VP level and working in VCs because they're not crazy enough to apply that knowledge at the beginning again," he said.

After a boom in the early 2020s, the past few years have seen numerous once-promising EV startups collapse as electric vehicle sales growth has slowed and funding has dried up.

Meanwhile, legacy automakers have also sought to launch increasingly affordable, mass-market electric offerings as they look to boost adoption and sales.

That makes it an unusual time to launch a mid-range electric sportscar — but Longbow's cofounders believe the lack of competition gives the startup an opening.

"It's a scandal that no one else is focusing on this segment," said Davey.

"We're passionate about the products in the segment, but from a logical perspective, it is the best place to be building cars. You have the best margins, and there is no competition," he added.

Tapscott said that Longbow's approach to building its cars was centered on the concept of "speed of lightness."

Rather than choosing to build the majority of components in-house — a process that has seen other startups like Tesla and Rivian face an EV "valley of death" as production has scaled up before profits — Longbow plans to buy most of its components off the shelf from outside suppliers.

Davey and Tapscott argue that will allow the startup to be more flexible, improve margins, and take advantage of an EV supply chain that is far more developed than when Tesla began building the first Roadster.

"We don't have to build a billion-dollar factory just to get a single motor," said Tapscott.

Although Longbow is making an effort to prioritize local suppliers in the UK, some of its supply chain will likely include Chinese EV tech.

Having worked with Chinese EV companies in the past, Tapscott and Davey described the technology coming out of the world's most competitive auto market as "breathtaking."

"A lot of components come from China, where it's appropriate, especially [battery] cells, right? We will leverage that," said Davey.

"But we really want to lean into and support the local supply chain," he said, adding that Longbow expects to finalize its supply chain nine months before deliveries begin in late 2026.

Davey and Tapscott declined to say how many reservations Longbow has received so far but described the response to the Speedster and the Roadster as highly encouraging.

"Tesla builds 2 million cars a year … but at some point, the disruptors become the disrupted," said Davey.

For weeks, the stars of "The White Lotus" have been tight-lipped about viewers' most burning question: Who dies?

That question was answered in the season three finale of the HBO hit, which aired on Sunday night — and some of the show's stars are finally getting to air their real feelings about their characters' fates.

Arguably no character has a more tragic arc in season three than Walton Goggins' long-suffering Rick. Rick arrives at the resort for a vacation with his younger girlfriend, Chelsea, but he's also there on a revenge mission against the man he believes killed his father.

Rick operates from pain and desperation. He's so obsessed with his past that he's often blind to the love Chelsea is offering him. In episodes seven and eight, he finally finds brief moments of absolution and lightness — moments of joy that are cut short when both he and Chelsea are killed off in the show's finale.

In the hours after the finale aired, Goggins took to Instagram to share a 235-word tribute to his character.

"Rick + Chelsea. With the heaviest of hearts… To me, ours was a love story. It was only ever a love story, hindered by unresolved, childhood trauma," Goggins wrote.

"We all have them… but can we move past them. In the depths of our despair there is always beauty around us. If we can sit with our pain, just sit with it… not react… not be defined by it…It's there… the love the world is constantly giving in any given moment is there," he continued.

A post shared by Walton Goggins (@waltongogginsbonafide)

Goggins thanked the show's creator, Mike White, writing, "Thank you Mike White for your imagination, your tender heart, for the privilege of giving us the opportunity to tell it."

He also thanked Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea, and Sam Rockwell, his scene mate and longtime friend.

The show was filmed over several months, primarily on the Thai island of Koh Samui. Wood told The Sunday Times that the cast accidentally found themselves going into Method acting during filming.

Season three featured both big names in Hollywood and some newcomers. Among the industry vets featured in this season are Parker Posey, Michelle Monaghan, and Jason Isaacs. The show pays all characters the same, non-negotiable salary.

Goggins' Instagram post after the finale aired drew reactions from fans, many of whom expressed love for the two ill-fated characters — and from at least one of his costars, Patrick Schwarzenegger.

"I'm crying," Schwarzenegger wrote on the post.

Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies.

In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a "free hall pass" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures.

"Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance," said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill.

The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days.

The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. 

Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health.

Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days.

The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets.

Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider.

For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, "likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks," the analysts wrote.

The Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties.

Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10.

The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week. At market close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 6%, the Dow was down 5.5%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 5.8%. Dow Jones futures fell 2.5% on Sunday night, pointing to another brutal session in the coming week.

On Monday, Asia stocks opened deep in the red. Japan's Nikkei plunged 6.5%, South Korean Kospi was down 4.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the worst hit and down 9.9% in the late morning.

"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X on Thursday. "The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion."

President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on April 2 — and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering.

Here's what big names in business and economics have been saying:

Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs "run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters." He added: "Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures."

He said the Business Roundtable "supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners" but called on him to introduce "additional reasonable exemptions" and a "transparent, predictable exclusion process."

"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much," Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. "The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion."

Summers added that the tariffs were the most expensive and "masochistic" the US had imposed in decades.

"The price action in global financial markets in the immediate aftermath of the US tariff announcement points to major worries about global economic growth," Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant PIMCO and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on X.

"These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs," Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's "Peston" program.

Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: "I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. This is not a buy-the-dip opportunity. It's a sell the dip opportunity."

"So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? What is with that adverb 'again' which is defined as 'returning to a previous condition'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don't all live at the average!)," David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, said on X.

"Have tariffs really stood in the way of wealth creation in America? I think the title should simply be the truth: 'Let's Make the World Poor Again' (and then we can buy it at a discount)," Rosenberg added.

Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the "Liberation Day" label was "Orwellian doublespeak."

"Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be — ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world," he said on X.

"He's gone full-on crazy," Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter.

"If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them," Krugman added.

"March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth," wrote Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column.

"Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings)," he added.

"The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.3% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household consumer loss of $3,800 in 2024$. Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,700," wrote the Yale Budget Lab in a new analysis published on April 2, shortly after Trump's blanket tariff announcement.

"Tthe United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries," said Jared Bernstein, the US's former chief economist, in his newsletter. "That means, as Trump has correctly argued, we can hurt them more than they can hurt us. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners."

"First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices — as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points — and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2," he added.

"Monstrously destructive, incoherent, ill-informed tariffs based on fabrications, imagined wrongs, discredited theories and ignorance of decades of evidence. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else," said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky.

"If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth," said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, on BlueSky.

"Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built," she added.

The latest set of tariffs is "a similar event to going off the gold standard in 1971. It's an epic event. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance," Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC.

"I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%," said Gross, who's also known as "Bond King."

Gross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to "catching a falling knife."

"Tariffs attack US trading partners but, in effect, attack US corporate profit margins first," wrote Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. "The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. The macro risk hitting markets is real, but only accentuates the devaluation process."

"Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising," Blitz wrote.

Jim O'Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the "sensible" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services.

He said this would be "very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in."

If the US wants to continue down this "kamikaze path," the UK will have to respond, O'Neill added. "It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves."

"Just had a journalist ask me to explain "Liberation Day," Stephanie Kelton, the author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. "I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets."

George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said in a Friday note that markets were pricing in a global recession.

"This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. The countries that respond the quickest and most forcefully to this shock are those whose currencies will likely be the most resilient. And, on the flipside, the more the US fiscal strategy under the Trump administration lacks visibility, the more the market will punish the dollar and US assets.

"One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. Remember that during the European supply-shock of 2022, the ECB turned hawkish. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed."

Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a "significant risk" to the global economy.

"We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth," she said in a statement on Thursday.

Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, told Ireland's Newstalk that the tariffs would be "negative the world over."

She said Trump's move "will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate."

Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, posted on X on Friday:

"The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Why not give them a chance? Make the 10pct min tariff immediate but defer the "reciprocal" part 6 mos. Take the win! The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!"

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations.

"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected," Powell said at a conference for business journalists. "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth."

The central bank president repeatedly said it was too early to tell what the Fed's response might be.

"We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said."

Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs, which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes "no economic sense."

"The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc," Corinth wrote. "But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold."

In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could "hit imminently and extend until next year" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate.

"Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario," he predicted.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV, veteran analyst Ed Yardeni said he hoped the "message that the stock market is sending to the administration is being heard."

"The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy," he added.

Brad Setser, the former senior advisor to the US trade representative and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the latest round of tariffs will be "painful."

"I think what the announcement on Wednesday showed is that the decision of the administration, not surprisingly, was to follow President Trump's instincts, not the instincts of his more moderate advisors, to go all in," Setser said on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast.

Setser said the goal is to "radically restructure the US and global economies using tariffs as a tool, with some flexibility perhaps to negotiate at the edges. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs."

Greg Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young, told Yahoo Finance that "the risk of a recession are very real" with the tariffs in place.

"The risks of a particularly severe recession are real, because if these tariffs remain in place on a persistent basis, you would see a drag on US economic activity worth about 1% to 1.5% of growth," he said. "In an economy that is expected to grow around 1.5%, that puts the economy essentially into stagnation. Add to that a 1% to 1.5% lift on inflation, and you have stagflation."

Douglas Irwin, the trade historian and economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in The Economist that Trump's tariffs "blow an enormous hole" in the trade policy that the US has advanced since World War II.

"The president now touts his tariffs as mainly 'reciprocal': 'Whatever they charge us, we charge them.' This makes them sound fair. Far from it," Irwin said.

"Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this week's events is the ability of one person to completely remake American trade policy. A situation in which the occupant of the White House can make such momentous changes on his own, unchecked, reflects serious political decay in American politics."

One day before Trump's latest tariff announcement, the economist Thomas Sowell told the Hoover Institution that the president's tariffs could lead to a global trade war.

"It's painful to see a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated," Sowell said. "If you set off a worldwide trade war, that has a devastating history."

"Everybody loses because everybody follows suit," he continued. "And all that happens is that you get a great reduction in international trade."

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on X that the US's global economic war against the world risks destroying confidence in America as a trading partner and investment destination.

Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square, suggested a 90-day time-out to negotiate and resolve "unfair asymmetric tariff deals." 

"If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate," wrote Ackman.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their probability for a US recession from 35% to 45% on a sharp tightening in financial conditions, overseas consumer boycotts, and a spike in policy uncertainty that will depress capital spending.

The forecast is based on their assumption that the effective tariff rate rises by 15 percentage points — which is less than what has been announced. If most of the tariffs take effect on Wednesday, that would raise the effective tariff rate by 20 percentage points. In that case, the analysts expect a recession, they wrote.

(Bloomberg) — Before the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets. Today we look at:

Good morning, this is Chiranjivi Chakraborty, an equities reporter in Mumbai. A bruising start to the week awaits traders as global markets continue to reel from the impact of President Trump's tariffs on global growth. While India has indicated that it does not plan to retaliate against Trump's levies, the knock-on impact from a slowing global economy and a potential US recession will keep volatility high.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is set to premiere Nicholas Bruckman's NFT documentary Minted in key global territories this week, including in North America.


	The film, subtitled The Rise (and Fall?) of the NFT, provides audiences with “a front-row seat to the explosive emergence of the turbulent NFT (non-fungible token) phenomenon as it erupts into a $40 billion digital gold rush.” It debuts Wednesday on Netflix in North America, the UK, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand.


Minted held its world premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival, followed by an international premiere at CPH:DOX in Copenhagen. It was broadcast on the PBS series Independent Lens earlier this year.

	In some sense, NFTs represent an inherent contradiction. They are digital assets – meaning, in theory, they can be reproduced endlessly and perfectly. But using block chain technology a single artwork or piece of music, for instance, can be made unique and therefore collectible. The market for NFTs took off four years ago, the timeframe when the documentary opens.

	“It begins with the artist known as Beeple, whose record-shattering $69 million digital art sale sends shockwaves through the traditional art world,” notes a release. “Following Beeple and a pioneering group of multidisciplinary artists from the U.S., Latin America, and Africa, Bruckman explores the soaring highs and chaotic lows of this polarizing movement as it unfolds, examining the intersection of technology, artistic expression, and value.”


	The release continues, “Against the backdrop of the NFT market's dramatic rise and collapse, Minted places the phenomenon within the broader arc of art history and offers a nuanced perspective on its evolution and enduring impact.”


	In a statement, Bruckman said, “I'm ecstatic to see Minted reach new audiences as it rolls out on Netflix. Love or hate NFTs, we hope the film entertains viewers and sparks big conversations about how art, finance, and tech are colliding.”


	By some estimates, the market for NFTs will reach more than $350 billion by 2032. But similar to cryptocurrency, it's a highly speculative enterprise, complicating any attempt at forecasts.


Minted is directed, written, and produced by Bruckman; produced and executive produced by Rahilla Zafar; and written and produced by Shawn Hazelett. The film is a production of Bruckman's film, TV, and branded content studio People's Television, Inc.

	











	Range Media Partners negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmaker, with global sales agency CAT&Docs handling international sales of the film.


	Bruckman's credits include the Emmy-nominated Not Going Quietly (PBS POV, Hulu) about the late activist Ady Barkan, and the immigration documentary La Americana (PBS America Reframed, Nat Geo).

 The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was established in March to oversee the adoption of blockchain technology and digital assets. 

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been appointed as an adviser to Pakistan's Crypto Council, a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing the country's embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets. 

The appointment was confirmed by Pakistan's finance ministry and reported by Bloomberg on April 7. Zhao will advise the regulatory body on cryptocurrency regulation, infrastructure and adoption, Bloomberg reported.

Zhao is one of the most recognizable names in crypto, having served as CEO of Binance between 2017 and 2023. He resigned as CEO of the exchange in November 2023 after pleading guilty to charges related to violating US money laundering laws. He was later sentenced to four months in prison. 

For Pakistan, Zhao is a high-profile appointment that could potentially help the country lure foreign investment in an industry that has taken on new strategic importance.

In March, the CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council, Bilal bin Saqib, told Bloomberg that the country plans to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital assets.

“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” Saqib said. “We want to attract international investment because Pakistan is a low-cost high-growth market with [...] a Web3 native workforce ready to build.”

Pakistan has long been considered a potential hub for crypto adoption due to its growing population, large diaspora and thriving black market for foreign exchange trades. 

The value of cash sent to Pakistan through formal remittance channels surged at the end of last year amid a countrywide crackdown on black market dollar trades.

“This increase might be because remittances that had previously been sent using the black market are now being sent via official channels,” John Ashbourne, an economist at Fitch Solutions, told Bloomberg. 

Pakistan ranked highly in Chainalysis' 2024 crypto adoption index, largely due to strong retail adoption and transactions at centralized services.

Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto's most prominent use cases in regions with high demand for US dollars due to currency depreciation.

Although data on stablecoin usage in Pakistan is slim, a 2023 KuCoin survey revealed that 33% of local crypto investors use digital assets to hedge against the rupee's devaluation. 

A more recent survey conducted by Bitget found that 46% of respondents in South Asia — a region that includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and others — use digital assets for speed and accessibility of transactions.

Ethereum faced heightened selling pressure for a lengthy period due to the volatility in the broader crypto market, causing its price to undergo a sharp pullback close to the $1,400 mark. However, recent trends show that ETH seems to be entering a calmer phase as bulls are gradually taking control of the market in anticipation of a rebound.

Although Ethereum's price has declined sharply below key support levels, investors' sentiment is starting to shift toward a more positive outlook. A report from Darkfost, an on-chain data and technical expert, reveals bullish behavior from investors on one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance.

As reported by Darkfost, ETH is showing early signs of a potential turnaround to a calmer phase on Binance, as selling pressure appears to be slowly fading. This suggests a decrease in the amount of ETH being offloaded by traders and investors on the platform, marking an encouraging moment for the altcoin and its price trajectory.

The drop in sell-side pressure on the crypto exchange is a sign that bears or sellers are losing control of the market after a period of intense downward movement in ETH's price. Darfost revealed the development after a thorough examination of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric on Binance. 

Specifically, the taker buy-sell ratio is a key metric that compares the volume of buy orders to the volume of sell orders in the order book. Furthermore, it aids in visualizing the prevailing tendency, which appears to be changing at the moment.

A 7-day Simple Moving Average (SAM) view of the taker buy-sell ratio shows that the volume has flipped into positive territory, rising above level 1. Looking at the chart, the recent move above the level marks the third time since the beginning of this year, indicating investors' resilience in volatile periods.

In the meantime, the easing selling pressure may act as a launchpad for price stabilization or a price recovery in the short term as bullish momentum picks up. Darkfost highlighted that it might contribute to the formation of a bottom and, at the very least, temporarily stop the bloodbath in Ethereum if the pattern persists.

However, the expert noted that the trend is still too weak to make any clear conclusions, even though it is an encouraging sign for Ethereum's price dynamics. Thus far, Investors are closely monitoring whether bulls can take advantage of the change and propel ETH toward a short-term recovery.

The easing selling pressure might have raised the possibility of ETH experiencing a rebound in the short term. However, the altcoin‘s pullback is more likely to extend after its recent drop below a key chart pattern.

Following his examination of Ethereum's price action, Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst, has identified a massive multi-year Triangle formation, which ETH has fallen below. According to the analyst, its break below the pattern would lead to an extension of the ongoing pullback, with ETH dropping as low as $1,105 in the upcoming months.

Strategy is not expecting a first-quarter profit, given billions of dollars in unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, the company said on Monday.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm—formerly known as MicroStrategy—said the value of its Bitcoin holdings fell $5.91 billion on paper in the first quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our digital assets,” the company said, adding that a $1.69 billion tax benefit should partially offset its unrealized losses in the first quarter.

Over the past week, Strategy did not purchase any more Bitcoin, leaving its holdings unchanged at 528,185 Bitcoin, worth around $41.3 billion. In the first quarter, Strategy spent $7.7 billion on Bitcoin, scooping the asset up for an average price of around $95,000 per coin.

As U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have battered risk-on assets, Bitcoin's price has dropped to a five-month low. Around noon Eastern Time, the leading digital asset was changing hands around $78,200, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Since Strategy started buying Bitcoin in 2020, the company has spent $35.6 billion on the asset, acquiring it for an average price of $67,485 per Bitcoin, according to Saylor Tracker. Based on that average Bitcoin price, Strategy is up around 16.5% on its bet.

Strategy has taken on $8.2 billion worth of debt to buy more Bitcoin than it could otherwise, while issuing products like convertible debt and perpetual preferred stock. Between its so-called “Strife” and “Strike” offerings, Strategy is required to pay $146 million in dividends annually.

Before it became a Bitcoin-buying machine, Strategy was known for its enterprise analytics software business, which “has not generated positive cash flow” in recent periods and may not help it satisfy its financial obligations, according to the company.

In order to fulfill its financial obligations, Strategy said it plans to take on more debt, issuing common shares, or conduct more offerings of preferred stock and convertible debt.

Strategy hasn't had a profitable quarter since the company posted an earnings per share of $0.32 on $124 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to Macrotrends.

On Monday, Strategy shares fell 10.6% to $262, according to Yahoo Finance. While notably off from last year's peak of $543, it was still above its Election Day price of $233.

Crypto markets have been flipping the script again. Bitcoin is teasing those all-time highs, and suddenly every altcoin looks like it's waking up from hibernation. Whale activity is back, and major players are throwing serious money at projects with real utility. With the next bull run potentially around the corner, smart community members are scouring the market for the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—and there's no shortage of contenders.

What sets Qubetics ($TICS) apart is how it's fixing one of crypto's biggest headaches—blockchain interoperability. It's not just slapping together buzzwords but offering a real-world solution that's already grabbing attention. Alongside Qubetics, Render and Theta are pushing their own tech limits, giving this list some serious heavy hitters ready to shine when the market explodes. Let's dive into the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Qubetics is making waves by solving one of blockchain's nastiest problems—getting separate networks to talk to each other. Its interoperability framework is built to make data, assets, and applications move seamlessly between blockchains, unlocking a whole new level of utility.

Think about a Toronto-based NFT creator wanting to sell digital art on a Solana marketplace while their assets sit on Ethereum. With Qubetics, they don't need a middleman or deal with double fees. The platform's AI-driven QubeQode IDE handles it, shifting assets across networks without breaking a sweat. Or picture a North Carolina logistics firm wanting to manage shipments on VeChain but needing payments processed on Polygon. Qubetics makes that combo possible—smooth, fast, and secure.



For small businesses, professionals, and regular folks tired of getting stuck in one ecosystem, this is a game-changer. It means no more worrying if a project's on the wrong chain or missing out on opportunities because of network limitations.

Right now, the Qubetics crypto presale is lighting up the scene. It's in stage 29, and over 506 million $TICS tokens are already out there, snapped up by more than 24,300 holders. The presale pulled in a solid $15.8 million. And here's the kicker: $TICS is still sitting at just $0.1573 per token.

Analysts aren't holding back either. If $TICS touches $1 post-presale, backers are looking at a 535% ROI. A $5 jump spikes it to 3,078%. At $6, it's a wild 3,713%. Some see it blasting to $10 or even $15 once the mainnet drops—which would mean 6,256% to 9,434% returns. Try finding another project throwing down numbers like that.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics isn't just a whitepaper fantasy. Its real-world interoperability solution is built for the long haul, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Render has been turning heads in the digital art and AI scene. With more demand for graphics rendering than ever—from Hollywood studios to indie game developers—Render's decentralized GPU network steps in where traditional services choke.

Lately, Render's been scoring major partnerships and expanding its use cases. The platform's supporting AI-generated content, AR/VR projects, and even big-time animation studios. With Nvidia GPUs priced like luxury cars, Render gives artists, designers, and creators affordable access to serious horsepower.

The token's performance reflects that buzz. RNDR has been climbing the charts, riding bullish sentiment driven by the explosion of AI and digital content. More creators are locking in Render as their go-to platform, and community members are taking notice.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Render's growing relevance in AI, virtual production, and digital content makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. This project isn't just following trends—it's leading them.



Theta has always been about flipping the script on video streaming. Instead of relying on centralized servers that cost a fortune and lag under pressure, Theta uses a decentralized model where users share bandwidth and resources—and get paid for it.

Recently, Theta rolled out its EdgeCloud platform, boosting its capabilities way beyond just streaming. It now supports AI computing, edge rendering, and video-based AI agents. In plain English? It's gearing up to dominate the next phase of internet content delivery.

Partnerships with major media outlets and sports organizations keep pouring in, and the community's backing is growing fast. THETA token holders are loving the network's new use cases, and buyers are snapping up tokens expecting a serious surge once the market heats up again.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Theta's taking on a massive industry with a solution that actually works. Its evolution into edge computing and AI-backed content delivery locks it in as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Finding the best altcoins to buy for next bull run isn't about chasing hype—it's about locking in projects solving real problems. Qubetics is breaking blockchain barriers with next-level interoperability. Render's changing how graphics rendering and AI content are created, while Theta is pushing video streaming and edge computing into the future.

With Qubetics' crypto presale heating up and Render and Theta setting up for major growth, these three look like serious contenders. Community members aiming to ride the next bull run won't want to sit this one out.

Qubetics delivers game-changing interoperability while offering huge ROI potential in its ongoing presale.

Render's decentralized GPU network is booming thanks to rising demand in AI, gaming, and digital content creation.

Theta's EdgeCloud now powers AI computing, edge rendering, and advanced content delivery—making it a serious contender.

Analysts predict $10-$15 after mainnet launch, which could mean over 9,434% ROI for early backers.

All three solve major real-world problems with proven use cases, making them the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

A widely followed analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) could break out of its slump with a massive counter-trend rally.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 890,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical trends, a huge test is coming for the top crypto asset by market cap, one that could see it skyrocket after it dips to its 2024 highs near the $72,000 level.

According to Cowen, BTC has immediate support near the March 2024 highs, but may also tap a previous downward resistance line currently at around $60,000.

“I'm still thinking that there's a good chance that Bitcoin will retest the 2024 high, and if it tests that trend line, sort of the lower high trend line, it would probably be a good short-term trade.

If it were to test that trend line all the way down, [it] would be a really good short-term trade by Bitcoin. You probably get a massive counter-trend rally off of that level, but I wouldn't necessarily be that optimistic for the remainder of the cycle if it were to in fact play out like that.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $75,366, down nearly 8% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin mining stocks are taking it on the chin alongside broader equity markets as competition ramps up to an all-time high and traders panic-sell equities amid tariff-led uncertainties. 

Most mining stocks fell more than 10% on Monday, adding to last week's sell-off. MARA Holdings (MARA) fell nearly 11%, Riot Platforms (RIOT) slumped about 8%, and CleanSpark (CLSK) dropped 10% in early Monday U.S. trading. Other crypto-linked stocks, such as Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), also slid more than 10%.

Read more: Strategy Treads Water on BTC Bet, While Metaplanet, Semler Reel From Heavy Losses The sell-off comes as traders around the world panic-sell most asset classes, with equities hit the hardest. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs added uncertainties to the market and a trade war with China added more concerns for the miners. 

Currently, Chinese manufacturers hold the lion's share of the market for the machines most miners use to mine for their block rewards. If the tariffs hold, they will likely make mining more expensive for those who are already navigating higher energy costs and lower profit margins following the recent halving that cut their rewards by half.

Adding to the pain, the Bitcoin network's computing power — a measure of competition for the miners — hit a new all-time high of 1 zettahash per second (1 ZH/s) on Friday, according to data from Glassnode. The previous record was set on Jan. 31, when the network hit 975 exahashes per second (EH/s).

As the competition ramped up, the bitcoin price has fallen from the recent high of over $109,000 to $77,0000, pressuring mining revenue. Hashprice, a measure of daily income relative to hash power — has fallen to a record low $42.40, squeezing the miners even further.

 Strategy paused Bitcoin purchases last week as BTC fell below $87,000, disclosing a $5.91 billion unrealized loss in Q1, according to SEC filings. 

Michael Saylor's firm Strategy, the world's largest publicly listed corporate holder of Bitcoin, did not add to its BTC holdings last week as the cryptocurrency's price dropped below $87,000.

In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7, Strategy announced it made no Bitcoin (BTC) purchases during the week of March 31 to April 6.

The decision followed a week of heightened market volatility, with BTC surging to as high as $87,000 on April 2 after starting the week at around $82,000, according to data from CoinGecko.

BTC fell below $80,000 on April 6, a significant discount from the average BTC price of Strategy's previous 22,000 BTC purchase announced on March 31.

In the period from March 31 to April 6, Strategy also did not sell any shares of class A common stock, which it tends to use for financing its Bitcoin buys, the filing stated.

As of April 7, Strategy held an aggregate amount of 528,185 Bitcoin bought at $35.6 billion, or at an average price of 67,458 per BTC, it added.

An excerpt from Strategy's Form 8-K report. Source: SEC

“Our unrealized loss on digital assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was $5.91 billion, which we expect will result in a net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, partially offset by a related income tax benefit of $1.69 billion,” the filing added.

While Strategy avoided buying Bitcoin last week, its co-founder and former CEO, Saylor, continued posting about the crypto asset's superiority on social media.

“Bitcoin is most volatile because it is most useful,” Saylor wrote in an X post on April 3, soon after BTC tumbled from the intra-week high of $87,100 on April 2 below $82,000, following the tariffs announcement by US President Donald Trump.

“Today's market reaction to tariffs is a reminder: inflation is just the tip of the iceberg,” Saylor wrote in another X post.

“Capital faces dilution from taxes, regulation, competition, obsolescence, and unforeseen events. Bitcoin offers resilience in a world full of hidden risks,” he added.

Economic tariffs could be helped with technology.

Blockchain and AI may soon feel the effects of sweeping changes in global trade policies, as tariffs became the talk of the town in April 2025—and not just in trade circles. The U.S. rolled out a sweeping new set of tariffs, creating ripples throughout global supply chains. Almost every imported product now faces at least a baseline 10% duty, but some nations felt the pinch more than others.

China, in particular, saw significant hikes with tariffs reaching up to 54% on critical sectors like electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar cells. Vietnam didn't escape either, with a hefty 46% tariff impacting its key exports—think textiles and electronics. Vietnam is now looking at discussions and negotiations on the tariffs along with 50 other countries that have reached out to US for negotiations.

Europe, Japan, and India weren't left out of the tariff wave either, facing new duties of 20%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. And if you're shopping for a new ride, take note: a 25% tariff now hits all imported automobiles, affecting nearly half of U.S. auto sales.

The reaction? China responded swiftly, implementing a 34% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. imports starting April 10, 2025. These changes aren't just numbers—they're shaking up trade relationships, causing uncertainty, and forcing businesses everywhere to rethink their global strategies.

For companies shipping electronics from Vietnam to the U.S., these shifting trade policies aren't just headlines—they're operational headaches. Imagine you're running a supply chain for a hardware startup. Your team scrambles to determine whether the latest tariff rates affect your products, and if so, by how much. Meanwhile, your CFO asks whether rerouting production to another country would save millions. This is where emerging tech—AI and blockchain—steps in, not as buzzwords, but as lifelines.

Artificial Intelligence can digest complex tariff codes and regulatory changes in real time, flagging risks before goods even leave the port. Blockchain, on the other hand, acts as a digital notary, locking in proof of where products were made, how they moved, and who handled them. Together, these technologies offer a smarter way to handle global trade friction.

Circle back to that hardware company. With AI models constantly scanning trade databases and tariff announcements, the logistics team can get immediate updates on the best shipping routes and cost projections. Blockchain ensures that customs officers—and auditors—can verify the country of origin without endless paperwork or risk of fraud. The time and cost savings are huge, but the real win is agility.

Tariffs, by nature, are unpredictable. They change with political winds, react to global events, and often lack the clarity needed for confident decision-making. Businesses operating on tight margins can't afford guesswork. In this new era, having a digital infrastructure that supports transparent, automated, and verifiable decisions isn't just smart—it's necessary.

Across the globe, startups and innovators are already working on this. Take OpenSC, an Australia-based platform that tracks products from origin to shelf using blockchain. By scanning a simple QR code, buyers—and regulators—can trace exactly where a good came from. In a tariff-heavy landscape, that level of transparency could mean the difference between paying a 25% duty or none at all.

Similarly, Everledger, a U.K.-based company, is applying blockchain to authenticate the origin of diamonds and other luxury goods. Now imagine applying that same concept to industrial goods—steel, semiconductors, lithium batteries—where origin determines tariff rates. What if every bolt, battery, or board came with a blockchain-verified passport?

AI isn't sitting idle either. Predictive models are already helping companies assess the long-term cost implications of sourcing from one country over another. If tariffs on Vietnamese semiconductors jump next quarter, an AI model could suggest alternatives in real time—backed by real trade data, not assumptions. This allows companies to pivot faster, avoid disruptions, and maintain compliance.

Recent research by the World Trade Organization found that misclassification of goods contributes to billions in lost revenue annually. AI's ability to detect errors or fraud in trade documentation can help minimize those losses dramatically. A 2022 McKinsey report noted that combining AI and blockchain in customs and compliance systems could reduce processing costs by 30% or more, while increasing speed and accuracy.

There are even efforts underway to tackle the misuse of origin labeling, a tactic sometimes employed to dodge tariffs. Blockchain's immutable ledger makes it virtually impossible to forge shipment logs or fake a product's origin. AI can then audit this data for inconsistencies or red flags, alerting compliance teams before issues become legal problems.

While AI can analyze tariffs and blockchain can secure records, there's a critical missing piece: verification. That's where technologies like Truebit come in. Truebit's verification layer adds computational transparency—ensuring AI systems calculating tariffs are themselves accountable. This is vital in scenarios like the Trump administration's complex tariff structure, which included universal rates around 10% and country-specific duties, such as Cambodia's 49%.

Truebit is already deployed in real-world supply chains. It supports Quadrans, the blockchain behind the EU-funded TRICK project, a €8 million initiative tracking cross-border textile and food supply chains. "While blockchains can immutably record shipping records, and AI can analyze tariff patterns, there's a critical verification gap between them,” said Jason Teutsch, Founder and Chief Scientist at Truebit.

“Companies need proof that the AI's calculations themselves are trustworthy, especially with tariffs now ranging from 10% to nearly 50% depending on the country of origin. Like a notary for computational processes, verification technology can create proof that an AI system correctly applied the correct tariff rates and pulled data from legitimate sources – something customs authorities are increasingly demanding."

Davide Costa, co-founder of the Quadrans Foundation, reinforced this with his experience: “We discovered that blockchain alone wasn't enough when tracking products across international borders. The moment data moves between systems or undergoes AI analysis, verification becomes critical. Verification technology ensures that customs authorities and trading partners can trust not just the records, but the calculations and transformations applied to that data—essential when regulatory compliance and billions in tariffs are on the line.”

Even new stealth startups like Robotax are being built around this pain point. "The Trump administration's tariff reciprocity plan has a blind spot: we can't actually prove products are taxed correctly,” said David Deputy, a finance and regulatory tax software professional. “Blockchain can track a product moving from Nigeria to France to the USA, but it can't verify if the correct tariffs and sales or VAT tax were actually applied at each step. This is where computational verification becomes essential."

So, what does this look like in action? A company exporting textiles from Southeast Asia might deploy a system where every step—from fabric sourcing to final packaging—is logged on-chain. AI monitors the data flow, scanning for anomalies or mismatches against tariff rule sets. If a discrepancy arises, the system flags it before the shipment ever leaves the dock. That's not just smart—it's transformative.

The future of tariffs doesn't have to be murky. Yes, global trade will always be shaped by diplomacy and politics, but how businesses navigate those waters can be upgraded. Blockchain and AI give companies the tools not just to react—but to plan, adapt, and lead.

As countries tighten regulations and implement digital customs systems, the companies that win will be those who lean into innovation. Tariffs may never go away—but the confusion, inefficiency, and risk associated with them? That can.

It's time for businesses to stop fighting yesterday's trade wars with outdated tools. The new era of global trade demands tech that's proactive, predictive, and permanent. Blockchain and AI don't just offer a way through the tariff storm—they offer a way forward.

Bitcoin hovered below the $77,000 level in early Monday trading as the broader crypto market downturn deepened. Losses extended across altcoins, with major ones like Ether, XRP, and Solana suffering double-digit losses ahead of the US stock market opening.

Bitcoin fell below $75,000 today, its lowest level since November, as crypto markets tumbled amid growing concerns over President Trump's new global tariff policies impacting Asian markets, CoinGecko data shows.

The crypto market selloff intensified with major altcoins posting severe losses.

Ether dropped 17% to trade under $1,400, levels not seen in March 2023. The sharp price drop forced the liquidation of an Ethereum whale, who suffered losses surpassing $100 million.

XRP declined 16% to $1.7, with its market cap falling to $102 million and losing its position among the top three crypto assets. Solana and Dogecoin each fell 16%, while Cardano dropped 15%.

Binance Coin and TRON showed more resilience, declining 8% and 6% respectively. The total crypto market capitalization decreased by over 10% to $2.5 trillion, representing approximately $100 billion in lost value within 10 hours.

The decline coincided with sharp falls on Asian stock markets. Taiwan's benchmark index plunged nearly 10%, its largest single-day drop since 1990.

Shares of major Taiwanese companies like TSMC and Foxconn tumbled nearly 10%, triggering automatic trading halts. In response, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) introduced temporary short-selling restrictions in an effort to stabilize the market.

The ripple effect was felt across the region. Japan's Nikkei index plunged over 8% on April 7, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index sank roughly 12%. China's CSI 300 Index also dropped sharply, falling 7%.

In South Korea, the Kospi shed more than 5% early in the session, prompting a five-minute circuit breaker. Singapore's Straits Times Index wasn't spared either, slipping nearly 8%.

Markets in Australia and New Zealand followed the downtrend. The ASX 200 in Australia dropped 6.3%, and New Zealand's NZX 50 slid more than 3.5%.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, said Monday he's been actively purchasing Bitcoin while maintaining a cautious stance on altcoins.

“Been nibbling on $BTC all day, and shall continue,” Hayes said, indicating an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy amid market volatility.

The analyst points to cheaper altcoins but expects Bitcoin's dominance – its share of the total crypto market cap – to increase towards 70%, implying Bitcoin's market-leading gains.

“Shitcoins are getting in our strike zone,” he said, “but I think #bitcoin dominance keeps zooming towards 70%. So we are not gorging at the shitcoin supermarket.”

Hayes reiterated that the catalyst for Bitcoin's growth is the central banks' continued use of monetary stimulus in response to economic slowdowns.

              Highlights            



                        Traditional financial institutions are now handling hundreds of billions of dollars in blockchain transactions, underscoring how the cryptocurrency space is maturing.                      


                        The integration of AI tools offers the potential for enhancing crypto literacy, compliance and the fight against illicit financial activity.                      


                        Stablecoins play a key role in mainstream adoption, but the absence of a federal framework for stablecoins makes it difficult for financial services and enterprises to scale adoption.                      

File this under things you couldn't say two years ago: Blockchain technology is maturing, and its potential for compliant, mainstream use is growing.

“Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Karen Webster.

In particular, Levin said the adoption of stablecoins is one of the most significant shifts in blockchain usage, at least since Chainalysis began in 2014. The shift has been monumental. Now, hundreds of billions of dollars move across blockchains while being stored in traditional financial institutions like banks or United States treasuries.

“When we started the business in 2014, that wasn't yet a concept,” he said. “Cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain, including the U.S. dollar.”

Yet, challenges remain around global policy frameworks and the integration of concurrent advances such as artificial intelligence into on-chain ecosystems.

There is a push for a federal framework around stablecoins, and it's important for industry confidence Levin said.

“Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” he said, adding that as the conversation around crypto regulation evolves, providing clarity, compliance and insight will become more critical.

Chainalysis, a blockchain data company, was founded with a mission to illuminate the traditionally opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. Over a decade later, it boasts a dataset spanning 70 countries, capable of providing deep insights into how crypto is used, abused and regulated.

As it relates to the growth of stablecoins, tracking real dollars rather than merely crypto tokens has broadened the scope of blockchain monitoring. This evolution has transformed blockchain from a niche technology to a mainstream component of financial infrastructure, Levin said.

“What we are starting to see with OCC guidance and SEC guidance … is that this is something that is going to be possible for banks to do,” he said. “We now track not just cryptocurrency tokens, but … real dollars that are being used to settle financial transactions, remittances and payments all across the world on these rails.”

Still, a persistent criticism of cryptocurrency is its alleged use in illicit activities, and scams and fraud remain separate challenges. Estimates from Chainalysis highlight that between $10 billion and $12 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions annually are linked to scams.

Chainalysis is uniquely positioned to monitor the entire “supply chain of scam activity,” offering insight into how scammers procure tools and sell illicit services, Levin said.

“We've helped the government seize more than $10 billion worth of crypto assets from criminal proceeds,” he said.

There has also been progress made in combatting the use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for money laundering and other financial crimes.

“The cryptocurrency transactions that we've been able to link to those types of activities is actually a smaller percentage of the overall activity,” he said. “It started off much higher, but now it's consistently below 1% of the transactions that we can associate directly to these types of actors.”

This decline is largely thanks to improved regulation and the ability of blockchain monitoring tools to help detect illicit transactions more accurately when compared to many traditional financial systems.

One area of excitement shared by stakeholders within the Web3 ecosystem is the potential for AI to improve crypto literacy and compliance. Despite the inroads blockchain has made to date, widespread misunderstandings about the technology's opacity persist.

“Even the people who are advocating for the technology … don't also advocate for the fact that cryptocurrency has been much more effective as a tool for both enterprises identifying risky activity off-boarding bad clients from their platforms and law enforcement being able to hold scammers to account,” Levin said.

Chainalysis itself continues to invest in educating enterprises about how blockchain works, using AI to simplify complex concepts for regulators and industry participants.

“I'm very optimistic about the potential for AI to actually contextualize some of the transactions and concepts for people,” Levin said.

“We still got work to do,” he added. “But the progress is real. And the potential is enormous.”

Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency has signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. According to the agency, Binance will assist Kyrgyzstan in several key areas, including the development of blockchain infrastructure and the creation of a national cryptocurrency reserve.

The partnership will also focus on training young professionals, government employees, and specialists in blockchain technologies, virtual asset management, and cybersecurity. In addition, Binance will provide support in establishing a management system for virtual assets and blockchain technology in Kyrgyzstan source.

While public interest in cryptocurrencies continues to grow in Kyrgyzstan, the market remains poorly regulated. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce proposed legislation to create licensed crypto banks that would offer regulated banking services related to digital assets. The ministry stressed the need to integrate crypto assets into the national financial system, citing the rapid advancement of digital technology and the economic potential of legalizing cryptocurrency transactions. The introduction of crypto banks is expected to increase transaction volumes, boost tax revenues, and create new jobs in the fintech sector, positioning Kyrgyzstan as a regional hub for financial innovation.

In a separate move to stabilize the sector, Kyrgyzstan's Cabinet of Ministers significantly raised the minimum authorized capital required for crypto exchanges, from 100 million KGS to 10 billion KGS, a hundredfold increase. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce, which initiated the reform, stated that the measure is designed to ensure the financial stability of crypto platforms, safeguard user interests, and foster a transparent and secure virtual assets market. Existing exchanges have until January 1, 2026, to comply with the new capital requirements.

US

The tool is being touted as a digital safety net for artists in a fast-evolving tech era.

A pair of artists have launched a new app aimed at helping creators secure their work against the growing reach of artificial intelligence, as concerns mount over AI's use of human-generated content.

The app, named ARK, was developed by screenwriter Ed Bennett-Coles and songwriter Jamie Hartman. It uses blockchain technology to log creative ownership from concept to completion, offering a decentralised safeguard for writers, musicians, and other creators.

“AI is coming in and taking jobs,” Hartman told AFP. “This is our work. It's human. And we decide what it's worth.”

The platform allows users to register demos, scripts or any creative file, with additional features like biometric verification, NDAs, and blockchain time stamps designed to help prove ownership. It also enables collaborators to track their contributions in real time.

Bennett-Coles said the idea was born from his “career death moment” after reading about AI's first attempt at screenwriting back in 2008. Now, nearly two decades later, ARK aims to offer a solution by “ring-fencing” the creative process.

The app, set for a full launch in summer 2025, has secured investment from Claritas Capital and partnered with performing rights organisation BMI.

Its creators hope it will stand up in court as legal proof of authorship via blockchain-backed “smart contracts”.

“Copyright is a good principle—if you can prove it,” Hartman said. “Why not update how that's done?”

The initiative reflects growing unease in the creative sector over AI's rapid adoption and its potential to undercut traditional forms of artistic labour.

“Growth for growth's sake is the philosophy of the cancer cell,” Bennett-Coles said, adding that AI often dismisses the value of the creative journey.

The developers argue ARK is not just a tool, but a necessary defence mechanism for creators in the digital age.

Ethereum and Solana prices collapsed Monday morning as President Trump's sweeping new tariffs sparked a global market selloff and pushed crypto liquidations past $1.4 billion.

At press time the Ethereum price has shed 16.4%, dribbling down to $1,485 after briefly touching its lowest price since October 2023 during Asian trading hours.

Meanwhile, the Solana price has plummeted 15.4% on the day, dipping as low as $96.70, before gaining ground to $101 at the time of writing, while Cardano's price dropped by 15.2% to $0.5412.

The broad-based crypto market sell-off intensified in lockstep with futures markets, with S&P 500 contracts plunging 5.98% and Nasdaq futures dropping 6.2% by Sunday night, over a whirlwind weekend that saw equities markets responding with "circuit breaker" measures.

Fears of a global trade war deepened following Trump's "Liberation Day" pronouncements of a universal 10% tariff on nearly all imports, with targeted penalties reaching 34% for China and 20% for European Union goods.

Crypto markets "reeled from a sharp pullback" as Trump's reciprocal tariffs sent countries "scrambling to renegotiate trade terms," Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt.

"The uncertainty dragged Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) into a steep downtrend," Liu explained, adding that the price skid "smells of profit-taking, as traders offload risk in the face of mounting macro tensions."

All these factors have been "amplifying global economic jitters and weighing heavily on sentiment across the altcoin space," Liu noted.

Over at Myriad Markets, an on-chain predictions platform launched by Decrypt parent company DASTAN, over 61% of punters see a U.S. recession within the year. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Trump's moves "demand Federal Reserve interest rate cuts" to address the challenges ahead, Ryan Yoon, senior research analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt.

As key inflation indicators such as the CPI and PPI get released, the Federal Reserve would likely "find it difficult to implement rate cuts in the near future," Yoon said. That prospect "suggests limited potential for short-term market improvement," he explained.

Yoon points to a critical juncture over how tariff conflicts have expanded from previous points of tension.

"While previous tariff conflicts primarily involved the US and China, the current situation has expanded to affect global markets more broadly," Yoon noted. Such a predicament "necessitates close attention to negotiations and outcomes" over a longer period.

But for the meantime, crypto market sentiment has deteriorated and fast, with the broader class of investors surveyed by the American Association of Individual Investors showing "unusually low" bullish sentiment as bearish sentiments run to 61.9%—the third highest reading on record.

A whale's Ethereum worth $105 million was liquidated after ETH dropped $1,650, despite the whale adding 2,160 ETH to delay the liquidation.

Ethereum faced intensified selling pressure in the past 24 hours, resulting in a sharp 19% decline that brought its price down to $1,460. Over the past month, ETH has dropped by 30%, driven by broader macroeconomic concerns. 

This steep descent has unsettled the market and triggered significant liquidation events, including the collapse of a massive whale position tied to a $105 million collateralized loan.

In an attempt to rescue his position, a whale holding a 67,500 ETH collateralized loan with a $1,650 liquidation threshold added new collateral early in the morning. 

The wallet added 2,160.52 ETH in three separate transactions: 1000.25 ETH, 1000 ETH, and 160 ETH. This effort slightly improved the collateral ratio from 152.13% to 160.25%. However, the new ratio remained dangerously close to the liquidation threshold of approximately 145%.

The price of ETH continued to slide, falling below the critical $1,650 mark. This drop activated liquidation protocols on the loan. Over the next hour, multiple automated actions occurred, starting with the liquidation of approximately 32,106 ETH to cover 35.3 million DAI.

A second liquidation of roughly 32,076 ETH against the same DAI value followed, and smaller liquidations were recorded again. These events totally liquidated the 67,500 ETH position, fully repaying a 74.4 million DAI loan.

With this wave of decline, the whale position of 67,500 ETH ($105 million) loan position liquidation line at $1,650 was completely liquidated, which also contributed to the further decline of ETH. He also added 2,160 ETH of collateral to lower the liquidation line. @EmberCN…

While one position was fully liquidated, another whale narrowly avoided a similar fate by adjusting their holdings just in time. This second position originally held 57,000 ETH with a liquidation price set at $1,564. The market drop pushed ETH close to that threshold, posing a serious risk of forced liquidation.

Roughly 90 minutes before hitting that margin, the wallet sold 3,920.8 ETH and exchanged it for 5.775 million DAI. This move helped reduce the overall position size and lowered the liquidation price. 

Now holding 53,000 ETH, the adjusted liquidation threshold sits at $1,495, still within a vulnerable range given ongoing market volatility.

The bearish sentiments across the markets have been intensified as Bitcoin marks range below $75,000 and Ethereum below $1500

The growing fear among the market participants is increasing the selling pressure that could drag the levels to the bottoms, offering a strong entry point

Meanwhile, altcoins like EOS and FARTCOIN remain within the bullish range and hence are believed to trigger a strong rebound soon

The global markets plummet as the tariff war escalates after Donald Trump's Liberation Day. The stock markets across the globe, including the US, Japan, China, Taiwan, the UK, and many more, have opened on a huge bearish note. While many refer to it as Black Monday, experts believe the bearish influence may settle soon. With this, crypto markets are also expected to recover, and this could be when these altcoins may make a strong move. 

The EOS price has been demonstrating massive strength in the last few days of Q1 2025, but the token faced a 20% pullback after entering the crucial resistance zone between $0.82 and $0.88. Despite the plunge below the multi-month ascending trend line, the price remains within a bullish zone. Hence, it holds the possibility of a strong recovery upright. 

The EOS price has dropped significantly, but a potential ascending trend seems to be imminent. The price is testing the crucial support at the 200-day MA at $0.677, and even if it loses the 50-day MA at $0.588, it may offer a strong base. Therefore, the EOS price is expected to trigger a strong rebound as the volume has surged notably, which reflects the increased trading activity. 

The global market conditions have failed to heavily impact the FARTCOIN price, which is attracting the significant attention of the market participants. The bulls are trying hard to revive a rebound, which could elevate the levels back to $0.6 very soon. However, volume remains low, which could adversely impact the pace of recovery. 

As seen in the above chart, the Bollinger Bands have begun to squeeze, citing the drop in volume and volatility. Moreover, the 50-day MA is offering a strong base, which collides with the lower bands of Bollinger. Therefore, the FARTCOIN price is expected to trigger a rebound or else may drop to test the support levels and later trigger a rebound.

The bulls seem to have entered the markets and are utilizing the ‘buy at dip' opportunity well. However, the Bitcoin price has triggered a decent recovery, and if it rises above $78,000, the path towards a strong recovery may be activated. Otherwise, a plunge below $72,800 could further drag the entire crypto markets lower.

Kremlin-backed social network VK will close its NFT platform this month, following a year of deepening losses and a planned $1.36 billion share issue to reduce debt.

Russian social media company VK plans to shut down its marketplace for non-fungible tokens, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, the team said, ending a service that was launched in December 2022. In a public announcement, users were told to transfer their tokens to external wallets before the deadline.

After April 15, the special visual markers on VK associated with NFTs — small neon diamonds that appeared on avatars — will be removed, leaving users who purchased NFTs for this feature with nothing. The NFT team added that existing content in the VK NFT community will remain, though it's unclear whether VK plans to return to NFTs or digital assets in the future.

The closure comes as VK faces financial pressure as the company's net loss nearly tripled in 2024 to 94.9 billion roubles (around $1.1 billion), up from 34.3 billion roubles in 2023. Amid declining financial health, the company revealed plans to raise up to 115 billion roubles through a new share issuance to reduce debt.

It's understood that the company will direct the received funds to lowering its debt burden. As crypto.news reported earlier, March marked a turning point, with a series of marketplace shutdowns intensifying the situation. These included South Korean tech giant LG shutting down its LG Art Lab, as well as the closures of X2Y2, and Bybit's NFT marketplace, among others.

Highlights

Satoshi Street is witnessing a major selloff as the crypto market crash in response to escalating global tensions triggered by Trump's renewed tariff war. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have dropped 6–12% in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations exceeding $900 million. The steep correction has prompted analysts to question Bitcoin's “digital gold” narrative and its reliability as a hedge amid growing volatility.

On Monday morning in Asian trading hours, crypto market crashed as risk-ON assets faced heavy volatility. Top markets like China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, hit circuit breakers in the early trading hours on Monday, with their indexes crashing 10%, sending the global markets into a situation of absolute turmoil.

Bitcoin price is down 6.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at the crucial support of $77,500, with daily trading volumes up by a staggering 220% to more than $44 billion. As per the Coinglass data, BTC's 24-hour liquidations have surged to $322 million. Based on the Bitcoin technical chart, $77,500 is a crucial support level for BTC. If it fails to hold these levels, further correction could be deeper.

Although Bitcoin price showed resilience to the Dow Jones crash last week, it is down by 7% today. However, it is still performing better as Asian indices are down 9-10% today. On the other hand, precious metals are up, as gold prices shot up $80 earlier today, and silver has an upward trajectory as well. Following today's crypto market crash, Peter Schiff took the opportunity to add:

“After a delayed reaction on Friday, crypto is finally starting to crack. Ether has already fallen to its lowest level since Oct. 2023, down 65% from its peak, and Bitcoin just traded below 81K, taking out last week's low. It could be a long day for those trapped in Bitcoin ETFs”.

As Donald Trump's tariff war increases odds of US recession, debates over Bitcoin's “digital gold” status have picked up once again. Long-term players still continue to remain bullish about BTC despite this volatility. Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise Investments, noted:

“As nations trust each other less. As corporations have more difficulty doing business. A global, digital, apolitical store of value — controlled by no nation — looks increasingly differentiated. Bitcoin's place in the world has never been more valuable”.

The altcoins market correction has extended further with Ethereum (ETH) price crashing 13.5% at press time and plummeting to $1,550. As a result, the world's largest acltoin has extended its 2025 losses to more than 53% while leaving investors in a complete state of shock. Investors believe that ETH price crash today leaves the gates open for the $1,100-$1,300 range. However, on-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that whales are buying the ETH price dips.

Other altcoins have faced a drop of a similar magnitude. XRP price is down 14.5%, dropping under the crucial $2 support, while analysts predict a further crash to $0.65 ahead. Solana price is also down today by 14% to $102 levels, while Dogecoin price has plummeted 16% to $0.143 levels.

The Ethereum network has reached a historic milestone with 200,000 addresses holding stablecoins. This record adoption is establishing itself as the backbone of a more mature digital economy, potentially reshuffling the cards for this altcoin whose price struggles to take off.

Ethereum has just crossed a historic threshold: more than 200,000 unique addresses now hold stablecoins. This steady progression since mid-2023, peaking at the end of March 2025, reveals a profound transformation in the use of blockchain.

Unlike previous bullish cycles marked by speculation, the adoption of stablecoins follows a stable and sustainable trajectory. USDT dominates the market, while USDC and DAI are gradually gaining ground.

This figure of 200,000 addresses takes on great importance when considering that it represents a significant share of users who are truly active on Ethereum.

Indeed, the number of truly operational addresses is much lower than the total number of created addresses, and this massive adoption of stablecoins reflects an ecosystem that is maturing and turning towards practical uses.

The accelerated adoption of stablecoins on Ethereum reflects the unique power of this blockchain as a programmable finance platform. Its technical robustness, combined with the most developed DeFi ecosystem, makes it the ideal ground for the rise of stable digital currencies.

In a crypto market known for its volatility, stablecoins offer a haven of stability necessary for daily transactions, capital preservation, and as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto universe.

This stability has become essential to attract new users who are less inclined to endure the extreme fluctuations of assets like bitcoin or Ethereum itself.

The rise of stablecoins also brings considerable liquidity to decentralized exchange platforms and lending protocols, thereby strengthening the entire ecosystem.

This increased liquidity facilitates more efficient transactions and paves the way for more accessible and less costly cross-border financial services than traditional solutions.

However, this rise is not without challenges. Regulators' attention is intensifying, particularly regarding the transparency of reserves and compliance with anti-money laundering rules.

Moreover, competing blockchains like Solana and Base are gaining ground in the stablecoin ecosystem, offering alternatives with lower fees and faster transactions.

This record adoption of stablecoins comes at a paradoxical time for Ethereum. While the blockchain is going through a tough period with a continuous drop in its price and a decline in activity, the growing interest in stablecoins could serve as a catalyst for recovery.

The upcoming Pectra update, scheduled for May 7, 2025, could also play a crucial role in this dynamic. By improving the capabilities of the blockchain and reducing transaction costs, it could make the use of stablecoins even more attractive on Ethereum.

A whale saw a massive amount of their Ethereum — 67,570 units worth around $106 million — liquidated on Maker following a sharp price drop exceeding 10% on Sunday evening, which saw ETH fall from above $1,800 to around $1,500, as reported by Lookonchain.

The crypto market has faced renewed selling pressure after showing resilience on Friday amid US stock market declines. Bearish sentiment fueled by President Trump's aggressive tariffs sent Bitcoin tumbling below $78,000, according to CoinGecko.

The crypto market decline extended beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the total crypto market cap dropping approximately 8% to $2.6 trillion.

In the last 24 hours, XRP declined 10% to below $1.9, while BNB fell 5% to $562. Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano each dropped approximately 11%. TRON showed relatively smaller losses at 2%.

As a result of the recent decline, the ETH/BTC trading pair reached 0.021 on April 6, marking its lowest level since March 2020.

In a separate report, Lookonchain revealed that another investor panic-sold 14,014 ETH, worth approximately $22 million, this evening.

Despite the current market turbulence, some whales are viewing the dip as an opportunity to accumulate more ETH.

A whale widely known as “7 Siblings” recently acquired 24,817 for around $42 million, Lookonchain reported, boosting their total holdings to over 1.2 million ETH, which is now valued at approximately $1.9 billion.

Since February 3, this investor has spent almost $230 million to buy 103,543 ETH, currently facing a loss of $64 million on their accumulated coins.

IntoTheBlock reported earlier this week that whales accumulated 130,000 ETH on Thursday when the second-largest crypto asset plunged below $1,800 in the first trading session post-tariff announcement.

Metrics details

The rheology of the lower crust and upper mantle influences Earth's plate tectonic style of mantle convection, yet its spatial variability is poorly resolved, particularly in continental interiors. Here we use satellite radar interferometry to map the delayed uplift resulting from the desiccation of the Aral Sea, which has lost ~1,000 km3 of water since 1960. From this we constrain the rheology of the underlying upper mantle by elastic and viscoelastic modelling. We find a long-wavelength uplift of up to ~7 mm yr–1 between 2016 and 2020 that decays radially from the Aral Sea. This uplift pattern is best explained by viscoelastic relaxation of the asthenosphere below a strong lithospheric mantle. We estimate that the asthenosphere has an effective viscosity of 4–7 × 1019 Pa s below 130–190 km depth, slightly larger than the values inferred from post-seismic deformation at subduction zones, but 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than estimates from glacial isostatic adjustment in other tectonically stable regions. Such uplift highlights the potential for human activities to influence deep-Earth dynamics and the interconnectedness of surface and mantle processes.

Metrics details

Environmental thermal stress substantially affects cellular plasticity of thermogenic adipocytes and energy balance through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms in rodents. However, roles of cold-adaptive epigenetic regulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in systemic energy metabolism in humans remained poorly understood. Here we report that individuals whose mothers conceived during cold seasons exhibit higher BAT activity, adaptive thermogenesis, increased daily total energy expenditure and lower body mass index and visceral fat accumulation. Structural equation modelling indicated that conception during the cold season protects against age-associated increase in body mass index through BAT activation in offspring. Meteorological analysis revealed that lower outdoor temperatures and greater fluctuations in daily temperatures during the fertilization period are key determinants of BAT activity. These findings suggest that BAT metabolic fate and susceptibility of metabolic diseases are preprogrammed by the epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure before the fertilization in humans.

Obesity is the major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular diseases, increasing all-cause mortality1,2. While exercise habits and eating behaviours are important for energy homeostasis, environmental stimuli also influence the risk of obesity due to dynamic fluctuations in energy expenditure (EE)3. Cold exposure is a well-established environmental determinant of whole-body EE, triggering adaptive thermogenesis through the activation of metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue (BAT)3,4. Individual differences in BAT activity are associated with age-related increases in body mass index (BMI), visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risks5,6,7,8. Despite the potential of BAT as a therapeutic target, underlying factors contributing to individual differences in BAT activity remain poorly understood, particularly in humans.

Environmental regulation of adipose tissue thermogenesis differs between acute and chronic activation. In small rodents, acute cold exposure (for a few minutes) evokes immediate heat production in BAT through activation of the sympathetic nervous system and β-adrenergic signalling pathways9. Conversely, prolonged cold exposure (several weeks) induces de novo brown adipocyte differentiation and the appearance of beige adipocytes, which require chromatin conformation changes and histone modifications orchestrated by epigenetic regulators such as JMJD1A, limiting metabolic disorders10,11. Consistently, in humans, acute cold exposure for a few hours elicits BAT thermogenesis and substrate utilization, which correlate with sympathetic innervation12,13,14,15,16. Moreover, repeated cold exposure or chronic administration of an adrenergic receptor agonist for several weeks increases BAT activity and mass, ultimately improving adiposity and insulin sensitivity12,17,18. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that BAT in the supraclavicular depots of human adults resembles mouse beige adipocytes; in addition, expression of the epigenetic regulator JMJD1A in adipose tissue negatively correlates with BMI19,20,21. These consistent findings across species suggest that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the recruitment of BAT in humans as it does in mice22,23.

Genetic inheritance of risk alleles in thermogenic genes can also influence BAT activity as evidenced by the accelerated age-related decline in BAT and visceral fat accumulation in human adults with single nucleotide polymorphisms on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and β3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3)24. Compelling evidence also suggests that epigenetic predisposition induced by specific nutritional and environmental stresses such as temperature during gestation and lactation can be inherited across generations, resulting in various physiological alterations in experimental animals25,26,27,28.

Building on these findings, we hypothesized that meteorological exposures experienced by parents before and during gestation influence BAT metabolic fate and regulate energy homeostasis in human offspring. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study in mice, demonstrating that preconception cold exposure, particularly within the paternal lineage, enhances adipose tissue thermogenesis in offspring through mechanisms possibly involving DNA methylation in sperm28. We present evidence that BAT metabolic activity, as well as adaptive EE, are elevated in healthy human individuals conceived during a cold season compared with those conceived during a warm season. Moreover, we performed a spatiotemporal meteorological analysis and identified a lower ambient temperature and larger diurnal temperature variation in the period before conception as critical determinants of BAT activity. Additionally, BAT activation resulting from preconception cold exposure was associated with a reduced BMI and waist circumference independent of age, sex and the season of birth. These findings provide comprehensive evidence suggesting that thermal stress experienced just before conception plays an intergenerational role in facilitating the activation and sustenance of BAT and modulating systemic energy homeostasis in humans.

To investigate the lifelong effects of early-life environmental exposure on BAT function, we examined the association of cold-induced BAT activity with the seasons of fertilization or birth in 356 healthy young male volunteers (Cohort 1; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The presence of detectable BAT and its quantitative metabolic activity were assessed with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) following cold exposure at 19 °C for 2 h (Fig. 1b)5,8,12,14. Based on the participant's day of birth, the seasons of birth and fertilization were categorized as either warm season (16 April through 16 October) or cold season (the remainder) (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Note that the seasonality of meteorological factors is distinct and rather coherent regardless of the latitude in the main islands of Japan, and the participant's place of birth distributed throughout Japan (Extended Data Fig. 1b,d). The prevalence of detectable BAT (high BAT) was indistinguishable between participants born in the cold season (cold birth group, 71.8%) and those born in the warm season (warm birth group, 73.8%, P = 0.381; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, BAT prevalence was significantly higher in those conceived in the cold season (cold fertilization group, 78.2%) than in those conceived in the warm season (warm fertilization group, 66.0%, P = 0.007; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Similarly, quantitative BAT activity was notably higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (P = 0.017; Fig. 1e), whereas BAT activity was not associated with the season of birth (P = 0.144). The association between the fertilization season and BAT activity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.949, P = 0.007) was irrespective of age, BMI and the season of birth (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The effect of fertilization season is not specific to the supraclavicular BAT because fertilization in cold period was associated with increased number of active BAT depots, including thoracic, cervical, axillary, mediastinal and perirenal regions (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). These suggest an intergenerational activation of BAT by preconception perceived environmental stress in young healthy men. These findings are not dependent on our method to define the seasons because the difference between our unbiased definition and another definition based on the median of outdoor temperature was only 2.7% of the year (10 days), having a negligible impact on the results.

Source data

To address whether BAT activation by preconception environmental stress extends to the general population, we recruited 286 independent healthy male and female volunteers aged 20–78 years (Cohort 2). In this cohort, BAT density (BAT-d) was estimated noninvasively by measuring the total haemoglobin concentration ([total Hb]) in the supraclavicular region using near-infra-red time-resolved spectroscopy (NIR-TRS) (Fig. 1a). BAT-d measured by NIR-TRS exhibits a strong correlation with cold-induced FDG uptake by PET/CT, making it a reliable alternative index of BAT functionality29,30. We categorized the participants into high and low BAT-d groups based on the median of BAT-d (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Consistent with findings from Cohort 1, the season of birth did not affect the percentage of high BAT-d (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c) or quantitative BAT-d (Fig. 1i). In contrast, the percentage of high BAT-d was significantly greater in the cold fertilization group (56.4%) than in the warm fertilization group (44.4%, P = 0.029; Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3b,d). Additionally, we found a significant increase in BAT-d ([total Hb] at the supraclavicular BAT deposits), in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm fertilization group (P = 0.020; Fig. 1i). This increase in [total Hb] was specific to the supraclavicular BAT region and was not due to a general increase in blood flow because [total Hb] in other regions such as the abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue and the deltoid skeletal muscle remained consistent regardless of the season of birth or fertilization (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). A disaggregated analysis for sex revealed an enhanced BAT-d in the cold fertilization group in male and female participants (Extended Data Fig. 3g). These results were consistent with those in Cohort 1 and support the idea that the metabolic fate of BAT in adulthood is predetermined by parental exposure to meteorological environments during the period around fertilization in healthy humans.

It is widely recognized that cold-activated BAT has a crucial role in EE, especially in nonshivering cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT), which fluctuates seasonally in accordance with the recruitment of BAT31. We hypothesized that the intergenerational activation of BAT might influence CIT in a season-dependent manner. To test this, we analysed the resting EE at 27 °C and after 2-h cold exposure at 19 °C measured by indirect calorimetry in 42 young healthy males who underwent FDG-PET/CT31 (Cohort 3; Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). This test was conducted during both the summer (July to September) and winter (December to March) in a randomized crossover design. As expected, no notable difference in BAT activity was observed between the warm and cold birth seasons (Extended Data Fig. 4d, left). Whole-body EE adjusted for fat-free mass (FFM) at 27 °C and 19 °C and CIT were comparable between the warm and cold birth groups regardless of season of the measurements (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f).

Conversely, BAT activity was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Extended Data Fig. 4d, right), consistent with findings observed in Cohorts 1 and 2. While there was no group difference in EE at 27 °C, the response of the adjusted EE to cold exposure seemed to be increased in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm fertilization group in the winter (Fig. 2b, left), but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Indeed, CIT was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group specifically in the winter (Fig. 2b, right) but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Given that neither shivering, as assessed by electromyography nor FDG uptake into the skeletal muscle is induced in our mild cold exposure protocol14,32, the observed increase in CIT is likely due to BAT activation. This aligns with the observation that BAT activity was positively correlated with CIT in the winter, but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4i), FFM did not associate with CIT regardless of the season (Extended Data Fig. 4j). These findings suggest that BAT activation due to fertilization in the cold season enhances cold-induced BAT thermogenesis and contributes to seasonal cold adaptation in humans.

We next examined the effects of the fertilization season on diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), another component of BAT-associated adaptive thermogenesis33,34,35. In this study, whole-body EE was measured in 23 healthy adult males (Cohort 4; Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) by indirect calorimetry over a period of 2 h following the ingestion of a meal (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d)35. All DIT measurements were carried out in the winter months (December through March). We ensured that age and anthropometric parameters were comparable between the warm and cold birth groups and between the warm and cold fertilization groups. Postprandial thermogenesis and DIT, calculated as the incremental area under the curve, did not differ significantly between the warm and cold birth groups (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5e). Increased BAT activity was observed in the cold fertilization group of Cohort 4 compared with the warm fertilization group (Extended Data Fig. 5b, right), as observed in Cohorts 1 and 3. It is noteworthy that postprandial thermogenesis and DIT were significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5f).

Finally, we asked whether fertilization in the cold season is sufficient to enhance total energy expenditure (TEE) under the free-living conditions in Cohort 5 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To this end, we measured TEE using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method and physical activity levels using a validated triaxial accelerometer36,37. The DLW method is an accurate way of determining metabolic rate with the advantage that the participants need not be confined, allowing us to investigate TEE in free-living conditions. TEE assessed using DLW was associated with age, anthropometric parameters, physical activity levels and step count per day (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that FFM and steps per day were significant predicting factors of TEE (model 1, R2 value = 0.794; Extended Data Fig. 6c). Of note, FFM- and step-independent TEE as residuals in model 1 was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group, whereas it was indistinguishable between the warm and cold birth groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Thus, adjusted TEE for FFM and steps was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 3b). A similar increase in adjusted TEE was found in a disaggregated analysis for sex (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the TEE-increasing effect of fertilization season was independent of body size- and physical activity-related parameters, including FFM and step count (Fig. 3c). Together, we demonstrate a critical role of the season of fertilization in adaptive CIT, DIT and TEE, suggesting that the pre-fertilization-origin activation of BAT is sufficient to modulate whole-body EE.

The above observations led us to hypothesize that fertilization in the cold season may reduce the risk of obesity and metabolic diseases in offspring by protecting against an age-related decline in BAT. Clinical cross-sectional studies demonstrated that BAT activity is inversely correlated with adiposity and blood glucose, preventing age-related obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases7,8. In Cohort 1, the inverse association between BAT activity and BMI was relatively weak (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7a), likely due to the younger age and lower adiposity levels among participants6,38. Conversely, more pronounced effects of BAT-d on obesity-related traits such as BMI, body fat content, visceral fat area and waist circumference were observed in Cohort 2, which included a wider range of ages and adiposity levels (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Next, we investigated whether the fertilization season is associated with adiposity. In Cohort 1, with a limited-range of ages and adiposity, BMI and related parameters did not exhibit a direct correlation with either the birth season or the fertilization season (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Figs. 1c and 8a). In Cohort 2, however, we detected modest yet significant associations of the cold fertilization season with decreased BMI, visceral fat area and waist circumference (Fig. 4b). Similarly, BMI, body fat content, visceral fat area and waist circumference were significantly lower in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 4c). Conversely, the season of birth had a negligible effect on adiposity in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Fig. 4a,b). Additionally, parameters such as skeletal muscle mass and cardiovascular function, including blood pressure and heart rate, remained unaffected by either the birth or fertilization season (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c).

To examine more deeply the intricate relationship between fertilization season, BAT and adiposity, we performed structural equation modelling based on the structural model hypothesized39. This analysis revealed that the fertilization season (coded as warm, 0 and cold, 1) positively correlated with BAT activity (Cohort 1: β = 0.145, P = 0.005, Fig. 4d; Cohort 2: β = 0.132, P = 0.022, Fig. 4e), which in turn negatively correlated with BMI (Cohort 1: β = −0.175, P < 0.001; Cohort 2: β = −0.547, P < 0.001). The direct association between the fertilization season and BMI, however, was not statistically significant (Cohort 1: β = −0.022, P = 0.671; Cohort 2: β = −0.041, P = 0.365). Based on these findings, we concluded that a decrease in BMI associated with the cold fertilization season is due to increased BAT activity.

Meteorological parameters, including temperature, vary seasonally, as depicted in Extended Data Fig. 9, and some of these parameters, along with temperature, can modulate BAT activity40,41. For example, studies in rodents demonstrated that photoperiod regulates BAT thermogenesis via the sympathetic nervous system or μ-opioid receptor signalling42,43. To pinpoint the environmental factor responsible for the intergenerational BAT activation, we performed an unbiased spatiotemporal meteorological analysis. This analysis involved examining associations between the participant's BAT activity and environmental parameters before, during, and after pregnancy periods within their specific region of residence (Fig. 5a).

a, Schematic of the study design for the meteorological survey and the definition of pregnancy periods. The pregnancy period was divided into five periods: preconception (−12 to −9 months), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), second trimester (−6 to −3 months), third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and postpartum (0 to 3 months). b, Schematic showing the extraction of meteorological data for pregnancy periods from Japan created by the JMA, the NARO and the NAOJ.

Source data

A total of 93 participants in Cohort 1 completed a questionnaire regarding their regions of birth and conception, their lifestyles and meteorological questionnaire survey. We collected meteorological parameters, including outdoor temperature, humidity, precipitation, sunshine duration, daytime length and atmospheric pressure, at the region residence during five pregnancy periods: before conception (−12 to −9 months from the birth), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), the second trimester (−6 to −3 months), the third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and after delivery (0 to 3 months) (Fig. 5a,b). A multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, BMI, smoking status and shift work status (referred to as model 1) revealed that the daily mean outdoor temperature before fertilization correlated inversely with BAT activity (adjusted OR = 0.335, 95% CI 0.138−0.809, P = 0.015; Fig. 5c), while humidity, precipitation, sunshine duration and daytime length showed no significant association with BAT activity. Additionally, we discovered a positive association between BAT activity and daily maximum temperature (adjusted OR = 3.033, 95% CI 1.27−7.25, P = 0.013), which contradicted the negative association with the daily mean temperature. We hypothesize that diurnal temperature variation might serve as a latent environmental stimulus for activating BAT in the offspring. To test this, we calculated the diurnal range of temperature and incorporated it into model 1 as an independent variable (referred to as model 2). Notably, this parameter emerged as the most significant determining factor of BAT activity (adjusted OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.028−2.519, P = 0.037; Fig. 5d). A similar association was found when diurnal temperature gap between daily maximum and mean temperature was incorporated in to the multivariate regression model (model 3; Extended Data Fig. 10a). These results suggest exposure to a lower outdoor temperature and larger diurnal temperature variation before conception preserves BAT activity of the offspring in adulthood.

Furthermore, the multivariate regression model revealed no association of BAT activity with outdoor temperature or its diurnal variation in the first, second and third trimesters (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 10a), suggesting a negligible effect of maternal thermal stress during gestation, consistent with earlier studies in mice28,43. We also observed an inverse association between the daily mean outdoor temperature and diurnal temperature fluctuation after delivery and BAT activity (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). We then tested the potential synergistic effect of thermal stress before conception and after delivery on BAT. To this end, we categorized the participants into four groups: (1) those with warm birth and warm fertilization seasons, (2) those with warm birth and cold fertilization seasons, (3) those with cold birth and warm fertilization seasons, and (4) those with cold birth and cold fertilization seasons (Fig. 5e). Increases in the BAT prevalence and activity by the cold fertilization season were clearly confirmed in the cold birth group whereas they were only marginal in the warm birth group (Fig. 5f,g). It is possible that cold exposure after delivery enhances the BAT-activating effect of preconception cold exposure although this requires further investigation. However, thermal exposure before conception is likely the primary stimulus because a clear linear-by-linear association between diurnal temperature gap and BAT prevalence was detected specifically in a period before conception (Extended Data Fig. 10b).

In summary, the spatiotemporal meteorological analysis revealed that a low outdoor temperature and a large diurnal temperature variation just before conception preserves BAT activity and energy homeostasis in human offspring (Fig. 6).

Preconception exposure to low outdoor temperature and temperature gap affects offspring's metabolic phenotype, promoting higher EE in humans. Our findings propose a conceptional theory, named PfOHaD. This concept suggests that environmental factors, such as temperature exposure before conception, can programme physiological traits in offspring, potentially influencing their health outcomes across generations.

Our study demonstrated that the season of fertilization significantly influences BAT development and metabolic health in adulthood. Utilizing healthy volunteers and employing three distinct methods (FDG-PET/CT, NIR-TRS and DLW), we observed a potential link between EE and the season of fertilization, which may be mediated by BAT activity. These findings extend the work by Sun et al.28, who reported that individuals conceived during colder months were 3.2% more likely to possess active BAT, whereas those conceived in warmer months were more likely to lack active BAT. They suggested that the season of conception is linked to BAT development in humans, proposing an intergenerational activation of BAT through paternal lineage, potentially involving sperm DNA methylation as demonstrated in mouse models. Incorporating meteorological analyses, we found that not only outdoor temperature but also diurnal temperature variations impact BAT activity, with effects observed based on the season of fertilization rather than birth season. These findings support and expand the theory of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) to encompass the concept of Pre-fertilization Origins of Health and Disease (PfOHaD), as discussed in later sections.

A major strength of our study is the thorough assessment of BAT using the gold-standard method and a large sample size of healthy participants. Prospective studies demonstrated that BAT remains metabolically inactive in warm conditions regardless of its maximal thermogenic capacity5,32,44,45. Moreover, BAT activity varies seasonally depending on age, sex and adiposity5,8,40,46. These factors impose a major limitation on retrospective assessment of BAT using clinical scans. In the present study, we ensured a sensitive evaluation of BAT functionality with season-matched FDG-PET/CT and acute nonshivering cold exposure. This analysis included over 350 young, lean male participants to minimize potential fluctuations in BAT activity. While FDG-PET may underestimate BAT activity in conditions such as insulin resistance47, our all participants of Cohort 1 were healthy individuals. Our well-designed approach and the largest sample size in this field, allow us to certify the intergenerational influence of cold stress on BAT activity in humans.

Of note, we validated the fertilization season-specific activation of BAT in an independent population of Cohort 2 with no discernible effect of the birth season. Despite a wide range of ages and adiposity in Cohort 2 and including both males and females, multivariate regression revealed that BAT activation by the cold fertilization season is independent of age, sex and adiposity. Moreover, the difference in the BAT prevalence between the warm and cold fertilization groups was 11.9% for Cohort 2, consistent with Cohort 1 (14.6%). Notably, these differences were four-times higher than those reported in the previous retrospective analysis of oncology scans (3.2%)28. Our results demonstrate the extent to which preconception seasonal acclimatization enhances BAT activity in offspring.

Previous studies demonstrated BAT's role in nonshivering adaptive thermogenesis (CIT and DIT)12,34,35,48. Our study is the first to show that preconception environmental exposure enhances whole-body EE and adaptive thermogenesis due to a significant increase in BAT activity. CIT for the cold fertilization group was 1.5-times higher than the warm group. In contrast, resting EE at 27 °C was unaffected by the fertilization season, as BAT remains inactive in thermoneutral conditions. The impact of the fertilization season on CIT was negligible in the summer, when BAT activity is low31. These results suggest that preconception cold exposure is sufficient to increase adaptive thermogenesis and whole-body EE. Notably, TEE under free-living conditions increased by ~5.8% in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm group, indicating that intergenerational inheritance of cold adaptation enhances whole-body EE in humans. Future study employing 15O-O2 and 11C-acetate PET/CT is required for validating the contribution of BAT to intergenerational control of whole-body EE.

Fertilization during the cold season was linked to a lower BMI in Cohort 2, which encompassed a wider range of age and adiposity levels. Structural equation model suggested that the BMI-decreasing effect is mediated by BAT activation. Given the absence of a significant impact of the fertilization season on BMI in young lean individuals (Cohort 1), we propose that the beneficial metabolic effect of preconception cold exposure is greater in middle-aged and older populations. Consistent with this notion, a cross-sectional study involving over 4,500 middle-aged males reported that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high in those born in the spring (with an estimated summer fertilization season) compared with those born in the fall (with an estimated winter fertilization season)49. Similar trends were reported by a large cohort study that included male and female participants50,51. The current study highlights the need of investigating the hypothesis that global warming may be contributing to disruptions in energy homeostasis and the ongoing obesity pandemic. Together, our present findings suggest a crucial role of intergenerational regulation of BAT in the systemic energy homeostasis, reducing the propensity for age-associated metabolic diseases. Our findings align with earlier studies reporting protective roles of BAT against insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases7,38,40.

The mechanisms of intergenerational activation of human BAT have remained unclear because the key meteorological factors remained undetermined. Our unique spatiotemporal meteorological analysis, however, identified the daily mean outdoor temperature before conception as a significant determinant of BAT metabolic fate in adult offspring. This finding is compatible with findings in mice28. Other parameters, such as daytime length, sunshine duration, humidity and precipitation, before conception were not associated with BAT activity. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that diurnal temperature variations serve as a novel meteorological factor that mediates BAT activation. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may be involved in this temperature gap-induced activation. For example, the cold pressor test (cold water immersion of the limbs) increases SNS activity in humans without altering core body temperature52. Further investigations are needed to confirm whether the SNS plays a role in passing on BAT activity to the next generation in humans.

Potential factors that may influence the intergenerational activation of BAT include individual differences in dietary and behavioural pattern, genetic variants, and other unmeasurable variables such as living indoor temperature and gut microbiota composition24,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60. The use of pharmacological agents such as adrenomimetics may also confound the association of preconception thermal stress with BAT44,61,62,63. We note, however, that all our participants were healthy individuals who did not regularly take medications, and neither smoking history nor shift work status influenced the BAT activation.

A notable limitation of our study is the use of a fixed cold exposure at 19 °C to assess BAT activity with FDG-PET/CT. We cannot rule out the possibility that our fixed cold exposure might be insufficient for some participants with low cold perception, resulting in low BAT activity. An alternative approach would be FDG-PET/CT with personalized cold exposure protocol64. The use of only FDG as a radiotracer is also a limitation because FDG uptake does not directly reflect total heat production in BAT and its anatomical presence47, although it is proportional to nonshivering CIT. However, fixed protocols like ours have been recognized as suitable for evaluating BAT's thermogenic responsiveness to a certain stimulus, which is one of the most physiologically important readouts64,65. Nevertheless, our findings need to be validated by future studies employing PET/CT with various tracers in combination with personalized cold protocols13,61,64,65. Moreover, our correlational results do not exclude possibility that other tissues, including skeletal muscle66,67, contribute to the intergenerational cold adaptation and metabolic improvement. Additional investigations are required to establish BAT as a causative driver of metabolic improvements due to pre-fertilization cold exposure. Another limitation of this study is its geographically focus on Japan. Future studies should test the effects of different geographic regions of living and races of individuals on the intergenerational activation of BAT. In addition, our meteorological approach faces challenges in determining whether the intergenerational regulation of BAT originates from the paternal lineage, as reported in mice28. In this regard, two independent study groups reported that maternal cold exposure does not activate BAT in mice28,43. We also emphasize that no meteorological parameter during the first, second and third trimesters correlated with BAT activity, suggesting minimal effects of maternal lineage during gestation. Although it may not be feasible to experimentally validate whether it is paternal lineage in humans, alternative approaches may involve investigations of cold-induced epigenetic changes in human sperm68,69, as discussed in the below paragraph. It seems likely that the intergenerational control of BAT by preconception cold exposure is linked to the paternal lineage.

In future studies, it would be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure and to examine the effect of cold exposure on sperm, ovum, fertilized eggs and embryos in humans. Earlier studies in small rodents suggested that certain molecular mechanisms in sperm govern the intergenerational inheritance of paternal metabolic stress68,69. First, a previous DNA pyrosequencing study revealed that paternal preconception cold exposure induces alterations of DNA methylation in mouse sperm28. The specific genes or sites targeted by cold-induced DNA methylation, as well as their causal link to the BAT activation remain undetermined. Second, although sperm chromatin undergoes massive epigenetic reprogramming through histone–protamine exchange, minimal histones (~1% in mice and ~10% in humans) are retained in mature sperm70. The retained histones carry epigenetic marks, for example methylation, which are transferred to the embryo and play a role in intergenerational physiological adaptation71,72,73. Third, transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNA) have the potential to be transmitted to the zygote and are proposed as a molecule responsible for germline epigenetic transmission27,74,75,76. Future studies should investigate the roles of these mechanisms in the intergenerational inheritance of cold exposure.

Together, these findings provide evidence of a discernible impact of preconception cold exposure on BAT metabolic fate, adaptive thermogenesis and systemic energy homeostasis in human offspring. Our findings indicate a perspective beyond the DOHaD theory, which acknowledges that environmental stress, for example poor nutritional conditions, during pregnancy or lactation triggers predictive adaptation during embryonic and postnatal development via the maternal lineage77. Because the intergenerational activation of BAT is initiated before fertilization, we propose a conceptional theory, named PfOHaD, which can theoretically originate from both maternal and paternal lineages. The PfOHaD-based activation of BAT may be a sophisticated predictive cold adaptation through specific mechanisms, enabling offspring to survive despite cold climates and thereby contributing to species conservation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic transmission between generations, as well as how cellular memories stored in specific cell types operate, will open research opportunities to develop therapeutic approaches aimed at attenuating an ageing-associated decline in BAT activity and achieving cardiometabolic benefits in humans.

Healthy adult volunteers were provided information about the study and gave their written informed consent for participation in the FDG-PET/CT examination and the meteorological questionnaire survey. The FDG-PET/CT and NIR-TRS data obtained in our previous studies8,30 were enrolled in the analysis by obtaining the written informed consent or through an opt-out process. The data of the CIT, DIT, and TEE obtained in our previous studies31,35,37 were enrolled in this study through an opt-out process. Inclusion criteria included age (Cohorts 1, 3 and 4, 18 years and older8,31,35; Cohort 2, 20 years and older30 and Cohort 5, 3–6 years37). Exclusion criteria included individuals with metabolic diseases, those who regularly take medications for diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or hypertension, heavy smokers (>21 cigarettes per day), those drinking more than the average amount of alcohol (30 g alcohol per day or more), those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those who are considered unsuitable for the study by investigators (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). In addition, only male participants aged 18–29 years old were included in the analysis for Cohort 1 to minimize the confound effects of age and sex on the results, whereas both sexes were included in Cohorts 2 and 5 to test whether our findings can be generalized regardless of sex. The written informed consent for participation was obtained from 242 participants of Cohort 1 (68.0%) and all 268 participants of Cohort 2 (100%). Data of the FDG-PET/CT examination from the remaining 114 participants of Cohort 1 (32.0%) and data of CIT/DIT obtained in our previous studies were utilized under an opt-out basis. CIT was measured both in summer and in winter in a randomized crossover design31, whereas the other experiments were performed in observational study designs with no randomization. The FDG-PET/CT, NIR-TRS, CIT, DIT measurements and the DLW examination as well as measurements of anthropometric parameters were performed by experienced physicians/radiologists/investigators who were blinded to the experimental group and study hypothesis. Meteorological parameters were obtained by two research assistants who were blinded to the experimental groups.

The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Review Boards of the University of Tokyo (23-585) and Tohoku University (35632). The trial was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ (UMIN000050690). The primary outcomes were BAT activity/density, EE and adiposity (BMI, visceral fat area, waist circumference) and secondary outcomes included FFM, fat mass, heart rate and blood pressure.

Cold-activated BAT was assessed by FDG-PET/CT following standardized nonshivering cold exposure, as reported previously8,12. All FDG-PET/CT examinations were performed in the winter (December through March). After fasting for ~12 h, participants remained in a room at 19 °C for 2 h. The participants received 18F-FDG (1.7 MBq kg−1 body weight) intravenously after 1 h of cold exposure and remained in the same cold conditions for another hour. PET/CT was performed using a PET/CT system (Aquiduo, Toshiba Medical Systems), Biograph 16 (Siemens Medical Solutions) or Discovery PET/CT 600 (GE Healthcare). Cold-induced BAT activity was quantified by the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG in the supraclavicular adipose deposits with Hounsfield Units from −300 to −10. On the basis of the presence of detectable BAT activity greater than SUV 2.0, participants were divided into high and low BAT groups8,12. Experienced investigators monitored participant's condition during cold exposure and no adverse effect of cold exposure was reported.

The participants relaxed in a room at 23–27 °C and 3-cm probes were placed at the skin of the supraclavicular region. Total haemoglobin concentration ([total Hb]) in the supraclavicular region was measured based on the optical properties evaluated by NIR-TRS29,30,78. Because the abundance of capillaries in BAT helps to distinguish it from other tissues, including white adipose tissue, the supraclavicular [total Hb] is an indicator of BAT-d, which is correlative to SUV by FDG-PET/CT. NIR-TRS data were extracted every 10 s and averaged over 1 min using a NIR-TRS system (TRS-20; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The obtained NIR-TRS parameters were adjusted for the thickness of subcutaneous fat in the region by B-mode ultrasound (Vscan Dual Probe; GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS). Based on the median value of the supraclavicular [total Hb], participants were divided into high and low BAT-d groups. As control regions, [total Hb] in the deltoid skeletal muscle and in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured.

BMI was calculated as the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg m−2) and the per cent of body fat was estimated using the multifrequency bioelectric impedance method (InBody 320 and 720 Body Composition Analyser; Biospace) or a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (Lunar Prodigy; GE Healthcare). In concurrence with FDG-PET/CT, the visceral and subcutaneous fat areas at the abdominal level of L4–L5 were estimated from the CT images. The visceral fat area of participants undergoing the NIR-TRS examination was estimated using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (EW-FA90; Panasonic). Waist circumference was measured using a flexible narrow, nonstretchable tape. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were measured by an automated sphygmomanometer (HBP-9020; Omron Healthcare). The FFM of participants of the DLW procedure was calculated from the total body water (TBW) using the hydration factor by the International Atomic Energy Agency36,37. Fat mass was calculated by subtracting the FFM (kg) from the body weight.

Whole-body EE and CIT were measured by indirect calorimetry in the summer (July to September) and winter (December to March) in a randomized crossover design31. After fasting for ~12 h, participants relaxed in a sitting position in a room at 27 °C for at least 30 min. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were then recorded for 20–30 min using a respiratory gas analyser connected to a ventilated hood (AR-1, Arco System). After 2 h cold exposure at 19 °C, VO2 and VCO2 were recorded again. The stable value of the last 10-min period was used to calculate EE. Whole-body EE was adjusted for FFM, the major component of the individual variation of EE. CIT was calculated as the difference in the adjusted EE between before and after cold exposure.

Whole-body EE before and after meal ingestion was measured using a respiratory gas analyser (AR-1, Arco System) in winter (December to March)35. After fasting for ~12 h, participants relaxed on a bed in a room at 27 °C, and VO2 and VCO2 were recorded for ~30 min. The participants were then given a test meal with a total energy of 7.9 kcal kg−1 body weight in 10 min. The energy ratio of the meal was 11% protein, 38% fat and 51% carbohydrate. After 15, 45, 75 and 105 min, VO2 and VCO2 were measured for 20 min. The stable value in the last 10-min period was used to calculate the EE. Whole-body EE was adjusted for FFM. Postprandial thermogenesis was calculated as the change of adjusted EE from baseline and the incremental area under the curve of postprandial thermogenesis over 2 h was calculated for estimating DIT.

Daily TEE was measured over 1 week using the DLW procedure, the gold-standard method to determine whole-body EE under free-living conditions36,37. All DLW procedures were performed in the winter (December). Upon accessing the preschool, a urine specimen was collected to measure the baseline 2H and 18O before administering DLW (day 0). Each participant was given a beverage containing a premixed dose of ~0.12 g kg−1 estimated TBW of 2H2O (99.8 at.%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso) and 2.5 g kg−1 estimated TBW of H218O (10.0 at.%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso). The urine samples were then collected on the following day (day 1) and on day 8. The urine specimens were analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Hydra 20–20; Sercon). The dilution space of 2H and 18O (Nd and No, respectively) was determined by dividing the amount of the given tracer using the intercept method in two specimens from day 0 and two samples from the days 1 and 8. The TBW was calculated as the mean of Nd (mol) divided by 1.043 and No (mol) divided by 1.007 (ref. 79). Carbon dioxide production rates (rCO2, mol d−1) were calculated using the following equation: rCO2 (mol d−1) = 0.4554 × TBW (mol) × (1.007 × ko − 1.043 × kd), where ko and kd represent the 18O and 2H elimination rates per day, respectively. TEE was determined using a modified Wier equation based on rCO2 and 24-h respiratory quotient (RQ) estimated as 0.87 (ref. 37): TEE (kcal d−1) = 1.106 × rCO2 (l d−1) + 3.94 × (rCO2/RQ).

In concurrence with the DLW procedure for 1 week, the participants were asked to wear a previously validated triaxial accelerometer (Actimarker, Panasonic) over the waist80 from morning till night, except during bathing and bedtime. The obtained data during the experimental period were used for calculating daily mean steps and daily mean physical activity levels.

Day of fertilization was estimated as the day 266 days before the due date (day of birth). To define seasons of birth and fertilization, the year was divided into the cold season (1 January through 15 April and 17 October through 31 December) and warm season (16 April through 16 October) by splitting spring and autumn. To examine the effects of meteorological exposure before, during and after pregnancy on BAT of the offspring, five pregnancy periods were defined based on the days of birth and fertilization; before conception (−12 to −9 months from the birth), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), the second trimester (−6 to −3 months), the third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and after delivery (0–3 months). Meteorological parameters in these periods were obtained from the meteorological and climatic big databases for Japan: the Agro-Meteorological Grid Square Data by the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) for outdoor temperature, its diurnal variation, precipitation and sunshine duration81; the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) database for humidity and atmospheric pressure; the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) database for sunrise and sunset times for 2012–2020 to calculate the daytime length for each calendar day.

Data are expressed as the mean with s.e.m. or the proportion unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis was carried out using a statistical software package (IBM SPSS Statistics v.29.0 and Amos 29.0, IBM Japan; Microsoft Office Excel 2016, Microsoft Japan). The difference in continuous variables between two experimental groups was analysed using an unpaired Student's t-test. The effect of the birth or fertilization seasons on the BAT prevalence, as well as differences in the proportion of female participants between the experimental groups, was analysed by Fisher's exact test or linear-by-linear association chi-squared test. Subgroup analysis for sex was performed in Cohorts 2 and 5 to test whether intergenerational effect of seasons of birth and fertilization was consistent across males and females. Simple correlations were assessed using a univariate linear regression analysis and Pearson's or Kendall's correlation coefficient. Whole-body EE measured by indirect calorimetry was adjusted for FFM using a linear regression equation31. The adjusted EE before and after 2-h cold exposure was compared using a paired t-test with three outliers by the Smirnov–Grubbs' test removed31. Postprandial EE over 2 h with one noncompliance of fasting and one outlier removed35 was tested by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a within-subject factor (time) and a between-subject factor (season), with a post hoc unpaired t-test performed when the interaction effect (time × season) was statistically significant. TEE was adjusted for FFM and step counts by means of the stepwise multivariate regression model to estimate body size- and physical activity-independent TEE. The magnitude of the independent associations between BAT and the birth/fertilization seasons was estimated by calculating ORs and 95% CIs using a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustments for age and BMI. The association between BAT and meteorological parameters were estimated by means of multivariate logistic regression models with the backward method for the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, shift work status and a medical history of low birth weight. Direct and indirect, BAT-mediated inferences of the birth/fertilization seasons on BMI were estimated by employing structural equation model39. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications31,35,82. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Climatological annual cycle of meteorological parameters in Tokyo, Japan. Daily maximum (max.) and minimum (min.) outdoor temperatures (temp.), precipitation, humidity, sunshine duration, atmospheric pressure, and diurnal range of outdoor temperature for 11 years (2010–2020) were obtained from the climate databases constructed by the JMA and NARO. Sunrise time and sunset time for 7 years (2012–2020) were obtained from the database constructed by the NAOJ to calculate daytime length. Diurnal temperature fluctuation was calculated as differences between maximum and minimum temperature and between maximum and mean temperature. For all meteorological parameters, 11-day moving average was calculated for each calendar day. Data are mean ± s.e.m., n = 11 except daytime length (n = 9).

And they discovered it completely by accident.

Containing some 3.2 billion base pairs, the human genome is far from a simple set of genetic instructions, but the process of inherited traits from parent to child is often described as a straightforward one. The genes of one parent combine with the genes of another, which forms the genetic traits of their offspring. While DNA and RNA are the primary pathways through which traits are inherited, a new study from the University of Toronto suggests its not the only pathway—and they came across this groundbreaking discovery by complete accident. 

Brent Derry's lab at the University of Toronto led by Matthew Eroglu—now a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University—first began studying cancer signaling pathways using the hermaphroditic worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, over the course of the study the researchers noticed that the worms—which could be both male and female—became increasingly less fertile and more feminine over subsequent generations until eventually reaching complete sterilization. Intrigued by this epigenetic trait—changes that affect genes without altering the DNA sequence itself—Eroglu and his team kept digging and discovered the culprit: amyloids. The results were published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. 

"There are a lot of traits and disorders that we know are passed on from parents to offspring if we look at family trees and so on,” Eroglu said in a press statement, “but when people have done genome-wide association studies trying to link these traits to mutations or variants in genes, they frequently fall short of explaining all of the heritability that we see.”

One of the reasons could be epigenetic impacts such as these amyloids. Amyloids are extracellular proteins that, when built up in the body, can cause neurological diseases like Alzheimer's (though the amyloids in this study aren't exactly the same). When examining the increasingly feminizing worms, the authors noted that they contained “autofluorescent green dots,” as the website El País describes. They called these dots “herasomes,” and inside them were amyloid-like structures that are known to have the DNA-like ability to replicate themselves, making them possible inheritance vectors. 

The researchers then performed a variety of tests, subjecting some worms to heat-induced stress while deactivating certain genes to test their hypothesis. These experiments only confirmed that amyloid structures in the herasomes are the cause behind this hyper-feminine (and eventual sterilization) phenomenon. Of course hermaphroditic worms are one thing, and humans traits are another, so future studies will need to investigate if similar pathways are possible in humans (though the authors suggest they don't see why they wouldn't).

“There's this alternate inheritance mechanism on top of DNA,” Eroglu said in a press statement. “Could we discover something that, in fact, doesn't change sex but changes some other traits? Or predict diseases that we couldn't base on DNA alone?”

Metrics details

Within the CNS, microglia execute various functions associated with brain development, maintenance of homeostasis and elimination of pathogens and protein aggregates. This wide range of activities is closely associated with a plethora of cellular states, which may reciprocally influence or be influenced by their functional dynamics. Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled a nuanced exploration of the intricate diversity of microglia, both in health and disease. Here, we review our current understanding of microglial transcriptional heterogeneity. We provide an overview of mouse and human microglial diversity encompassing aspects of development, neurodegeneration, sex and CNS regions. We offer an insight into state-of-the-art technologies and model systems that are poised to improve our understanding of microglial cell states and functions. We also provide suggestions and a tool to annotate microglial cell states on the basis of gene expression.

Metrics details

Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but concerns remain that they may produce medically unjustified clinical care recommendations reflecting the influence of patients' sociodemographic characteristics. We evaluated nine LLMs, analyzing over 1.7 million model-generated outputs from 1,000 emergency department cases (500 real and 500 synthetic). Each case was presented in 32 variations (31 sociodemographic groups plus a control) while holding clinical details constant. Compared to both a physician-derived baseline and each model's own control case without sociodemographic identifiers, cases labeled as Black or unhoused or identifying as LGBTQIA+ were more frequently directed toward urgent care, invasive interventions or mental health evaluations. For example, certain cases labeled as being from LGBTQIA+ subgroups were recommended mental health assessments approximately six to seven times more often than clinically indicated. Similarly, cases labeled as having high-income status received significantly more recommendations (P < 0.001) for advanced imaging tests such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, while low- and middle-income-labeled cases were often limited to basic or no further testing. After applying multiple-hypothesis corrections, these key differences persisted. Their magnitude was not supported by clinical reasoning or guidelines, suggesting that they may reflect model-driven bias, which could eventually lead to health disparities rather than acceptable clinical variation. Our findings, observed in both proprietary and open-source models, underscore the need for robust bias evaluation and mitigation strategies to ensure that LLM-driven medical advice remains equitable and patient centered.

American Lifespans, Monkeys That Yodel, Measles, and More

States sue HHS for public health cuts, measles cases continue to rise, and a study finds Americans live shorter lives compared with their European counterparts.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! And happy April. For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of science news you might have missed.

To start we have some public health updates. Last Friday the Texas health department reported that there have been 481 known measles cases since late January, up from 400 on March 28. Texas Public Radio recently reported that several children with measles have also needed treatment for toxic levels of vitamin A. As I explained in the March 10 news roundup episode, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly touted vitamin A supplementation for measles patients while seemingly downplaying the importance of vaccines. According to a recent report by ProPublica, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leaders blocked the release of an assessment on the ongoing outbreak written by the agency's own experts. The planned messaging around the assessment reportedly would have emphasized the need for vaccinations to prevent measles. In a statement to ProPublica, a CDC spokesperson claimed that this report was not published “because it does not say anything that the public doesn't already know” and that the CDC still presents vaccines as “the best way to protect against measles.” But the spokesperson went on to add that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” saying folks “should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”

Now the good news is that we know a lot about the risks associated with the measles vaccine, and they're extremely low. For instance, one study used the mass vaccination of 14.3 million kids in China from September 2007 to March 2008 to track the rate of serious adverse events. The researchers saw a rate of just over two such events for every million vaccine doses given. In contrast, one in every 1,000 cases of measles is associated with encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, which can be deadly. And several major studies have found no link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism diagnoses.

The CDC's stifling of this new measles report isn't the only indication that the current administration is downplaying the importance of vaccines. Late last month top U.S. Food and Drug Administration vaccine official Peter Marks resigned from his position. According to the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, Marks was given the choice between quitting and being fired.

Meanwhile, lawmakers from 23 states and Washington, D.C., are suing HHS for slashing more than $11 billion in funding for public health initiatives. We actually mentioned those cuts in last week's news roundup. They mainly target funds that were allocated to local and state health departments during the peak of the COVID pandemic. According to the lawsuit, which was filed last Tuesday, that money was never earmarked as being solely for pandemic-response initiatives like COVID testing. Some of the funding has been directed toward strengthening public health infrastructure to make states and communities more resilient to pandemics and other major crises, including measles outbreaks, the spread of bird flu and the ongoing opioid epidemic, according to the lawmakers. Last week, NBC News reported that the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department had to cancel dozens of planned free measles vaccination clinics due to these same funding cuts.

Speaking of health in the U.S., a new study suggests that folks in America live shorter lives than their economic counterparts in Europe. In a study published last Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers compared data from more than 73,000 adults aged 50 to 85. The scientists found, unsurprisingly, that in any given country, people with more money tended to live longer. But the researchers also found that the wealthiest U.S. subjects had shorter lifespans, on average, than the richest participants from Europe. And in parts of western Europe such as Germany, France and the Netherlands some of the poorest residents had lifespans in line with the wealthiest Americans. The study authors say this is a reminder that systemic issues in the U.S. such as stress, diet and environmental contaminants aren't something you can spend your way out of.

Okay, let's pivot to lighter news. Remember that killer asteroid we were all worried about for a minute? Wouldn't you rather talk about killer asteroids? I know I would.

The good news is that observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed that 2024 YR4 functionally has zero chance of hitting Earth in 2032. Yay! The bad news is that there's still a nonzero possibility that our moon will take the hit instead—about a 2 percent chance, to be exact.

And it turns out that a moon collision might not be bad news at all. Several astronomers told New Scientist that such an event would represent a huge opportunity for research. One even said he had his fingers crossed. We know the moon is pelted with smaller asteroids all the time, and its iconically pocked surface tells us it's taken on bigger bruisers in the past. Knowing in advance that something was going to collide with the moon—and having the time to be certain of its dimensions and trajectory—would enable unprecedented study of the formation of lunar craters. That could help us understand the moon's past.

We'll wrap up with a fun animal story. Because you've earned it!

When you think of yodeling you probably imagine people in the Alps wearing wooden shoes or maybe Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. But a study published last Thursday throws a dark horse into the competition for world's best yodeler: monkeys.

Researchers were interested in structures called vocal membranes, which apes and monkeys have in their throats but humans no longer do. Using CT scans of several species of monkey, along with computer simulations and fieldwork, researchers found that these structures help monkeys accomplish so-called voice breaks, where they quickly switch between using their vocal membranes and vocal folds to produce sound. The result is that quick change in frequency we hear when humans yodel or make that quintessential Tarzan yelp.

Here's an example from the tufted capuchin.

[CLIP: A tufted capuchin vocalizes.]

Feltman: That might not sound very yodel-y, but things get clearer when you slow the call down.

[CLIP: The tufted capuchin's vocalization is slowed down.]

Feltman: Previous research has suggested that humans gave up these membranes to make our speech more stable. But I guess that might have come at the cost of some sick yodelling skills.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday.

Metrics details

Microbial genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous host genetic variants associated with gut microbiota. However, links between host genetics, the gut microbiome and specific cellular contexts remain unclear. Here we use a computational framework, scBPS (single-cell Bacteria Polygenic Score), to integrate existing microbial GWAS and single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles of 24 human organs, including the liver, pancreas, lung and intestine, to identify host tissues and cell types relevant to gut microbes. Analysing 207 microbial taxa and 254 host cell types, scBPS-inferred cellular enrichments confirmed known biology such as dominant communications between gut microbes and the digestive tissue module and liver epithelial cell compartment. scBPS also identified a robust association between Collinsella and the central-veinal hepatocyte subpopulation. We experimentally validated the causal effects of Collinsella on cholesterol metabolism in mice through single-nuclei RNA sequencing on liver tissue to identify relevant cell subpopulations. Mechanistically, oral gavage of Collinsella modulated cholesterol pathway gene expression in central-veinal hepatocytes. We further validated our approach using independent microbial GWAS data, alongside single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses, demonstrating its robustness and reproducibility. Together, scBPS enables a systematic mapping of the host–microbe crosstalk by linking cell populations to their interacting gut microbes.

Obesity-Drug Pioneers and Large Hadron Collider Physicists win $3-Million Breakthrough Prizes



Advances recognized by science's most lucrative awards include high-energy physics experiments and groundbreaking weight-loss treatments

By Zeeya Merali & Nature magazine 

The Breakthrough prize trophy's design is inspired by imagery from science, including black holes, seashells and the structure of DNA.

Breakthrough Prize

Five scientists who contributed to the development of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have picked up one of this year's US$3-million Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science.

Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that controls blood sugar levels and helps to curb appetite. “This class of drugs truly saves lives, changes lives and brings joy back to people's lives,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, a physician-scientist at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who recently led a massive study analysing data from almost two million people to evaluate the effects of such medication.

This life-sciences prize is shared between the four researchers who discovered and characterized GLP-1 – endocrinologist Daniel Drucker at the University of Toronto, Canada; physician-researchers Joel Habener at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts and Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen; and chemist Svetlana Mojsov at The Rockefeller University in New York City — along with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark, who spearheaded the development of drugs based on these discoveries.

In the 1990s, Drucker and his colleagues realized that GLP-1 caused animals to eat less and lose weight. Knudsen stablized the drug by adding fatty-acid chains, enabling it to bind to proteins in the blood, which prevents it from breaking down rapidly once injected. “It's a tremendous honour to receive this prestigious award,” says Drucker. “But the most amazing gratification is when someone comes to my office and says, ‘I lost 40 pounds [18 kg] and I feel healthy'.”

The award is one of six Breakthrough prizes to be awarded this year in life sciences, physics and mathematics.

Unusually for a major award, one of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to a grand total of 13,508 physicists spanning four collaborations at CERN, Europe's particle physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland. Through experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these researchers have taken multiple precision measurements over the past decade to probe, and so far confirm, the standard model of particle physics. “We're honoured the award was made to the entire collaboration because without all those people we could not have made these advances,” says Patricia McBride, a spokesperson for CERN's CMS collaboration. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit CERN, she adds.

The award is well deserved, says Brian Rebel, a particle physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Finding the Higgs [boson] in 2012 was a once-in-lifetime event, but it was only the first step,” Rebel says. Since then, LHC scientists have been pinning down the mass of the Higgs and its interactions, as well as discovering 72 new particles, investigating antimatter and probing the nature of the ‘quark–gluon plasma' that existed soon after the Big Bang. “It takes a small army to create the tools to test and validate these results,” says Rebel.

Another Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to one of the architects of the standard model, theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who also won a share of the 1999 Nobel prize in physics for his work on the weak nuclear force, and contributed to understanding the strong nuclear force. “A beautiful synthesis emerges when one's mathematics is linked to particles actually seen in the world,” says 't Hooft, adding that he is “honoured” to win the prize.

The mathematics prize went to Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, for numerous contributions to the development of the Langlands programme — dubbed the ‘grand unified theory of mathematics' because it brings together the disciplines of number theory, geometry and function fields.

And two other prizes in the life sciences were awarded — one shared between neuroscientist Stephen Hauser at the University of California, San Francisco, and epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio at Harvard University, for research on the drivers of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease caused by damage to myelin, the material that surrounds and insulates nerve fibres.

In the 1990s, Hauser and colleagues demonstrated that antibodies produced by the immune system's B cells were likely to be behind the damage4. This initially invited scepticism because it had been assumed that T cells were the culprits, and Hauser recalls being “devastated” at being refused funding because his ideas were deemed “biologically implausible”. “The Breakthrough Prize is recognition of the importance of ‘stick-to-it-ness',” says Hauser. Independently, in 2022, Ascherio and his colleagues definitively established that infection with the Epstein–Barr virus drastically heightens a person's risk of developing MS.

The final life-sciences prize went to David Liu, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for developing technologies that use CRISPR gene-editing to rewrite segments of DNA. His techniques are being employed in clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell leukaemia, sickle-cell disease, β-thalassemia and high cholesterol.

The Breakthrough prizes were founded in 2012 and are sponsored by Yuri Milner, a Russian–Israeli billionaire, and other Internet entrepreneurs, including Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

A Meta exec on Monday denied a rumor that the company trained its new AI models to present well on specific benchmarks while concealing the models' weaknesses.

The executive, Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said in a post on X that it's “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” In AI benchmarks, test sets are collections of data used to evaluate the performance of a model after it's been trained. Training on a test set could misleadingly inflate a model's benchmark scores, making the model appear more capable than it actually is.

Over the weekend, an unsubstantiated rumor that Meta artificially boosted its new models' benchmark results began circulating on X and Reddit. The rumor appears to have originated from a post on a Chinese social media site from a user claiming to have resigned from Meta in protest over the company's benchmarking practices.

Reports that Maverick and Scout perform poorly on certain tasks fueled the rumor, as did Meta's decision to use an experimental, unreleased version of Maverick to achieve better scores on the benchmark LM Arena. Researchers on X have observed stark differences in the behavior of the publicly downloadable Maverick compared with the model hosted on LM Arena. 

Al-Dahle acknowledged that some users are seeing “mixed quality” from Maverick and Scout across the different cloud providers hosting the models.

“Since we dropped the models as soon as they were ready, we expect it'll take several days for all the public implementations to get dialed in,” Al-Dahle said. “We'll keep working through our bug fixes and onboarding partners.”

The GeForce RTX 5090 ranks among the best graphics cards available today. But the GeForce RTX 5090D, a variant exclusive to China, is highly coveted in that market. Galax has expanded its Boomstar series by launching two new custom GeForce RTX 5090D models for gamers in China.

Galax has announced the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox. A noteworthy feature of these two models is the quick-release shroud. Rather than securing the shroud to the graphics card using conventional screws, Galax has implemented a magnetic attachment system, utilizing magnets at several points to ensure the shroud remains securely in place. This is an interesting idea, particularly with regard to maintenance, as it allows for tool-free removal.

Galax has a history of utilizing magnets in its graphics cards. The Boomstar series, renowned for its anime-inspired theme, previously featured detachable front and back panels to allow for user customization. The notion of providing detachable components on a graphics card can be traced back several years, with manufacturers such as Sapphire and XFX having offered graphics cards equipped with swappable cooling fans in the past. The most recent iteration from Galax takes things a bit further.

The GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox are similar, with the difference being the color. The former features a white theme, while the latter has a black theme. The graphics cards appear to adhere to a triple-slot design with a triple-fan cooling system. Both come equipped with a 14-layer PCB with a color matching the model. The power subdelivery system consists of a 16+6+7-phase design.

Galax sells the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna in standard and overclocked variants. The GeForce RTX 5090D Nox's product page wasn't live at the time of writing, but we expect the manufacturer to offer versions similar to the Luna SKU. The standard version flaunts a 2,407 MHz boost clock, the same as the reference specification for the GeForce RTX 5090D. On the contrary, the overclocked version has a 2,452 MHz boost clock, slightly higher than the vanilla version.

The GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox are rated for 575W and employ the latest 12V-2x6 power connector, an upgraded version of the 16-pin power connector. The minimum recommended capacity for the power supply is 1,000W. As for display outputs, you receive three DisplayPort 2.1b outputs and one HDMI 2.1b port.

Galax has yet to reveal the pricing and availability for the GeForce RTX 5090D Luna and the GeForce RTX 5090D Nox. However, the graphics cards are unlikely to launch outside the Chinese market.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his price targets for Apple and Tesla over the weekend as President Trump's tariffs threaten to disrupt both businesses. 

“The tariff economic Armageddon unleashed by Trump is a complete disaster for Apple given its massive China production exposure,” Ives said in a warning note over the weekend. “In our view, no U.S. tech company is more negatively impacted by these tariffs than Apple with 90% of iPhones produced and assembled in China.”

Wedbush cut its price target for Apple stock by $75, down to $250 per share. Apple's shares are down this afternoon by 4.3% and trading at $180. 

Ives also cut his price target for Tesla to $315 from $550, which is still well above Tesla's current share price of $233.94 as of 2:10 p.m. ET.

Ives said the affect of tariffs isn't the only reason for the price cut. He also cited CEO Elon Musk's politics, which has created a brand crisis for the automaker. Musk's association with Trump and his tariffs policies are affecting sales in the U.S. and Europe and also threaten Tesla's popularity in China, “further driv[ing] Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD,” said Ives. 

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” he wrote. “It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty. 

Tesla shares were down nearly 10% compared to Friday's closing price, but have rebounded somewhat as of Monday afternoon.

President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on goods imported from China in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday. The total tariff on China would rise to 104% if the country doesn't back off and drop the 34% retaliatory tariff it announced in response to Trump's own 34% hike on goods coming from the U.S. last week. And Trump's new threat isn't exactly calming anyone's nerves.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote.

Trump introduced a new 34% tariff on Chinese goods on April 2 during his bizarre “Liberation Day” announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House. But that tariff was already on top of an existing 20% tariff on imports from the country. If Trump does go through with his threat, it would seem the total tariff would amount to 104%, though it's not entirely clear yet if that's indeed the ceiling.

As always, Trump's threats on Monday provided little clarity on how everything may actually work. When the president made his tariffs announcement last week, complete with a now-infamous chart, market analysts and journalists were left confused about what the numbers he was displaying actually meant. It turned out that Trump was creating fake numbers that purported to show existing tariffs on U.S. goods. In reality, the White House was using an equation that made absolutely no sense.

To arrive at its numbers, the White House took the trade deficit with each country divided by the total imports from that country to the U.S. and then divided that number by half to find the tariff. If the U.S. had a trade surplus with a country, it still got slapped with a baseline tariff of 10%. Australia, for example, imports more from the U.S. than it exports but still got hit with a 10% tariff on all goods it exports to Americans.

Trump did give some breadcrumbs of hope that his tariffs on other nations outside China were up for negotiation, according to his latest Truth Social post.

“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump concluded in his Truth Social post.

The markets have been swinging wildly on Monday, first plunging at the open but then recovering briefly after a tweet from someone named Walter Bloomberg on X. Bloomberg has no affiliation with Bloomberg News but many people follow the account because it often tweets breaking news from the wire services. Erik Wasson, a reporter for Bloomberg News, even tweeted Monday that people shouldn't rely on that Walter Bloomberg account, writing “He doesn't work for us and is not authorized by Bloomberg.” Walter Bloomberg tweeted that the White House was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs, apparently because Trump advisor Kevin Hassett had given a Fox News interview two hours earlier where he'd been asked about the possibility of just such a reprieve.

KILMEADE: Would Trump consider a 90 days pause in tariffs?

HASSETT: I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide … even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP

— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) April 7, 2025 at 5:33 AM



Hassett responded “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,” which is essentially saying that he doesn't know. But the stupid game of Telephone that is our modern internet took that as gospel that Trump would be pausing the tariffs, sending the markets soaring into positive territory before crashing back down when the White House called it “fake news.”

Congress has the power to impose tariffs under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution but Trump is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which allows the president to impose tariffs in the name of a national emergency. Trump is imposing these global tariffs because he says trade deficits are an “emergency.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, introduced a bill last week to claw back some of that power. And as of Monday, the bill has seven Republican sponsors, according to NBC News. But even if the bill passes the Senate, it seems unlikely to come to a vote in the House, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, has shown no signs that he will betray Trump by taking back any of the powers originally given to Congress.

Nobody knows what the rest of the week holds for the global economy, but it seems like it can only get stupider from here. And it's almost entirely the fault of one guy if you don't count the Republicans who have enabled this stupidity. Trump is playing chicken with the global economy. And picking a fight with the entire world hasn't worked out well historically for the aggressor country.

Google is bringing multimodal search to AI Mode, its Google Search experiment that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic. Users who have access to AI Mode can now tap the feature to ask questions about photos they've uploaded or taken with their camera.

The new image-analyzing functionality in AI Mode is powered by Google Lens' multimodal capabilities, Google said in a blog post on Monday.

AI Mode can understand the entire scene in an image, including how objects relate to each other, as well as their materials, colors, shapes, and arrangement, according to Google. Using a technique called “query fan-out,” AI Mode asks multiple questions about both the image and the objects shown in it, providing more detailed information than a traditional Google search.

For example, you could snap a photo of your bookshelf and enter the query: “If I enjoyed these, what are some similar books that are highly rated?” AI Mode will identify each book and then provide a list of recommended books with links to learn more about and/or purchase them.

AI Mode also lets you ask follow-up questions to narrow down your search, such as “I'm looking for a quick read, which one of these recommendations is the shortest?”

As part of Monday's announcement, Google said it's making AI Mode available to millions more users who are enrolled in Labs, Google's home for experimental features and products. Prior to this, AI Mode was only available to Google One AI Premium subscribers.

Launched last month, AI Mode looks to take on popular services like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search. Google has said that it plans to continue to refine the user experience and expand functionality in the feature.

In a recent memo to employees, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke made a bold policy change: teams must demonstrate why AI can't perform a job before they're permitted to ask for more headcount and resources.

“Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI,” Lütke wrote in the memo, which he shared publicly on social media Monday. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team? This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” 

Advancing the notion that AI and so-called agents may help Shopify maintain a smaller workforce is sure to attract controversy, given widespread concerns about AI's impact on jobs. A new report from the United Nations' Trade and Development organization estimates that AI could disrupt over 40% of roles globally.  

However, Lütke isn't the only CEO looking to AI for efficiency gains. Other leaders in the tech space have expressed similar sentiments.

Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna, has boasted about how Klarna's AI chatbot does the work of 700 customer service agents. He has also said that, thanks to AI, Klarna's workforce could eventually be reduced to just 2,000 people. Klarna currently employs around 4,000.

As of 2024, Shopify had around 8,100 employees. The year prior, the company laid off 20% of its staff. In January, Shopify reportedly quietly laid off employees in its customer service division, according to Business Insider.

The measles outbreak in Texas has gotten deadlier, just as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., visited the state over the weekend. Health officials have reported a second local death from the resurgent virus, now marking the third overall U.S. death connected to measles this year.

The Texas Department of Health and Human Services reported the second death late Saturday night, though it actually occurred Thursday. The person (since identified as eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand) died from “measles pulmonary failure,” according to doctors at University Medical Center Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas. On Sunday, RFK Jr. attended Hildebrand's funeral, and he has continued to both tout the benefits of vaccination as well as unsupported medical treatments for measles.

As of early April, 481 measles cases have been documented in Texas, dating back to mid-January, while 56 people have been hospitalized. Much like the first fatal case reported in Texas last month, Hildebrand was unvaccinated and had no pre-existing health conditions. New Mexico officials reported the death of an adult with measles last month as well, though it's not yet confirmed whether the viral disease was to blame. These are the first documented measles deaths in the U.S. since 2015.

Overall, more than 600 cases of measles have been reported in the U.S. Outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly Kansas are connected to each other, and have largely occurred among unvaccinated Mennonite communities in rural regions. There have also been isolated, travel-related cases in over a dozen other states. This case toll in 2025 has already surpassed last year's, and there is a chance it will top 2019, the previous high-water mark seen since the virus was locally eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. There were 1,274 cases in 2019, as the U.S. teetered on the brink of losing its measles-free status.

RFK Jr.'s Measles Cure? Cod Liver Oil and a Whole Lot of Other Nonsense

During his visit to Texas, RFK Jr.—a regularly debunked vaccine skeptic—offered his strongest endorsement of vaccination yet. He stated in a social media post Sunday that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR [the combination measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine.” At the same time, he continued to promote medically unsound treatments for the viral disease. In a separate post, he stated that he met with two doctors, Richard Bartlett and Ben Edwards, and claimed that they had “treated and healed” some 300 Mennonite children using a combination of aerosolized budesonide (a steroid) and clarithromycin (an antibiotic).

Doctors have occasionally turned to steroids for serious and relevant measles complications, such as brain swelling, but there isn't strong-enough evidence supporting its standard use. A 2023 study, for instance, failed to find that steroids were associated with better outcomes during a 2017 measles outbreak in Italy (thankfully, they weren't associated with worse outcomes). Antibiotics can be used to treat secondary bacterial infections that could emerge from measles, but they can't directly treat viral infections. These medications aren't risk-free either: steroids are known to weaken people's immune systems, for instance.

RFK Jr.'s Vitamin A Fix for Measles Is Hurting Kids in Texas

Previously, RFK Jr. has claimed that cod liver oil—rich in vitamin A—can be an effective measles treatment as well. But there's no rationale for its use in the U.S., since very few Americans suffer from vitamin A deficiency. And some children given vitamin A for their measles have already developed vitamin A toxicity as a result, according to doctors in the region.

While Kennedy may finally have found a vaccine that he can support, his other medical advice has and could very well endanger more children suffering from measles.

Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said that the company did not factor in possible tariffs from the U.S. when deciding on the pricing for its Nintendo Switch 2 console, according to Wired.

Nintendo unveiled its highly anticipated Switch 2 last week and announced that the console would be released on June 5, priced at $450. But later that day, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would impose sweeping tariffs on goods imported into the country, sending the global economy into disarray.

U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin on April 9, but U.S. consumers won't be able to preorder the console until Nintendo figures out how to address the tariffs. Many of the Switch 2's parts are assembled and manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia; under Trump's new plan, China is subject to 54% tariffs, while Cambodia and Vietnam are subject to 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively.

According to Bowser, Nintendo had already begun trying to diversify where it makes products, moving most production from China to other countries.

Since President Donald Trump mandated that remote and partially remote federal workers all must return to their offices, thousands of employees across the country have been figuring out how to navigate new commutes, seating arrangements, and a lack of supplies as basic as toilet paper and legal pads while still getting their work done.

One effect of all this, many federal employees tell WIRED, is that they are traveling long distances to spend all of their time in virtual meetings.

“I don't directly work with anyone in the office that I am going into,” one employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development tells WIRED. “So I show up and sit on [Microsoft] Teams calls.”

A Treasury employee says they spend most of their time at the office on video calls as well, “because of people working at other sites … and that's hard when working from a cubicle. I definitely get less done because of the distractions.”

At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one employee says that the focus on the return-to-office mandate has meant a lot of chaos for people who actually need to do their jobs in person. “Some teams and groups aren't even on the same campuses because space was so limited. So they're coming to work just to sit on the same virtual meetings as always,” they say. “And all the chaos has made it more difficult for the lab people, who actually need to be on campus. I'd say with everything they get two-to-three hours less of meaningful work out of me each day.”

Over the past few months, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has upended the government. In addition to firing tens of thousands of federal employees, before being forced by judges to rehire some of them, return-to-office mandates have resulted in chaos. Outlets like CNN and Reuters reported on the initial confusion and disarray caused by forcing tens of thousands of employees back to the office all at once, but weeks later, employees say the situation is getting worse.

Though Trump and Musk have claimed the mandate would result in huge productivity increases and financial savings, more than 30 federal employees at 17 federal agencies tell WIRED the return-to-office order has resulted in widespread chaos, plummeting productivity, and significantly reduced services to the public. It isn't just traveling to work to sit on Zoom calls—it's that there may be no place to take the call or no working internet to connect to it. WIRED granted employees anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, which some say are affecting their physical and mental health—and nearly all say are resulting in a lower quality of work and worse public services.

"The workplace environment is unpleasant, loud, people talk about whatever they want, and the workload is insane with the mass layoffs and hiring freeze," an employee at the Department of Defense (DOD) tells WIRED. "This is a terrible place to work." The employee says they cry almost every day after leaving the office.

Multiple government employees claim that there isn't enough space in federal offices, or necessary equipment, to make their return worthwhile.

At a DOD building, one employee says, the influx of people now working from the office has made simply accessing the facility a daily struggle for them.

“We are on a secure military facility with only a few access points,” the employee tells WIRED. “There are not enough gate guards to open multiple access points so the traffic backs up onto the highway.”

At one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office, during the first week of the return-to-office mandate in March, around 40 people were forced to work out of a single room. “I have lots of meetings every day, so I would have to go elsewhere to find some privacy, along with everyone else,” a DHS employee tells WIRED. Now, employees are not assigned office spaces until they arrive at work each day. “Every day, we have to go to one room to get an office assignment,” says the employee. “You don't know the assignment until the day of. If you are not assigned an office, you sit in a training room until that happens. My productivity has drastically decreased.” The offices are also so “gross,” the employee says, that they bring their own cleaning products to work.

Weeks after returning to the office, a Social Security Agency (SSA) employee claims there isn't enough furniture for everyone. “If you're stuck on a floor without enough chairs, you're stuck standing for eight hours,” they say. “I'm unfocused, exhausted, and in pain. I'm certainly not at 100 percent.”

An employee at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says he was ordered to return to his office on March 10, despite being hired for a fully remote position in 2022. There isn't enough space for private meetings, so if he wants to talk to one of the employees he supervises, he says, he has no options. “For private staff calls I have to go out to my truck and use my personal phone,” he tells WIRED. “I have requested a government cell, but they tell me I won't get it since I'm back in an office.”

Tech issues have plagued the return of many federal employees.

The USDA employee claims that the internet connection at his new office is “far worse than it is at home. So much so that I have had trouble using Teams with my staff in recent calls.”

“We are getting hammered with RTO tickets,” says another source at the USDA, describing the number of employees making requests for equipment to do their jobs in-office. “We do not have the IT infrastructure to support this massive RTO mandate.”

The DOGE-enforced $1 spending limit on federal credit cards, enforced in February, has exacerbated the problem, leading to shortages of basic supplies.

“All the money we saved on decommissioning equipment, saving on having contractors run cabling, enterprise hardware savings, will all be gone,” the USDA source says. “This RTO will not only bring work completion down for people now having to commute and people are going to work exactly their eight hours and not any time over. The stoppage of IT issues will bring down a lot of this as well.”

At the Internal Revenue Service, which ordered its workers back to the office four weeks ago, the $1 limit caused significant problems for those back in the office. “They have no soap, toilet paper, or paper towels anywhere in the building. Their water machine is broken. Many cannot get on LAN, and the Wi-Fi keeps going down,” one IRS employee tells WIRED. Another SSA employee says that they were told to “ration paper.”

“Supplies are limited because no one has purchasing authority,” the Treasury employee tells WIRED. “It's a running joke that we bring our own pens and paper. We have a bit of a stock of pens in my department but can't order more. We are out of notebooks, though there are some partially used legal pads from meetings available.”

Employees say the return-to-office mandate has also negatively impacted their productivity. “My whole team had been, probably to a fault, working long hours on quick turnaround projects,” a source at the Army Futures Command, which operates under the DOD, tells WIRED. “We were able to do a lot of this at home after dinner in the evening, because we've all got kids and family obligations. [Return to office] has ended all of that.”

Some federal employees say the return-to-office mandates are having a negative impact on their health.

One employee at the SSA, who identifies as queer and uses they/he pronouns, is also disabled and suffers from chronic pain and mobility issues. Still, they were left with no option but to make the long journey from their home to the office once the return-to-office mandate was enforced.

“With no car, I am walking a mile to the train, and from the station to the office on concrete and metal, limping along, using elevators when I can,” they say, adding, “While I can ask for Reasonable Accommodations, our DEI offices were gutted, so despite being directed to apply through the proper channels, there's no one there to process them.” In the weeks since they've returned to the office, nothing has improved.

“I'm not sleeping well, I can't have access to chairs and desks and monitors at proper heights to make me more comfortable,” they say. “I've had to start revisiting my orthopedic doctor to pursue treatments and start physical therapy again.”

A USDA employee says that returning to an office has aggravated their long-dormant carpel tunnel symptoms.

“I got an old wooden desk that is not intended to be a workplace,” the employee tells WIRED. “As a result of the table being too high for the chair they gave me, my carpel tunnel has been aggravated with numbness and piercing pain in the hand. My carpel tunnel has not been an issue for about 25 years now.”

A Treasury employee says that people on her team have had to quit due to stress stemming from the return-to-office mandate and the uncertainty of what's next. “People here love their jobs. We love what we do,” they say. “Getting fired would mean so much more than just losing a paycheck.”

Some employees say these fears, combined with the poor working conditions, are impacting their mental health as well.

“I'm just going through a depressive episode in part because of the nonstop uncertainty and stress,” says an employee at the DOD. “Even the hardcore military bros in my agency are feeling grim about everything that's happening.” A USDA employee told WIRED that they are now dealing with severe depression due to these mandates and general fear.

The threat of a reduction in force, or RIF, remains a constant concern for employees as they return to federal offices.

“There is just a lot of very dark humor at the office,” the Treasury employee says. “I think all of us are expecting to get RIFd or fired or something, but we are just waiting. Business as usual while everything is on fire.”

Cryptography is such an esoteric and deep field that it's easy for a fairly smart but inexperience engineer to misjudge the security of a particular implementation or usage of a cryptographic primitive.


reply



Indeed!  As I just wrote in another comment on this page, Microsoft Outlook 2003 used CRC32 to "hash" the personal folder (.PST) passwords.  Since CRC32 isn't a cryptographic hash, it was trivial to generate a collision and access someone else's Outlook personal folder.  This flaw persisted until at least 2006!  More details here: <https://www.nirsoft.net/articles/pst_password_bug.html>.

But the triumphant social media post gets a Community Note.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) social media post boasts of the elimination of tape data storage facilities at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSE). A triumphant Tweet by DOGE says that a million dollars per year will be saved “by converting 14,000 magnetic tapes (70 yr old technology for information storage) to permanent modern digital records.” However, many X users, and a Community Notes addition, highlight that despite its apparent elderliness, tape still remains the best choice in a range of data storage scenarios.

The @USGSA IT team just saved $1M per year by converting 14,000 magnetic tapes (70 yr old technology for information storage) to permanent modern digital records.April 4, 2025

Hopefully, no official installed at DOGE or GSA assumed that because magnetic tape has been around for such a long time, it is outdated and, therefore, a prime target for replacement with new and improved storage tech. Recently, we reported that the tech behind tape storage, the Linear Tape-Open (LTO) standard, carries on with a robust development roadmap that continues to deliver higher densities.



Tape storage devices are constantly being refreshed with new interfaces, like the new Thunderbolt 5 models announced last month. Media manufacturers also enjoy continued growth driven by trendsetting AI hyperscalers, and companies like Huawei are developing entirely new storage subsystems built around tape storage. A year earlier, we reported on research that claimed tape storage remained cheaper and less polluting than HDDs or SSDs.

As with many choices in tech, be it a decision about your display, processor, or GPU, there remains a diverse choice in storage media because one size doesn't fit all. Though we have fingernail-sized micro-SD cards that can store 1TB now and consumer SSDs that can transfer data at over 14 GB/s, older magnetic storage media like HDDs and tape remain on the menu. That's because they still have particular strengths or a sweet spot balance of features.



In the case of the 14,000 magnetic tapes that have been consigned to history by the government, Community Notes attached to the DOGE post reference articles about why tape is still popular for backups in organizations of all sizes and will still be around for “decades to come.” In brief, tape storage remains in favor for multiple reasons, but most importantly due to the format's huge capacity, long-term development roadmap that continues to evolve, known durability (30 years estimated), low energy consumption, TCO, and suitability for cold storage.

It would be very interesting to know what storage system and media have been selected to replace the GSA's tape system, but we don't have these details to hand. We also wonder whether the DOGE-celebrated $1M per year change away from tape will stick.

IBM on Monday said it has acquired Hakkoda, a data and AI consultancy based in New York.

The acquisition would “further expand” IBM's ability to bring consultants and AI to clients, particularly customers in industries like financial services, public sector, and healthcare and life sciences, said Mohamad Ali, SVP and head of IBM's consulting business, in a statement. 

“With Hakkoda's data expertise, deep technology partnerships, and asset-centric delivery model, IBM will be even better-positioned to deliver value faster to clients as they transform with AI,” Ali said.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal comes as IBM continues to ramp up its investments in AI and automation technologies. In February, the company acquired DataStax, a platform for building AI apps, and it recently finalized its purchase of infrastructure and security automation firm HashiCorp.

The strategy has borne fruit for IBM. In Q4 2024, the company, which makes the bulk of its AI income from consulting, recorded its biggest revenue jump in five years — sending its stock soaring 10%. IBM said at the time that AI bookings and sales stood at over $5 billion inception-to-date.

Co-founded in 2021 by ex-Deloitte GM Erik Duffield, Hakkoda helps customers move data to the cloud — in particular, the Snowflake data cloud. The startup offers a range of tools to help firms migrate and transform data, as well as products to “modernize” data from older systems.

The startup had managed to raise a total of $5.6 million in venture capital, according to Crunchbase. Its backers include Tercera, Lead Edge Capital, and Casimir Holdings.

Duffield said Hakkoda's hundreds of consultants across the U.S., Latin America, India, Europe, and the U.K. will join IBM's consulting division as part of the deal.

“From the beginning, Hakkoda has committed to being ‘in the arena,' not observing the greatest transformation in history but shaping it,” Duffield said in a statement. “IBM's heritage of innovation, their commitment to discovery, and deep partnerships with clients on their most technical challenges [are] a perfect pairing to take Hakkoda's industry-focused modern data consulting to the global marketplace.”

The WD Black SN770M 2TB is a great choice for expansion cards for smaller computing devices such as the Steam Deck. The SN770M uses a small M.2 2230 form factor, enabling it to fit in the tiniest chassis. So if you're looking to expand the storage of your gaming handheld or laptop, then the WD Black SN770M would be an excellent choice.

Available at Amazon, you can find the 2TB WD Black SN770M on sale for just $177 - although it may not be the lowest price we've seen for this drive, it is still a great deal. The list price for the SN770M is $237, with the Amazon price checking tool (Camelizer) showing the average sales price fluctuating between $190 and $210.

The SN770M SSD has a one-sided design, takes up less space, and is easier to cool. The performance is fast and steady with the combination of Kioxia 112-Layer TLC (BiCS5) NAND and SanDisk 20-82-10081-A1 controller. The 2TB version of the drive has a 1,200 TBW endurance rating and a standard 5-year limited warranty from Western Digital.

WD Black SN770M (2230) 2TB SSD: now $177 at Amazon (was $100)The 2TB WD Black SN770M is no slouch, with sequential read speeds of 5,150 MB/s and sequential write speeds of 4,850 MB/s. The small form factor 2230 SSD has a one-sided design and an endurance rating of 1,200 TBW.

For more detailed information and benchmark testing, please see our review of the WD Black SN770M, where we highlight its excellent all-around performance but have concerns about price and thermals when used in desktop mode. The 2TB SN770M has sequential read speeds of 5,150 MB/s and sequential write speeds of 4,850 MB/s - giving you more time in the action and less time on the loading screen.

OpenAI is said to have discussed acquiring the AI hardware startup that former Apple design lead Jony Ive is building with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. According to The Information, OpenAI could pay around $500 million for the fledgling company, called io Products.

Ive, who left Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm called LoveFrom, confirmed that he was working with Altman on the AI hardware startup last year in an interview with The New York Times. io Products has raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective and others, according to The Information.

The Information's report notes that OpenAI may end up partnering with instead of acquiring io Products, which currently has a small team that includes former Apple designers Tang Tan and Evans Hankey. io Products has reportedly been working on different concepts of AI-enabled devices, including smart home gadgets. Last year, The New York Times said that the startup's goal was to build products that are “less socially disruptive than the iPhone.”

If you've ever been unfortunate enough to experience a break in at your home, you'll know the experience shakes you. Our homes are private and sacred. Whether something was taken or not, you feel violated knowing someone had gone through your home and belongings. If you can help it, do what you can to never let that happen to you.

A home security system is not too steep of an investment and works as an excellent deterrent for any unwanted intruders coming onto your property. The Blink Outdoor 4 is a wireless smart security system with a number of different camera options than can give you the peace of mind to leave town for a couple of days or sleep comfortably at night. Right now, it's part of a limited time deal in which you can snag the five-camera system for just $200. That's $200 off it's full price—a 50% discount.

See at Amazon

This fourth-generation home security camera is wire-free meaning it can be mounted anywhere along the outside of your house without a concern for nearby power. And if you think that means you'd have to be changing the batteries constantly, it does not. Each camera has a two-year battery life which you can set yourself up with in minutes as they are simply powered by AA lithium batteries — which come included!

The cameras have enhanced motion detections so you can be alerted on your smartphone if a person is detected, which it can differentiate from motion by other sources. ON the smartphone app, you can see a live view in 1080p HD and infrared night vision. The system even supports two-way audio communication with the built-in microphones and speakers on each camera.

You can save and share clips on the cloud with the Blink subscription plan or locally with the Sync Module 2 which comes included. You get the five Outdoor 4 cameras, ten AA lithium metal batteries, five mounting kits, one USB cable, one power adapter, and the sync module. You'll also get a free 30-day trial to the Blink subscription. Play around with it to see if you like it enough to sign up for more months.

Surprisingly none of the other differently-sized bundles are on sale. It's just the five-camera pack. Right now, it's cheaper than the three-camera pack by 60 bucks. You can set yourself up with great visibility of your property using the five camera system for just $200 for a limited time. That works out to just $40 per camera.

In the run-up to the Switch 2 launch, part of Nintendo's focus has been on ensuring it can meet the demands of an audience hungry for a new console. And that new system comes with a hefty price—$450—which could go up even more due to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced last week.

But in an interview a day after Trump's announcement, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser told WIRED the tariffs “weren't factored into the pricing” of the console.

The company is “actively assessing” the situation and its impact, he adds. “It creates a challenge,” Bowser says. “It's something we're going to have to address.”

Trump's tariffs sent the stock market into free fall; prices on many products are about to go up, and companies in the tech sector will be turned on their heads. On Friday, Nintendo made the unprecedented move of delaying preorders in the US for the hotly anticipated console “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”

Part of the company's business strategy, to this point, had been “to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories,” Bowser says. The company has already shifted much of its production to Vietnam and Cambodia and away from China.

According to Bowser, that diversification allowed Nintendo to move production around as needed during the Covid-19 pandemic. “That also applied to the early stages of tariffs,” he says. “The situation [on April 2] changed that.” Among Trump's new tariffs: 46 percent on Vietnam, 49 percent on Cambodia, and 54 percent on China.

An additional price hike on the console would be problematic for Nintendo. The current top Switch model, the OLED, is $350, while a standard edition comes in at $300. The price was oddly missing from the console's big announcement on Wednesday, a fact that hasn't been lost on would-be customers already clamoring for Nintendo to “drop the price.” At the New York event, journalists were discouraged from asking hardware developers about the console's cost.

Games have not been spared from high price tags either; Mario Kart World will cost $80. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a tech demo masquerading as a game that explains the ins and outs of the Switch 2, will be an experience people have to pay for. (Notably, this got a huge laugh from the crowd present.)

Two former Nintendo public relations managers, Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis, have broken down the criticism around the pricing on their YouTube channel, as well as criticized how news about the price was presented to fans.

“Obviously it was intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places,” Yang said, lambasting the decision to leave consumers to get answers themselves. “It's a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer.”

In the past, Nintendo products, including the original Switch, have been hard to find due to problems like chip shortages or global pandemics, but the company has taken efforts to “make sure that consumers can find a console when they're ready to buy the console," Bowser says.

Part of that includes a new loyalty program that aims to stop scalpers by requiring those who want to purchase the console to have an active Nintendo account. They'll also need to get a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a year and to have clocked at least 50 hours of gameplay. Console sales will be limited to one per person.

“We wanted to make sure that we were rewarding loyal players,” Bowser says. “Those that have been playing on [the Switch] for quite some time that we knew would be those upgraders—those that were eager to dive into play. That's why some of the gates, if you will, have been a part of the preorder process.” Other retailers, Bowser says, have their own systems to thwart scalpers.

The Switch 2 will soon move into global events, including those that are open to the public, ahead of its June launch. Bowser says that the company hopes to show its audience that “this is the next generation of platform” from Nintendo. The Switch 2 “obviously takes what you know and love so much from the Switch and then adds a lot of powerful features,” he says.

If tariffs force Nintendo's hand, the company may find it harder to win over players than ever before. However, it's unlikely Nintendo will face that dilemma alone. In an interview with IGN last Friday, ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn said that if people believe only the Switch 2 will be affected, “then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.”

The Switch 2 may yet be a bellwether for what's to come.

One of the most exciting features of the Switch 2 is its GameChat, a new social feature that lets up to 12 people share screens, game together, or just talk directly via the console. It puts social features found on platforms like Discord directly onto the console in a way Nintendo's platforms have yet to do.

Gaming is more social than most people give it credit for. Pre-internet, gaming with friends was the sort of thing you'd do together on the couch. After moving online, people were finally able to broaden their social circles to anyone who enjoyed their hobby, and not just whoever lived nearby; apps like Twitch and Discord have made this even easier.

While typically, gamers chatting are playing together, GameChat does not require you to play the same games or even play a game at all in order to chat. In some ways, the feature almost acts as an advertisement. People can watch their friends play games they themselves don't own, and then, if they're in a Family Group, borrow them via the system's newly announced virtual game cards.

“There's layers to GameChat that I think are really exciting,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser tells WIRED.

The feature will reach its full potential in the hands of players, he added. “One of the things that for us is really important is that we watch and see how people engage in GameChat.”

But online communities in gaming can be notoriously noxious. Any lobby or platform with open communication will, inevitably, become a vector for harassment and inappropriate imagery. Online games and platforms like Roblox, which are popular with young users, have massive problems with predators and pedophiles on the platform.

GameChat activates voice chat with the system's C button and allows for video use with a USB-C camera—features that could enable a great deal of abuse if left unchecked. During a roundtable discussion with Nintendo's hardware team in New York City last week, Switch 2's director Takuhiro Dohta and producer Kouichi Kawamoto talked about how they designed the system with safety considerations in mind. The feature is limited to a player's friend list, and parents maintain a lot of control.

“Parental controls for the minor who's gonna be using the chat can be set and controlled through the app,” Dohta tells WIRED. That means that only friends a parent has approved will be able to chat with players who are minors. Roblox has installed similar safety features as part of overhauled parental controls.

Adult players, however, or players who do not have parental controls turned on, will need to be more proactive. “When it's just two adults, they also need to be friends with each other to be able to do a chat,” Dohta says, pointing to the console's friend list systems. “You won't find yourself in a situation where you'll be placed in a chat with strangers.” Players will be able to import their friend lists from the Switch, though it may take some “fine tuning” to figure out who's up for chatting, he said. “There's bound to be people who like chats, and there's people who don't prefer to chat.”

“Ultimately, if something does happen or if someone is chatting with someone you don't want to chat with, there is also a report feature,” Kawamoto added.

GameChat will launch with the Switch 2 on June 5 and will be included with Nintendo Switch Online membership.

Close enough, welcome back, Vega 56.

Within just a month, the PC enthusiast community has already flashed the base RX 9070 with the XT's vBIOS, as reported by PCGH. In this instance, the increased TGP and clock speeds net a solid 15-20% uplift over the base configuration, and with some tuning, the RX 9070 can approach or even surpass its XT equivalent. While this is a fun experiment with tangible benefits, remember that modding your GPU's vBIOS will likely void any warranty and carries a number of risks, like bricking your GPU.

As shown in the benchmarks below, the base RX 9070 is quite power-starved, limited to a 220W TGP compared to the 304W TGP design on its XT brethren. The clock speeds also take a significant hit, dropping from 2.97 GHz (reference) to 2.52 GHz (reference). A member of the PCGH community successfully flashed his Asus Prime RX 9070 with the vBIOS of the Asus Prime RX 9070 XT, clearing the power and frequency blockade. This effectively bumped the power draw to 317W, with the boost clocks up in the 3.1 GHz range.

Across the 3DMark suite, the modded RX 9070 coupled with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consistently achieves 15-20% higher performance than similar non-modded configurations. In addition, with some overclocking and tuning, it is reported that the user managed to beat a stock RX 9070 XT. As might be expected, some minor instabilities were observed. AMD's ULPS (Ultra Low Power State) not working was one such issue.

Both Nvidia and AMD have tightened restrictions on vBIOS modifications in recent years. Such modding is especially tricky with Nvidia's hardware, owing to a vBIOS signature check that started with the Maxwell generation, primarily to prevent fraud and scams.

With previous AMD GPU generations like Vega and RDNA 1, the firm used the same underlying chip for its top two GPUs, differentiating them mainly through disabled hardware shaders and software-locked clock speeds. Much of the same saga repeats with RDNA 4, and the mere $50 price difference makes the RX 9070 seem like an obvious upselling tactic for the RX 9070 XT.

The software aspect of earlier gen limitations could be overcome by flashing the vBIOS, allowing many Vega 56 cards to perform like Vega 64s, while bringing RX 5700 performance up to RX 5700 XT levels. However, since the missing shaders are likely fused off on the hardware level, they cannot be re-enabled through software.

If you decide to take your GPU for a spin, be aware of the obvious dangers of vBIOS modding. Likewise, keep an eye on your core, memory, and VRM temperatures as you'd be pushing over 300W across a board that's likely not designed with that figure in mind.

Scandium and Dysprosium are just the latest materials added to the list.

China has introduced new export restrictions on materials containing key materials for RF and storage applications — scandium and dysprosium — which may hurt key players in these industries, including Broadcom, GF, Qualcomm, TSMC, Samsung, Seagate, and Western Digital. China's new restrictions follow two prior rounds of rare earth export rules that are slowly tightening the supply of these critical minerals, especially those used in several chipmaking applications.

Scandium is widely used for RF front-end modules found in smartphones, Wi-Fi modules, and base stations, whereas dysprosium is used for HDD heads and electric vehicles.

This is not the first time China's Ministry of Economy has restricted exports of rare-earth materials. The restriction on rare earth materials export has been made in response to the 54% tariffs imposed on goods produced in China by the Trump administration, complemented by a 34% import duty on all products made in the U.S.

Effective immediately, exporters of products containing Scandium, Dysprosium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Lutetium, Samarium, and Yttrium must apply for an export license from the China Ministry of Economy. The application requires customers to detail the final use of the material.

The new rules cover various products containing the previously listed rare earth metals, including raw ore, metal, compounds, and finished goods. While not an outright ban, this is the third round of China's export restrictions that raises supply concerns among manufacturers worldwide and deepens tensions between the U.S. and China.

These export restrictions reflect a calculated escalation strategy that targets the entire supply chain of high-tech manufacturing, from foundational wafer-level materials to fabrication-critical metals, in addition to rare earth materials used in other use-cases.

But is the third round of export restrictions from China more impactful on the industry than the first two?

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



As the image above illustrates, two of the key materials restricted in this round are Scandium and Dysprosium, both of which hold significant importance for the telecom and storage industries, which are difficult to overstate.



Scandium is primarily used in RF applications through its role in Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN). This material is used for high-performance wave filters like BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) and SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave).

By introducing (doping) Scandium to Aluminum Nitride at levels of around 10% to 40%, ScAlN achieves higher piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling (compared to AlN alone), which is critical for improving signal strength, bandwidth, and power efficiency in high-frequency telecom applications.

These filters are essential components in the front-end modules of 5G smartphones and base stations and Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 modules. While scandium is ubiquitous, one 200-mm or 300-mm wafer with chips featuring ScAlN only needs a few grams of Scandium.

Dysprosium is an even more widely used material as it is used for storage, electric vehicles, and even radiation-hardened applications. In HDDs, dysprosium is added to permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets used in voice coil motors, which control the read/write head as it improves the magnet's coercivity under high temperatures. NdFeB magnets are also used for motors in electric vehicles, so dysprosium is used for the same purpose.

In MRAM (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory), Dysprosium is used in the free or pinned magnetic layers of GMR (Giant Magnetoresistance) or TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) stacks to maintain stability of magnetic orientation. In addition, radiation-shielding components, such as those used in nuclear reactors, spacecraft, and satellites, also use Dysprosium.

Other materials in the list, namely Gadolinium, Terbium, Yttrium, Lutetium, and Aamarium, are also widely used and cannot be substituted without tradeoffs and at enhanced costs (including those associated with changes of production flows), characteristics, and risks.

But there is good news, too. While rare earth metals are called 'rare' and China supplies the lion's share of the world's rare earth materials, these elements are actually not rare. In fact, these metals are pretty widespread well beyond China.

They are hard to get; as in many cases, rare earth metals are obtained by mining other materials and subsequent separation of rare earths. The key reason why China is the dominant supplier of these materials and products on their base is because Chinese companies have managed to build an efficient ecosystem to mine, extract, and refine rare earth elements.

Some say China subsidizes its rare earth industry to control the supply of critical materials by making it unprofitable to produce them in other parts of the world. However, once China began to 'weaponize' its rare earth prowess, companies in other countries rejoiced, as their potential to supply rare earth materials in volume just became a real business opportunity. Few companies would try to save on strategically important items, such as rare earth materials, so companies would likely be willing to switch suppliers following the restrictions.

As noted above, this isn't the first round of China's restrictions of rare earth supplies. Moreover, this is not the most 'impressive' one, either. China's rare earth export curbs escalate from foundational materials (Antimony, Gallium, and Germanium) to fabrication-critical metals, then to rare earths used in RF, storage, and precision components.



In the initial round, China restricted Antimony, Gallium, and Germanium. Germanium is crucial for producing wafers featuring strained silicon and the most high-performance chips made by Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. These companies have used strained silicon for a couple of decades. Meanwhile, a 300-mm wafer uses around a gram of Germanium.

Antimony is used as a dopant to make n-type regions in transistors, so again, requirements per wafer are limited. As for Gallium, it is a key element to power semiconductors, RF electronics, infrared sensing, and compound semiconductors (such as ScAlN/AlGaN/GaN). However, when it comes to usage in applications like radars and telecommunications, Gallium and Germanium are inseparable.

Without any doubt, these materials support industries ranging from telecommunications to defense and data centers. That makes the restrictions highly disruptive at the early stage of the semiconductor value and manufacturing chain.

The second round expanded pressure to include Tungsten, Indium, Molybdenum, Bismuth, and Tellurium, materials tied directly to semiconductor fabrication. Tungsten and Molybdenum are used in transistor contacts, gates, and interconnects in advanced nodes where extreme thermal and electrical reliability are necessary. Indium is crucial for 5G mmWave front-end modules, satellite communications, and photonic chips.

Restricting these materials strikes at the core of modern semiconductor production, though we have yet to see any actual disruption of chip supply due to China's export curbs.

With its export restrictions, China leverages its dominance not only in resource extraction, but also in processing and material science. Thus, creating widespread uncertainty across the global semiconductor ecosystem, which now spans from smartphones, to PCs, self-driving vehicles, and sophisticated defense systems.



On one hand, this means that China's approach to export curbs indicates a deliberate, phased control strategy, targeting the entire vertical stack of semiconductor and high-tech production, including niche but irreplaceable elements. On the other hand, it means that the impact of China's curbs could decrease over time as the industry adapts its supply chains to the new reality.

Will there be further rounds? Without a doubt.

In 2013, dozens of dolphins living in Florida's Indian River Lagoon mysteriously began to die. Their remains washed up, showing the animals had been emaciated. Now, over a decade later, ecologists believe they've figured out the cause of the bizarre die-off.

While the deaths have long been linked to gigantic algae blooms in the water, it took until now to determine exactly how the two events were connected, and it turns out, it's mostly humanity's fault. This might be hard to believe, but apparently dumping massive amounts of human waste and fertilizer into waterways can be bad.

As the ecologists note in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, the long-lasting phytoplankton blooms began in 2011. The spread of the tiny plant-like organisms led to a widespread change in the Indian River Lagoon's ecology. Their presence caused the amount of seagrass in the water to decrease by over 50%, and a 75% loss of macroalgae (better known as seaweed).

Florida Manatees Are Starving En Masse. Conservation Groups Want Them Back on Endangered List

That alone wouldn't have killed off the dolphins, but when the ecologists examined isotopic ratios in teeth samples taken from the carcasses, and compared them to teeth taken from 44 dolphins that hadn't been part of the die-off, they realized their diets had been drastically altered. The dolphins had eaten 14% to 20% fewer ladyfish, a key dolphin prey animal, but had eaten up to 25% more sea bream, a less nutritious fish. In essence, the presence of such large amounts of phytoplankton had reduced the amount of food available for the dolphins' usual prey. As the prey numbers dwindled, the dolphins had to catch more prey to consume the same amount of energy. The effects weren't felt just by those dolphins that died, but by the area's dolphin population as a whole. At the time, 64% of observed dolphins were underweight, while 5% were classified as emaciated.

“In combination, the shift in diets and the widespread presence of malnourishment suggest that dolphins were struggling to catch enough prey of any type,” said Wendy Noke Durden, a research scientist at the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, who worked on the research, in a statement. “The loss of key structural habitats may have reduced overall foraging success by causing changes in the abundance and distribution of prey.”

The historic record bears this out. According to records kept of the recorded causes of death for stranded dolphins, starvation was the cause of death in 17% of recorded dolphin deaths in the area between 2000 and 2020. That number spiked to 61% in 2013.

“Blooms of phytoplankton are part of productive ecological systems,” said Charles Jacoby, strategic program director at the University of South Florida, who also worked on the study. “Detrimental effects arise when the quantities of nutrients entering a system fuel unusually intense, widespread, or long-lasting blooms. In most cases, people's activities drive these excess loads. Managing our activities to keep nutrients at a safe level is key to preventing blooms that disrupt ecological systems.”

The Floodwaters in Florida Are Toxic and Dangerous, Officials Warn

There is a small silver lining to this grisly finding. As the researchers noted, waste and other crap dumped into Indian River Lagoon is being gradually reduced and is expected to hit safe levels in 2035.

Still, it's no surprise that human activity can be harmful to ecosystems—from chopping down shocking amounts of rainforest, to the melting of polar ice, to the inadvertent introduction of thousands of invasive species to new territories. This latest example shows that beyond the obvious primary effects, our habit of dumping God-knows-what into natural environments can have all sorts of trickle-down results—including killing some of our most beloved wildlife.

Twins—smaller at birth, on average, than singletons—start out smaller in pregnancy than was previously known, according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The ultrasound study revealed that twins have less fat tissue and less muscle mass than singletons beginning at 15 weeks of pregnancy. If results are confirmed by additional research, the findings could provide information to guide physicians in monitoring and managing twin pregnancies.

Researchers analyzed data from previous ultrasound studies of fetal development in the uterus.  Included in the analysis were 3D ultrasound scans of 2,604 singleton pregnancies and 315 twins. All twin pairs had individual placentas. Twin pairs who shared a placenta were not included in the analysis.r

Beginning at 15 weeks, thigh volumes were significantly smaller for twins than singletons. Twins had smaller fat and lean thigh volumes than singletons. They also had a lower thigh fat to lean ratio than singletons, having proportionately 2.7 to 4.2% less fat from 15 to 37 weeks. Previous studies of twin growth in the womb involved 2D ultrasound scans and had documented decreased twin growth relative to singletons only in the early 3rd trimester (28 to 40 weeks).

Scientists do not think the twins early small size resulted from increased competition for nutrients as their placentas should have been developed enough to supply needed resources until the third trimester. Rather, they hypothesize that twins' small size early in pregnancy could be an adaptation to accommodate the need for increased resources of two fetuses later in pregnancy.

The study was conducted by Jessica Gleason, Ph.D. and Katherine Grantz, M.D., of NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and their colleagues. It appears in JAMA Pediatrics.

More than 7 million American adolescent girls ages 13 to 17 live in states with abortion bans, restrictive gestational limits or parental involvement requirements, according to Rutgers Health researchers.

Their study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, is the first to examine in detail the experiences of adolescent girls after states enacted restrictions on abortion access following the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization Supreme Court decision.

As a result of Dobbs, two-thirds of girls ages 13 to 17 now live in states that ban or severely restrict their abortion access. Minors are often targeted by restrictive policies and less able to use routes to abortion care common for adults – traveling to another state or using telehealth – leaving them disproportionately impacted. Without access to abortion, these girls have lost the ability to control their lives and their futures."

Laura Lindberg, professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health and author of the study

As of December, 12 states have banned abortion entirely and 10 states have restrictive gestational limits. As of Sept. 1, 2023, parental involvement in a minor's decision to have an abortion is required in the 10 states with restrictive gestational limits and 14 of 29 states (as well as Washington, D.C.) without bans or without restrictive gestational limits. New Jersey is a protective state for minors and does not require parental involvement.

The researchers relied on population estimates from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, numbers that reflected the U.S. 2020 Census. They found that 66% (7,080,485 of 10,666,913) of adolescent girls live in states with an abortion ban, restrictive gestational limits (six to 22 weeks), parental involvement requirements or a combination of the three.

In addition, the researchers found that 42% of adolescent girls live in the 24 states where abortion isn't banned but that require parental consent or notification. Lindberg said, "twenty-four states protect abortion access for adults but don't afford the same rights to minors forcing them by law to involve a parent, adding an unnecessary and harmful barrier to care."

The Chinese Medical Association has released new guidelines for diagnosing and treating Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children. Addressing challenges like variable symptoms and rising antibiotic resistance (81% for macrolides in China), experts recommend PCR testing for accurate diagnosis, macrolides for mild cases, and tetracyclines for severe infections in older children. Corticosteroids are also advised for severe cases, and judicious antibiotic use is stressed to combat resistance and improve treatment outcomes.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is a bacterial pathogen that causes pneumonia in school-aged children and adolescents. It spreads through respiratory droplets, leading to prolonged cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. While most cases resolve without complications, some become severe and require advanced medical care. Due to variations in disease presentation and rising antibiotic resistance, standardized diagnostic and treatment approaches are essential.

To address these challenges, the Chinese Medical Association has released new guidelines in Pediatric Investigation, led by Professor Baoping Xu, from the Department of Respiratory at Beijing Children's Hospital, on 11 March 2025. These guidelines provide clear recommendations on diagnosis, treatment, and managing complications, ensuring healthcare professionals have access to standardized, evidence-based strategies. Given the overlap of clinical symptoms with other respiratory infections, the guidelines emphasize a multi-faceted diagnostic approach that integrates clinical observations, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

"Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial in preventing unnecessary antibiotic use and ensuring appropriate treatment," said Prof. Xu. "By combining Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, antibody detection, and imaging, we can improve diagnostic precision and reduce misdiagnosis."

PCR, particularly fluorescence quantitative PCR targeting MP-DNA, is highlighted as the gold standard for confirming MPP due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Antibody tests like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination may help identify infections but have limitations, including false positives or negatives depending on infection timing and immune responses. Chest imaging, primarily X-rays, assesses lung involvement and distinguishes MPP from other pneumonias. In severe cases, computed tomography (CT) scans may provide additional insights into lung inflammation and complications.

Treatment strategies depend on infection severity. For mild MPP, macrolide antibiotics like azithromycin remain the first-line therapy due to their effectiveness against M. pneumoniae. However, increasing macrolide resistance, particularly in China, necessitates alternative antibiotics for severe or refractory cases.

For children aged 8 and older, tetracyclines such as minocycline or doxycycline are preferred due to their effectiveness against resistant strains. However, these are generally avoided in younger children due to potential effects on developing teeth. In such cases, macrolides are still used despite resistance concerns. Quinolones, including levofloxacin, are an alternative but require careful monitoring due to potential adverse effects, particularly in younger patients. Physicians must weigh risks against benefits and obtain informed consent before prescribing quinolones.

Severe MPP often involves significant lung inflammation, requiring additional treatments. Corticosteroids, particularly methylprednisolone, are recommended to reduce inflammation and improve respiratory function. However, they should always be used alongside antibiotics, as they do not directly target the infection. The routine use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not supported due to insufficient evidence of its effectiveness for MPP.

Refractory MPP, which does not respond to initial antibiotics, is managed similarly to severe MPP, with alternative antibiotics and corticosteroids when necessary. The guidelines acknowledge the lack of consensus on the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy, highlighting the need for further clinical research.

Beyond medications, the guidelines address managing complications in severe cases. Some children with MPP develop increased D-dimer levels, indicating a higher risk of blood clot formation. To mitigate this, low molecular weight heparin is recommended. In cases of mucus accumulation causing airway blockage, bronchoscopic lavage therapy may be necessary. This procedure, which removes mucus and debris from the airway, is most effective when performed 7 to 14 days after symptom onset, though its use should be based on individual patient needs.

"Antibiotic overuse and misuse are driving resistance, making infections harder to treat. These guidelines emphasize responsible antibiotic use—choosing the right drug, dose, and duration for each case," emphasizes Prof. Xu.

The authors acknowledge that some recommendations rely on expert opinion due to limited high-quality clinical trials. Additionally, while the guidelines primarily focus on diagnosis and treatment, they provide limited information on complications and long-term effects of MPP. Future updates will incorporate new research findings to address these gaps, ensuring healthcare professionals have the most up-to-date strategies for diagnosing and treating MPP, ultimately improving outcomes for affected children.

Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.

FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.

At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.

Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have "an enormous effect on patient safety" and are "antithetical" to Kennedy's promise to bring "radical transparency" to federal health agencies.

"It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff," Lurie said. "Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that."

HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department's plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.

Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.

"What we need to be doing is the opposite of what's happening now: hiring more staff," she said.

Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.

Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what's available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.

All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.

"I think one thing we've learned is that if there's less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse," Morisy said. "I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety."

Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.

During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS' most recent annual FOIA report.

Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.

Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That's why it's important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.

"We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge," Morisy said. "And I just don't see how these things continue to function."

David Rousseau, the publisher of KFF Health News, serves on the board of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

Most handheld Raman spectrometers are built for quick, on-the-spot material analysis, making them particularly valuable for security applications such as identifying illicit drugs. Beyond that, the BRAVO spectrometer is specifically designed with industrial quality control (QC) in mind, streamlining raw material release processes in a way that saves both time and costs. This is especially critical in the pharmaceutical industry, where 100 % material verification is often required.

The BRAVO often provides analytical results for materials at which competitive devices have their challenge. This comes by significant investments in R&D, leading to exceptional performance across Bruker's entire product range. With the BRAVO, the goal was to deliver benchtop-level performance in a handheld device while addressing a key challenge in Raman spectroscopy—the trade-off between fluorescence suppression and sensitivity based on excitation wavelength. This is where SSETM (Sequentially Shifted Excitation) technology comes in, offering the best of both worlds.

For example, this level of performance is well recognized in the scientific community, with the BRAVO widely used for R&D applications, including the analysis of valuable historic paintings.

With its Class 1 laser certification, the BRAVO eliminates the need for additional laser safety measures such as personal protective equipment, designated safety officers, training programs, or access restrictions. Today, the health and safety of employees are more important than ever, and as well an aspiration in product development is to establish designs that are as safe as possible.

In the pharmaceutical industry, providing robust hardware and reliable services is crucial – but equally important is the software. As digitalization continues to shape pharmaceutical QC, seamless system integration and compliance-driven yet efficient software solutions are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of analytical devices in modern QC environments.

A few years ago, Bruker introduced TOUCH software for its OPUS vibrational spectroscopy suite, designed specifically for routine tasks. The BRAVO follows the same intuitive GUI concept, allowing even inexperienced users to quickly learn and operate the device within minutes.

From a data integrity standpoint, BRAVO features a dedicated validation mode that ensures electronic records remain secure, regardless of user role. Data cannot be deleted or modified without authorization, maintaining compliance with the ALCOA+ principles emphasized by the FDA.

First, the BRAVO features a true high-performance spectrograph, expanding its applications beyond traditional quality control. With OPUS, Bruker offers the industry-leading vibrational spectroscopy software suite, also enabling full remote control of the handheld spectrometer—making it a viable option for R&D tasks that don't require a large benchtop system.

Combined with its onboard software and advanced fluorescence mitigation for challenging materials, BRAVO has matured into a highly specialized solution for the pharmaceutical industry - one that is widely recognized and valued by our global customers.

Compared to other analytical techniques, Raman spectroscopy is still relatively young, particularly in industrial applications, making its market and technological evolution highly dynamic. High Throughput Virtual Slit (HTVS™) technology for process Raman applications significantly enhances sensitivity—by more than an order of magnitude – impressing even experts in the field.

New research led by Western Sydney University finds limited evidence on the association between health literacy and medication adherence among ethnic minority adults living with Type 2 Diabetes.

Published in BMC Public Health, the research team from Western Sydney University and the University of Sydney reviewed seven global studies investigating reduced medication adherence and lower levels of health literacy, however, only one study found a significant association between the two factors and to date none have been based in Australia.

Lead author, PhD Candidate, Jinal Parmar from Western Sydney University's School of Health Sciences said the review has revealed the need for more targeted studies to address disparities in cultural and linguistic considerations of Type 2 Diabetes patients from ethnic minorities in Western Sydney.

“People from ethnic minorities face significant barriers in accessing diabetes care, including facing cultural and language barriers, and low health literacy. There is a need for more targeted strategies to improve access and health outcomes for these communities,” said Jinal.

“Health promotion experts need to co-design resources with ethnic minority groups to address this problem. More studies are needed globally, but especially in the Greater Western Sydney region.”

Senior author, Associate Professor Amit Arora from Western's School of Health Sciences and Translational Health Research Institute said that one of the key recommendations of the review is that health services and policy makers need to consider cultural safety training for healthcare professionals providing care to people with Type 2 Diabetes.

Health professionals should be using techniques such as teach-back and asking patients to repeat information in their own words, visual aids, and using simple language to confirm understanding and address any gaps.”

Amit Arora, Senior author, Associate Professor, Western's School of Health Sciences and Translational Health Research Institute

“By ensuring ethnic minority groups understand their diabetes management instructions, patients are empowered in making informed decisions and remain in control of their treatment.”

Dr Tien-Ming Hng, Endocrinologist at Western Sydney Local Health District and Conjoint Associate Professor at Western Sydney University's School of Medicine emphasized the need for research-driven insights to improve patient outcomes.

Dr Hng works with culturally diverse communities in clinics in Western Sydney and can see the importance of addressing the challenges of medication adherence.

“The rates of Type 2 diabetes in Western Sydney are higher relative to other parts of metropolitan Sydney,” said Associate Professor Hng.

“Multiple medications are sometimes needed to achieve treatment goals, and regular use is key to their success. There are potentially many factors that can influence medication use within specific ethnic groups, and studies that inform us of these challenges will help us treat our patients better.”

 April 07, 2025  

BOSTON — In the staging of liver fibrosis in the post-liver transplant setting, readings from noninvasive tests commonly have major discrepancies when compared with liver biopsy results, particularly in cases of severe steatosis, according to the results of a new study.

Our findings support liver biopsy as “the gold standard for confirmation of allograft fibrosis that is predicted by transient elastography and assessment of its underlying cause,” said first study author Nazire Albayrak, MD, of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.

Liver fibrosis is known to be the main driver of chronic liver disease as well as a key factor influencing post-liver transplant morbidity and mortality.

While a liver biopsy is indeed considered the gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis, such biopsies have important drawbacks, including the involvement of invasive surgery, discomfort, the potential for complications, and the consumption of time.

To help assist in the assessment of fibrosis, noninvasive tests, including serum biomarker indices and hepatic imaging techniques, have gained interest and have been validated in the detection and monitoring of chronic liver disease.

Although these tests have been adopted for clinical use post-liver transplant, research is lacking on their reliability in this setting, the study authors noted here at the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology 2025 Annual Meeting. 

To compare the results of such tests with confirmed assessments on liver biopsy, Albayrak and colleagues evaluated results on the two most widely used noninvasive tests: FibroScan, which uses ultrasound to assess liver stiffness, and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), an index that calculates liver fibrosis with a score based on age, platelet count, and levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.

They identified 108 liver transplant recipients who had received a liver biopsy between 2015 and 2024 and who had testing with FibroScan within 6 months of transplant and lab values within 1 month.

Liver biopsies with < 7 portal tracts and/or < 1 cm in total core length were excluded.

The median age of the study participants was 63 years, 54% were male, and the median graft age was 5.4 years. More than half had type 2 diabetes (60.1%) and/or obesity (58%).

The most common post-transplant major liver biopsy diagnoses included recurrent and new steatotic liver disease (45.4% and 26.8%, respectively), recurrent hepatitis C (8.3%), and organ rejection (7.4%).

All of the patients with recurrent steatotic liver disease had diabetes, while 82.7% of patients with new steatotic liver disease had diabetes and/or obesity.

The patients had a median fibrosis stage of 1, as determined by trichrome stain. A median stiffness of 8.2 kPa and a FIB-4 of 2.032 were both predictors of stage 2 fibrosis.

Importantly, for patients with no fibrosis, FibroScan and FIB-4 each overestimated the degree of fibrosis (P < .0001); FIB-4 also predicted more fibrosis than liver biopsy in stage 1 of disease (P < .0001).

Overall, major discrepancies occurred in 25% of cases, and most were associated with severe stenosis, observed on 62.5% of biopsies and imaging.

Specific over-assessments included 24% (21/88) of stage F0-2 cases that were wrongfully described as stage F3-4 on FibroScan.

Conversely, 30% (6/20) of stage F3-4 cases on liver biopsy were undercalled as stage F0-2 on FibroScan.

On FIB-4 scoring, 29.6% (26/88) that were stage F0-2 were called stage F3-4, while 45% (9/20) of patients that were stage F3-4 were undercalled as stage F0-2.

Specific examples of cases involving discrepancies included:

The high rate of discrepancies observed in the study could have been related to the fact that a higher proportion of patients had obesity, and as many as 40% had moderate to severe steatosis, Albayrak cautioned.

“Also, one of the overcalls was due to amyloid infiltration,” she said.

The bottom-line result remains, however, that “major discrepancies in fibrosis assessment occurred in more than 50% of cases,” in the study, she concluded.

Further commenting on the issue, Nigar Anjuman Khurram, MD, of the UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, added that various other factors are known to elevate estimations of fibrosis potentially falsely on FibroScan.

“Physiological factors such as hepatic inflammation, cholestasis, and vascular congestion may [also] alter liver stiffness readings, compromising accuracy,” she told Medscape Medical News.

“Additionally, technical considerations, including probe positioning, patient cooperation, and operator proficiency, can introduce measurement variability,” she said.

Khurram presented separate research at the meeting showing that yet another factor — ferritin — may also not be as reliably predictive of liver fibrosis as expected.

“Ferritin estimation alone, in the absence of liver biopsy, remains a key parameter in guiding hemochromatosis management,” she said. However, “in our study, we observed that despite normal serum ferritin levels, some patients exhibited fibrosis progression to advanced stages, as confirmed by histological examination.”

These findings indicate that ferritin levels, “while useful clinically to guide therapy, cannot be used to replace liver biopsy as a gold standard,” said Khurram.

Albayrak and Khurram had no disclosures to report.

Underscoring the massive scale of America's medical debt problem, a New York-based nonprofit has struck a deal to pay off old medical bills for an estimated 20 million people.

Undue Medical Debt, which buys patient debt, is retiring $30 billion worth of unpaid bills in a single transaction with Pendrick Capital Partners, a Virginia-based debt trading company. The average patient debt being retired is $1,100, according to the nonprofit, with some reaching the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The deal will prevent the debt being sold and protect millions of people from being targeted by collectors. But even proponents of retiring patient debt acknowledge that these deals cannot solve a crisis that now touches around 100 million people in the U.S.

"We don't think that the way we finance health care is sustainable," Undue Medical Debt chief executive Allison Sesso said in an interview with KFF Health News. "Medical debt has unreasonable expectations," she said. "The people who owe the debts can't pay."

In the past year alone, Americans borrowed an estimated $74 billion to pay for health care, a nationwide West Health-Gallup survey found. And even those who benefit from Undue's debt relief may have other medical debt that won't be relieved.

This large purchase also highlights the challenges that debt collectors, hospitals, and other health care providers face as patients rack up big bills that aren't covered by their health insurance.

Pendrick's chief executive, Chris Eastman, declined several requests to be interviewed about the debt sale, which has not been previously reported. But Eastman acknowledged in a 2024 podcast episode that collecting medical debts has grown more challenging as regulators have restricted how collectors can pursue patients.

Pendrick has now shuttered, which Sesso said provided strong motivation for this deal. "This was a really great opportunity to get a debt buyer out of the market," she said.

Undue Medical Debt pioneered its debt relief strategy a decade ago, leveraging charitable donations to buy medical debt from debt trading companies at steeply discounted prices and then freeing patients from the obligation to pay.

The nonprofit now buys debts directly from hospitals, as well. And it is working with about two dozen state and local governments to leverage public money to relieve medical debt in communities from Los Angeles County to Cleveland to the state of Connecticut.

The approach has been controversial. And Undue Medical Debt's record-setting purchase — financed by a mix of philanthropy and taxpayer dollars — is likely to stoke more debate over the value of paying collectors for medical debts.

"The approach is just treating the symptoms and not the disease," said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president at the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that has led efforts to restrict aggressive hospital collections. Benjamin and other advocates say systemic changes such as ensuring hospitals offer sufficient financial aid to patients and reining in high medical prices would be more valuable in preventing people from sinking into debt.

But many government officials see retiring people's unpaid medical bills as part of a larger strategy to make it easier for patients to avoid debt in the first place.

"Turning off the tap is what's really important in the long run," said Naman Shah, a physician who directs medical affairs at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The county is working to improve local hospital financial aid programs for patients. But Shah said debt relief is key, as well.

"It's easy to criticize band-aids when you're not the one who's cut," he said. "As a physician, I take care of people who have cuts, and I know the importance of stitching them back up."

Undue Medical Debt's latest deal, which it is spending $36 million to close, will help patients nationwide, according to the nonprofit. But about half the estimated 20 million people whose debts Pendrick owned live in just two states: Texas or Florida.

Neither has expanded Medicaid coverage through the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a key tool that researchers have found bolsters patients' financial security by protecting them from big medical bills and debt.

The patients eligible for debt relief have incomes at or below four times the federal poverty level, about $63,000 for a single person, or debts that exceed 5% of their incomes.

About half the debts are also more than seven years old. These have been donated to Undue Medical Debt by Pendrick, the group reported.

The nonprofit plans to pay for the rest of the debts over the next year and a half, though all collections have stopped against patients. It also plans to spend an additional $40 million — or $2 a person — to process the debts, find patients, and inform them that their debts have been relieved.

Sesso, Undue's chief executive, said she hopes the debt purchase will keep policymakers focused on enacting longer-term solutions to the nation's medical debt crisis.

She applauded state leaders for taking steps to bar medical debts from their residents' credit scores. But she said action is also needed in Washington, D.C. However, the Trump administration has suspended regulations enacted under former President Joe Biden that would have barred credit reporting of medical debt nationally, and congressional Republicans are now moving to revoke the new rules.

"There is a limit to what state and local governments can do to solve this problem," Sesso said. "It's really a national problem that has to be solved at the national level."

A new genetic study reveals that some gut bacteria and blood chemicals aren't just linked to short stature—they may be causing it, opening doors to microbiota-based interventions for childhood growth issues.

Study: Causal relationship between gut microbiota, metabolites, and short stature: a Mendelian randomization study. Image Credit: Tomsickova Tatyana / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Pediatric Research, researchers investigated the causal relationship between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and the risk of short stature (SS).

SS is a common endocrine and metabolic disease in children, defined as a height below the third percentile or two standard deviations below the mean height of children of the same age, sex, and race under comparable growth conditions. In 2019, there were around 144 million children with stunted height globally. Various epigenetic, environmental, and genetic factors regulate SS. Around 60% of children with SS have unknown pathogenesis and unidentifiable etiology, viz., idiopathic SS (ISS).

One study suggested that the gut microbiota and metabolites contribute to human bone health. Further, another study reported shorter femur lengths in germ-free mice, and colonization by normal gut flora increased bone formation rate and femur length. This suggests that gut microbiota play a vital role in longitudinal bone growth. While studies have assessed associations between SS and gut microbiota, they are observational; thus, causal relationships cannot be inferred.

This is the first study to use Mendelian randomization to investigate causality between gut microbiota, blood metabolites, and SS.

Children with higher Prevotella9 levels showed reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) activity, a key hormone for bone development, suggesting a direct microbiome-growth axis.

In the present study, researchers investigated the causal relationship between SS, blood metabolites, and gut microbiota, as well as how blood metabolites influence this relationship. They performed a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data. GWAS summary data on SS, gut microbiota, and metabolomics were acquired from separate studies.

The GWAS data for short stature were obtained from the FinnGen R9 dataset, comprising 611 cases and 361,988 controls, with a mean age of approximately 8 years. Notably, the GWAS data were derived primarily from European populations, which may limit generalizability to other ethnic groups.

Instrumental variables were selected if the single-nucleotide polymorphism loci showed significant associations with the exposure. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was the primary MR method, while simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median, and MR Egger regression were complementary methods. MR-Egger intercept was used to assess horizontal pleiotropy. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic. The causal relationship was deemed stable if the effect directions of the complementary methods were consistent with the findings of the IVW analysis.

Additionally, a two-step mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the mediation of blood metabolites in the association between SS and the gut microbiota.

The gut genus Roseburia produces butyrate, a fatty acid previously linked to bone density in mice, but its role in human height remained unexplored until this study.

The IVW analysis suggested seven causal relationships between gut microbiota and SS. After validation with complementary methods, six effect directions were in line with IVW results. Three genera (Alloprevotella, Prevotella9, and FamilyXIIIAD3011) were positively associated with the risk of SS, and three others (Parasutterella, Roseburia, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1) were negatively associated. The protective role of Parasutterella may relate to its involvement in testosterone and bile acid metabolism, as suggested in prior research.

In addition, the team performed a reverse MR analysis to examine whether SS has a causal effect on identified genera. This revealed no reverse causality between SS and these gut microbes. Furthermore, IVW results revealed six causal relationships between blood metabolites and SS, and after validation with complementary methods, five of the effect directions were concordant with the IVW results.

Three metabolites (caffeine, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and laurate) were negatively associated with SS risk, and two (cyclo (leu-pro) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate) were positively associated. The odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.08 to 16.12, demonstrating substantial variation in effect size.

While caffeine showed a protective effect here, the authors caution that animal studies have reported caffeine may inhibit bone growth, suggesting this finding warrants further investigation. There was no heterogeneity or pleiotropy. Furthermore, the mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 on SS through 4-hydroxyhippurate, with a mediation effect proportion of 43.03%. This metabolite is linked to flavonoid metabolism, which depends on gut microbiota for processing.

The five metabolites identified span four major metabolic pathways: lipid, amino acid, peptide, and xenobiotic (compounds not naturally produced by the body, such as dietary or environmental chemicals).

No association was found between vitamin D metabolites and short stature, contradicting hypotheses that micronutrient deficiencies dominate growth disorder risks.

The study examined causal relationships between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and SS risk. The team identified Alloprevotella, FamilyXIIIAD3011, and Prevotella9 as risk factors for SS. Indeed, a previous study reported a higher abundance of Prevotella in children with ISS compared to healthy children, and this level returned to normal upon treatment with recombinant human growth hormone.

In contrast, Roseburia, Parasutterella, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 were protective factors for SS. Five blood metabolites were causally related to SS. Specifically, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate and cyclo(Leu-Pro) were associated with a higher risk of SS. In contrast, caffeine, laurate, and 4-hydroxyhippurate were associated with a lower SS risk. The mediation analysis revealed a novel mediating role of 4-hydroxyhippurate in the relationship between SS and Clostridium sensu stricto 1.

Taken together, the findings illustrate causal relationships between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and SS and that 4-hydroxyhippurate mediates the effect of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 on SS. The effect directions of different methods were consistent, and there was no heterogeneity or reverse causality. However, the study's reliance on genus-level microbiota data limits resolution, and species- or strain-specific effects remain unexplored. The lack of demographic subgroup analysis also limits insight into how these associations may differ across age, sex, or ancestry groups. Overall, future clinical diagnosis and treatment of SS should consider the regulation of gut microbiota.

New evidence reveals that treating SIBO with antibiotics, diet, and supplements dramatically boosts quality of life—even when test results don't show full recovery.

Study: Should We Treat SIBO Patients? Impact on Quality of Life and Response to Comprehensive Treatment: A Real-World Clinical Practice Study. Image Credit: Pepermpron / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Spain assessed the effectiveness of an integrated treatment approach in enhancing the quality of life for patients with Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO).

Did you know that over half of the people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) might actually have SIBO? SIBO occurs when bacteria excessively grow in the small intestine, causing bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Despite affecting millions globally, healthcare providers frequently underestimate or misdiagnose this condition, limiting proper treatment. Patients experience reduced productivity, compromised mental health, and disrupted social lives, significantly impacting their quality of life. In addition to this underrecognition, diagnostic methods such as breath testing have come under scrutiny, with recent clinical guidelines suggesting that their reliability may be limited. Given the lack of clarity on the most effective management strategies and limited data on long-term outcomes, more targeted research is essential to optimize treatments and improve patient well-being.

Blood tests revealed reduced inflammation markers (C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin) in 68% of participants, linking symptom improvement to measurable biological changes.

The present study involved 179 adult patients diagnosed with either hydrogen-predominant (H2-SIBO) or methane-predominant (CH4-SIBO) small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients were recruited between November 2021 and March 2023 from Sagunto Hospital and Casa de Salud Hospital in Valencia, Spain. Diagnosis relied on breath tests measuring hydrogen and methane gas after ingestion of lactulose or lactitol, where gas increases above certain thresholds indicated SIBO.

Participants underwent comprehensive treatment, guided by gastroenterologists and nutritionists, tailored according to gas phenotype (H₂ or CH₄) as per real-world clinical protocols. All patients initially received antibiotic therapy: rifaximin alone for H2-SIBO and a combination of rifaximin and neomycin for CH4-SIBO, supplemented with herbal treatments included in the Valencian Digestive Institute (IVADI) protocol, such as oregano oil, peppermint, and berberine. This pharmacological approach was supported by dietary intervention using the low-Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAP) diet, carefully personalized by dietitians to maximize adherence.

Additionally, gut health supplements, including probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum) and L-glutamine, were administered. The quality of life improvements were evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, one month, and three months post-baseline. These questionnaires assessed overall health (EuroQOL-5D), IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL), gastrointestinal symptom severity (GSRS), and stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale). Follow-ups included repeated breath tests and blood and stool analyses to monitor treatment response and health status.

Herbal antimicrobials (oregano oil, berberine) were standardized as part of the Valencian Digestive Institute's clinical protocol, reflecting regional trends in integrating phytotherapy with conventional medicine.

After the 90-day comprehensive treatment regimen, substantial improvements were observed across various health indicators. Although breath test normalization (gas excretion returning to healthy levels) occurred in only 41.3% of participants, a significant majority (72.6%) reported meaningful clinical improvement, demonstrating a discrepancy between objective test results and subjective symptom relief.

The quality of life, as assessed by the EuroQOL-5D, showed substantial improvements for all patients, indicating an enhanced overall health perception. All participants reported improved self-perceived health status, even those who did not achieve gas normalization, further underscoring the subjective benefit of treatment. Patients who experienced symptom improvement reported notably higher scores, highlighting the importance of subjective health perception in managing SIBO. Specifically, those who achieved clinical relief had significantly better scores across the categories of mental health, emotional well-being, physical energy, and social interaction.

Using the GSRS, patients exhibited a significant reduction in symptom severity, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation, with scores decreasing substantially from baseline to the end of the study period. However, there were no statistically significant differences in GSRS score improvements between patients who normalized gas levels and those who did not. Interestingly, symptom improvement occurred independently of gas normalization, suggesting that treatment effectiveness in symptom relief might depend more on overall microbiome health and dietary factors than solely bacterial reduction.

Stool consistency, assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale, demonstrated marked normalization. Initially, most patients experienced abnormal stool types associated with either constipation or diarrhea. Post-treatment, a significant shift towards normal stool consistency was observed, directly correlating with better patient comfort and daily function.

Anxiety/depression scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) dropped by 40% in patients achieving stool consistency normalization, tying physical symptom relief directly to mental health gains.

The IBS Quality of Life questionnaire revealed substantial improvements across all sub-domains, including emotional and psychological health, physical activity, dietary adaptations, and social engagement. Although direct psychological outcomes such as anxiety or depression were not measured in the study, improvements in these domains are consistent with findings from related literature. These psychological benefits are likely due to the reduction of physical symptoms and improved dietary habits, which in turn lead to greater confidence in social settings and daily activities.

Regression analysis underscored the importance of initial self-perceived well-being in predicting successful symptom resolution. Patients who began the treatment with a higher subjective perception of health exhibited a greater likelihood of clinical improvement, highlighting the psychological component as an integral part of treatment outcomes.

To summarize, this study demonstrates that a holistic therapeutic approach significantly improves the quality of life and clinical outcomes for SIBO patients, emphasizing the necessity for individualized treatments that address diet, microbiota balance, and symptom relief. Despite moderate normalization of diagnostic test results, substantial clinical improvement highlights the importance of patient-reported outcomes. This is one of the first large-scale studies to specifically evaluate quality-of-life outcomes in SIBO patients using validated tools, making it a unique contribution to the field. These findings underscore the critical need for increased awareness and acceptance among healthcare providers of comprehensive SIBO management strategies. However, the authors also acknowledge key limitations, including the lack of a placebo or control group and the difficulty in isolating the effects of individual treatment components.

Future research should investigate psychological interventions, long-term sustainability, and personalized diets to better address the profound impact of SIBO on patients' daily lives, ultimately improving care standards and patient well-being globally.

New study reveals how dairy products like non-fermented milk and cheese may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, while fermented options provide a surprising protective effect. Find out which dairy could be a game-changer for your health!

A new study involving Swedish adults finds that high intake of non-fermented milk and cheese can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. The study findings are published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels, is becoming a major public health concern worldwide, with a projected increase in its prevalence from 537 million in 2021 to 783 million by 2045. Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of all diabetic cases.

Diet is one of the major modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Dairy products are vital components of any diet, and the dietary components present in these products are considered essential for growth and immune function.

A dairy-linked xenobiotic—likely from pesticides or veterinary drugs in cattle feed—was strongly tied to non-fermented milk intake. Its role in human metabolism remains unknown, but it could signal industrial farming's indirect health impacts.

Regarding the associations between dairy product intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes, studies have produced mixed results, with some reporting inverse associations and others suggesting neutral associations.

Existing evidence also suggests a link between higher intake of dairy products and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, studies investigating diabetes risk with very high intakes are lacking due to a lack of data among populations with high dairy consumption.

Sweden is among the countries with the highest intake of dairy products worldwide. Various dairy products are consumed in regular diets in this country. These factors present a suitable opportunity for researchers to investigate the association between various types of dairy products and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a particular focus on the level of consumption.

In this study, researchers utilized high-quality dietary data from a group of Swedish adults to investigate the impact of high intakes of different dairy products on the risk of type 2 diabetes. They also explored plasma metabolites associated with dairy intake.

The study analyzed dairy intake data from 26,461 Swedish individuals who participated in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) between 1991 and 1996 and were followed up until December 31, 2020.

Dairy products analyzed in the study included non-fermented milk, fermented milk (yogurt and sour milk), cheese, cream, and butter.

To identify plasma metabolites associated with dairy intake, a subgroup of 893 participants with data on metabolomics and dairy intake was analyzed separately in this study. Metabolites are end products of metabolic reactions that serve as crucial biomarkers of dietary intake. Assessment of plasma metabolite levels can provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between dairy products and type 2 diabetes.

Fermented milk's arabonate/xylonate isn't just a biomarker: It may reflect gut microbes breaking down plant fibers more efficiently, linking yogurt consumption to improved glucose processing.

About 17% of study participants (4,552 out of 26,461 participants) developed type 2 diabetes during the average follow-up period of 24 years.

The analysis, adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, dietary intake, and body mass index (BMI), revealed that high consumption of non-fermented milk and cheese can significantly increase the risk of developing diabetes; however, these associations were attenuated after accounting for BMI (e.g., non-fermented milk hazard ratio [HR] dropped from 1.40 to 1.15), suggesting body weight may partially mediate the observed effects. In contrast, high consumption of fermented milk, cream, and butter was associated with significantly reduced risk of diabetes.

Specifically, the study found that a 100-gram increase in daily intake of non-fermented milk and fermented milk is associated with a 4% increased risk and a 3% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, respectively.

Notably, the study found that the association between dairy product intake and diabetes risk is independent of participants' socioeconomic status. Similarly, no significant impact of participants' gender was observed on the association between intakes of non-fermented milk, fermented milk, cream, and butter and the risk of diabetes. However, the negative impact of cheese intake on diabetes risk was observed more strongly in male participants, a notable sex-specific finding, but not in female participants.

By analyzing metabolomic data, the study identified 45, 48, 12, 27, and 46 metabolites that were distinctly associated with the intakes of non-fermented milk, fermented milk, cheese, cream, and butter, respectively.

Plasma metabolite profiles of fermented milk exhibited positive associations with intakes of vegetables, fruits, and dietary fibers, and inverse associations with meat intake. In contrast, the metabolite profile of butter exhibited inverse associations with dietary fiber intake.

Butter's unexpected benefit (lower diabetes risk) correlated with metabolites also found in nuts and seeds, hinting that butter might share bioactive compounds with plant fats when consumed minimally.

The study reveals that high intake of non-fermented milk can significantly increase type 2 diabetes risk among Swedish men and women. A similar positive association between very high cheese intake and diabetes risk has also been observed in the study. However, this association is restricted only to male participants.

In contrast to the modest health impact of these dairy products, the study finds that higher intakes of fermented milk, cream, and butter have modest protective effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes among both Swedish men and women. These protective associations were weaker after adjusting for BMI (e.g., butter HR increased from 0.82 to 0.86), implying that body weight may play a mediating role.

Notably, the study identifies sphingomyelins as robust plasma biomarkers of dairy intake. Furthermore, a strong association was observed between a xenobiotic metabolite and non-fermented milk intake in the study. This metabolite, which belongs to the class of organic compounds known as salicylic acids, can serve as a novel biomarker for dairy intake.

For fermented milk, the strongest association has been observed with arabonate/xylonate, a metabolite associated with pentose metabolism. Probiotics in fermented milk may be involved in this process. For cheese, the study identifies three novel plasma biomarkers that need further investigation for a more conclusive interpretation.

The study measured dairy intake only at baseline. This could be a potential limitation, as any changes in dairy intake during the 24-year follow-up period may influence the observed associations with diabetes risk.

Moreover, the study was conducted with Swedish middle-aged participants, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to populations of different ethnicities and age groups.

Fifa is so concerned about sluggish ticket sales for this summer's Club World Cup that it is offering fans the incentive of a guaranteed opportunity to buy a ticket for next year's World Cup finals.

Supporters are being offered the perk in a bid to drive interest in an expanded 32-team Club World Cup (CWC), which takes place from June 14 to July 13 in the United States. The 2026 World Cup is also being held in the US, who are co-hosting with Canada and Mexico.

The incentive has been launched at a time when tickets for some CWC matches are now being sold on secondary sites for less than the initial asking price.

For example, for the round-of-16 match in Miami on June 29, seats on Ticketmaster, Fifa's official partner, are being advertised at $105.95 for section 328, row 17, but $88.63 (£69) for the same row on the secondary ticket site Viagogo.

Fifa did not respond when asked to provide figures on ticket sales or secondary sites selling cut-price tickets. But Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, has been doing his bit to try to boost sales. He posted an Instagram video on Monday from the Saudi-owned LIV Golf Miami tournament at the Trump National Doral course — owned by the US president Donald Trump — imploring fans not to “miss the opportunity” to buy CWC tickets.

The World Cup ticket offer is aimed at boosting sales for the club tournament — Chelsea and Manchester City are the two English teams involved — but the small print makes the offer considerably more complicated.

A standard ticket pack for the CWC has tickets to two or three matches and buyers “will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a Fifa World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final)”.

But the terms and conditions state that Fifa will decide which World Cup match that will be, with a clause saying: “Fifa ticketing is entitled to determine, in its sole discretion . . . the match or matches that may be available to you in connection with the FWC26 Ticket Option redemption”.

To have an option of buying a ticket for the World Cup final, a “Super Ticket Pack” must be purchased, which includes one ticket to attend 20 different CWC matches. The games are on different days and there are only 22 separate CWC matchdays. Even though buyers can pass their tickets on to family members or friends, attending the 20 matches would be a huge logistical operation.

Infantino, who has established close links with Trump, claims in his video that, “We are [here] in the best golf tournament” — a somewhat controversial boast in the week of the Masters at Augusta — “and in Fifa events we bring the best here”.

He added: “Fans should have to go to the games in the stadiums, opening here in Miami on June 14 and the final in New York on July 13. Don't miss the opportunity, so go to fifa.com/tickets — get your ticket for the first ever Fifa Club World Cup to see the best players in the world and the best clubs in the world; it will be unique.”

Expectations are low for New Zealand team, but there could be some surprises from the Northern League side

Let's get one thing out of the way: Auckland City FC aren't going to the Club World Cup's knockout stages. In a stacked Group C, which features heavyweights Bayern Munich, Boca Juniors and Benfica, the team will be lucky to get a draw, let alone a win against teams with higher pedigree, payrolls and tradition.

Yet, the 10-time Dettol Northern League winners have plenty to play for and it could be a catalyst for an unlikely result or two. This is the top team from the Oceania region, with seven straight OFC Champions League titles in their trophy cabinet.

Including previous Club World Cup appearances, this is the biggest tournament the New Zealanders have participated in. The Navy Blues play in a 2,500-capacity stadium. They'll be playing one of the tournament favorites in Bayern at the 26,000 seater TQL stadium, by comparison, for their opener.

That's not to mention the potential chance to showcase a relatively unknown team to dozens of international scouts at the tournament. Former New Zealand defender Winston Reid parlayed a strong showing in the 2010 World Cup into big money move to West Ham following the tournament. That should also serve as motivation.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

Next up is Auckland City FC, with a look at key players to watch, and expectations for the pride of Oceania ahead of this summer's tournament.

NWSL

This is Alyssa Thompson's moment.

That much was palpable when she received the ball left of the center circle from defender Crystal Dunn during the U.S. women's national team's 2-0 win over Brazil on Saturday in front of 32,303 people in her home city of Los Angeles.

For anyone who has watched the 20-year-old attacking player during her three seasons across town with Angel City FC in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), her path might as well have been cut into the field at SoFi Stadium with a lawn mower: straight to goal.

One feint sent a Brazilian defender sliding out of the play and Thompson exploited the space left behind. By the time she reached the top of the 18-yard box, the moment had begun to feel like what could one day be considered vintage Thompson, much like the goal she scored for Angel City before the international break. But rather than aim for the goal, Thompson delivered an assist that split two more defenders to reach an oncoming Trinity Rodman, who knocked the ball past Brazilian and Kansas City Current goalkeeper Lorena in the sixth minute.

“That was the perfect ball to a perfect finish. I think we read each other's minds in that moment,” Rodman said after the match.

Her direct attacking style aside, Thompson's short journey from being voted Gatorade Player of the Year at high school level in 2021 to this moment has been anything but linear.

She was the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft and the youngest player on the USWNT's World Cup roster in a matter of months. Her standout rookie season rolled into her first senior call-up, however, and things quickly changed.

Thompson made just two appearances off the bench in the defending champion United States' ill-fated run to the round of 16 at that World Cup, playing just 17 minutes in a tournament that saw very little squad rotation by coach Vlatko Andonovski. The World Cup crash led to Andonovski resigning and the youngest member of the squad getting left out of the roster to regain form, with mixed results, for her club.



After new coach Emma Hayes took the reins midway through 2024, Thompson watched the USWNT's Olympic gold medal run from home. Instead of a summer in France, she worked to hone her skills, and after five goals and two assists in seven NWSL games, Thompson got the call from Hayes in October. And she didn't waste her shot.

The then-19-year-old scored her first senior international goal 39 minutes into a friendly against Iceland in Austin. The joy was apparent on her face as she leaped into the arms of substitute Sophia Wilson on the sideline.

“I feel like last year, and the last couple of years, I put a lot of pressure on myself,” Thompson told reporters last week. “I think just coming in this year, I just wanted to be confident in my abilities and know what I bring as a player, and not compare myself to other people. I think that has helped me a lot, just knowing that if I'm playing like Alyssa Thompson then I'll be able to put a good foot forward for my team.”

Each month since, Thompson has been finding and learning ways to sharpen her craft. And, with the marquee front three of Wilson, Rodman and Mallory Swanson, who headlined that Olympic triumph, down to just Rodman for now, Thompson found another moment to make her case on Saturday.

Hayes acknowledged Thompson's journey ahead of the match as a cautionary tale of how a mistimed moment can obscure a player's potential, especially from an outsider's perspective.

“I hope that we can look at someone like Alyssa Thompson's situation, i.e. a 17-year-old coming into the program probably underprepared for that because the level is so much higher, to then have a journey which is pretty normal for a young player. But I think she's in the best place she has been in terms of her start to the season,” Hayes said.

But the former Chelsea manager also expressed her intention to continue elevating the characteristics that make Thompson an attacking threat as she progresses through national team camps and racks up minutes on the field.

“Since October we've been working so hard positionally with her to get her to have a better understanding of what to do and when, and saying, ‘Listen, at the top level, you're a great one-v-one specialist, but when you're playing the top players in the world, they know how to drop off of you in a certain way where they don't give you a one-v-one opportunity, so how do you link with others?',” Hayes said.

There were glimpses of those areas of growth in Saturday's match, particularly in some of Thompson's unsuccessful attempts to take on the well-read Brazilian and Olympique Lyonnais central defender Tarciane. Still, she created dangerous scoring opportunities that contributed to the team's 2.72 expected goals (xG) figure.

Hayes has seen the gap close between where Thompson was six months ago and where she is now, and part of that comes through in her instinctive thinking.

“When you play for me, I will overload you to take a player to another level tactically, but that means for a period of time, there's a lot of thinking going on, a lot of processing,” Hayes said. “There's a lot of conscious thinking, whereas I feel like with Alyssa now, she understands that, so she's able to do it more naturally.”

Thompson is still at the beginning of her professional career and it's important to consider: managing internal pressure, brewing confidence and resisting the urge to compare herself to others. These are all tall orders for most teens (and adults) even when they haven't faced the challenges she has. But they, too, have led to the moment Thompson is now enjoying, and she credits her teammates with supporting her through it.

“They believe in me so much and I attribute a lot of my success to them because their help and reassurance has really helped me become the player that I am right now,” Thompson said.

Angel City captain and defender Ali Riley has viewed Thompson's journey from a unique vantage point.

The 37-year-old Los Angeles native attended Harvard-Westlake, the same high school Thompson and her younger sister and Angel City teammate Gisele did, and experienced that same World Cup in 2023, though Riley played for co-host New Zealand (she was born in LA but her father is from New Zealand). Riley was quick to refuse credit for any guidance she's given the elder Thompson and made clear her progress is just as promising as her ceiling — as a player and as a face of the sport.

“Even when we look at how much she's grown, her performances on the field, what's so special about her is that this is the beginning,” Riley told The Athletic. “I think she has the personality and the eloquence to be someone who can speak about being a woman in sport, being a woman of color in sport. She's so good about speaking about her experience growing up, the value of representation.”

Riley, who hasn't played since last season because of nerve damage in her left leg, added that Thompson was voted into the team's leadership group this year.

When Thompson went through a bit of a scoring drought during that 2024 season, Riley said she faced criticism from “keyboard warriors” on social media who picked through her stats and body language with a fine-tooth comb. Now, Riley said, “when she scores, she doesn't seem relieved, she's genuinely happy.”

So far, that happiness has shown up as cheeky TikTok goal celebrations with her sister Gisele and fellow Angel City striker Casey Phair on the sidelines. Other times, it's a full-throated rebel yell.

For Thompson to enjoy another stellar performance in her hometown on Saturday only sweetened the moment — topped off with one of those yells after assisting fellow Southern California native Rodman.

“I love playing in LA,” Thompson said in the mixed zone following the match. “Being here is amazing for the club, and I've never played in LA with the national team, so being able to feel that comfort from my city and my family and friends, I just felt like I could be more like me, and I knew what I could do.”

Hello there! The Champions League returns for some quarterfinal action this week, while the U.S. women's national team wrap up a two-game series against Brazil on Tuesday. I'm Pardeep Cattry with an update ahead of a busy week.

All times U.S./Eastern

The headlining act of this week's Champions League action will be Real Madrid's trip to Arsenal, which comes with fairly big stakes for two teams at very different stages in their season.

For the hosts, the baggage of seasons past defines the importance of this  month's two-legged tie. This was poised to be a season in which Mikel Arteta's Arsenal would act upon the promise they demonstrated in years past and finally win a major title, but the nonexistent Premier League race means they are down to just one potential trophy lift – the Champions League. The Gunners' European campaign has been as straightforward as it gets but a clash against Real Madrid offers their first serious test of the season, and at a crucial juncture of the competition. Arsenal have not booked a spot in the Champions League semifinals in nearly 20 years, so the importance of the quarterfinal tie is not lost upon Arteta, who described these matches as the most significant of his managerial career.

In order to live up to the momentous occasion, though, they will have to get through Real Madrid first. It may not be as daunting a task as it sounds considering how the season has gone for Los Blancos – they registered some notable losses during the league phase, but managed to oust Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the knockouts and are making a case that they are peaking at the right time. Recent results might raise some questions about that claim, though, with a 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad in the Copa del Rey and a 2-1 loss to Valencia in La Liga play showcasing the imbalance that Carlo Ancelotti's side have long had.

The possibility of a trophyless season does not define Real Madrid's Champions League campaign as much as it does Arsenal's at this point, but there's just as much pressure for them to deliver their uncanny ability to cross the finish line even in imperfect circumstances. Real Madrid have been resigned to taking the hard road to repeat as champions and have done well in those circumstances, but will once again have to prove their worth to ensure they have a spot in the semifinals.

The U.S. women's national team kicked off their two-game series against Brazil with a 2-0 win on Saturday that showcased head coach Emma Hayes' mix and match approach as she continues a period of player pool expansion.

Six members of the USWNT's Olympics squad started in the rematch of last summer's gold medal game, most notable among them Trinity Rodman, who scored just eight minutes into her first game since Paris. Rodman's star quality was on full display for her 61 minute shift, but she was not the only attacking talent who made the most of her moment – Alyssa Thompson, who already has two goals in three NWSL games this season, notched the assist to Rodman's goal and enjoyed yet another strong showing in the U.S.' post-Olympics era of experimentation.

Hayes mixed some of the USWNT's mainstays with a batch of less-experienced talent, including goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. She, as well as defender Avery Patterson, earned her first cap on Saturday and made six saves as the battle to succeed Alyssa Naeher continues. Though the head coach admitted there are still areas of improvement, including ball retention and decision-making, but she believes the "less-experienced team are growing up" and pointed towards the attacking effort as an example.

Hayes and company wrap up the two-game swing against Brazil on Tuesday, where a different group of players could receive the opportunity to impress as the USWNT's long road to the 2027 Women's World Cup continues.

🇪🇸 La Liga title race: Both Barcelona and Real Madrid dropped points in La Liga play over the weekend, but the former's four point lead means the title race tilted further in the favor.

💤 Goalless in Manchester: The Manchester derby ended 0-0 on Sunday as the struggles both Manchester City and Manchester United have faced all season long were on full display at Old Trafford.

🔴 Liverpool lose: Liverpool's 3-2 loss to Fulham may not cause many issues in their quest to win the Premier League title, but offers a signal that things may not be so straightforward next season.

🌴 Messi scores again: Lionel Messi scored a crucial – and impressive – equalizer for Inter Miami against Toronto FC on Sunday, but their 1-1 draw means they are winless in two ahead of their Concacaf Champions Cup quarterfinal against LAFC on Wednesday.

This summer, Manchester City and Chelsea will both head to the USA to compete in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

Unlike previous variations of the tournament, the competition has been revamped to include 32 teams from around the world in a format akin to a major international tournament. 

Both Premier League teams will be among the favourites to take home the brand-new trophy, but which English clubs have previously been crowned world champions?

DAZN News runs down the honour list. 

Almost a decade after they turned their back on the FA Cup to compete in the first-ever Club World Cup, Manchester United became the first English winner of the competition by lifting the trophy in Yokohama. 

After earning their spot with 2008's Champions League win over Chelsea, United saw off Gamba Osaka in the semi-final with a comfortable 5-3 win and went on to face Ecuadorian side LDU Quito in the final. 

It was then Wayne Rooney who etched his name into the competition's folklore by netting the only goal of the game to add another trophy to the Sir Alex Ferguson dynasty. 

Cup final winning team: Van der Sar, Rafael (Neville), Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Carrick, Anderson (Fletcher), Ronaldo, Park, Tevez (Evans), Rooney 

Held in the winter and seen as a test event for the upcoming 2022 World Cup, Qatar was the setting for Liverpool's only FIFA World Club Cup win in 2019. 

Their 2019 Champions League win saw them earn their spot in the competition and would defeat Monterrey in the semi-final thanks to a Roberto Firmino winner, which set them up for a final meeting with Flamengo. 

In the showpiece, it was once again Firmino who was the difference, scoring an extra-time winner for Jurgen Klopp's men. 

Cup final winning team: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Djik, Roberton, Keita (Milner), Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain (Lallana), Salah (Shaqiri), Firmino (Origi), Mane

Thomas Tuchel's short reign as Chelsea boss saw two major continental wins - including this FIFA World Club Cup triumph in Abu Dhabi. 

The Blues edged past Saudi champions Al Hial in the semi-final thanks to a Romelu Lukaku goal and it set up a second England vs Brazil finale in three years. 

This time, it was Palmerias, but it was Lukaku again who made his presence known, opening the scoring before Chelsea's Champions League-winning hero Kai Havertz repeated the trick by tucking home a penalty in extra time to seal the victory. 

Cup final winning team: Mendy, Christensen (Ziyech), Silva, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Kovacic (Sarr), Hudson-Odoi (Werner), Mount (Pulisic), Lukaku (Saul), Havertz

Fresh off a season where Manchester City nabbed a historic treble, the silverware continued to reign as they added the FIFA Club World Cup to their list of accolades. 

City made light work of it too, first defeating Urawa Red Diamonds 3-0 in the semi-final before a thumping victory over Brazilian side Fluminense saw them take home the trophy. 

Julian Alvarez scored a brace either side of a Nino own goal and Phil Foden's strike to see Pep Guardiola win the competition for a third time with a third different club. 

Cup final winning team: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Stones (Gvardiol), Ake (Bobb), Lewis (Kovacic), Rodri (Akanji), Silva, Foden (Nunes), Grealish, Alvarez

Home > Headlines > Bounou Confident as Al Hilal Prepare to Face Real Madrid in Club World Cup

Yassine Bounou

Rabat – Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou has said that Al Hilal are ready to take on the world's best teams, including Real Madrid, at the upcoming Club World Cup 2025.

Speaking in an interview with FIFA, Bounou shared his excitement about playing in the tournament and expressed confidence in his team's ability to make a strong impact.

Al Hilal, champions of Asia, will face a tough challenge in Group H, where they are drawn against Real Madrid, FC Salzburg, and CF Pachuca. 

But Bounou, who has faced Real Madrid many times before while playing for Spanish clubs Girona and Sevilla, said his past experience gives him confidence. “I've played against Real a lot; I have many friends in the team, and I've always met their fans on the streets of Spain. I've always had mutual respect for the club and its supporters,” he said.

“I've faced a lot of great teams throughout my career, and I'm privileged that Real Madrid is one of them, and it's a great honour to do it again wearing the Al Hilal shirt,” the player added.

The 2023 African Goalkeeper of the Year added that the Saudi Arabian team is motivated to go far in the competition. “We at Al Hilal are honored to participate in the first edition of the Club World Cup (in its new format). We look forward to delivering a performance worthy of Al Hilal,” he stated.

The upcoming Club World Cup will be the first to feature an expanded format featuring 32 of the world's top clubs. 

Bounou also spoke about the difficulty of the group stage and said he hopes to reach “a level I have never reached before” as a Moroccan player in this global competition.

The player also reflected on his experience at the World Cup 2022 in Qatar, where he helped Morocco reach the semi-finals for the first time in history. “The experience I have gained from it will be an additional factor that the team can capitalise on,” he said.

When asked whether he would like to face one of his old clubs, Wydad or Atlético, in the later rounds, Bounou laughed and said, “Honestly, I'd rather not face them, but I hope they reach the highest levels.”

The 31-year-old never considered herself a guaranteed starter, but she is making the most of every opportunity under Emma Hayes.

On the current United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) roster, only three players have tallied over 100 appearances for their nation.

Emily Sonnett is one of them.

It may have seemed an unlikely achievement for the 31-year-old, who has never considered herself a bona fide starter when it comes to playing for her nation.

“I think one thing I think about for my personal journey [is that] it didn't come quickly,” she told The Guardian.

“I wasn't seeing starts or a lot of game time… I actually never thought I'd reach 100 caps for [because] I've never been a true starter for this team.”

Even with the arrival of a new manager mid-2024, there was a general feeling that her role under Emma Hayes would be a supporting one from the bench.

The reality, however, has been quite the contrary.

In the face of injury woes across central defenders, Hayes has called on the centurion to fill in at the back. Before that, Sonnett had been deployed in midfield when in rotation.

She is quickly but surely becoming a key player in this new U.S. era, with her versatility proving to be a secret and reliable weapon for the current coaching staff.

Emily Sonnett honoured for 100 appearances in a USWNT shirt.

Full-back, defensive midfielder, and now centre-back.

These are all positions occupied by Sonnett for the national team in the space of a year.

Her versatility stems from her drive to represent the U.S. on the biggest stages – instilling the kind of work ethic that pushes her to succeed wherever she is called on.

“I think I'm versatile because every roster I really had to fight to be on, and that sometimes meant moving positions to make it and get to a tournament,” the NJ/NY Gotham star said in an interview with Just Women's Sports.

“This team is so competitive in every position, especially [squads like] the Olympics that [only have] 18 spaces.

“You have to stay coachable, you have to learn… if that's what is going to get me on rosters, then that is what I have to do.”

That kind of approach wasn't born overnight. It has been tireless years of work and going the extra mile.

Determined to become a consistent performer in any of the roles she was required to play, Sonnett went as far as working with an analyst to identify any areas of weakness.

‘It probably took me four years to really get that [consistency across the pitch] down,” she admitted to the Women's Game podcast.

“I worked with an analyst so I [could] understand exactly where I'm falling short and where I'm not, so I can have these consistent years back-to-back.

“I would look into defensive duels, aerial duels, progressive passes, where I'm passing the ball and [assessed] if I was hitting certain numbers compared to some of the best centre-backs in the world.”

Such willingness to improve her game and apply it at each opportunity has made her a go-to option in the face of a minor injury crisis in the backline.

Emily Sonnett helps the USWNT keep a clean sheet against Brazil in April 2025.

At Paris 2024, it became clear that Sonnett – much to her surprise – would be a crucial part of Hayes's plans going forward.

Her experience and expertise across multiple positions made her an invaluable asset in the English coach's first tournament in charge.

More importantly, it outlined what her plans for the player were and that included seeing her as more of a central defender as opposed to a fullback, which had previously been her core role with the national team.

In the six games it took for the U.S. to be crowned Olympic champions, Sonnett featured in each of them.

Subbed on four times and a starter for two, including the 1-0 quarter-final victory over Japan.

Then came the SheBelieves Cup and, without first-choice centre-back Naomi Girma, the Georgia-native stepped in comfortably.

She is once again the go-to replacement at the back for the USWNT's latest friendlies against Brazil, amid more injury woes following Tierna Davidson's withdrawal from camp.

“I'm someone who leads a lot by example and being coachable… [I want to be] a constant reminder for everyone that we have to be working hard, but also applying what we're learning,” she told ESPN.

“What I really appreciate about Emma and her staff is that they're always forward-thinking, always layering in.

“I think the Olympics are the tip of the iceberg for how much they can teach in a short amount of time.”

Benjamin Pavard could play at wingback in tomorrow's Champions League showdown between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. They report that the Frenchman could fill in if Matteo Darmian doesn't see out the ninety minutes.

Inter Milan will be without wingback Denzel Dumfries against Bayern Munich tomorrow.

And that creates quite a headache for Nerazzurri coach Simone Inzaghi.

Matteo Darmian is available. The veteran former Manchester United and Torino has played all of Inter's last three matches.

However, that has naturally taken quite a toll on Darmian.

The wingback role is a physically demanding one. Therefore, it may be difficult for the 35-year-old to see out yet another ninety minutes after going the distance against Parma over the weekend.

And Matteo Darmian is really the only natural right-wingback in the Inter squad besides Dumfries.

Nicola Zalewski has played there a couple times off the bench.

However, Zalewski has not looked comfortable playing on the right flank.

Therefore, Inter coach Simone Inzaghi had even tested Carlos Augusto in the position in training recently.

However, Augusto could have a different task at left-centre-back or left-wingback tomorrow.

That leaves Inzaghi somewhat short of options, if Darmian reaches his limit.

One would be to move Benjamin Pavard into the attacking wingback role on the 3-5-2 shape.

That is not the Frenchman's natural position. He prefers to play in the back three.

However, Pavard could be the most effective option in the position at a certain stage of tomorrow's match.

Phil Foden's form has 'fallen off a cliff' and he needs to be left out of Manchester City's squad for this summer's Club World Cup, Ian Ladyman has told Chris Sutton on the latest 'It's All Kicking Off!' podcast.

Foden, 24, was subbed off before the hour mark during Sunday's turgid Manchester derby which finished goalless.

The winger still made headlines after the match as he was the target of abusive chants about his mother from rival fans.

Looking ahead to this summer's Club World Cup, The Mail's Football Editor Ian Ladyman told co-host Chris Sutton that Foden's 'exhausted' performances show that the player needs a sustained break from the game to recover his form.

'Foden looks ruined, he looks exhausted, he looks like he needs a long rest', Ladyman said.

'I think at times with footballers, you get to a point where you've got to ask yourself: do we need that player for this tournament? What is best for him? Do we have a duty of care towards him?'

'It doesn't happen very often, but I think we're getting to that point with Phil Foden – that guy needs to be left at home in June and July, so he can take a breath and get ready for next season.

'With Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, and De Bruyne, you can put down their form to age, playing at the highest level for a decade. You can't say that with Phil, he's a young player – there's got to be another reason for what we're seeing.

'This isn't a dip – he looks on the floor.'

Last season, Foden recorded 19 goals and eight assists across all competitions: his tally this season stands at seven goals and two assists in 10 fewer matches.

He was named PFA Players' Player of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season but struggled to make an impact for England at the Euros.

Former professional player and pundit Chris Sutton defended Foden, accusing Ladyman of unfairly 'singling him out' from an underperforming City side.

'All players go through this; I went through it. He was the best player in the country last year and he's now having a dip.

'You're singling Foden out because of his age. I don't see age the way you're seeing it. Foden is one of many Manchester City players whose form has fallen off a cliff.

'Pep Guardiola is smart enough to realise if there's an issue beyond football, whether or not he needs a mental break from the game. But I think you can say that about any Manchester City player right now.'

Sutton added however that he believes no Manchester City players should be going to the Club World Cup this summer based on their tired performances this season.

'We know what that tournament's all about: it's about money, it's about finance, it's about greed.

'None of the Manchester City players, based on this season's form, should be going. But they are going to go – I don't see Foden as different from any of them.'

Patrick Agyemang has no problem elaborating on his answers to questions about his rapid rise. He's generous when it comes to sharing detail and perspective. Only one of over a dozen queries warrants a one-word answer of “no” – albeit with a bit of a chuckle to provide plenty of subtext.

The question: Did he hear from U.S. Soccer or sense he was being considered for inclusion prior to Mauricio Pochettino's tenure?

It's defensible to an extent. Striker has quickly become one of the deepest position groups in the USMNT pool, with multiple players scoring regularly in Europe – Josh Sargent and Haji Wright were at it again this past weekend – and a steady stable of dependable forwards playing regularly in MLS. Injuries, however, remain a regular concern.

Folarin Balogun has struggled since joining Monaco in the summer of 2023 and hasn't played since October after suffering a shoulder injury. Ricardo Pepi's season ended in late January after suffering a knee injury. Sargent missed all of November and December with a groin injury, and Wright missed nearly four months with an ankle complaint.

Even so, to those who hadn't been watching Agyemang's 2024 season, the 24-year-old's inclusion on Pochettino's January camp squad may have seemed like little more than a flier on a young player.

“It's so easy to go into these camps and think you're not good enough to be here, or just feel like this isn't your level, it's too high for you or something,” Agyemang told The Athletic. “For me, I go into these camps and I'm just like, ‘I need to do my role. I need to work hard. If I get on the field, I need to show that I belong here and I want to be back, to be in this picture.'”

Agyemang was arguably the standout player of his first USMNT camp, scoring in each of his first two international caps in wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica. The strong impression kept him in frame for the Nations League finals, where he came off the bench in the semifinal vs. Panama and then started the third-place match against Canada. His 35th-minute goal in the latter fixture helped the U.S. pull level before halftime.

While the end result — a fourth-place showing in a four-team bracket — hardly inspired, Agyemang's conversations with Pochettino made him feel as though he had impressed again.

“I've been really trying to make a presence for myself on the field,” Agyemang said. “In the first game against Panama, if I could go back, I would change the decisions that I made in a split moment, because essentially, I could have scored two goals, but the fact I was able to create space for myself in those opportunities, (Pochettino) was happy with it. He's realizing I can come in showing a different profile and spark to the game. As long as I continue doing that, he was happy with it.

“There's things I need to still improve on, but in the overall bulk of it, it was a positive outlook on what I did (from him).”

It was hard to find reasons for optimism surrounding the USMNT after those consecutive defeats.

The two games provided a worrying 180 minutes for Pochettino to assess, with defensive miscues and clumsy attempts at upfield progression leaving time for concerningly few glimpses of promise. After each game, pundits and fans alike grasped for answers as to how the U.S., once lauded for grit and determination, could look so flat.

Throughout the discourse, two players' names emerged as bright spots amid the carnage, the same two who combined for the team's only goal of the window: Diego Luna and Agyemang. While Luna's stock began rising during a breakout 2023, Agyemang's has escalated more rapidly, having only just become Charlotte FC's starting striker in 2024.

He has now been thrust into contention for the 2026 World Cup, and even the loudest detractors of the U.S.'s present form can notice what he brings to the fold.

“Yeah, it has been a lot, just how quickly everything has been moving,” Agyemang said. “I've always prayed for this. I've always had the faith that at some point, hopefully I'll be able to be on a stage where I can really show what I can do and just give my all for it, just to see that this is the start of something that potentially could just keep going higher. It's a blessing.”

At a time when former U.S. stars are questioning the motivation and commitment of the current group of players, Agyemang's performances have merited increased attention. While many other U.S. forwards have played abroad, Agyemang's development has fully come stateside, first in the college ranks and then with Charlotte.

A striker can often force his way onto a tournament squad on the back of strong scoring form, and Agyemang is no exception. The fact that making the World Cup squad seems like a genuine possibility is an impressive development from a player whose professional career is still getting started.

“To hear stuff like that, it's a nice feeling,” Agyemang said of his increasing support, “but that just makes me want to do it more.”

Agyemang's ascent is even more impressive when considering that he didn't begin playing striker regularly until he was 21.

Given his pace and dribbling ability, coaches asked Agyemang to play on the wing, most often on the left to cut inwards onto his preferred right foot. It's the spot where Agyemang began his college career with his hometown Eastern Connecticut State Warriors. He was prolific during his two years in Division III, bagging 30 goals and 10 assists in 39 appearances and garnering D-1 interest from the University of Rhode Island. Once he arrived, his new coach saw a different way to maximize his skillset.

“When I got to Rhode Island, that's when the coaches said, ‘I want you to be my No. 9,'” Agyemang said. “I was like, ‘OK, cool. I could do pretty well (in) this position for myself.' I thought if I continue just learning more about the nine position, I could be a really good nine.”

Agyemang took to his new position and level of competition quickly, landing on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference first team in both his junior and senior seasons. He scored 19 times while adding 12 assists in 37 games, and that caused his stock to soar ahead of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft, where Charlotte traded up to select him 12th overall.

While he earned 423 minutes across the regular season and Leagues Cup, scoring twice, most of his rookie development came in MLS Next Pro with Crown Legacy FC. Throughout 2023, however, he found himself being asked to play striker in a less agile manner, a potential byproduct of his 6-foot-4 stature as well as a coach (Christian Lattanzio) whose positional play model had granularly defined job descriptions for each role.

“It's hard,” Agyemang said of being assessed on his stature. “I remember when I first got here, a lot of times, it was just like: hold the ball, set and go. Obviously, that's a lot of principles that as a striker you want, because at the end, you want to score your goals in the box and stuff like that. I think I had to build into it, because I was letting people know, like, I could do more than that.

“I know my game, and I know when I'm at my best. I know what I'm good at. When the ball is on my feet, I'm never scared to, like, take somebody on in a 1-v-1. I look for those opportunities, and I always want to go.”

Ahead of 2024, Charlotte appointed Dean Smith as its new head coach, bringing the former Aston Villa and Norwich City boss over for his first job outside England. Early in preseason, Agyemang worked with his new coaching staff to try incorporating more of his natural skillset into his game.

Agyemang feels as though Smith — like Pochettino with the national team — took the time to size up how he could thrive most.

“There's a difference,” Agyemang said of coaches who tailor game plans to their personnel instead of forcing players into strict systems. “You definitely feel that. Initially, when I first was here at Charlotte, it felt like I was just a role, like they weren't really looking into who I was as a player.

“I think a lot of times, coaches try to give you too much information rather than letting you just play. So I think now, especially with the coaches I've been working with now, it's been a big change. I feel like now, I'm just gonna continue to elevate my game.”

Agyemang and Charlotte leveled up during a transformative 2024. Across 2,014 minutes in the regular season and playoffs, Agyemang led the club with 10 goals and tied for the team lead with six assists. He bagged three crucial game-winners as Charlotte found its rhythm in the spring and summer, showing Smith he could swing results with his approach to leading the line.

“His ceiling is as much as he wants it to be, to be honest,” Smith told the Total Soccer Show podcast in March. While he has just one goal to date in the 2025 MLS season, the underlying numbers show that he has the requisite instinct to find dangerous areas that typifies an elite center forward.

Since the start of 2024, 30 strikers have played at least 1,500 minutes in MLS. It's a sample that includes luminaries like Luis Suárez, Christian Benteke and Cucho Hernández as well as prolific MLS forwards like Jordan Morris and Cristian Arango. While Agyemang's numbers are competitive among them in most categories, he tops the charts in two crucial rate stats for a forward with his profile.

Nobody has a higher progressive carry rate — that is, how often his carries advance the ball at least five yards closer to goal — of 32% (second-best is 22.1%), while no striker has logged a greater share of his touches in the opponent's box than Agyemang's rate of 25.4%.

When presented with the data, Agyemang can't help but take a little pride in how his work is paying off. Still, he sees it as evidence that he needs to keep refining the rest of his game.

“It's cool to hear those stats, but I just know how I like to play the game now,” Agyemang said. “I'm comfortable being on the ball and on the run with the ball. With my frame, you look at me, and you're like, ‘A 6'4” winger, it just doesn't make sense.'

“I like to add those things I've learned on the wing, and bring it into my game, because I want to make my game unique to myself. There's a lot of players in the world that play the nine in a way, but I want to make it my unique way. That's why I think like that progressive ball carrying is a way that I like to do. Maybe nines, you know, they don't want the ball (that far from goal), but I love carrying the ball.”

UNSTOPPABLE from Patrick Agyemang to double the lead!#USMNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/BxMB1B16Lx

— U.S. Soccer Men's National Team (@USMNT) January 18, 2025



Another area that Agyemang continues to refine is his off-ball movement, a facet that changes considerably when shifting from the wing to center forward.

He admits to being “very critical” of himself, watching each of his performances back to revisit in-moment thoughts that crop up in games. He looks for “patterns” that come up in game scenarios, trying to identify pockets of space that opponents are presenting his team so he can exploit them to create room for himself or his teammates as a clever decoy.

“I've just been really working on that, because before I really didn't do as much movement,” Agyemang said, “But the best way as a striker is like, you want to feel as if the defenders don't know where to go at times. If I'm always in front of them and stuff like that, it's a field day for them. You kind of mix it up and find ways to open space.”

That effort is possibly more crucial now as Smith calibrates his system to include Wilfried Zaha, who joined the club this winter on an initial loan. The former Crystal Palace great is among the modern era's most prolific dribblers, and his presence will inevitably take some carrying responsibility off of Agyemang's shoulders. While the striker acknowledged that they're “still learning and understanding each other's games,” the initial collaboration has been positive and he's already seen glimpses of the pair “getting that rhythm down.”

Charlotte fans are watching that partnership blossom with great hope, as the team — which also includes U.S. international defender Tim Ream and former Villa and Burnley midfielder Ashley Westwood — projects to remain in contention in the Eastern Conference. It'll also be closely assessed by Pochettino and his staff as they continue to size up the U.S.'s player pool ahead of next summer.

Agyemang's work rate in the Nations League finals stood out in contrast to some of his teammates. His goal against Canada was a just return for his first-half shift, where his movement had unsettled the defense and opened spaces for Luna, Tim Weah and Christian Pulisic.

To him, that inner drive was refined during his time in the NCAA.

“I think there's things that I still need to work on, but I think it's just like the grit and the grind part — like the determination,” Agyemang said of his college tenure. “No matter what happens, I'm gonna keep going. I think that's the part I really like grabbed and has stuck with me since college.”

He, like his peers, will also want to play in the 2026 World Cup. The fierce competition in his position will keep a fire under Agyemang to turn in good performances, refine that interplay with Zaha and keep himself on the radar regardless of what his compatriots are doing.

Agyemang isn't fixating too much on what could happen when the tournament kicks off in over 15 months — after all, he wasn't even a projected starter for his club 15 months ago.

“For me, I try not to look too far, because it brings a lot of extra pressure,” he said. “But at the end of the day, it's home. If you're a part of that, you're involved in something that's so special, just to be able to play in a World Cup on your home soil. That's such a special feeling. I think a lot of Americans will want to be a part of that. It's cool to just be in the conversation for it. At the end of the day, who knows?”

And so, the hard work continues in Charlotte and off the training ground. Agyemang emphasized that he wants to improve his consistency in 2025, and not just in front of goal. He's studying the tape to see how he can improve his defensive pressing, how to be even better at retaining the ball and making better decisions when it's at his feet. In total, it's about “polishing the cleanness of (his) game” now that he's getting consistent reps.

At a time when greats like Landon Donovan question if the current group wants to represent the U.S., it's an honor that's only fueling Agyemang to push on. Although it comes with increased expectations and scrutiny, it's a blessing he's worked hard to invite – and an area where he's more than happy to elaborate.

“Now that I've quickly gotten into this national team, they're expecting more from me,” Agyemang said. “For me, it's cool. It's a fun dynamic to work with. At the end of the day, if you want to be a great player, you need to know what's to come with it.

“I'm blessed to be in this position, but I won't puff my chest because of what's come, if that makes sense. I'm always this type of guy to keep my head down and want to do more, and get better each and every day. I don't want it to just be, like, that was my first and my last camp. I want it to be the beginning of something to come.”

Perhaps the biggest draw of this summer's FIFA Club World Cup is the sight of Europe's most successful club heading Stateside for the tournament. 

Not only are the Spanish giants 15-time Champions League winners and La Liga champions on a record 36 occasions, but Real have also won the Club World Cup more times than any other side. 

They have lifted the trophy five times, with the last coming in 2022 as they beat Al Hilal in Rabat thanks to braces from Federico Valverde and Vinicius Jr. 

DAZN  is the only place to watch every match of the Club World Cup live and for free - download the free app now for smart TV's, smartphones, streaming devices and games consoles to start watching.

DAZN News   has everything you need to know about Real Madrid. 

Real are Madrid's crown jewel, alongside the other capital clubs Atletico Madrid and Rayo Vallecano.

The famous Bernabeu Stadium has the second-largest seating capacity in Spain and has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.

Football was introduced to Spain by English workers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Madrid was officially founded in 1902 by Juan Padros.

In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.



Real Madrid are the most dominant team in Spanish football history, having lifted La Liga 36 times. Their battle at the top of La Liga with Barcelona is the stuff of legend, and their 'El Clasico' battle is arguably the most popular football rivalry in the game. 

They also hold the record for most Champions League wins with 15, making them the most successful side in European football. 













Real Madrid are one of twelve European teams competing in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and qualify as one of the last three winners of the UEFA Champions League.

Real Madrid have been drawn into Group H, alongside Al Hilal, Pachuca and Red Bull Salzburg.

The new expanded Fifa Club World Cup will take place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July 2025.

Previously an annual tournament contested by the top seven teams, the Club World Cup will now feature 32 teams and occur once every four years.

The tournament once branded a "mistake" by ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter is undergoing a revamp as significant as it is controversial.

Club World Cup draw pairs Man City with Juventus; Chelsea face Flamengo

Teams from each of the six international football confederations will be at the Club World Cup: Asia (AFC), Africa (Caf), North and Central America (Concacaf), South America (Conmebol), Oceania (OFC) and Europe (Uefa).

There are 12 places available for European clubs - the highest quota of the confederations. These places are decided by clubs' Champions League performances over the past four seasons.

That means recent winners Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid have all qualified.

Other European teams have qualified through a Uefa ranking system determined by clubs' performances over the four seasons. Only two clubs per country can qualify, so England's 2022 Champions League finalists Liverpool are not included.

Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg - who will be known as FC Salzburg because of Fifa sponsorship regulations - will be there.

There are four club places each for Asia and Africa, as well as the North and Central America federation.

Six places are awarded to South American clubs, and one to Oceania.

Clubs have accrued points over the most recent four seasons, based on their performances in their continental club competitions.

Group A: Palmeiras, FC Porto, Al Ahly, Inter Miami

Group B: Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Botafogo, Seattle Sounders

Group C: Bayern Munich, Auckland City, Boca Juniors, Benfica

Group D: Flamengo, Esperance Sportive de Tunisie, Chelsea, Club Leon

Group E: River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds, Monterrey, Inter Milan

Group F: Fluminense, Borussia Dortmund, Ulsan, Mamelodi Sundowns

Group G: Manchester City, Wydad, Al Ain, Juventus

Group H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal, Pachuca, Salzburg

One spot in the tournament is reserved for a team from the host nation.

Fifa opted to award that place to Inter Miami for winning the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield, the trophy given out to the team which has the best regular-season record. The Floridians then lost in the MLS play-offs, meaning they are not this season's champions.

The decision to invite Inter Miami to the Club World Cup before the MLS campaign was concluded has been interpreted by some as an attempt on Fifa's part to ensure Lionel Messi, who joined the team in 2023, will play in a tournament that has attracted little public enthusiasm so far.

The revamped Club World Cup will run in a similar way to the international men's and women's World Cup competitions.

The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four, who will play each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams from each group will then go through to the knockout stages.

Unlike the international World Cups, the Club World Cup will have no third-place play-off.

The final will take place on 13 July 2025.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

Clubs will take home a set figure for each round:

Group Stages: £1.5m for a win / £800k for a draw

Round of 16: £5.8m

Quarter-Final: £10.1m

Semi-Final: £16.2m

Finalist: £23.2m

Winner: £30.0m

Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria.

European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents. The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

All matches will be held in the United States, a year before the country co-hosts the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

Fixtures are set to be played in 12 different stadiums.

Atlanta, Mercedes-Benz Stadium

Charlotte, TQL Stadium

Cincinnati, Bank of America Stadium

Los Angeles, Rose Bowl Stadium

Miami, Hard Rock Stadium

Nashville, GEODIS Park

New Jersey, MetLife Stadium

Orlando, Camping World Stadium

Orlando, Inter&Co Stadium

Philadelphia, Lincoln Financial Field

Seattle, Lumen Field

Washington DC, Audi Field

The opening match will be held in Miami, and the final is scheduled for New Jersey.

Streaming platform DAZN has secured exclusive rights and will show all 63 matches free to view on on its platforms, and there is also potential for it to sublicense rights to local free-to-air broadcasters.

Fifa is currently facing legal action from player unions and leagues about the scheduling of the tournament.

Global players' union Fifpro and the top European Leagues say the international football calendar is "oversaturated" and "risks player safety and wellbeing".

Several players - including Liverpool's Alisson Becker and Manchester City's Rodri - have raised concerns about player wellbeing amid an increasingly jam-packed football calendar.

There are just five weeks between the Club World Cup final and the first Premier League match of the 2025-2026 season, which is scheduled for 16 August.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has already requested a late start to the Premier League season for his team, while City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne told reporters: "The issue is that Uefa and Fifa keep adding extra matches, and we can raise concerns but no solutions have been found. It seems that money speaks louder than the players' voices."

A Fifa spokesperson BBC Sport: "The Fifa Club World Cup is not responsible for calendar congestion. It is a competitive tournament that takes place once every four years and, as independent studies have verified, Fifa is only responsible for a small percentage of matches per season.

"Fifa cares about the welfare of the players. Following a decision taken earlier this year, Fifa is formalising the Task Force on Player Welfare, headed by Arsene Wenger, to promote further global dialogue on player welfare issues with key stakeholders across football."

The Club World Cup will partially overlap with Women's Euro 2025, which runs from 2-27 July.

BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify this scheduling clash and whether there were concerns about the Women's Euro competing with the Club World Cup for attention.

A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: "The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa.

"While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.

"It is also important to note that given the time difference between Switzerland [host of Uefa Women's Euro 2025] and the United States [where the Fifa Club World Cup will take place], the number of matches where a potential clash could take place will be fewer."

≡ THE 5-RING CIRCUS ≡

● Olympic Games 2028: Los Angeles ● Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt has asked the City Council to approve a $34.6 million guarantee to the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games organizing committee in order to host the slalom canoeing and softball events.

The motion is scheduled for Tuesday, with the cost calculated by a projection of the amount it would take to relocate the events to the Los Angeles area in case of an Oklahoma City default.

Holt told The Oklahoman, “It's not a check we expect to write out.

“From their perspective, we've committed to do this. They committed to the [International Olympic Committee] these events will happen. They are relying on us to keep the commitment they made.”

¶

Los Angeles City 15th District Council member Tim McOsker continued his rage against the LA28 organizers, trying to get the sailing competition moved from Long Beach to San Pedro, filing two more motions on Friday to compel reports from LA28 on commitments made in the November 2021 Games Agreement with the City.

One asks for a report in seven days by City staff on the current status of the “LA28 Community Business and Procurement Program and the Local Hire Program” and the other for a City staff report – in seven days – on the LA28 “Impact and Sustainability Plan.”

Both motions were referred to the City's Ad Hoc Committee on the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games; the first motion was also referred to the Economic Development and Jobs Committee.

● Football ● On Thursday, FIFA announced a special ticket offer, tying purchases – and attendance – at FIFA Club World Cup matches this summer for tickets at the FIFA World Cup in 2026:

“This package involves one ticket per match to two FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches, with the option to add one ticket to a third match at an additional cost. The purchaser of a Ticket Pack who uses all tickets to attend all matches included in their Ticket Pack will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final).”

This is available for 25 days (from 3 April), or until the allocation runs out. There is also a “Super Ticket Pack:”

“A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enjoy the groundbreaking FIFA Club World Cup 2025, this package features one ticket per match to 20 FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches, which must include a semi-final and either the opening match or the final. The purchaser of a Super Ticket Pack who uses all tickets to attend all matches included in their Super Ticket Pack will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket for the eagerly anticipated FIFA World Cup 26 final.”

The Club World Cup kicks off on 14 June in Miami, Florida, with the final on 13 July in New Jersey.

● Gymnastics ● A total of 14 Russian artistic gymnasts received neutral status from the Federation Internationale de Gymnastique to compete in FIG World Cup events, but decided not compete. According to the Russian Gymnastics Federation:

“All Russian athletes representing artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, who have received neutral status, have decided to refrain from participating in the upcoming competitions under the auspices of the International Gymnastics Federation. The reason for this decision is the numerous unfounded and biased refusals by the FIG special committee to allow our gymnasts to compete.”

According to the Russian news agency TASS:

“[T]he FIG refused to grant neutral status to some athletes from Russia due to the posting of a congratulatory message on social networks for Victory Day, the athletes' participation in a gala concert for Defender of the Fatherland Day, during which the St. George ribbon was used and photographs were taken with children in military uniform.

“Another reason for the refusal was the athlete's subscription to a group on a social network where an announcement of the V All-Russian Anti-Doping Dictation, dedicated to the Physical Culture Day, was posted. The experts of the special FIG committee took the number V for one of the symbols of the SVO [Ukrainian invasion].”

● Skateboarding ● The Italian news agency ANSA reported that World Skate will impose a minimum age limit on athletes at the 2028 Olympic Games of 14, to be achieved by the end of the year (meaning 13-year-olds could compete in Los Angeles).

Athletes as young as 11 – China's Haohao Zhang – competed in Paris in 2024; an age limit of 12 will be installed for the Youth Olympic Games.

≡ RESULTS ≡

● Athletics ● At the USATF National 10-mile Championships in Washington, D.C., held in conjunction with the annual Cherry Blossom 10, with former Oklahoma State All-American Taylor Roe backing up her win in the USATF Half Marathon champs in March with two American Records.

She surged away from the field after a couple of miles and won going away in a U.S. record of 49:53, destroying Molly Huddle's 2018 mark of 50:52. Emma Grace Hurley was a distance second in 51:04 and Fiona O'Keeffe was third in 51:49.

Along the way, Roe passed 10 km in 30:56, four seconds off Shalane Flanagan's 2016 best, but got a U.S. women's-only record, ahead of Weini Kelati's 31:18 in 2021. Roe also grabbed the American Record for 15 km at 46:24, slashing Kelati's 46:32 from earlier in 2025.

The men's race was won by U.S.-British dual citizen Charles Hicks in 45:14, with a final sprint to beat USATF Half Marathon champ Alex Maier (45:15) and Biya Simbassa (45:23). Maier claimed the American Record, one second better than Conner Mantz's en route time during the Houston Half Marathon earlier this year.

● Curling ● Olympic silver medalist Bruce Mouat's Scottish rink claimed their second World Curling Men's World Championships in the last three editions in Moose Jaw (CAN) on Sunday.

Canadian star Brad Jacobs, the 2014 Olympic winner, had his rink at the top of the round-robin after an 11-1 record, ahead of the Swiss (9-3) and then China, Sweden and Scotland at 8-4.

In the playoffs, Mouat's Scots dispensed with Canada's Jacobs in the semis, 7-4, and Swiss Yannick Schwaller's rink dumped China, 7-3. That set up the final, with the Swiss leading, 1-0, through four ends, but Mouat coming up with two in the fifth, only to see Schwaller match in the sixth. The Scots scored twice more in the seventh, but the Swiss tied it at 4-4 in the eighth.

Finally, a score in the 10th gave Mouat and Scotland a 5-4 win and the title, their seventh in history and the second for Mouat, who won with the same team as in 2023: Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie, Hammy McMillan Jr. and Kyle Waddell.

Canada and Jacobs won the third-place game, 11-2, over China (Xiaoming Xu). The U.S., with Korey Dropkin as skip, finished 4-8, in 11th.

That was 1:01 better than Mads Pedersen (DEN) and Mathieu van der Poel (NED), who ended up 2-3, with Wout van Aert (BEL) in fourth, with the same time. It's Pogacar's second win in this race, also in 2023.

The women's race was won by home favorite Lotte Kopecky, winning a final sprint of four riders at the end of the 168.9 km track, in 4:24:34. She was just better than Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (FRA) and Liane Lippert (GER), both with the same time, and a second up on Kasia Niewiadoma (POL). It was the third win in this race for Kopecky, who took it in 2022 and 2023.

● Football ● The USA women met Brazil in a friendly at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on Saturday, in a re-match of last summer's Olympic final won by the U.S., but with a more emphatic outcome.

The Americans were on offense from the start, with immediate pressure. Midfielder Alyssa Thompson quickly found space, dribbling into the middle of the field and sent a lead pass to a cutting forward Trinity Rodman in front of the goal and she sent a right-footed toe-tap into the right side of the Brazilian goal at the five-minute mark. It was Rodman's first game since the Olympic final against Brazil in Paris last year, thanks to a back injury.

Thompson almost got a goal herself in the 17th, as her shot from the top of the box toward the far right side of the Brazilian goal was saved by keeper Lorena. The U.S. had more chances, from forward Ally Sentnor (18th) and Rodman (22nd), but Lorena was equal to those challenges.

Brazil had chances too, with striker Amanda Gutierres challenging U.S. keeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the 30th, but Tullis-Joyce handled it; she stayed busy throughout the half. Possession was 50-50 in the half, but Brazil ended with a 9-6 edge on shots.

The U.S. came out with more control in mind in the second half, but Brazilian midfielder Ludmila hit the U.S. goal post with a shot in the first minute. Brazil got off three more shots on Tullis-Joyce by the 62nd minute before the U.S. offense got going, and in the 66th, Ludmila tackled Lily Yohannes in the box for a penalty.

Midfield star Lindsey Heaps calmly shutter-stepped, then a right-footed smash (barely) into the left side of the Brazilian net for the decisive 2-0 lead. From that point, the U.S. maintained most of the control and the game finished at 2-0.

With better possession on the ball in the second half, the Americans finished with 55% of the ball and had 16 shots to 15 for the visitors. They will meet again on Tuesday in San Jose, California.

● Gymnastics ● At the FIG Rhythmic World Cup in Sofia (BUL), Ukraine's Paris Olympic ninth-placer Taisila Onofriichuk took the All-Around, scoring 114.450 across two rounds, ahead of Bulgaria's six-time Worlds medal winner Stiliana Nikolova (110.65) and Uzbek Takhmina Ikromova (109.850).

The men's pool winners were Argentina, Kenya, Spain and Fiji, and Fiji and Kenya romped into the final, with Fiji winning its second tournament of the season, 21-12 in the final. Argentina defeated Spain, 33-14, for third. That leaves Argentina still on top of the standings, heading to the Grand Final in Carson, California, with 114 points to 96 for Fiji and 88 for Spain.

April 7 – The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has a busy month unravelling the qualification mess that FIFA's Club World Cup has become following the late barring of Club León from the competition over multi-club ownership rules.

On Friday CAS confirmed it has registered individual appeals by both Club León and Club de Fútbol Pachuca (Pachuca) against FIFA over the decision in March to remove Club León saying that Pachuca and Club León breached the Regulations for the FIFA World Cup Club 2025 (Art. 10.1) concerning multiple club ownership.

Mexican clubs Pachuca and Club León both qualified by right but are both owned by the Groupo Pachuca. The ownership conflict was known at FIFA, but with an absence of guidance Grupo Pachuca took steps to put in provisions similar to those in place for UEFA competitions that allow two clubs under the same ownership to play in the competition.

“The Parties are currently exchanging written submissions for these appeals in accordance with the arbitration rules governing CAS procedures. The appeals will be expedited and heard during the week of 5 May 2025,” said CAS. The Club World Cup kicks off June 14 in Miami.

If CAS rules that ultimately FIFA were correct to remove Club León, who fills their slot.

A separate appeal filed at CAS by Costa Rica's Alajuelense in February, claims that they should be given the slot ‘immediately'. Their case is based on an unofficial ranking and that Mexico and the US already have two teams from their nations qualified (a separate rule for the competition qualification).

However, even if Alajuelense were, the next highest ranked team, they would likely not automatically qualify as they have not won that right through the qualifying competitions.

FIFA's competition rules do not provide for the next highest ranked team to qualify in this instance, rather the issue is a matter of ‘exceptional circumstance' which ultimately means that FIFA has the final decision over who will participate if Club León lose their CAS appeal and remain barred from the competition.

In short it looks like Alajuelense's appeal has the look of the old two hopes adage – Bob and No. The club probably knew this when they made their appeal.

So ultimately it looks like FIFA – under the principle of ‘exceptional circumstance' – will have free reign to decide who enters their competition, and like the decision to award the discretionary slot to Inter Miami, it will likely be made on commercial pulling power.

That would include the power to add a third team from either the USA or Mexico. A single winner-take-all play-off between Major League Soccer's (MLS) LAFC and Ligue MX giant Club América, has been mooted.

“FIFA can confirm it is considering a one play-off match between LAFC and Club América for the right to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025,” a FIFA statement read.

Unless, of course, CAS rules that Club León can stay.

Emma Hayes earned her 16th win as the USWNT head coach as the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) celebrate victory over Brazil.



The U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) showcased a blend of youthful energy and strategic prowess in a commanding 2-0 victory over Brazil at SoFi Stadium. This match marked the first encounter between the two teams since the 2024 Olympic gold medal game, reaffirming the USWNT's dominance on the international stage.​

From the outset, the USWNT displayed aggressive intent. In the 5th minute, forward Trinity Rodman, returning from an eight-month injury hiatus, capitalized on a precise assist from Alyssa Thompson to net her 11th international goal. Rodman's swift finish into the lower right corner set the tone for the match.​

The team's momentum continued into the second half. In the 66th minute, 17-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes, who had been on the field for just five minutes, drew a foul in the penalty area. Captain Lindsey Heaps confidently converted the ensuing penalty kick, marking her 37th international goal and solidifying the team's lead.​

Defensively, the USWNT was bolstered by the debut of goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. The 28-year-old Manchester United player delivered a stellar performance, recording six saves and securing a clean sheet. Her composure under pressure underscores the depth of talent within the squad.​

Head Coach Emma Hayes' influence was evident throughout the match. Since her appointment, Hayes has prioritized integrating young talent with seasoned veterans, fostering a cohesive and dynamic team dynamic. Her strategic vision and emphasis on player development have been instrumental in the team's recent successes.​

The match drew a crowd of 32,303 fans, marking the first-ever women's professional sporting event at SoFi Stadium and the second-largest USWNT attendance in the Los Angeles area, excluding the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.​

Rafael Nadal left tennis last year as a legend of the sport, with 22 Grand Slam titles on his honours list.

Nadal secured Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces at the 2009 Australian Open, although the majority of his success arrived on clay.

The Spanish legend won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles at the French Open, well ahead of any other ATP player.

Nadal also triumphed four times at the US Open, as well as winning twice at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon.

It is now the first clay season since 2002 without Nadal, who decided to call time on his glittering career late last year.

Casper Ruud can fly on clay in Nadal's absence, with the latter having beaten the former in his last-ever Grand Slam final.

The 2022 French Open champion was asked in his winning press conference that year if he was surprised by what he had achieved in his career, with Nadal replying: “Well, for sure surprise is surprise.

“If not surprised you win 14 Roland Garros or 22 Grand Slam, it is because you are super arrogant. Honestly, no, I am not this kind of guy.

“I never even dreamt about achieving the things that I achieved. Honestly, no, I never considered myself that good.

“So I am just honestly keep going step by step, practice by practice, and always with a clear goal to improve something.

“That's my mindset during all my tennis career, no? Go on court and every practice with the goal to improve something in my game. I don't understand the sport another way.

“With that philosophy probably and with a lot of help from a great team next to me and family and friends, everybody who support me and help me during all my tennis career have been important for me, no?

“All the coaches, all the people that have been next to me in some moments, no? I learned from every situation, and not only in a tennis world. I learned a lot in terms of life. So that's all the experiences help me to grow always.”

Ruud has certainly impressed on clay throughout his career, with the Norwegian now aiming for success on the surface at the Monte-Carlo Masters.

Two of his Grand Slam final appearances have come on clay, but Ruud was on the receiving end of defeats on both occasions.

He currently occupies seventh in the ATP rankings, dropping one spot and replaced by Jack Draper ahead of Monte-Carlo.

Nadal meanwhile of course reached number one in the world during his glittering career, with all 14 of his French Open finals going his way.

Comedian Andy Hamilton was one of the key figures taking part in Save Wimbledon Park's held their sixth public meeting in opposition to the mammoth proposed development of the former Wimbledon Park golf club.

The All England Tennis Club (AELTC) submitted ground-breaking expansion plans, which were approved by Merton council and rejected by Wandsworth council.

The GLA were asked to rule, and they passed the plans. That decision is now the subject of a Judicial Review, launched by Save Wimbledon Park earlier this year. The estimated legal costs of bringing such a challenge are £200k, for which a crowdjustice funding appeal is currently underway.

A capacity crowd at St Barnabas Church in Southfields, heard legal and environmental presentations about the nature of the judicial challenge and the impact to the area if it all goes ahead.

Special guest and local resident Andy Hamilton (A Have I Got News For You regular) gave an impassioned speech on the importance of green open spaces under threat.

Mr Hamilton said: “It's important that the community win this battle to stop the AELTC swallowing up valued green spaces in order to build an industrial scale tennis complex.”

Save Wimbledon Park say AELTC were invited but did not attend, with their place on the stage was taken by a tennis racquet bearing their name.

Meeting organiser Simon Wright said “Another sell-out meeting indicates the strength of local feeling that these are the wrong plans for Wimbledon Park.

“During the Q&A session, the audience made it very clear that they do not want 39 practice courts, vast maintenance hubs, concrete driveways and a stadium the size of the Royal Albert Hall to be built in Wimbledon Park.”

Among those speaking out against the planned expansion was Thelma Ruby, who said: “I am 100 year old actress, living overlooking Wimbledon Common golf course. I am appalled by the Wimbledon tennis plan to ruin my life by chopping down hundreds of precious trees and turning a glorious heritage landscape into a polluting building site.

“If I have to see the desecration of my view and polluting lorries passing my door every 10 minutes and hear chain saws cutting down the trees I love instead of the sound of birds and Canada geese, I would rather not be alive. I am prepared to chain myself to a tree to save it.”

School boy Gabriel, nine, of Bishop Gilpin Primary School, said: “I think the AELTC planning is a terrible idea. A few months ago I started a petition to save the trees in Wimbledon Park.  My friends and I spoke to the whole school, and put posters up, I have over 100 signatures.

“My petition is about the trees and wildlife because I care about the environment.  I also love tennis I even play every week at the Wimbledon Club, but I would rather keep the trees and quit tennis if it helped.  I think it is important to protect these trees at all costs.”

Matt Birch, headteacher at Bishop Gilpin Primary School said: ” Gabriel has devoted himself to ensuring that the school community knows and understands the Save Wimbledon Park campaign.

“Gabriel has worked tenaciously in his own time to share the message and has demonstrated his true belief in the cause and we are very proud of him.”

“Tennis is broken. Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent,” said PTPA's executive director Ahmad Nassar last month. The Novak Djokovic-led Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) had just filed a major lawsuit. Their target? The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA. One of the issues at hand is pay disparity. That move sent waves through tennis. Now, top stars like Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka, Novak Djoković, and more are speaking up, asking Grand Slams to increase their share of revenue. Jessica Pegula, the new World No. 3, is among them. What did she say?

Let's talk money. The Grand Slams do shell out big bucks, but how much exactly? The US Open in 2024 had the richest prize pot in tennis history at $75 million—a 15% jump from the previous year. Wimbledon wasn't far behind, handing out $65 million. The Australian Open saw a 12% rise, reaching nearly $60 million. The French Open followed closely, offering around $59 million—up 7.8% from 2023.

Transitioning from numbers to action, L'Equipe first reported that a letter demanding a major revenue share increase was sent to the heads of all four Slams—Craig Tiley (AO), Stephane Morel (French Open), Sally Bolton (Wimbledon), and Lew Sherr (US Open). According to the Associated Press, the letter was dated “March 21” and featured 20 handwritten signatures from top players on both the men's and women's sides.

Speaking at a UTS event in Nimes, World No. 6 Casper Ruud added fuel to the fire. “As a player, I don't feel like it's fair… If you compare with other major sports around the world, NFL, MLB, NBA, they are closer to 50 percent revenue sharing.” The numbers don't lie. As per the PTPA, professional tennis players only get about 17.5% of the total revenue generated by the sport. Compare that to NBA athletes, who receive nearly 50%. That's a massive gap. And it's not sitting right with the top players anymore.

After her win at the Charleston Open, Jessica Pegula spoke about the letter and the larger movement with Tennis Channel.

She said, “That was more about the Slams trying to secure higher revenue shares—revenue that would go towards prize money, considering how much money they're making. I think there are also other things, like player welfare, but more details will probably come out in a couple of months. I'm always pushing for that kind of stuff. It's amazing to see what Ben (Navarro) has done for tennis, especially in the U.S., and particularly for women. That's awesome to hear. There's a massive discrepancy. People often assume there's equal prize money across the board, but it's really only at the Slams—and maybe one or two of the 1000-level tournaments. There's a huge drop-off between the 250s and the 500s. So just starting that trend toward better equity is huge for us. It's amazing.”

With tennis players getting just 17.5% of revenue, is it time for a major overhaul?

Debate

Speaking of Ben Navarro, the father of World No. 11 Emma Navarro and owner of the Charleston Open, made a big move. His company, Credit One Bank, extended its title partnership with the tournament through 2031. Thanks to this, the Charleston Open became the first WTA 500 to offer prize money on par with ATP 500 events—well before the 2033 deadline.

Pegula walked away with $164,000 after her Charleston win. The total prize pool? $1,064,510. All WTA 500 and 1000 events are now expected to match ATP levels. From 2026, the pool will rise to around $1.15 million and continue to grow. Meanwhile, many ATP 500s already offer over $2 million. So there's still a long way to go.

Beyond the paycheck, Pegula's Charleston title was special for another reason—it was her first-ever clay-court win.

After losing the Miami Open final to Aryna Sabalenka just a week earlier, Jessica Pegula bounced back in style. She adjusted beautifully to the green clay in Charleston and won her second title of the year. This also marked the eighth singles title of her career. The 6-3, 7-5 victory over fellow American Sofia Kenin sealed the deal. At 31, the American finally conquered clay.

The win gave her 300 points, boosting her from No. 4 to No. 3 in the rankings, equaling her career best from October 24, 2022. It also knocked fellow American Coco Gauff to No. 4, though there's less than 40 points between them. With that, Pegula also became the No. 1 American woman in tennis. There's more good news.

Pegula had missed last year's entire clay season due to injury. But this year, she's heading into Madrid, Rome, and Roland-Garros with zero points to defend. That's a free shot to rack up more wins. And she's leading the WTA Tour in victories this season with 25, ahead of even World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who has 23.

Jessica Pegula is making moves on and off the court. Whether it's fighting for fair pay or collecting titles, she's showing up. Will this movement finally push tennis toward true equality—or is it just the start of another long rally?

Let the world know your perspective.

"I never wanted to put any pressure because I really care about Marat."ByMatt FitzgeraldPublished Apr 07, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 07, 2025

MONTE CARLO—Andrey Rublev always had the idea in his head to work with the champion he idolized.At the start of this month, that notion came to fruition when Marat Safin signed on to join the world No. 9's team alongside long-time coach Fernando Vicente—debuting last Friday at the UTS event in Nimes.“Yeah, it's different. It's not like… yeah. I have to really focus,” Rublev shared with me in Monte Carlo after I asked how having Safin in his ear on court compared to having conversations off it.

On Sunday, the two had their first practice together at an ATP event. Across the net trained good friend Daniil Medvedev and hours later, Rublev teamed up with another close buddy in Karen Khachanov to defeat Nikola Mektic and Michael Venus.“Today was a good day. Me and Karen, we played really well. I lost many times against Venus and Mektic and now we were able to beat them,” summarized the 27-year-old.Said Medvedev the day prior when I asked for his take on the new combination, the 2021 US Open champion said, “Big combination. I'm practicing with them tomorrow, so I'm gonna see with my eyes how it works. I think it's going to be very interesting, positive in terms of PR for other people, for fans to enjoy it, But also in terms of work.”

In 2024, Rublev revealed that he turned to Safin to “fix my head” after dropping his Wimbledon opener to Francisco Comensana. He was grateful that the two-time major winner made the time for him, and while Rublev hoped to soak up more of Safin's insights, the Moscow native didn't want to force the issue either.“Deep inside, I always wanted to work together, but I knew that he was not interested. And I never wanted to put any pressure because I really care about Marat. Later on, I found out that he's kind of ready to work in tennis or something like that, that he don't mind.And then I say, ‘OK, even if it's not gonna be me, at least I can ask.' I have nothing to lose if I ask. Then my agent ask, they talk and little by little we work for a couple of days together.”

As for what ultimately drove Rublev to make this decision going into the European clay-court season? It came straight from the heart.“It was my feelings. There was no logic, no explanation,” he said.“I know him since I was a kid, and he was my inspiration. Then, he knows me for many years as well. When I start to play better tennis, we start to get to know each other more. I find out that he's a really nice guy and then later on, during I guess his life, he was struggling with his own struggles and he was able to (come) through. And that's it.”Rublev, who lifted the Monte Carlo crown two years ago for his maiden Masters 1000 title, is seeded seventh. Looking to snap a three-match losing streak that followed a triumph in Dubai, Rublev will have to get past Gael Monfils. On Monday, the 38-year-old Frenchman stormed back to beat Fabian Marozsan, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1.

Jessica Pegula's Meteoric Rise and the American Tennis Revolution

In the realm of tennis history, where legends like Max Decugis, Suzanne Lenglen, and Chris Evert once reigned supreme, a new star is on the horizon – Jessica Pegula. Fresh off her victory at the Charleston Open, where she outshined the competition and secured her second title of the 2025 season, Pegula is making waves in the tennis world.

Defeating top players like Sofia Kenin, Pegula has now climbed to the No.3 ranking, surpassing fellow American Coco Gauff as the new American No.1. With her sights set on even greater achievements, Pegula is not just aiming for the stars; she's reaching for the heavens.

In a recent interview, Pegula reflected on the possibility of breaking records, particularly Rafael Nadal's astounding 14 French Open titles. With a glint of determination in her eyes, she remarked, “Hey, you never know. Honestly, we always say ‘never say never.' I mean, we always think records aren't supposed to be broken, but they're meant to be broken. So, it's really cool.”

While Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros may seem insurmountable, history has shown that records are made to be shattered. Just look at Novak Djokovic's 428 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 or Iga Swiatek's dominance on the clay court with four French Open titles under her belt.

But Pegula's success is not just about her individual achievements; it's also a testament to the resurgence of American tennis. With players like Madison Keys and Coco Gauff making their mark on the international stage, the American tennis scene is ablaze with talent and potential.

As Pegula gears up for more challenges on the court, the question lingers – will she be the one to break barriers and set new records in the world of tennis? The stage is set, the competition is fierce, and Jessica Pegula is ready to carve her name into the annals of tennis history.

 Alejandro Tabilo won a first-round epic on Monday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, where he prevailed in a topsy-turvy deciding set to deny a Stan Wawrinka vs. Novak Djokovic clash in The Principality. 

 Facing Wawrinka on Court Rainier III, Tabilo recovered from a slow start and held his nerve after squandering a 5-3 lead in the deciding set to eventually prevail 1-6, 7-5, 7-5.

 Wawrinka, 40, was making his 15th appearance in The Principality, the fourth most in the Open Era. The 2014 champion was trying to record just his second tour-level win of the season and looked impressive at times against Tabilo, taking large cuts from both wings to overpower the Chilean in the early stages. 

 However, Tabilo refused to go away. The 27-year-old won 52 per cent of points on the Wawrinka first serve in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and earned victory on his third match point, having squandered a chance at 4-5. 



 Tabilo had not won a tour-level match on clay since Rome last year, losing eight matches in a row on the surface.  His reward for getting over the line is a meeting with two-time champion and former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic. Their only previous meeting came in Rome in 2024, when Tabilo shocked the Serbian en route to the semi-finals. 

In other early action on Day 2, Jiri Lehecka overcame Sebastian Korda 6-3, 7-6(7). The Czech is competing on clay for the first time since he advanced to the semi-finals in Madrid last season. He will take on Lorenzo Musetti after the Italian battled back to defeat Buyunchaokete.

Musetti upset Djokovic en route to the quarter-finals in Monte-Carlo in 2023, but it looked like he would be exiting early at this year's event. However, from a set-and-a-break down, the 23-year-old earned a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win against the Chinese qualifier.

Gael Monfils continued his impressive season with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 comeback win against Fabian Marozsan. The Frenchman holds a 6-2 record at ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, having reached the third round in Indian Wells and the fourth round in Miami.

 

The 38-year-old, who won the title in Auckland earlier this season, made his debut in The Principality in 2005, losing to Rafael Nadal in the first round. Still going strong 20 years later, Monfils will play seventh seed Andrey Rublev in the second round.

Daniel Altmaier shocked Jannik Sinner at Roland Garros two years ago and earned another impressive win on clay Monday when he defeated 16th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(5), 6-3 to clinch his first main-draw victory at the event. The German qualifier will next meet Richard Gasquet.

American Marcos Giron improved to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Denis Shapovalov with a 6-3, 7-6(5) win.

Australian Tennis Icon Praises Newcomer Daria Kasatkina as She Makes Waves in the Tennis World

In a shocking turn of events, Daria Kasatkina, the renowned 27-year-old tennis player, has been welcomed with open arms by Australian tennis legend Sam Stosur. The Russian-born athlete recently announced her switch in nationality, citing her opposition to the Russian government and her sexual orientation as driving factors behind this bold move.

Stosur, a former Grand Slam champion and top-ranked singles player, expressed her admiration for Kasatkina, hailing her as “one of the most liked players on tour.” The 2011 US Open singles champion commended Kasatkina's friendly demeanor and exceptional talent, emphasizing the positive impact she will have on Tennis Australia.

With her change in nationality, Kasatkina now holds the prestigious title of the highest-ranked Australian female tennis player, sparking excitement within the Australian Billie Jean King Cup team. Stosur revealed that Kasatkina is in the process of fulfilling the necessary requirements to represent Australia in the BJK Cup, a prospect that fans and teammates eagerly anticipate.

Already making waves under the Australian flag, Kasatkina showcased her prowess at the Charleston tournament, securing a resounding victory against Lauren Davis before a tough loss to Sofia Kenin in the round-of-16. As she navigates this new chapter in her career, all eyes are on Kasatkina as she blazes a trail in the tennis world, setting a new standard for excellence and sportsmanship.

Rafael Nadal's Unbelievable Triumph: The Epic Comeback That Shook the Tennis World

In a jaw-dropping reflection, Rafael Nadal revisited the 2022 Australian Open final showdown against Daniil Medvedev, where he stunned the world with a remarkable comeback. Admitting that he had doubts about his victory, Nadal showcased unparalleled resilience to clinch his second Australian Open title in a match that will go down in history.

The Spanish tennis maestro's journey to the final was nothing short of spectacular, conquering formidable opponents like Denis Shapovalov and Matteo Berrettini en route to his sixth final appearance in Melbourne. Despite facing setbacks in previous Australian Open finals, Nadal refused to let go of his dream of clinching the prestigious title.

The final match against Medvedev was a rollercoaster of emotions and intensity. Nadal found himself trailing by two sets but refused to back down. In a nail-biting turn of events, Nadal fought back from a precarious 2-3, 0-40 position in the third set, demonstrating his unwavering determination. With sheer grit and skill, he clawed his way back into the match, eventually triumphing over Medvedev with a final score of 3–6, 6–7(5), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5.

Nadal's victory not only secured his 21st Grand Slam title, propelling him to the top of the male major winners' list alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic but also solidified his status as a tennis legend. The intensity of the match was not lost on Nadal, who confessed to moments of uncertainty during the battle.

“I thought I was going to lose. But it was very important not to let myself go. I've been a player with a good capacity for self-control,” Nadal revealed. “The 4% was worth fighting for. That's always been my point of view.”

Following his historic win, Nadal embarked on a phenomenal 21-match winning streak at the start of the season, a testament to his unwavering determination and unparalleled skill on the court. His exceptional performance culminated in his 14th French Open title and 22nd Grand Slam trophy, further solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Nadal's unparalleled comeback at the 2022 Australian Open will be etched in the annals of tennis history as a testament to his indomitable spirit and unyielding resolve in the face of adversity.

As the ATP Tour embarked on the clay season, the Italian players certainly didn't waste any time proving their skills on the surface as Fabio Cobolli and Luciano Darderi claimed all the honors in tournaments in Bucharest and Marrakech respectively.

Flavio Cobolli completed a remarkable turnaround week in an otherwise very difficult 2025 season to claim his first ATP Tour title on Sunday at the Tiriac Open in the Romanian capital. Cobolli got the better of Sebastian Baez, winning 6-4, 6-4 to complete a dream title run at the clay-court ATP 250 tournament.

Cobolli's triumph in Bucharest marked a stunning turnaround of the season for the Italian, who otherwise arrived in Bucharest on the back of an eight-match tour-level losing streak.

Despite losing the final, Baez could take heart from another deep run on clay in 2025. Baez has won more tour-level matches (79) on the surface since the start of the 2022 season than any other player.

Another Italian who arrived with a poor record before a tournament was Luciano Darderi who came to Marrakech with a 2-8 tour-level record for the season. But Darderi dropped just one set throughout the tournament and claimed his second ATP Tour crown by defeating top seed Tallon Griekspoor 7-6(3), 7-6(4) in the championship final.

On the women's WTA Tour, Jessica Pegula is enjoying a superb season, and it got even better on Sunday when she won the first clay tournament of her career by beating fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-3, 7-5 to capture the Credit One Charleston Open title. Pegula has now won 17 of her last 19 matches, and recorded her 25th win of the season against Kenin. She will overtake Coco Gauff as the top-ranked U.S. player, and rise to a career-high World No. 3.

A big question on the Women's WTA Tour is if we will ever see Greek contender Maria Sakkari back to her best. The former World No 3 had a dreadful past season struggling with mental fatigue and endured a frustrating year, with early Grand Slam exits and extended losing streaks before a shoulder injury ended her season prematurely when she was forced to retire in the first round of the US Open against Wang Yafan.

"The pressure, it was a lot, being constantly chased and having to prove something to everyone," Sakkari told WTA Insider. She has already suffered comprehensive defeats this year against Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek.

At Charleston, where she reached the semi-final last year, it did not mark a turnaround for Sakkari, who crashed out of the tournament already in the second round where she lost to the Olympic champion, Qinwen Zheng, 6-4, 6-1.

On the Men's circuit, Kazakhstan's 24-year-old Alexander Shevchenko, who made his ATP debut at the 2022 Generali Open in Kitzbühel, is struggling to find the form which in February last year catapulted him into No 45 in the world rankings, his best ranking ever.

Shevchenko struggled for form over the back half of 2024 and was unable to defend the points he had earned in Basel (did not play) and Metz (first-round loss), thus finishing as World No. 78. His record in 2025 is 4-7 and he also looked out of sorts in Marrakech where he lost in two sets to the Austrian Filip Misolic in the second round. He has now dropped to 106 in the rankings. 

It's unusual you bring a dog to a winning ceremony. Nevertheless, that was the case when Jessica Pegula celebrated her first title in the clay-tournament in Charleston by holding on to her dog Maddie, a miniature Australian shepherd, when she presented the trophy. 

Pegula and her husband, Taylor Gahagen, actually brought all of their three dogs to the tournament, and she apparently tries to bring her dogs to all of her tournaments when it is possible. 

In fact, Pegula's devotion is so profound that it's permanently inked on her skin. Among her collection of tattoos, one stands out—a delicate paw print. This isn't just any tattoo; it's a tribute to her furry companions. 

Pegula's passion for dogs extends beyond her personal life into her philanthropic efforts. She and her husband, Taylor Gahagen, who share a deep love for dogs, run a charity called *A Lending Paw*. The foundation's mission is to train rescue dogs to become service animals, thus supporting both dogs and people in need. 

Jenson Brooksby captured his maiden ATP title at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Sunday with a stunning win over 2023 champion Frances Tiafoe to cap off a superb tournament that he began as a wild card in the qualifying rounds. The American also came out on top in a breathtaking rally against Tiafoe, when he under intense pressure fired a double-handed backhand winner down the line. 

Veteran Richard Gasquet beat Matteo Arnaldi 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 on Sunday to reach the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters, but the Italian had the better of Gasquet in this duel, when he, seemingly having lost the point, scraped an incredible forehand winner past the discouraged Gasquet. 

The Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006, is the first of three ATP Masters 1000 tournaments played on clay.

Top seed Zverev and second seed Alcaraz are chasing their first titles in The Principality, while Djokovic seeks tour-level trophy 100. Stefanos Tsitsipas has fond memories of Monte-Carlo, having won three of the past four editions.

The tournament has always been a favorite for players and fans due to its magnificent location at the Monte-Carlo Country Club. 

Spain's Rafael Nadal is the ultimate king of the tournament, having won 11 titles at the event, including an Open-Era record eight successive titles between 2005-2012.

Women's tennis will, for the upcoming week, be dominated by the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers, which takes players across six countries, three continents and three different surfaces.

Defending champions Italy and hosts China are automatically qualified for the finals, which will be hosted in Shenzhen, China.

In the storied history of the French Open, several legends have left their mark at Roland Garros. Max Decugis dominated the pre-Open Era, winning eight French Championships, a tournament that was then exclusive to French club members. Then we have Suzanne Lenglen, who also excelled in that period, claiming six titles. Just when you think it couldn't be topped, in the Open Era, Chris Evert emerged as the most successful woman. She secured seven French Open singles titles that stood the test of time until Rafael Nadal broke the record in 2013. Nadal eventually retired with an astonishing 14 French Open titles, and while many would think that record is safe forever, Jessica Pegula disagrees.

On Saturday, Pegula clinched her second title of the 2025 season at the Charleston Open. In an exciting all-American match against the 2020 Australian Open champion, Sofia Kenin, the 31-year-old triumphed with a 6-3, 7-5 victory. This win bumped her up to the No.3 position in WTA rankings, a feat she last achieved in October 2022. But this time, she's surpassed Coco Gauff as the new American No.1.

Following the match, Pegula sat down with Tennis Channel and spoke about her Charleston Open run. However, they took a detour from tennis to discuss a recent feat made by NHL's Alex Ovechkin, who surpassed Wayne Gretzky to become the NHL's all-time leader in goals by scoring his 895th in a 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Sunday! This prompted the interviewer to wonder: Does Jessica think someone could “break Rafa's record one day” of 14 French Open titles?

Well, Jess definitely holds out hope for it! She said, “Hey, you never know. Honestly, we always say ‘never say never.' I mean, we always think records aren't supposed to be broken, but they're meant to be broken. So, it's really cool.” And it's a possibility! We have seen records that seemed impossible to break being broken before.

For instance, Novak Djokovic's impressive 428 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 overthrew Roger's 310 weeks, demonstrating his enduring excellence alongside his 24 Grand Slam singles titles, matching Margaret Court's record. While no one has come close to Rafael Nadal's record at Roland Garros yet, a few have made big strides in this Grand Slam.

Iga Swiatek has been proving her dominance on the clay court. She is the first Pole to win a major singles title and has won four titles at the Roland Garros (2024, 2023, 2022, 2020). Alongside her 2022 US Open win, she doesn't need to prove further that she's certainly in the running to break a few records.

Coming back to Jessica, the Charleston final was her fourth appearance in the finals this season. It also marked the first all-American final in Charleston in 35 years – a feat Pegula recognized as the rise of American tennis.

Is the American tennis scene poised for a new era of dominance with Pegula at the helm?

Debate

On Saturday in the Round of 4 at the Charleston Open, Jessica Pegula beat Ekaterina Alexandrova in a thrilling match that saw her come back from a second-set loss to win 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. This victory marked her second consecutive final, after Miami, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka.

As Pegula advanced to the final in Charleston, she couldn't help but feel thrilled about facing fellow American Sofia Kenin. This all-American showdown marked the first in a Charleston final since 1990, when Martina Navratilova (who became a US citizen in 1981 took down Jennifer Capriati.

Speaking to Tennis Channel post her semifinal match, Pegula exclaimed, “That's awesome. It just shows the depth that the Americans have right now, especially on the women's side. There are so many of us, it's annoying almost!”

She's right; the American women's tennis scene is buzzing with talent. Madison Keys, for instance, won her first Grand Slam title this year, marking a significant milestone in her career. Before that, Coco Gauff made history by winning the 2023 U.S. Open at just 19 years old. Pegula is proud to be part of this dynamic group, noting, “There's just every week there's someone to root for because there's usually somebody doing good, and I'm just happy I get to be part of it.”

American tennis once dominated the sport. Navratilova's nine Wimbledon crowns stand as a testament to her grass-court supremacy, while Bill Tilden's seven US Championships titles remain unmatched by any American man. Then, there's Pete Sampras, with 14 Grand Slams under his belt, while Chris Evert's seven French Open titles remain a benchmark for American women. Not to forget, Serena Williams, with 23 Grand Slams, is the epitome of success.

Carlos Alcaraz is now in the zone for the clay court season, with the Monte-Carlo Masters up first for the Spaniard.

Alcaraz can impress on clay this season, in what is the first such season since 2002 without his compatriot and legendary figure Rafael Nadal.

The former has been handed a bye in the first round of the Monte-Carlo Masters, with Fabio Fognini or Francisco Cerundolo up in round two.

WTA star Paula Badosa loves watching Alcaraz, but the ATP number three fell to David Goffin in his first match at the Miami Open.

Elsewhere in the Sunshine Double, Alcaraz lost in the Indian Wells semi-finals to eventual champion Jack Draper.

He has now shared a verdict on his season so far, which includes one title at the Rotterdam Open, with Alcaraz saying: “I am really happy with the way I am playing.

“Since I started the year I have been playing great tennis. Tennis is not just about hitting the ball. It is about more than that. It is about mentality, physical side.

“With my game I am really happy about it. If I don't win it doesn't matter if I play well or not. People are not thinking about the opponent, they are just thinking about me.

“If I lose something is going on people say. I don't think that is fair. I am just happy and ready to play well on clay.

“A lot of people might have said we should have played better tennis or won more tournaments but I don't think that is fair.

“I think the draw in every tournament is very open and a lot of players are playing good tennis and they deserve to be there.

“There are so many players who play well on clay and on all surfaces. In the clay season I think it is going to be interesting. I see a lot of players who are capable of doing great things on clay.

“I am really happy to be here. It is a tournament I have only played [once]. I want to come here and play great. I am really excited about practising here and getting ready for my first match.”

It is not Alcaraz but Nadal that has dominated the Monte-Carlo Masters over the years, with his 11 titles more than any other player.

Alcaraz meanwhile boasts 17 ATP titles throughout his stunning career so far, eight of those have arrived on clay.

But he is now set for just his second appearance at the tournamnet, having missed the last two editions due to injury.

And in his opening match of the ATP Masters 1000 event three years ago, he lost to American Sebastian Korda.

The Brit is only the second left-handed player to reach the Top 6 on the ATP rankings this century, after the Spaniard.ByJohn BerkokPublished Apr 07, 2025 copy_link

Jack Draper didn't play any tournaments last week, but he rises from No. 7 to No. 6 on the new ATP rankings today after Casper Ruud—who didn't play last week either—drops points from reaching the semifinals in Estoril during the same week last year, and dips from No. 6 to No. 7.It's a new career-high ranking for Draper, and with that, he joins a very exclusive list: he's just the second left-handed player this century to reach the Top 6 on the ATP rankings, after Rafael Nadal.Seems hard to believe, right?Well, there have been plenty of left-handed players in the ATP Top 10 since the start of 2000—eight of them in total, including Nadal and Draper—but none of the others made it higher than No. 7.Nadal, of course, spent 209 career weeks at No. 1.LEFT-HANDED PLAYERS IN THE ATP TOP 10 THIS CENTURY:Marcelo Rios [ranked as high as No. 7 in 2000]Mariano Puerta [career-high No. 9 in 2005]Rafael Nadal [career-high No. 1 in 2008]Fernando Verdasco [career-high No. 7 in 2009]Jurgen Melzer [career-high No. 8 in 2011]Denis Shapovalov [career-high No. 10 in 2020]Cameron Norrie [career-high No. 8 in 2022]Jack Draper [career-high No. 6 in 2025]The last time a left-handed player other than Nadal or Draper was in the Top 6 of the ATP rankings was the week of November 1st, 1999, when another Brit—Greg Rusedski—spent his last week at No. 6.

To add to the stat's uniqueness, Draper isn't even a lefty in real life, as he described after his semifinal win over Carlos Alcaraz at Indian Wells.“I think, weirdly enough, my leftiness is a big plus, but I think the fact that I'm actually a right-hander, I think that really helps me, because my forehand has been improving all the time,” he said. “My forehand is naturally the shot where, you know, I'm not as comfortable. It's always been my backhand that has been the shot, like, I can hit with my eyes closed, you know. I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand. Usually that's something where players struggle. But with me, that's a big strength of mine.“I think the mix of that is a big advantage.”The 23-year-old is the No. 5 seed in Monte Carlo this week, with a bye into the second round. He has nothing to defend at the first Masters 1000 clay-court event of the year, having fallen in the first round a year ago.

There are also a lot of notable ranking moves for Americans this week, starting with former No. 33 Jenson Brooksby, who soars from No. 507 to No. 172 after capturing the first ATP title of his career in Houston, where he came back from match point down in three matches en route to the final.On the WTA rankings, Jessica Pegula rises from No. 4 back to her career-high of No. 3—switching spots with Coco Gauff—after winning the first clay-court title of her career on the green clay of Charleston.Meanwhile, up-and-coming American lefty Robin Montgomery makes her Top 100 debut, rising from No. 105 to No. 100 after a second-round showing in Charleston, where she fell to Danielle Collins.And last but certainly not least, probably the biggest surprise of the week: 16-year-old Californian Julieta Pareja soars more than 200 spots from No. 550 to No. 335 after a breakthrough run in Bogota, Colombia, where she made it all the way to the semifinals in her first WTA main draw.She had been a wild card into qualifying, too.Pareja was the youngest player to reach a WTA semifinal since Coco Gauff won the first WTA title of her career as a 15-year-old in Linz in 2019.

In the summer of 2004, Anastasia Myskina lifted the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen and made history. By winning Roland Garros, she became the first Russian woman to claim a Grand Slam singles title. This milestone would open the floodgates for a new generation of talent from her country, including players like Maria Sharapova. But while others went on to global stardom, Myskina's time at the top was surprisingly brief.

Known for her quick footwork, aggressive baseline play, and feisty demeanor on court, Myskina started her pro career in 1999. By 2003, she cracked the top 10 and was seen as one of the leaders of a growing Russian movement in women's tennis.

However, when she arrived in Paris for the French Open in 2004, she was far from being considered the favorite to win the title. In her previous 16 Grand Slam appearances, she hadn't reached the last eight. However, in a formidable run, she defeated her compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in a tough match in the semifinals, before facing another Russian, Elena Dementieva, in the big final.

“I can't believe it!” she expressed after the final, after she made history. That year, she helped Russia secure its first Fed Cup title and reached the semifinals in the Olympic games. That season, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2. It was a successful season all around, and she was named, alongside Roger Federer, singles World champion by the ITF.

What followed her breakout year was a puzzling decline. In 2005, she suffered from a shoulder injury in Charleston, as well as off-court pressures, such as her mother being diagnosed with cancer, according to ESPN.

When it came to defending her French Open title, she became the first champion to lose in the opening round, after being defeated by Spain's Maria Sanchez Lorenzo 6-4, 4-6, 6-0. It was just one of many disappointing results, and she ended the season outside of the Top 10 for the first time in three years.

She later acknowledged how deeply this affected her ability and motivation to compete at the highest level. “I just have no confidence. I hit the ball and it just goes off the court… I have no explanation, really… no. Right now when the ball comes to me I just don't know what to do,” she told the press after being eliminated from the French Open, crying (via CNN).

The following year, she was attempting a comeback. “I give one more chance to myself this year to do well, and I have a goal,” she told the press in 2006, cited by ESPN. However, she suffered from a foot injury and couldn't make an impact.

By 2007, at just 25 years old, Myskina played her last match but never announced an official retirement. There was no farewell tour, no major announcement. One of the sport's most significant champions simply faded from view. In total, she won 10 WTA titles and $5.6 million in prize money. 

Since retiring, Myskina has kept a low profile. She has worked occasionally in tennis commentary for Russian television and has been involved in some coaching, as well as Fed Cup captain, and ambassadorial roles. But mostly, she has focused on her personal life, including raising her three sons.

“It's a very tough job, but you learn how to understand the needs and wants of a child. You know how to help them,” she said about motherhood to Indian Express in 2018. “You become patient and that always helps you deal with the problems a player goes through. The only thing is that you can help them only when they are off court.”

Still, her legacy remains. Myskina's win at Roland Garros signaled the arrival of Russian women's tennis on the global stage. Within a few years, Maria Sharapova, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Dinara Safina would all reach Grand Slam finals — with several winning titles of their own.

“Sometimes I think seven years was not enough, but they were a good seven years,” Myskina told Indian Express. However, she also acknowledged that she wasn't considering any comebacks.

In many ways, Anastasia Myskina's story runs counter to what we expect from champions. She didn't chase every record or extend her career for longevity's sake. She won big, then walked away. But for those who remember 2004 and her place in Russia's tennis tradition, Myskina's place in history is secure.

NBA legend and NASCAR team co-owner Michael Jordan commented on his partner Denny Hamlin ahead of Sunday's Goodyear 400 at Darlington Raceway. Comparing himself to the driver, Jordan admits that "his competitive juice is no different than mine."

Jordan, currently estimated to have a net worth of $3.5 billion according to Forbes, partnered with Hamlin to start 23XI Racing, a team which now boasts three talented drivers in Bubba Wallace, Tyler Reddick, and Riley Herbst. During Fox's pre-race coverage at Darlington last weekend, Jordan discussed Hamlin with Jamie Little.

"He is a clown, but that's him," Jordan said with a smile. "That's Denny. He's a very confident driver. He is a very confident person. His competitive juice is no different than mine."

This comes off Hamlin's victory at Martinsville, where he outdrove Christopher Bell and Bubba Wallace to his 56th career win after starting fifth. Upon taking the chequered flag, the driver unravelled a flag that read, "11 Against the World."

 "I mean, I love that he's gotten back to winning and, you know, he wants - I want him to win a championship so badly because I think he's earned that, you know, because of what he's done for the sport for so long. And he's gonna grind it out.

"That's just the way Denny is and if you boo him, that makes him better. You know, you boo me, that makes me better. I mean, that's just the nature of a good competitor."

Following Hamlin's win, the driver spoke about his performance.

“There's two people I really love right now: my pit crew and Kyle Larson," he joked. “Had a little assist there, so thank you. The pit crew just did an amazing job.

"They won it last week [at Martinsville]. They won it this week. It's all about them.

"Thanks Sport Clips. They have such a big deal here in Darlington, South Carolina ... We'll see you at Victory Lane."

With only four laps before the chequered flag, a caution flag was dropped after Kyle Larson's #4 car was spun by Wallace. Hamlin was able to capitalise on this, taking his second Cup Series win of the season.

As reported by Jeff Gluck of The Athletic, Larson's crew chief Cliff Daniels said his driver felt bad after his involvement in the crash:

"We didn't catch Kyle Larson before he left, but Cliff Daniels said Kyle told him he felt bad about being part of the last caution. They were trying to stay out of the way of the leaders and stay low, and Larson checked up early to make sure he didn't get into Reddick, but Bubba didn't know Larson was going to slow down that much."

There were contrasting fortunes for the Williams drivers in Japan as Alex Albon bagged more points with a P9 finish, while Carlos Sainz was unable to match the feat in 14th.

While on paper Albon should have been the happier of the two, during the race things were quite different. He sounded frustrated on the radio in the early stages of the race thanks to an upshift issue, and later questioned the team's strategy in leaving him out longer than some of his rivals.

But on a day where the undercut did not prove potent, that strategy choice did not affect his finishing position, the Thai driver coming home where he started in ninth.

“We've been experimenting with shift settings all weekend and we thought we'd finally landed on something we were happy with,” Albon explained. "Turns out, it actually felt much better in Qualifying than it did in the race.

Albon bagged more points for Williams in Japan 

“The car wasn't easy to drive in the conditions either. In practice on Friday, the wind suited us more, but it was completely different today. We still scored points though. It just shows that even on days when we're not that optimal, we're able to score points. In that sense, I'm very happy.”

Albon tops the midfield runners in the Drivers' Championship, in seventh place with 18 points. He is ahead of Lewis Hamilton, and only two points behind the other Ferrari of Charles Leclerc.

Sainz, however, only has one point to his name, earned when he was promoted to the top 10 following the three disqualifications in China.

His race in Japan was made more difficult than it could have been thanks to the grid penalty he picked up for impeding in Qualifying. Starting P15, he ran a long first stint on the mediums and switched to the soft tyres late on.

But while he did manage a few overtakes, he could not climb back towards the top 10.

Sainz was unable to climb back through the field from a lowly grid slot on Sunday

“Unfortunately, as expected, it was a difficult race stuck in traffic after a costly Saturday, with some details to polish in Qualifying and then the penalty,” he said afterwards.

“On a positive note, I think the pace was there today. I was comfortable with the car, managed to do some good overtakes and overall learnt a lot out there on track.

“Now the focus is to carry the positive feeling of this weekend on to the next [races] and build from here. Once I start putting everything together, I know better results will come.”

HIGHLIGHTS: Catch up on Verstappen's stellar victory at the Japanese Grand Prix

Sainz added that he is giving himself “the first quarter of the season” to fully get to grips with his new car, which would mean he expects results to improve after Miami. By then he will have driven on a range of different tracks in varying conditions.

But in such a tight midfield, Williams will be hoping he can get up to speed as soon as possible, with a chance this year of a big result in the Teams' Championship.

Winning racer and championship-winning team owner ‘Shige' Hattori has died. Hattori was involved in a three-car traffic accident on Saturday morning. The tragic incident took place around 9:15 a.m. EST on I-77 northbound in Mecklenburg County, about 30 minutes north of Charlotte, North Carolina. He was driving a 2025 Toyota Crown when he crossed the center line, colliding with oncoming traffic. Everyone else involved suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

The Huntersville Police Department confirmed Hattori's passing and the details of the crash on Monday morning. Speeding or impairment were not believed to have been factors in the tragic accident, which remains under investigation. 

Hailing from Okayama, Japan, Hattori moved to the States in 1995 as he branched out into the American open-wheel racing scene. He competed full-time as an Indy Lights driver for three years, winning twice during the 1998 season at Homestead-Miami Speedway and Gateway.

He graduated to CART and IndyCar in the years to follow, driving for various teams and starting over two dozen races. His tenure in CART was tumultuous, but he improved mightily as an IndyCar driver. His career included three Indianapolis 500 attempts, making the iconic race twice in both 2002 and 2003, finishing as high as 20th. His best showing in IndyCar came while driving for Bradley Motorsports, finishing sixth at Texas Motor Speedway during the 2002 season.

However, Hattori's motorsports journey then took him from open-wheel racing to stock cars around 2004. Competing with Germain Racing in the NASCAR Truck Series, he struggled to acclimate and crashed out in six of the ten races he started. But this was not the end of his NASCAR experiment. 

His true impact on the sport would come a few years later as he ventured into team ownership. Hattori Racing Enterprises was established in 2008 and started actively competing in both the NASCAR Xfinity and Truck Series in 2013. He brought new sponsors into the sport and gave opportunities to future Cup stars like Alex Bowman and Ross Chastain. While the organization never placed higher than fifth in an Xfinity Series race, Hattori's NASCAR operation reached stunning heights in the Truck Series.

The race team won a total of 14 Truck races with Brett Moffitt and Austin Hill, but their crowning achievement came in 2018. Moffitt led the team to the Championship 4, beating Noah Gragson and Kyle Busch Motorsports to win the NASCAR Truck Series title. Hattori's team moved away from full-time competition in 2023, only running a partial schedule in recent years, but his impact on the sport's lower divisions has been immense.

The team reacted to Shige's tragic passing with the following statement: "We are heartbroken to confirm that Shigeaki "Shige" Hattori was pronounced deceased on the morning of Saturday, April 5, in Huntersville, N.C., following a motor vehicle accident. He was 61. A native of Okayama, Japan, Shige moved to the United States in the 1990s to pursue his dream of becoming an open-wheel race car driver. He won two INDY NXT by Firestone races and made two starts in the Indianapolis 500.

"His passion for motorsports ultimately led him to NASCAR, where he competed in the NASCAR Truck Series (NCTS) in 2004 and 2005. He transitioned to team ownership in 2008 and founded Hattori Racing Enterprises (HRE). He won 14 NCTS races as a team owner and reached the ultimate achievement by winning the 2018 series championship. Shige was known for his relentless drive, focus and competitive spirit. Team ownership through HRE and Hattori Motorsports had become both his passion and his life's work. He had a unique gift to constantly inject a light-hearted attitude and one-of-a-kind sense of humor into his race teams that will never be forgotten.

"We'll miss you dearly. Farewell, Shige."

“Shigeaki Hattori was a passionate racer and highly successful team owner, but beyond all his team's statistics – which includes a NASCAR Truck Series championship – Shige was a genuine, beloved member of the garage who worked tirelessly to lift our sport and his people. We are deeply saddened by his tragic passing. NASCAR extends its thoughts and prayers to his family and many friends.”

“Everyone at Toyota and TRD, U.S.A. is saddened to learn of Shige Hattori's tragic passing. Toyota's history with Shige spans decades. Through his long run as a driver to his history-making championship success as an owner, Shige's motivation and work ethic to achieve at the highest level never wavered. His endearing personality was infectious and unforgettable. We are thinking of his family and friends as they process this terrible loss.”

MotoGP's race direction has given Motorsport.com an in-depth analysis of the chaos that unfolded on the Grand Prix of the Americas starting grid in unstable weather conditions.

The Austin event called for quick thinking given several things failed to go as planned – including the safety car crashing into the barriers just 45 minutes before the race start, although this particular incident had no influence on what subsequently happened.

As per the rules, the pitlane opened 25 minutes before the start, at a time when the track was drying but still lightly drizzling. All riders were free to complete one or several laps – going through the pitlane – for five minutes, before taking their spots on the grid; Fabio Quartararo crashed then.

As the United States anthem was played just seven minutes before the start, the rain had stopped, the temperature had risen, and the track was quickly drying. Most riders realised they were about to start the race at a disadvantage, as their bikes were set up for a wet track with wet-weather tyres. Only Brad Binder, Enea Bastianini and Ai Ogura gambled on slick rubber – all from the sixth row of the grid.

A now-viral video clip shows that Marc Marquez was not only thinking about a bike swap but also how to minimise his rivals' reaction time. He could have started from pole with slick tyres and a wet set-up, but opted to run back to the pits and grab his alternate GP24, with him and his Ducati squad incorrectly assuming he would have to start the race from the back, not be given a ride-through penalty.

“The riders who leave the grid and change tyre types at this moment (from wet to dry or vice versa) must start the warm-up lap from the pitlane, take their qualifying position on the grid, and serve a ride-through penalty when directed by race direction,” as per Article 1.18.7 of the regulations.

Watch: Watch Marc Marquez decide on his grid gamble

Article 1.18.7 was tweaked after Jack Miller was alone on pole at the 2018 Argentine Grand Prix while the remainder of the field lined up at the back at Termas de Rio Hondo.

“It was adjusted because neither the organisation nor the infrastructure is prepared for a large number of riders to swap bikes just before the race and then take positions at the back of the grid," race director Mike Webb told Motorsport.com.

"That's why it was decided that each rider would start from their position and the penalty would come afterward."

Marquez proved to be so influential that many riders followed his lead, running across to the pitlane. In other words, it was chaos with under one minute before the formation lap.

As safety was compromised, race direction aborted the start with a red flag – which wiped the slate clean and, as a consequence, was detrimental to Binder, Bastianini and Ogura.

“The red flag was shown for safety reasons,” Webb said. “When Marc ran to his box, nearly half the grid followed him.

“In those conditions, with so many people and bikes moving around the grid and pitlane, it simply wasn't safe to start the race. We couldn't even close the pitwall gates because of the number of people there.”

At this point, one might wonder whether a ‘start delayed' protocol would have been fairer for all riders, but Webb argued that reordering the grid afterwards was unrealistic.

“We decided to show the red flag and restart the procedure because we thought it was the safest and clearest option,” he detailed.

“If we had gone with ‘start delayed', to follow the regulation we would have had to move riders who left the pitlane to the back of the grid, taking us back to Argentina 2018, where it proved unfeasible.”

After a 10-minute delay, the quick-start procedure was implemented, and the lights went out.

Race leader Marquez crashed out on lap nine; Francesco Bagnaia eventually secured his first victory of the season, and second-placed Alex Marquez took the lead in the standings.

From everything that unfolded in Texas, Webb drew one clear conclusion: “What happened in Austin is unprecedented, but it will lead us to review parts of the regulations – mainly to simplify them so that everyone involved understands them clearly.”

Liam Lawson attempted to take the positives from a disappointing Racing Bulls return at the Japanese Grand Prix after finishing 17th while rookie team mate Isack Hadjar bagged points in P8.

Lawson replaced Yuki Tsunoda at Racing Bulls in Japan, after Red Bull elected to swap the pair, following a challenging opening two weekends of the season for the New Zealander.

With the Racing Bulls car believed to have characteristics which make it more user friendly, it was hoped that Lawson would demonstrate some of the pace he had shown towards the end of 2024, which had earned him the initial Red Bull call up.

Although he escaped the first phase of Qualifying for the first time this year and outqualified Tsunoda – starting 13th on the grid – he fell back in the race after attempting to go longer than most on his first stint.

“That was basically it, there's not much more to say,” reflected Lawson. “We went really long and I guess tried something and it just didn't really work.

"It was a tough start anyway – Lap 1 was pretty tricky, but I think we'll obviously learn from that.”

Suzuka was event one of the first triple-header of the F1 season, with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia following in the coming weeks, meaning Lawson will have ample opportunity to demonstrate his progress.

Asked about the key takeaways for the next two outings, he added: “Keep building, obviously getting used to the car and pushing it.

Racing Bulls tried an alternate strategy with Lawson that failed to produce results

“We had good pace throughout the weekend, [but] unfortunately not when we needed to. There are always positives to take away from it.”

Lawson is currently 18th in the Drivers' standings, and is one of five drivers yet to register a point, alongside Pierre Gasly, Fernando Alonso, Jack Doohan and Gabriel Bortoleto.

Fernando Alonso has compared Suzuka to Monaco in terms of being a Formula 1 race that is basically won on a Saturday during qualifying.

Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix saw a dearth of overtaking as the spectacle failed to spark into an entertaining race with Max Verstappen winning from pole.

It is something that has become an issue in recent years at Suzuka in the same way that Monaco has been highlighted as a race where success is determined by a driver's starting position.

F1 will be hoping the Monaco issue is now set to be solved after it introduced two mandatory pitstops for the 2025 grand prix.

But Alonso, who finished 11th for Aston Martin on Sunday, fears Suzuka may have now gone the same way as the race in Monte Carlo.

“This is Suzuka, I don't remember a race when we saw too many overtakes here without the weather changing,” said the two-time F1 world champion.

“It seems like we repeat always on Thursday, how great Suzuka is, how great Monaco is, the glamour, the spectacular weekend.

“And then on Sunday, we wake up and we say: ‘Monaco is boring. What can we do to the track?' ‘Suzuka is boring.' This is Formula 1, and Suzuka is great, because Saturday is incredibly high adrenaline.”

Speaking after the race, Ferrari boss Frederic Vasseur said this season could become a “quali world championship” if the trend of struggling to overtake seen in both China and Japan continues.

In what is the final year of the current regulations, there has not only been a convergence in car design but simultaneously teams have also found ways around rules that were originally introduced to promote more overtaking.

Across 2024 there were 70 fewer overtakes than a year earlier, despite there being two extra grands prix. All four races in 2025 meanwhile (three grands prix and one sprint) have been won from pole.

Maybe one stop was not the race that we were hoping for,” added Alonso on Sunday's grand prix. “In the past with multiple stops, maybe the tyres are different but when we don't have grip, we complain that there is no grip and when we have too many stops.

“We complain the tyres don't last, so instead of seeing the negative part of the weekend I try to enjoy what we experienced this weekend.”

Suzuka began an F1 triple-header with this weekend being the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Saudi Arabia next week.

Could McLaren have prevented Max Verstappen's stunning victory around Suzuka?

Superficially it certainly looked like that, as Lando Norris – who had been running just 1.5s behind the Red Bull as the first stops approached – was brought in on the same lap. Although Norris got partly alongside on the pit exit, he was forced to yield to Verstappen and never got so close again in this one-stop race.

Carlos Sainz has been fined €20,000, with €10,000 of that suspended, by the FIA stewards for being late for the national anthem ahead of Formula 1's Japanese Grand Prix.

The Williams driver was late to the Japanese national anthem on the grid due to a stomach upset and was visiting a doctor at the track ahead of the race.

According to the FIA, Sainz was "not in place for the national anthem at the specified time of 1344hrs" before the Suzuka race, breaching Article 19.4 b) of the regulations.

The driver has been given a €20,000 fine, with €10,000 suspended for a 12-month period.

Sainz received the fine despite being examined by Dr. Messina of Med-Ex, who verified his stomach issues prior to the race, adding that they administered medication.

The mitigating circumstances meant that the usual penalty of €60,000 was reduced.

"The driver arrived at the national anthem position after the anthem had commenced," the stewards noted in their explanation.

"During the drivers' briefing on Friday all drivers were reminded of the requirement to be in position by the time prescribed in the regulations and the need to show respect for the host country's anthem.

"Displaying respect for the national anthem is a high priority and all parties need to consider every eventuality in planning to be in position for the anthem by the required time."

Sainz, who started 15th after a three-place grid penalty for impeding Lewis Hamilton in qualifying, finished the Japanese GP in 14th place for Williams.

Last weekend in MotoGP, Marc Marquez was shown talking to his Ducati mechanics during the United States national anthem at the Americas GP, but wasn't penalised given it is not part of the MotoGP regulations.

William Byron's performance at Darlington Raceway was one rarely seen in modern NASCAR, absolutely dominating the majority of the race. Byron led every lap in Stage 1 and Stage 2, going on to lead the first 243 (of 297 total) laps, without a single lead change.

The last time a driver led every single lap in a Cup race was Jeff Burton almost 25 years ago, but Byron's chance of completing the NASCAR version of a no-hitter did not pan out the way he hoped it would.

Despite a shocking show of dominance, all it took was one round of green-flag pit stops to unravel Byron's advantage.

No one passed him on track, but Byron fell back to third as Tyler Reddick and Christopher Bell pulled off the ‘undercut', through the cycle of green flag pit stops. Now in traffic for the first time, Byron struggled to make forward progress. He ended up losing more spots to Ryan Blaney and eventual race winner Denny Hamlin, who both had fresher tires after running long in the previous run.

A late-race caution paved the way for Byron to find a way back up to second, but it was still a bitter loss after showcasing such dominant speed from the 24 car.

"First off, really proud of my team, bringing that level of effort and preparation, have a car like that," said Byron. "For us to execute like that, it was looking like it was going to be a perfect race. We were going to lead every lap. Was really proud of that.

"Those guys could be aggressive on the other side of the green flag cycle, we lost control there. Once we lost control, too late in the going to kind of get back up there. Yeah, it sucks. I'm sure it will sting a lot tonight. There's still a lot of positives. It stings in the moment, for sure."

Byron, who won the season-opening Daytona 500, continues to lead the championship standings with a 49-point advantage over his closest competition.

Ryan Blaney was one of the fastest drivers at Darlington, but in the end, circumstances prevented him from reaching Victory Lane. It seemed like every time the Team Penske driver got near the lead, something would happen that would put him deeper in the field. Here's how Blaney managed to salvage fifth, despite it all.

First, there was an untimely caution in the middle of green-flag pit stops during the second stage of the race. Blaney pitted from third but ended up back in 14th, due to a caution for debris from Brad Keselowski's loose wheel. He fought back quickly, charging back up to fourth by the end of the stage.

Bad luck wasn't done with him yet, as a slow pit stop dropped Blaney all the way down to 20th.

Blaney once again marched through the field and made sure to have fresher tires than most of the leaders for the final run to the finish, pitting later than most. It paid off perfectly, quickly making up ground before finally catching race leader Tyler Reddick. He made the pass for the win with four laps to go, only for misfortune to rear its ugly head once more.

A sudden caution for Kyle Larson, who was more than 160 laps down, pushed the race into overtime. On pit road, Blaney lost the lead and never recovered, finishing a disappointing fifth. 

Blaney's reaction to the final caution: "Oh no. I thought we finally had the race won... We did a good job. Great strategy call of kind of running long, giving us time to get down, run down the 45, a lot of those guys that short pitted. It was a great call."

Blaney had the car to win at Darlington, but he never had the right amount of luck. "Never really got to control the race. I feel like nothing ever really went our way. Pit road, we got to work on a little bit. Caution coming out during the cycle set us way back. I felt like we just kept making up spots.

"Really proud of the 12 folks for giving me a fast car. Just really wasn't meant to be. I really wanted and would have liked to have won here. That would have been really neat. Just wasn't meant to be. Proud of the effort. We'll keep plugging along."

Plus, Drake's "Nokia" bounds to No. 3 on the Hot 100 after the premiere of its official video.

Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” tops the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart for a seventh total and consecutive week. The single, whose title shouts out late R&B crooner Luther Vandross, who is sampled on the track, became Lamar's sixth No. 1 and SZA's third. Lamar and SZA each extend their longest career Hot 100 reigns with the song.


	Meanwhile, “Luther” links the longest Hot 100 command for a rap hit in more than four years, since 24kGoldn's “Mood,” featuring iann dior, led for eight weeks in 2020-21. The only longer domination for a rap hit this decade: 11 weeks, for Roddy Ricch's “The Box” in 2020. (Rap titles are defined as those that have hit or are eligible for Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart.)


	Additionally, “Luther” ascends to the top of the Radio Songs chart, becoming Lamar's third No. 1 – and first in a lead role – and SZA's second on the all-format airplay ranking.


	Plus, Drake's “Nokia” bounds 7-3 on the Hot 100 following the March 31 premiere of its official video. He rings up his record-extending 42nd top five hit (and record-padding 31st top three hit).


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated April 12, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, April 8. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Luther,” on pgLang/Interscope/ICLG, totaled 61 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 5% week-over-week), 24.4 million official streams (down 7%) and 2,000 sold (down 13%) in the U.S. March 28-April 3.


	The collaboration rises a spot to the top of the Radio Songs chart, marking Lamar's third No. 1, and first in a lead role, and SZA's second. Lamar previously led as featured on Taylor Swift's “Bad Blood” (for five weeks beginning in July 2015) and Maroon 5's “Don't Wanna Know” (for eight weeks starting in December 2016). SZA's “Snooze” spent three weeks at No. 1 in October 2023.


	“Luther” concurrently holds for a sixth week atop Streaming Songs and dips 15-21, after reaching No. 4, on Digital Song Sales. “Luther” is the first hit to top Radio Songs and Streaming Songs simultaneously this year; Shaboozey last accomplished the feat with “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” last October (when it tripled up, also leading Digital Song Sales).


	Meanwhile, “Luther” makes for a win among rap hits atop Radio Songs, becoming an increasingly rare track to have hit No. 1 on both Radio Songs and Hot Rap Songs. Thirty titles topped both charts in the 2000s; eight did so in the '10s; and six have so far in the ‘20s. The previous five this decade: Jack Harlow's “Lovin On Me” (2023-24); Doja Cat's “Paint the Town Red” (2023); Harlow's “First Class” (2022); Latto's “Big Energy” (2022); and 24kGoldn's “Mood” (2020-21).


	“Luther” concurrently adds a 15th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts.


	Drake flips “Nokia” from No. 7 to a new No. 3 high on the Hot 100. It drew 21.5 million streams, up 11%, March 28-April 3, with its official video having premiered March 31. It's also up 45% to 15.4 million in airplay audience and 54% to 6,000 sold.


	The track becomes Drake's record-extending 42nd top five Hot 100 hit. Here's a look at the acts with the most such entries over the chart's 66-year history. (Upon its No. 10 debut in March, “Nokia” became his record-boosting 80th top 10.)


Most Top Five Hot 100 Hits:


	“Nokia” is also Drake's record-extending 31st song to hit the Hot 100's top three. Here's a look at the acts with the most gold, silver and bronze medals combined.


Most Top Three Hot 100 Hits:


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 2, following five nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” slips 3-4 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July. It adds a milestone 40th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart (where only one hit has led longer: Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line's “Meant To Be”: 50 weeks in 2017-18).


	Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” keeps at its No. 5 Hot 100 best.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 – and became the year's No. 1 song – repeats at No. 6. It notches an 85th week on the survey overall, the fourth-longest stay in the chart's history, below only Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” (91 weeks, in 2021-22); The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” (90 weeks, 2019-22); and Imagine Dragons' “Radioactive” (87 weeks, 2012-14).


	ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” ascends 10-7 on the Hot 100, after hitting No. 3.


	Morgan Wallen boasts two songs in the Hot 100's top 10, back-to-back: “Just in Case” drops to No. 8 a week after it debuted at No. 4 and “I'm the Problem” lifts 11-9, after it launched at its No. 2 best in February.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Billie Eilish's “Birds of a Feather” rises 12-10, after reaching No. 2. It tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Alternative Songs charts for a 35th week each.

Clairo is just living life freely. In a new cover story interview with Seventeen, the Charm star opened up about why she'd rather not place a label on her identity as a queer person.


	“I don't care for labels at all. I believe people should like who they want and no one should have a problem with it,” she told the magazine. “I've had a better experience with my queerness once I just shut the fuck up and let it happen to me. If I date a girl, I date a girl. If I date a guy, I date a guy.”


	She added: “I also understand that people benefit from drawing a hard line for themselves — having a clear path is also important. It varies person to person. Being queer is a huge part of who I am. I felt so free once I understood that I love anybody and everybody. I'll kiss anyone.”


	In the interview, Clairo joked about taking the “Am I gay?” tests and that she wished she could tell her younger self she doesn't “need a definite answer” on who and what she likes. “I can still be curious, date, and kiss who I want,” she said. “I don't have to wake up and decide who I am by a certain day. That was the first time in my life that I had to be OK with not having an answer.”

	In a response to a question about how her relationship with queerness has shifted over the years after she came out as bisexual in a 2018 tweet, Clairo told Seventeen: “It's really beautiful. It feels good to be queer.”

	 Several years later, the musician told Rolling Stone that she felt that “people knew that about me” already.”


	“I am not trying to take up tons of space in the community, so I don't always want to talk about it. That doesn't mean that my experience isn't important, it just means that someone can explain it with more grace and understanding than I can,” she said in 2021. “It's odd that I didn't really explore that very much in this record.”

Paul Schrader is speaking out about recent allegations of assault and harassment by a former assistant made public last week. The auteur previously denied the bulk of the allegations on April 4, but did confirm that two allegedly consensual kisses occurred with his then-26-year-old assistant between December 2023 and May 2024. On the morning of April 7, Schrader sent an email unpacking the allegations to various members of the press and other industry professionals and personal friends, which IndieWire has obtained. (You can read the full email below.)

 










The assistant filed a motion April 3 in New York State Supreme Court under the moniker “Jane Doe,” alleging that Schrader was in breach of contract for violating the terms of the settlement over the past assault accusations.

“You may have read that my former assistant filed a lawsuit making some allegations about me. I am writing because you are important to me and I want you to hear from me directly about this subject,” Schrader wrote. “Out of the blue, in the fall of last year, a lawyer I had never heard of, representing my former assistant, sent me a letter demanding that I pay my former assistant millions of dollars or she would go public with sensational, false, and misleading accusations about our relationship and my conduct via a lawsuit. I understood that the mere assertion of such accusations would be damaging and hurtful.”

He continued, “As a result, I nearly committed to settling the claims by paying a small fraction of the amount that had been initially demanded to avoid the hurt and harm that the publicity surrounding a lawsuit with these kinds of false and misleading accusations would cause, to say nothing of the cost of litigation. Upon reflection, I changed my mind, which I believe I was legally entitled to do, and declined to sign the written settlement agreement the lawyers had prepared. I refused to bow to the coercion created by what I regard as unwarranted and opportunistic claims and resolved to defend myself.”

As stated in the legal claim, Doe and Schrader's respective lawyers reached a settlement in February 2025, with the payment to be issued in increments across seven months. However, Doe's lawyer Menaka Fernando alleged that Schrader's attorney told their team that Schrader had done some “soul searching” after being ill and opted to not go forward with the payment to Doe for the amount agreed upon. 

 










Schrader now details how he believes Doe's lawsuit was filed “for a quick money grab.” He noted that Doe did not sue for sexual harassment, but instead took legal action to “enforce against me the settlement agreement I declined to sign — even though the agreement says clearly that it would not be effective unless both Plaintiff and I signed it.”

Schrader deemed the details of Doe's motion to be “gratuitous” in its inclusion of “sensational, false, and misleading accusations” ranging from alleging that Schrader “trapped” Doe in his Cannes hotel room while there for the premiere of his film, “Oh, Canada,” as well as wearing an open bathrobe with his genitals exposed. Doe worked as Schrader's production assistant from May 2021 to September 2024, when she was allegedly terminated (Schrader contests the details of this, below). The motion claims Schrader “used his position of power over Ms. Doe (who is 52 years younger than him) to force her to work in a sexually hostile, intimidating, and humiliating environment on a daily, if not hourly, basis.” 

He also added that after drinking together at Cannes, he did kiss Doe but after she “indicated displeasure,” he “never attempted to kiss her again” and apologized.

“I am not a mind reader, but I believe that the accusations were included as a tactic — to bully me into writing a check. If that is their plan, it will not succeed,” Schrader wrote. “The lawsuit labors to create a false impression about my character and my interactions with her. It also rewrites history, in a desperate attempt to transform our relationship of more than three years, which consisted of Plaintiff's diligent work and very willing non-sexual companionship, into something unwelcome, coercive and odious to her. Nothing could be further from the truth.”

 










He continued, “To be absolutely clear: I never had sex in any form with Plaintiff. Nor did I ever attempt such a thing — period. I never exposed myself to Plaintiff — at any time. Our most physically ‘intimate' experiences together consisted of two kisses on the lips, which occurred months apart. We also often kissed one another on the cheek in gestures of greeting and farewell. … Her lawsuit tries to paint a very different picture — one that isn't true.”

In the email, Schrader shared that Doe was not terminated, but rather demoted due to both his own reduced professional needs and her personal family leave. Schrader noted that, after having completed his most recent film, he did not need for a full-time assistant. (Schrader previously posted on Facebook in early 2024 to announce he was looking to employ an assistant for one feature.) According to Schrader, Doe had since relocated to Arizona to care for her ailing grandfather. 

Rather than eliminating Doe's position, Schrader reduced her pay by approximately 50 percent “even though she was not doing much work for me,” in hopes that Doe would return to full-time work on his next feature. “I also emphasized to her that if she was ready to move on in her career, she should do so and would have my unqualified encouragement,” Schrader wrote. “Within a few months of this reduction in pay, I heard for the first time about the grievances detailed in the demand letter, which have been partially published in the lawsuit papers.”

 










In contrast, Doe's motion alleges Doe was fired for refusing Schrader's advances.

Schrader concluded, “I understand that in the current climate a defendant accused of sexual harassment is often presumed guilty in the court of public opinion without the fairness of due process — unless and until the defendant proves his or her innocence. But that presumption is not always true. It is not true in this case. I have nothing to hide about my conduct — and that includes my decision not to yield to the pressure of my former assistant's threat to make her sensational allegations public, a threat that she and her lawyers have now executed. If this case ever makes it to trial, I will be honest with the judge and jury who I am confident will see the truth.”

You may have read that my former assistant filed a lawsuit making some allegations about me. I am writing because you are important to me and I want you to hear from me directly about this subject.

I refused to bow to the coercion created by what I regard as unwarranted and opportunistic claims and resolved to defend myself.
 










Plaintiff has now filed suit, apparently hoping against hope for a quick money grab. She hasn't sued for sexual harassment; she has sued to enforce against me the settlement agreement I declined to sign — even though the agreement says clearly that it would not be effective unless both Plaintiff and I signed it.

Although her lawsuit is for breach of the settlement agreement draft, it gratuitously includes some of the sensational, false, and misleading accusations that were contained in her demand letter. I am not a mind reader, but I believe that the accusations were included as a tactic — to bully me into writing a check. If that is their plan, it will not succeed. The lawsuit labors to create a false impression about my character and my interactions with her. It also rewrites history, in a desperate attempt to transform our relationship of more than three years, which consisted of Plaintiff's diligent work and very willing non-sexual companionship, into something unwelcome, coercive and odious to her. Nothing could be further from the truth.

To be absolutely clear: I never had sex in any form with Plaintiff. Nor did I ever attempt such a thing — period. I never exposed myself to Plaintiff — at any time. Our most physically “intimate” experiences together consisted of two kisses on the lips, which occurred months apart. We also often kissed one another on the cheek in gestures of greeting and farewell.
 










The first kiss was in December 2023 in a New York bar after we had both been drinking. She continued working actively with me thereafter. She did not indicate to me that she had been troubled by the kiss, much less that she preferred to change or end our relationship. She even co-wrote a script with me after this kiss.

The second kiss took place in May 2024 at Cannes where she had accompanied me for the premiere of my most recent film. Once again, after we had been drinking together, I kissed her. This time she indicated displeasure. I never attempted to kiss her again and I also apologized. Even after Cannes, Plaintiff expressed emphatically her desire to continue to work, dine and travel with me. She also expressed her desire to work with me on my next film, which was scheduled for production last fall. Finally, she participated in an interview and voluntarily made personal social media posts in which she chose to praise me.

Plaintiff was my Production Assistant from June 2021 until September 2024. During our more than three years of work together, she eagerly accompanied me to numerous work and social events as my guest. These events included small, private dinners with prominent celebrities in the entertainment industry. We also dined together in restaurants, drank together in bars, visited museums, and attended concerts, plays and film festivals. She never expressed any reluctance to attend these events or to join me in these one-on-one activities. If she was unhappy to participate in these activities, she didn't show or mention it. On the contrary, she repeatedly expressed to me enthusiasm about her participation. Her lawsuit tries to paint a very different picture — one that isn't true.
 










It is more than a little revealing that, throughout her employment, Plaintiff chose on her own to make flattering social media remarks about me, emphasizing her belief in my talent and her delight in my mentorship. I think it is at least as revealing that a number of her social media posts have been deleted since she engaged counsel and asserted her claims. The deletions include her reference to me as “my man”.

In the summer of 2024, having completed my most recent film, I had no need for a full-time assistant. Plaintiff was living in Arizona then, caring for her ailing grandfather, who subsequently passed away. Rather than eliminating her position, I reduced her compensation by approximately 50% even though she was not doing much work for me. I hoped that she would return to full-time work in the not-too-distant future when my next contemplated film project would create a need for an assistant. I also emphasized to her that if she was ready to move on in her career, she should do so and would have my unqualified encouragement. Within a few months of this reduction in pay, I heard for the first time about the grievances detailed in the demand letter, which have been partially published in the lawsuit papers.

I understand that in the current climate a defendant accused of sexual harassment is often presumed guilty in the court of public opinion without the fairness of due process — unless and until the defendant proves his or her innocence. But that presumption is not always true. It is not true in this case. I have nothing to hide about my conduct — and that includes my decision not to yield to the pressure of my former assistant's threat to make her sensational allegations public, a threat that she and her lawyers have now executed. If this case ever makes it to trial, I will be honest with the judge and jury who I am confident will see the truth.

Wes Anderson's new movie, The Phoenician Scheme, arrives in theaters on May 30, and today, Focus Features has unveiled the first trailer. It presents the story of Zsa-zsa Korda (Benicio del Toro), a rich businessman and “maverick in the fields of armaments and aviation” who enlists his daughter (Mia Threapleton), a nun, in a treacherous “land and sea infrastructure scheme.” Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Richard Ayoade, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Rupert Friend, Hope Davis, Mathieu Amalric, and Benedict Cumberbatch portray the cast of characters trying to assist or thwart them.

[Editor's note: The following story contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 8, “Amor Fati.”]

“The White Lotus” creator Mike White revealed another would-be viral scene that didn't quite make it into the Season 3 finale. White said during the “‘White Lotus' Official Podcast” bonus episode, as hosted by Jia Tolentino and Josh Bearman, that there was a deleted scene where Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) becomes determined to shed her virginity after deciding against her plan to live in the Buddhist monastery. In turn, she returns to the resort and seduces fellow hotel guest Zion (Nicholas Duvernay).

“That part was cut too, which is very disappointing, is that she decides to lose her virginity in the script in the last episode. And she actually has sex with Zion,” White said. “There's this whole scene where she's like, ‘It's true. Saxon is right about this one thing. I need to get this over with.' And you know how after she leaves the monastery she's just like, ‘I need to have sex.' But in the end, it was one of these things where it was like, it's already an hour and a half. It would have added 10 minutes to the thing. And it had a little bit of a rom-com vibe in the middle of trying to kill the family with the pong pong fruits. It just felt like I was trying to do too much narratively.” 

White also pointed to the “symmetry” of desires as embodied by siblings Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Piper, and Lochlan (Sam Nivola), with the trio representing three different idealizations of how to live. 

“A lot of times, people that retreat from life are just afraid they're not going to get what they want, or they say they don't actually want the things they want,” White said. “And Buddhism, to me, is a whole religion about that, which is renounce things because wanting things is suffering.” 

As Saxon craves too much, Piper represses her own carnality, and Lochlan is caught between his two older siblings as he tries to navigate his own place in both the family and the world. 

And the aforementioned tryst between Piper and Zion was not the only scene left in the editing room: Carrie Coon told Harper's Bazaar that she was part of a “short scene” that included the backstory of her character Laurie's child.

 










“There was a bit more context to her home life. You originally found out that her daughter was actually non-binary, maybe trans, and going by they/them,” Coon said. “You see Laurie struggling to explain it to her friends, struggling to use they/them pronouns, struggling with the language, which was all interesting.”

She added that amid the Trump administration's attempts to legally abolish transgender people, White decided not to include the scene. “When the time came to cut the episode down, Mike felt that the scene was so small and the topic so big that it wasn't the right way to engage in that conversation,” Coon said. “Mike doesn't shy away from challenging cultural conversations, and I really appreciate that about his work.”

Co-star Schwarzenegger also told Variety that time has been an issue for each episode length, saying of the 90-minute finale, “Mike likes ambiguity. He wants people to have these conversations. He shot two-and-a-half hours for the finale and boiled it down to 90 minutes. That's already a stretch for HBO to give.”

Jenna Ortega didn't leave Scream VII over her busy “shooting schedule.” In a new interview with The Cut, Ortega revealed that she exited the movie because things went awry after her co-star Melissa Barera was fired from the film for publicly supporting Palestine.


	“It had nothing to do with pay or scheduling,” Ortega told the outlet. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart.”


	She continued, “If Scream VII wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”


News of Ortega's departure from the film in November 2023 came just one day after Spyglass Media Group, the production company behind the Scream films, fired Barrera for her social media posts, which they deemed antisemitic.

	At the time, Variety reported that Ortega's departure was “apparently not influenced” by Barrera's firing. Still, speculation grew that her exit was due to the production company's treatment of her co-star, since Ortega, too, has been vocal about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

	At the time, Scream VII director Christopher Landon deleted a statement on X that read, “Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.” He later stepped away from the movie, saying the film had become a “dream job that turned into a nightmare.” Kevin Williamson, the film's original screenwriter, took over directing duties and ended up welcoming Neve Campbell back to the franchise.


	“I'm very happy and proud to say I've been asked, in the most respectful way, to bring Sidney back to the screen and I couldn't be more thrilled!!!” Campbell wrote on Instagram at the time. “Well, actually I could.”

	In 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery was named as a co-defendant when an extra in the film Arthur sued Russell Brand for sexual assault. In the case, Jane Doe alleged that Brand “exposed his penis to me on the set and in full view of the cast and crew,” adding that the actor later “assaulted me as a member of the production crew guarded the door from the outside.” Brand denied the allegations at the time. When her identity was revealed to him under seal, he claimed to have no recollection of ever interacting with her. But a recent progression of the case finds Warner Bros. offering to submit hours of unseen footage from the set for evidence.


	According to The Times, Patrick Lamparello, an attorney who represents Warner Bros, said the company is in possession of “four or five hours, it could be more, around eight,” hours of outtake footage from Arthur. The film was released in 2011 and was shot in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Department is not currently investigating Brand. Last week, the actor was charged with rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault in connection to incidents involving four women in the U.K. between 1999 to 2005. The Jane Doe assault case was submitted in New York.

	











	In the lawsuit, the actress alleged that Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Discovery, Bender-Spink, and Langley Park Pictures —the co-defendants in the case — either had employees on set the day she was allegedly assaulted, or at least bear some responsibility for what she claims transpired. Warner Bros. also denied the allegations at the time.

	Brand's legal representatives have expressed concern about the overlap in these assault cases, stating there is “reasonable belief criminal prosecution is possible in the US based on allegations tantamount to criminal sexual misconduct occurring in the US, of which he has been falsely accused both by this civil plaintiff and several others through the media.” Last week, Judge Shlomo Hagler rejected a request from Brand's legal team to delay proceedings in the New York case. 


	“I've always told you guys that when I was young and single before I had my wife and family … I was a fool, man,” Brand said last week in response to the U.K. charges. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict, and an imbecile. But what I never was, was a rapist. I've never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.” He is expected to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 2.

Good news for fans devouring “The Chicken Sisters” as Hallmark Channel airs its first season, which premiered exclusively on Hallmark+ in the fall of 2024. On April 7, 2025, the network confirmed via Deadline that the star-studded series has been renewed for a second season. Not only that, but the show has a new home and a new Hallmark hunk on board. 

A post shared by David James Elliott (@djameselliott)

As previously reported, the series renewal is no surprise to the cast of “The Chicken Sisters” — led by Lea Thompson (Nancy), Wendie Malick (Gus), Schuyler Fisk (Amanda), and Genevieve Angelson (Mae). They have already reunited in Vancouver to film the new season. On April 4, Angelson posted a photo in her Instagram Stories while getting her hair and makeup done, writing, “and we're back!” 

But according to Deadline, they'll be joined by a new cast member for season 2 — actor David James Elliott, best known for the decade he spent, from 1995 to 2005, starring on “JAG” opposite another Hallmark star, Catherine Bell. Elliott, 64, will play a man from Gus' past who returns to the fictional town of Merinac, Kansas. 

He joins a handful of Hallmark hunks who are part of the cast, including “Ruby Herring Mysteries” alum James Kot, who plays Amanda's husband and new restaurant owner Frank Jr. The first season cast also included “Ride” alum Jake Foy and Ektor Rivera, who co-starred with Lacey Chabert in 2022's “Groundswell,” but their casting for season two hasn't been confirmed yet. 

Based on KJ Dell'Antonia's popular book of the same name, “The Chicken Sisters” follows the drama between two fried chicken restaurants in the same small town, Mimi's and Frannie's. 

The townspeople's loyalty is deeply divided over the restaurants, owned by separate families with complicated ties to each other. The drama is only exacerbated by the arrival of a production crew for the reality TV show “Kitchen Clash.” 

Months after the first season of “The Chicken Sisters” premiered on Hallmark+, where it's still available to stream, the series made its Hallmark Channel debut on March 30, airing on Sunday nights through May 18. According to Deadline, the second season will premiere on Hallmark Channel, with each new episode available to stream the day after it airs. 

In another interesting shift behind the scenes, series co-creator and season one showrunner Annie Mebane has been replaced by Erin Gibson, who was a writer on the first season. 

Samantha DiPippo, senior vice president of programming for Hallmark Media, told Deadline, “We're grateful to Annie Mebane for creating the series for television and expertly bringing to life the town of Merinac and its colorful characters in K.J. Dell'Antonia's beloved book. The show is in great hands with Erin Gibson taking the reins as showrunner this season and we know that our stellar cast … will serve up something special for viewers.”

After Hallmark Channel aired the first episode on March 30, Fisk shared some behind-the-scenes details in her Instagram Stories, including gushing about her castmates. The daughter of Hollywood legend Sissy Spacek, Fisk said it's “a dream to get to act alongside the incredible wendie malick” and called Angelson “the best tv sister” and “the bessssst friend.” 

Of her TV mom, Thompson, Fisk wrote, “i sat next to @lea_thompson at our first table read for the show after basically just meeting her. i was (still am) so in awe of her. she has a poise and strength and a vibe that you just want to be around.”

Robert De Niro will receive the Cannes Film Festival‘s honorary Palme d'Or at the opening night ceremony of the 78th edition, the festival has confirmed.


	As part of the honor, De Niro wil also give an onstage masterclass in the Debussy Theatre for festival-goers on May 14.


	De Niro has been a frequent presence at Cannes over the years. He was last on the Croisette in 2023 to debut Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. De Niro was president of the Cannes jury in 2011. 


	“I have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,” De Niro said in a statement provided by the festival. “Especially now, when there's so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together — storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It's like coming home.”

	De Niro is one of contemporary cinema's most beloved figures. His history at the Cannes Film Festival is stacked. In 1976, he starred in two competition films, Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, which won the Palme d'Or. 


	He opened the festival in 1982 with Scorsese's The King of Comedy, and the next year presented Once Upon a Time in America, Sergio Leone's last film, before returning to the Croisette with Roland Joffé's The Mission, which also won the Palme.


	De Niro was last seen onscreen in Netflix's political thriller Zero Day and Barry Levinson's Alto Knights. 


	This year's Cannes Film Festival runs May 13 to 24.

Ticketing information for the shows will be announced soon, according to the press release.

	











	News of the summer tour comes on the heels of J. Lo announcing her upcoming film venture, Office Romance, in which she will join forces once again with Edward James Olmos — the actor who portrayed Selena's father, A.B. Quintanilla, in the 1997 Selena biopic, which starred the “On the Floor” singer as the late Queen of Tejano Music. “From ‘Selena' to now, this journey has come full circle,” the “Let's Get Loud” singer captioned the then and now photos of her and Olmos in a recent social media post.

Warner Bros.' kid-friendly movie blew past all expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, with final numbers coming in more than $12 million ahead of Sunday's already historic estimates.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The box office blues have been banished in historic fashion.


Warner Bros.' A Minecraft Movie, made with help from Legendary Pictures, struck gold with a record-shattering $163 million opening domestically and $150.7 million overseas for a global start of $313.2 million, according to final weekend numbers. Thanks to a huge Sunday, that's up more than $12 million from Sunday's domestic estimate of $157 million and $144 million overseas for a global haul of $301 million.




	The film came in tens of millions ahead of expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, besting the $146.4 million three-day launch of Universal Pictures' The Super Mario Bros. Movie over Easter weekend in 2023. (Opening on a Wednesday, Mario Bros. earned $204 million through Easter Sunday.)

A Minecraft Movie easily boasts the top start of 2025 to date, and is the biggest domestic launch since Deadpool & Wolverine in July 2024 ($211 million). Just as noteworthy, it came in ahead of Barbie ($162 million) to mark Warners' biggest domestic opening since 2016 when Batman vs Superman debuted to $166 million. Saturday's gross of $60 million is the biggest in the history of Warners, not adjusted for inflation. Legendary put up 25 percent of the $150 million production budget (that doesn't include marketing costs).


	The star-studded, high-wattage ensemble pic couldn't have come at a better time. The 2025 box office has seen its fortunes fall off dramatically in recent weeks. Minecraft is just the shot of confidence Hollywood studios and cinema owners needed after pics including Disney's Snow White bit the poisoned apple. 


	It's also a needed victory for embattled Warner Bros. movie studio chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, and for the studio overall. Ditto for Legendary, whose movie chief Mary Parent — known for her deft handling of big IP — is a credited producer and is given major props for suggesting that Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre) be hired to direct the pic.


	“We're absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world,” Abdy and De Luca said in statement thanking all involved, from Hess to the cast to Legendary and Vertigo, another producing partner. They also thanked their marketing and distribution teams. “A Minecraft Movie's decade long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP's Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.”

	











Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Jennifer Coolidge and Danielle Brooks star in the PG-rated film, as well as Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen. The movie, based on the Mojang Studios video game of the same name, centers around four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they must master their new reality's quirks while embarking on a quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, as Black steps into the shoes of the iconic character Steve.


	Warners global distribution chief Jeff Goldstein said the film worked everywhere, from small towns to the biggest cities. And, reached in London, Parent said the opening is a both a reflection of the mandate to celebrate the world of Minecraft in a joyful way, and the singular experience that only theatrical can offer. “This game is a global phenomenon,” she said.


	She's not spinning. Minecraft is the the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold. By some estimates, there are 125 million active daily players. (Microsoft bought Mojang in 2014).


	On Saturday morning, based on Friday's huge haul of $58 million, insiders at Warner Bros. projected a $135 million domestic start, up from an expected $60 million-pls. Some rival studios thought it had a shot at as much as $150 million, but massive walk-up business saw the final tally come in even higher.


	Not even so-so reviews or a B+ CinemaScore dinged A Minecraft Movie (moviegoers under 18 gave it a perfect A). 

	











	Exit polls from PostTrak did the best job at explaining the movie's out-of-this world start: Teens between ages 13 and 17 made up 35 percent of the audience, while the largest quad was between ages 18 and 24, according to those with access to the data. Those are the demos best known for repeat viewing. Families also turned out in force, while males — as expected — dominated at 65 percent to 67 percent of the audience. General audiences and parents/kids gave the movie four out of five stars on PostTrak, while kids delivered five out of five.


	Overseas, A Minecraft Movie is even showing promise in China, where it topped the weekend chart with $14.6 million, the best showing of any Hollywood title this year. Legendary East is handling the film in China.


	“This was lightning in a bottle,” said Goldstein.


	The next-closest film was A Working Man, which came in No. 2 with $7.3 million. Distributed by Amazon MGM Studios in the U.S., the pic has earned $27.8 million in its first 10 days of release. Fathom's screening of part two of The Chosen: Last Supper followed closely with $7.2 million.


Snow White, now in its third weekend, placed No. 4 with $6.1 million domestically for a tepid global total of $168.4 million.

The studio hopes that "Great American Stories" will become an anthology franchise, ripped from the pages of literary classics like John Steinbeck's novel.



		By Tony Maglio, Alex Weprin 

	April 7, 2025 7:01am	




	If you're one of those people who prefer a good book to the boob tube, AMC is about to make you feel conflicted.


	On Monday, AMC Networks announced it is developing a new TV franchise produced by AMC Studios and “built on iconic American stories.” Up first: John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.




	“Each season of the anthology series will be devoted to a different celebrated work, historical moment, or individual narrative celebrating and highlighting the American spirit,” the company said. The Great American Stories anthology will air on the AMC cable channel and stream on AMC's primary streaming service (out of a bunch), AMC+.

					'Mayfair Witches' Showrunner Unpacks Finale Fates, Talks Anne Rice Crossovers and Hopes for Season 3		
			









	If you want to Anne Rice-ify classic American literature, who better to adapt the novel than Rolin Jones, who did the same thing with Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire (and Friday Night Lights, and Boardwalk Empire)? Jones will take on Grapes and then “manage the franchise” from there, “working with acclaimed creative talent connected to individual seasons,” per AMC.


	“I actually look at it as big and epic as what we've seen with Walking Dead, the Anne Rice universe and Dark Winds,” says AMC chief commercial officer Kim Kelleher in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “Even if you haven't read the book since high school, there's a lot of expectation and build up around this. And I feel like the roster of talent he's put around it is going to do it justice.”


	Kelleher says that the company is planning to roll out a new edition of the anthology each year, based on different tales, though she declined to comment on any future literary inspirations.


	Jones, a playwright and television writer, will have some help in the form of Mark Johnson, who oversees the entire Anne Rice Immortal Universe. Johnson's got the résumé, his film and TV-producing credits include Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Natural, Rain Man, Diner, Donnie Brasco, The Notebook and a bunch more.


	“For more than a year we have been searching for the perfect story to launch our next big television franchise, and we found it in The Grapes of Wrath, which is as timely and relevant today as it was when first published in 1939,” Dan McDermott, the president of entertainment for AMC Studios and AMC Networks, said in a statement to press. “Our country is built upon so many unforgettable historic and dramatic moments, tales of bravery and courage, classic novels, short stories, and chronicles well known and never-before-told. As a network that began its life as American Movie Classics, this is the franchise we're destined to bring to the screen.”

	











	“We're thinking about Great American Stories like one of those resolute car factories in Michigan — bring in visionary creators, give them an assembly line of singular talent to build the thing, hand them the keys and get the hell out of the way,” Jones added. “This is Dan McDermott's big, bold, torpedo bat swing at AMC. He's hired me to roll a beauty off the factory floor every year. I hope to never have another job for the rest of my career.”


	A timely “torpedo bat” reference there out of Jones; clearly an MLB fan.


	“Never have I felt more professional pressure than in accepting this challenge to help translate some legendary American stories to the television screen,” Johnson said. “I am utterly grateful to AMC for this invitation and truly indebted to Rolin for his trust in me. What a terrifying opportunity!”

EXCLUSIVE: Even as he is deep in postproduction on his next film Death of Robin Hood at A24, Michael Sarnoski and the studio are already eyeballing their next project together. Sources tell Deadline that Sarnoski will write and direct the live-action adaptation of Hideo Kojima's genre-defying video game Death Stranding, with A24 and Kojima Productions producing. Lars Knudsen and Ari Aster's Square Peg will also join as producer.


	The film will delve into the game's mysteries surrounding the “Death Stranding” — a catastrophic series of events that blurred the boundaries between the worlds of the living and the dead, bringing forth nightmarish creatures into a fragmented world on the brink of collapse.

Death Stranding captured the imaginations of millions of gamers, played by more 19 million worldwide. Originally launched in November 2019 for PlayStation 4, it boasts an all-star cast including Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, Guillermo del Toro and Margaret Qualley. Players assume the role of Sam Porter Bridges, a character tasked with reuniting a divided America, rebuilding hope, and re-establishing connections among the last remnants of humanity.

	The news follows on the heels of a number of Kojima Productions announcements at SXSW including a launch date for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (June 26), debuting a new trailer, confirming a worldwide concert tour based on the franchise, and a collaboration with luxury watchmaker Hamilton. The game sees the return of Reedus, Seydoux, Nicolas Winding Refn and Troy Baker, who will be joined by Luca Marinelli, George Miller and Elle Fanning.


	The project gives Sarnoski another high-profile IP to add to his resume after his critically acclaimed 2021 breakout pic Pig. The film starred Nicolas Cage and put Sarnoski on the map as a rising star in the director ranks. The project landed him the high-profile A Quiet Place spinoff, A Quiet Place: Day One, which bowed this past summer grossing more then $250 million worldwide.


	Sarnoski most recently directed Death of Robin Hood at A24 starring Hugh Jackman and Jodie Comer. He is represented by WME, Range Media Partners and Derek Kroeger.

In a new interview, Jenna Ortega clarified why she stepped away from the “Scream” franchise. The actress, who starred in the fifth and sixth “Scream” films as Tara Carpenter, confirmed in 2023 that she was not returning for the seventh franchise installment. It was originally reported that “Scream VII” conflicted with her “Wednesday” Season 2 shoot in Ireland after the SAG-AFTRA strikes. The announcement that Ortega was leaving “Scream VII” was announced one day after co-star Melissa Barrera's firing. 

Now, Ortega has shared that her exit was in fact because the film itself was “falling apart.”

 










Ortega's co-star Barrera, who played her onscreen half-sister, was fired for pro-Palestine comments that “Scream” production company Spyglass Entertainment deemed antisemitic. Directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, who helmed the fifth and sixth films in the series, had already parted ways with the franchise; Christopher Landon was going to direct the seventh film, but also left the project amid the backlash.

Ortega cited the turmoil of “Scream VII” as to why she decided to leave the film. “It had nothing to do with pay or scheduling,” Ortega told The Cut. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart. If ‘Scream VII' wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”

These days, Ortega is leading recent A24 release “Death of a Unicorn,” as well as reprising her titular “Wednesday” role for the series.

As for “Scream VII,” original star Neve Campbell will now be back in the franchise as Sidney Prescott, after sitting out from the sixth film due to a pay dispute; reboot actors Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown will also return for the seventh installment. The first “Scream” actor Matthew Lillard will additionally star despite his character Stu being (most likely) deceased, with original screenwriter Kevin Williamson directing.

Barrera previously told Deadline that she considers Ortega to be her “family for life.” Of being part of the “Scream” franchise for two films, she said, “I'm grateful of what I got to infuse in[to] the franchise and that's something I will be proud of forever.”

							By 

	David Browne



	If anyone knows her way around protests, it's Daryl Hannah. The actress and director has been arrested a half-dozen times protesting for environmental causes. But even she can have a hard time getting her head around the almost daily chaos of the second Trump administration.


	“There are too many horrible things to even talk about,” she says from California, where she's been helping her family deal with the loss of their home from the L.A. fires. “A lot of my focus has to do with the environment and the potential destruction, considering what we've been facing already with these fires, floods, hurricanes, and global devastation. To not take that seriously and start going in the other direction is just so fucking stupid. Sorry for my French, but it's just so short-sighted on behalf of all living things.” And don't get her started on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who once joined Hannah in protesting the Keystone XL oil pipeline (both were arrested). “So disappointing,” she says, “because he was such a good, powerful environmental advocate for so long. The fact that he would be part of this administration is shocking to a lot of people.”

	











	How does she make sense of it all? “We've taken to not watching the televised news so much because it can be way too overwhelming,” she says. “We just choose our reliable outlets, because it definitely is better for our mental health.”


	By “we,” Hannah means herself and her husband, Neil Young. More than just Young's partner, Hannah has also taken an active in role in his work, working on his stage backdrops and album covers and documenting his music. In the roughly decade since they became a couple, Hannah has made a movie about the making of his Barn album with Crazy Horse, has filmed all his tours for his archives (including every show on last year's tour with the Horse), and even made what she calls an “improved imaginary goofball home movie” (2018's surreal Western Paradox, starring Young, Promise of the Real, and Willie Nelson).

	Her new film, playing in theaters April 17 with a possible wider distribution after, offers another perspective on Young and his life. Filmed on the bus, backstage, and onstage during his 2023 run of solo shows on the West Coast, Coastal provides a pretty intimidate look at Young on the road during his first tour in four years. Filming the bus scenes on her iPhone, Hannah captured him just before and after shows interacting with his son Ben (who was born with severe cerebral palsy) and his small crew. “It's not even a new iPhone,” she says. “It's not the latest model. But I didn't want to have a big camera or anything, because I didn't want to make Neil feel self-conscious at all. I wanted to him forget about it.”

	











	Hannah says she'll be filming this year's run of Young shows with the Chrome Hearts, but has no plans to turn that into a doc at the moment. Instead, she's shopping around her first feature script, what she calls “a homage to Sunset Boulevard, but kind of more a dark comedy instead of a film noir”; she also hopes to direct herself. “Because this [Trump 2.0] is so overwhelming, it's actually quite important to focus on the things we love, because that's what keeps you refueled,” Hannah says. “It's important not to just get lost in the depression and the fear and all that. It's really important to stay focused on the things that bring you joy.”


You've been filming most of Neil's recent tours. What made you want to turn this particular footage from 2023 into a doc?Well, usually I film the tours so Neil has archival footage. I don't necessarily make them into documentaries. I usually film everything, tours and recording sessions. That's how the Barn documentary happened as well, because I was filming it. A lot of that was shot on my iPad, but they were like, “You can't be seen!” Crazy Horse is very, very private when they're making music. They don't want to be self-conscious at all.

How did you get around that?Hide? [Laughs.] Neil says that sometimes I just become a camera lump. I fold into my sweatshirt and just turn into a little lump with my iPad.


	This [2023 run] was a solo tour. I've been thinking for a long time that I would like to show certain aspects of what it's like for him. Even friends of mine will be like, “Oh, can I come to the party after the show?” I'm like, “Party? We get on the bus and start heading to the next town.” If people think it's a rager, I wanted to share how sort of human it really is, at least for us. I wanted to show that it's very solitary and kind of almost, you know, normal existence in some ways.


	I especially was kind of stunned myself by the fact that after a show, he almost can't talk. He's drained. He has to just sit there and stare out the window for a while, and re-enter his body. I think, in the end, I kind of somehow miraculously got what I was hoping to get, which was sort of a mix of  almost the loneliness of being on a solo tour,  where you have a little moment of pensive, maybe even melancholy after the show, or just sort of a drained feeling. I kind of wanted to dissuade people of their notion of what rock & roll tour is.

	











The closest we get to backstage guests are shots of Joni Mitchell and Lukas Nelson at one show.That was the first show in L.A. Joni and my mom and Lukas came. That was the only time we had people backstage. My mom and Joni are both in their eighties. It was so funny, because when my mom was saying, “I was singing at the end,” Joni was like, “I was singing louder! I was the loudest!”


What was it like to go back on tour with him after four years?He was really nervous, actually. He talks about it in the film. He said, “I don't know if I can do this — we'll see.“ But he's been obviously making music for so many decades that it's kind of in his DNA at that point. So even though he was nervous, it was very second nature once he got onstage and started to play. It's hard for him to not be playing music in some way, shape, or form. I don't think there was ever a concern that he was never going to tour again. I don't think it's possible. He's so engaged with music, I just don't think there's some point where he's going to say, “That's it for me.”


Many of his peers are doing farewell tours now.  He's not that person. The venues may change. I don't know how things are going to evolve, but he's never going to not play music. I can't ever foresee a moment where he'd do something like that.


When you said you “miraculously” got what you needed for this film, what did you mean?We placed the cameras [at the concerts] in front of the instruments we thought he might play and some nights he would never use them. [Laughs.] Neil never has a set list. He just plays what he feels in the moment. Well, there's no way to accommodate that, so some nights we'd set the cameras for one of the three pianos on stage, or for a certain guitar and the organ maybe. And he wouldn't play any of them! So there were great versions of certain songs I would have liked to have used, but we didn't even capture them because he didn't even go to those instruments the whole night. We would have literally nothing for an entire night sometimes, you know, because of him choosing to do different songs.


Were you allowed to get mad at him over that?Well, that's his forte, you know. That's just who he is. I'm not going to start saying, “You have to play …!” [Laughs.] That would be horrible, right? He only listens to his muse. That's kind of what he's known for in some ways, because it has to be authentic for him, or he won't do it. So I'm not going to mess with that.

	











	I was absolutely determined to have “I'm the Ocean” at the beginning and “When I Hold You in My Arms” at the end. Those are really the heart of it to me. “I'm the Ocean,” even though it was written a long time ago, for that record with Pearl Jam, resonates with all of the shit we're facing today and all of these crises. And even in the ways we have to stay positive and remember that we don't need to focus on all the negativity all the time too.   


	With “When I Hold You in My Arms,” once again, it's one of those songs that resonates with what's going on in the world today: “New buildings going up/Old buildings coming down.” And how important it is to lean on someone you love or someone you care about to have that refuge. The fact that he plays both the electric guitar and the piano in that song, I've never seen him do that. And I've been around for a while. [Laughs.]


Given you're both the filmmaker and the spouse here, what are the challenges of making a movie like this in terms of what you do and don't include?  You even slipped in a few scenes of Neil addressing you behind your iPhone and saying he'd missed you.That was a little bit hard, because I really wanted to make a cinema verité film; that's my favorite style of documentary. And when I was in the editing room, I really was fighting those kind of moments because I didn't want to have myself or the camera acknowledged in order for it to be true cinema verité. You're supposed to be a fly on the wall.  


	But all of those moments, when he's looking in the camera, even when he's talking to Ben, I find them really moving. So, even though I fought it and fought it for months during editing, I finally decided to put them in because there was an aspect that you would never catch otherwise. When Neil looks in the camera, there's such a beautiful openness and vulnerability and charm. You really see so much more into his soul.


At one point, we see Neil talking to Jerry, his bus driver, about how the fans want to hear the hits because those are often the only songs they know. That's an unusual comment to hear in a movie like this.But it's pretty true. People go to a show and want to hear the song they're familiar with, their favorite song played at their wedding or whatever. So I think that's kind of true for everybody, but Neil specifically decided on this tour that he was going to do songs he'd never really played before, “hidden by hits,” as he calls it. It was like people were hearing them for the first time, and in many cases, they really listened. I mean, you could hear a pin drop in all of those theaters.

	











Does Neil have any sort of approval over the finished film?He doesn't get any approval. Another thing that is specific to him is that if he sees something, he gets attached to it. So if I showed him the film in an earlier form and then changed something, he'd be like, “What happened to that part?” So I didn't show it to him until I was really done with it, because I don't want him to lock in on something, and then I've changed it.


	But he really liked it. I was a little bit nervous because I don't think we've ever filmed him with Ben before. I said to Neil, “Are you going to be comfortable with that?” But he absolutely loved it. 


	Sometimes I film a lot of things for him, like messages to people for when someone's getting celebrated for something and they want him to film a video message. I did one for Paul McCartney, since he was receiving some kind of award, or maybe it was his birthday. We did one take, but the birds in our backyard were really loud. And I was like, “Could you do it again?” And Neil's like, “Nope!” He does not do a take two.


The film is black and white, but at the very end, as we see the next highway in front of the bus, it turns to color.My favorite movie in the world is The Wizard of Oz.  I have to do something from that in every one of my movies, something a little magical.


In the end, what do you think you captured about him that's not in other documentaries, even the ones he's made?People generally think of him as a sort of kind of inscrutable guy. It's funny how many people are intimidated by him; they go, “Scary!” Before I knew him, I was like, “Oh, God, he's so scary.” So I wanted to dissuade people of that notion. And those moments of intimacy really show something that I don't think I've ever seen before in any documentaries.


At the Oscars last month, you presented the editing award and gave a shout-out to Ukraine: “Slava Ukraine!” Was that spontaneous?I'd been planning it, but I didn't want to tell anyone. I didn't know until I got there that night that they had a 10-second delay so they could bleep people. So I was trying to sneak it in there so they wouldn't bleep me. I didn't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Neil. I didn't want anyone to try to talk me out of it. I was just trying to disguise my intentions until the last second. I'm not sure why they didn't bleep me, but I'm glad they didn't. I think possibly it was because people cheered, and then people [watching] would have thought, “Why are they cheering?”

	











Afterwards, many people wondered why more presenters that night didn't say similar things.I 100 percent agree. It was weird, especially because it was just a few days after that horrific meeting in the Oval Office. You'd think more people would have wanted to send a little bit of love to the Ukrainians. I went to Ukraine many years ago for a film festival, in 2014, and I cried when I left, because I fell in love with those people. They have a great sense of humor. They're full of heart and soul. Even then, people in Ukraine were struggling economically and there were still bullet holes in some of the buildings. It was not a super-groovy, wealthy country. But people were happy and full of love. I really have a beautiful, deep connection with the people of that country. And I'm just horrified at the decisions that are being made now on behalf of us.


Neil announced a free show in Ukraine but then canceled.Yeah, everybody wanted to go, the whole band. But [authorities] just said they could not possibly allow it to happen because of the danger, to the audience as well as to us and the band members. When many people gather in one place it just becomes the obvious target. We were both really disappointed. But we will definitely try to go at some point.


When you were at the Oscars and once more in such a Hollywood scene, did you flash back to your life in the Eighties and Nineties, when you starred in so many hit films?    No! [Laughs.] Well, kind of. You have to go to a rehearsal, where they show you where to stand and whatever. I brought my sister and told her I was going to change the script. Not the part about Ukraine, but I rewrote the whole part about editors too, because they had me saying something I didn't feel reflected editing. I really have a lot of respect for editors and for the process and how important and challenging that work is, and how it really is where the film is created.


	But I was really, really nervous. My sister was with me in the Eighties and Nineties, when I would do those [shows]. And when I would even suggest changing an “and” or an “if,” they would give me hell! I'd be called into the producer's office and they would berate me. It was intimidating. Sometimes even the other actors I was co-presenting with would join in on the berating and say, “Well, I'm absolutely fine with all of that. You don't have to change a thing for me!” Thanks a lot for the support, mother …!


	But this time it  was really interesting, because, first of all, I noticed the backstage was full of women. I've never seen that before. There was not even one woman that I remember ever [in the past shows]. Also, all the writers were women. So when I told them I wanted to change one line, they were like, “Fine.” When I told them I wanted to change the whole thing, they were like, “Great.” I was shocked. To a certain degree, a lot of that patriarchal, misogynistic style of producing that show seems to be gone. I didn't expect it at all, because I obviously have a lot of bad flashbacks from things I experienced in my career. I love, love making movies and I love the work, but the other parts of it can be really a nightmare. A lot of the personalities you have to deal with, and certainly the sort of old-school, misogynistic structure of the industry, especially when you're a young girl, you're drowned in it.

	











Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you'd decided to play the game and keep taking roles in films like Steel Magnolias and such?I don't even think that's a possibility. In a certain way, I'm very similar to Neil. I am who I am. I'm not going to be able to fake it. That was part of the problem for me, too, when I had to do a lot of press and stuff. If I had a bad experience on a movie, I couldn't do the press. I can't really say, “Oh, it was so great!” It's not possible for me. I'm not that good at lying. I'm not good at self-promotion either. I love the idea of disappearing into a character. But I want it to be about the character, not about me and my daily life. That was the reason I wanted to do movies in the first place, to disappear into these fantasy worlds.


Speaking of which, did the makers of Splash Too offer you a part in that sequel?They did. And I don't think any of us really liked the script, but I particularly didn't. A lot of times, they'll try creating sequels just to try to squeeze a little more juice from the stone, see if they can get some more money out of it. And it's not organic to the story. 


You went public about your terrifying experiences with Harvey Weinstein in The New Yorker in 2017, talking about how he was pounding on your hotel room door and later asked to touch your breasts.That was the tip of the iceberg. I experienced stuff like that in almost every movie. It was gnarly to be a young woman in those times. I never had an agent or a publicist or anything like that. So I was really kind of not protected.


You've worked since Kill Bill, on TV and indie movies, but that seems to be the last major film we saw you in.It totally was. It was my last real movie. I mean, I'm fine with it. But I never really got any offers after that either. I was offered one other movie that was not a very good part, but that was [makes a sound like a car stopping]. I think some of it definitely had to do with Harvey, because he was like, “Oh, she's difficult,” or whatever he said.

	It was pretty gnarly blowback. We were going to the Cannes Film Festival, and I had agreed to host some charity events. This was right after he tried to come into my hotel in in Rome. He took off on the plane with all the other actors and left me there. I not only had to find my own way, my own flights back and forth, but I still had to go to Cannes — and they'd canceled my hotel room and there was nothing available. He canceled everything, the hair and makeup, everything. So I had nothing. I arrived in order to do all these things, and I was dragging my suitcase on the cobblestones, trying to go from person to person's room, sleeping on people's couches each night. It was really a screwed-up situation. It was a bad time.

	











	So it was probably a combination of that and the fact that I turned 40: an “oh, my God, how dare I turn 40!” thing. Who knows, but it's just the way it is. I've never been comfortable with being a known personality. I put my creative energies elsewhere, and I've been directing for years now, and I love it. At least I'm still making films, but it doesn't have to be about me.

In a culture where endless sequels and nonsensical IP cash grabs have muddied the grandeur of blockbuster cinema, it's nice to know we still have Tom Cruise and “Mission: Impossible.” The 7-film franchise hasn't had one miss yet — despite what many may say about the first sequel directed by John Woo — and looks to continue its streak with number 8, titled “The Final Reckoning.” This latest installment picks up directly following the events of the previous film, “Dead Reckoning,” which sees legendary spy Ethan Hunt face his most lethal foe yet in the form of an A.I. known as the Entity. Watch the trailer for the film below.

 










Originally titled “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” “The Final Reckoning” completes the plot set up in the previous film, with Hunt now in possession of the key necessary to defeat the Entity. But before he can do that, he must first gather his team to find the sunken Russian submarine that houses the source code needed to destroy the technology. This includes returning cohorts Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, as well as new players Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, both of whom appeared as adversaries in “Dead Reckoning Part One.”

Footage of Cruise's death-defying stunts for “The Final Reckoning” — including hanging off the side of a WWI bi-plane and holding his breath as a submarine fills with water — was first unveiled at CinemaCon 2025 last week with star himself in attendance. He would go on to present an award to the film's co-writer/director, Christopher McQuarrie, later in the week. Cruise also recently discussed shooting the underwater scenes in an interview with Empire.

“I'm breathing in my own carbon dioxide,” Cruise said. “It builds up in the body and affects the muscles. You have to overcome all of that while you're doing it, and be present.”

In celebration of the Memorial Day Weekend release of “The Final Reckoning,” Museum of the Moving Image is hosting a special “Mission: Impossible” exhibition that honors the stunt work involved in making the series so special. It will feature sections on each films, accompanied by behind-the-scenes footage and artifacts. This exhibit opens April 18.

	The three-decade history of Blink-182 is marked by epic highs and miserable lows. At the peak of their popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, they were selling out arenas all over the globe and scoring hits like “What's My Age Again” and “All the Small Things.” But there were also two extremely ugly band splits that played out before the public, near-death experiences due to a plane crash and a cancer battle, partial reunions, and long periods where it looked like the band would never return. The only constant member from their formation in the San Diego suburbs to the present day is singer and bassist Mark Hoppus. Here are 10 of the juiciest revelations from his new memoir, Fahrenheit-182.


	Raynor was in the band from the very beginning, and plays on their first two records, including breakout single “Dammit.” But, in 1998, Raynor was told he had to either quit drinking or quit the band. Unhappy with the ultimatum, he chose the latter. They moved on with new drummer Travis Barker, and didn't hear from Raynor for another year when he suddenly called. “He ran through a laundry list of grievances, both real and imagined, cursed me and Tom [DeLonge], called us hypocrites,” Hoppus writes. “I said I was sorry, this was just the way things were. We sat in long silence. Then we hung up. That was the last time I talked to Scott.”

	The three members of Blink were given a chance to shoot cameos in 1999's original American Pie as a high school band (with a monkey) who watched Jason Biggs' fumbling attempt at sex with Shannon Elizabeth on a webcam. They were instructed to merely look shocked at what they saw on a computer screen while a professional actor said, “That guy's in my trig class.” Hoppus blurted out “Go, trig boy. It's your birthday.” The improvised line made the final cut. When the movie became a massive hit, strangers started to yell “Go, trig boy” at him in public. “It was a quick, throwaway gag,” Hoppus writes. “I have no idea why it caught on as a popular quote. Maybe it's because the entire movie is quotable. Keep in mind, this is the movie that immortalized the phrase, ‘This one time, at band camp…'”

	“[That's] always the most fun,” he writes. “Everyone's on top of the world. Nothing can touch them. Doors open wherever they go. People kiss their rings and do any favor they ask. No one ever stops to worry what might be waiting for them around the corner in the third act. Life is too good to worry about how they might end up stuffed into a car's trunk or hanging in a meat locker.”


	At the peak of Blink's success, a woman began parking her car outside their homes. Using binoculars and a telephoto lens, she kept a journal that listed their license plates, when they typically arrived home each day, and the times they turned off their lights at night. She wasn't technically breaking any laws, but it made all of them deeply uncomfortable, and Hoppus eventually moved to a house behind a gate to get away from her. Months later, she showed up at a San Diego record store where they were signing copies of their new album. Mark and Tom quickly signed her album and avoided eye contact. Travis did not. “I'm not signing that shit,” he said. “You hang around our houses? You stalk us? You follow our wives? Get the fuck out of here, I'm not signing shit.”


	When the new band released their first LP in 2001, Hoppus shrugged it off in public. Things were very different behind the scenes. “What the fuck is going on? I asked myself,” Hoppus writes. “It was a big conspiracy against me. I questioned everything about myself: Am I bad musician? Do people think I'm a dick? What is it about my personality that's making everyone so fucking eager to do something else without me?”

	The tour came at a time when Blink-182 were ascendant and Green Day were at a low point right before American Idiot. “I got the sense that Green Day fucking hated that they'd been reduced to opening for us,” Hoppus writes. “It must have been a difficult pill to swallow. There was a lot of tension on that tour. Some nights we drank together like old war buddies. Other nights we got into screaming matches with their manager in the hallways.” They haven't toured together again despite some overtures from Blink's camp. “We keep asking for a rematch and they keep refusing,” Hoppus writes. “They're the rival gangs across town who both despise and respect each other.”

	











	DeLonge's decision to sever any direct communication made the situation even more painful.  “Everything had to go through lawyers and management,” Hoppus writes. “My best friend of more than a decade, and I had to have my people call his people. I was paying a lawyer top dollar to communicate with the kid I used to break into abandoned buildings with to skateboard…I didn't just lose my best friend. When Blink fell apart, I lost everything.”


	After DeLonge left the group, Hoppus and Barker attempted to carry on making music together under the name +44. “People knew the name Blink-182,” Hoppus writes, “but the who the hell was +44? It felt like I was giving the world a math problem.” At this same time, Hoppus feels that DeLonge's group, Angels and Airwaves, was not living up to their hype. “Tom had over-performed and under-delivered,” he writes, “which might've made people skeptical towards another post-Blink project. We had to work twice as hard for everything. All the supports and safety nets we had in place were suddenly gone. Radio stations used to roll out the red carpet for a new Blink album, but now we had to play the game and kiss ass for airplay crumbs.”

	The band got back together shortly after Travis Barker's plane crash in 2008. They cut a new LP and toured the globe, but old tensions remained. “Tom arrived as late as he could, walked directly to his dressing room, and closed the door,” Hoppus writes. “Showtime came and we did what we do. The second the show ended, he was in his car back to the hotel, never to be seen.” They had plans to tour in 2015 until DeLonge decided he didn't want to do it. “It was ridiculous,” Hoppus writes. “Tom was out of control. Pretty soon we were speaking to each other solely through management. All fighters retreated to their corners to sulk as the saddest millionaires punk rock ever suffered. Did we really get the band back together only to end up running it into the ground, reverting to petty arguments about schedules? Again?”


	Tom became my best friend again,” Hoppus writes. “Some days I just wanted to waste away on a couch feeling sorry for myself. But Tom wouldn't let me. Every day he sent me a new joke. Or an old photo of us rocking out. Or just a dick pic .The past was never mentioned. All that mattered was right now.”

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 8, “Amor Fati.”]

“The White Lotus” did warn us: Violence begets violence.

In the Season 3 finale of Mike White's treacherous drama, cycles of violence take center stage as they spin on, end, or reroute in terrifying directions. Once again, a few days in paradise has left these characters changed forever — at least the ones who survived.

After conceding that he isn't a violent man, Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) finds himself at a crossroads. On one side, there is nonviolence, his Buddhist upbringing, and leaving the job he takes such pride in to pursue other avenues; in the other direction, accepting the option or at least the reality of violence will further his current career, and possibly his relationship with Lisa Manobal's Mook, who is weirdly rigid about his options. There is a sense that her interest hinges up his machismo and his job title, and (sadly) the show has barely bothered to give her more character than that.

Gaitok's affection for Mook and his own self respect are what drive him toward his actions later in the episode. In his eyes, Valentin and his friends not only committed a crime, but violated Gaitok's trust. He was disrespected at work by a colleague, and despite his aversion to violence, he hates that he didn't spur to action during the robbery. The word “honor” doesn't come up, but Gaitok is a man who values it and wants it back.

The karmic impact of violence manifests differently with Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), who starts out adamantly against taking Greg's (Jon Gries) hush money but comes around to it, thanks to son Zion (Nicholas Duvernay). There are obvious moral qualms in taking financial gifts from someone who almost-definitely killed (or at least played a role in her demise) his wife — but it's also hard to deny Zion's practicality. They can't stop this man, they can't change what he did, and if his mom can get a better life out of it, isn't that a net positive for the universe? Zion goes full Business Bitch with Belinda's blessing, and watching her bank balance shoot up was easily the most satisfying beat in this episode.

But while Belinda escapes the violence to come and the wrath of Greg (so far), she ends up perpetuating a cycle that hurt her deeply when she leaves things hanging with Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul). Just a few episodes ago, Belinda was grappling with the pain of Tanya's (Jennifer Coolidge) rejection and how it felt to delay her dream because of a wealthy woman's whims; with Greg's donation in the bank, Belinda leaves Thailand and Pornchai in a similar position to where she herself once was.

 










When it comes to reaping what you sow, no one has done more introspection this season than Timothy (Jason Isaacs), whose business dealings and their ultimate fallout will change life as his family knows it forever. Timmy has spent his phone-free vacation ideating every fatal outcome for his family, and eventually deciding that it's not enough to take his own life, or his wife's, but that he should also kill his two eldest children out of mercy. Lochlan (Sam Nivola) — pure of heart, a self-proclaimed “pleaser,” and the only one who can find a worthwhile life without their usual luxuries — is spared the sentence, unbeknownst to him as Tim hands out the poisoned piña coladas.

“The White Lotus” hints at the dark and twisted often enough, but “Amor Fati” goes far beyond flirtation with these themes — and even then, Mike White controls the viewer. You simply cannot look away from this picture-perfect family about to die via smoothie machine, or imagine the horror Lochy will experience as witness and survivor. The nightmare gets grimly inverted the next morning, when Lochy makes his first protein shake from the dregs of the deadly fruit and ostensibly dies after a vivid vision of himself drowning and crying out to four faceless individuals for help. It's a strikingly surreal and spiritual scene for show that normally opts to mine tension from everyday human behavior, and it works even if it shifts the tone drastically. 

 










Lochy lives (I did say in a previous review that he or his siblings dying would simply be too sad), but death has officially checked in to the resort by this time. A newly composed Rick (Walton Goggins) reunites with Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) only to come face-to-face once again with Jim (Scott Glenn), who's taking no chances. The old man has a gun strapped to his person now, and he tells Rick that his mother was a “drunk and a slut” and a “liar,” that his father was not a good man. Poor Rick starts to spiral instantly; it's as if the interaction kicked him back into childhood and the character begins to re-mature at hyperspeed before our very eyes. He returns to Chelsea as a wounded child, seeks Amrita's  (Shalini Pereis) help as a source of wisdom and guidance, and finally spots Jim again while in something akin to an adolescent rage. He doesn't care about the consequences, internal or external. He just needs to do something.

Tragedy — Greek, Shakespearian, Lucasfilmic tragedy — surrounds Rick in his final moments. He executes Jim only to learn that the man was his father, but before he has time to unpack that even slightly, he's on the lam from White Lotus security in a full-blown shootout. Chelsea, of course, sticks with him, and of course catches a stray that kills her before he can even call for help. The end of Rick's life is the end of Gaitok's innocence, the violence and torment moving from the dead man into his killer.

 










And at the same time that Rick's actions destroy his life and his love, Timothy's threaten to take his son from him, but Lochlan lives. How interesting that the Ratliffs escaped a devastating fate while it so mightily befell Rick and Chelsea. Earlier in the episode Victoria told her daughter that it's their responsibility to live well in honor of those who can't — the kind of cognitive dissonance required in her position, perhaps, but the episode gives them all that chance when someone like Rick never even had it. Death loomed over him for as long as he could remember, and finally welcomed him into its arms.

From the nostalgic and scene-setting intro of “Toronto's Window” to the groovy “1999,” the 13-track debut album gives fans a look inside the head (and heart) of one of K-pop's brightest stars. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	“I never thought I could dream in detail,” NCT's Mark Lee begins his newly released song, “Toronto's Window,” expertly kicking off his debut solo album, The Firstfruit.


	The 25-year-old K-pop star, known simply by his stage name Mark, debuted nine years ago as a member of SM Entertainment's mega-group NCT and is still learning new things about himself creatively. “I really got to find myself while creating this album,” Mark tells The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom from Seoul, South Korea. “Now that it's done, it even put me on the idea of my second chapter.”

	As one of the busiest working performers in the world of K-pop — Mark is a member of NCT subgroups 127 and Dream and has worked in supergroup SuperM, along with other NCT formations — the Canada-born singer and rapper has never shied away from a challenge. On The Firstfruit, Mark gets vulnerable and open like he never has before. “Toronto's Window” serves as an almost origin story to listeners before jumping into the album's title track, “1999.”

	In its totality, the 13-track album is a clear window into the mind of one of the genre's brightest (and arguably most earnest) stars. Below, Mark digs into The Firstfruit with THR, explaining the process of making the album, what his father said to him after listening for the first time, how much this album has aged him and why it had to start in Toronto. 


What was the process of making The Firstfruit like? Do you have a favorite or most challenging part of the process?


	It took almost a year to create everything, but I think the most important part of the process — every part was important but — after “200” came out there was a turning point for me to realize that “I need to change everything that I've been working on.” That was the start of The Firstfruit. I had an idea of another album, but it wasn't The Firstfruit but after “200” came out, things weren't adding up. There was a specific turning point that I realized I had to start everything from scratch again. That was the hardest and the most challenging part, but it was the most important part of the process.


You previously said you put a lot of yourself in this album. Do you feel it has changed you now that you're on the other side of it?












	Absolutely. I have been trying to put my finger on what this feeling actually was, and then I realized. I think this album helped me find myself, and I hope that it can help my listeners to find themselves if they haven't yet. I think that's the point of this album for me.


On the album, “1999” is really such a cool track. It's a very different direction than I would've thought you were going with this, which is exciting. Why did you feel this was the sound to kick off this new version of you?


	The first time I heard it, I wasn't like, “This is the one.” We had other options. Among all the other options, this was the one that captivated me the most because I was working on it with [the producer] Dress. He came with the beat and with the hook. Before that, though, I've always been proud of my falsetto. I've always been confident about my falsetto. I just left it as that. One day he just came with the song and the hook itself is all falsetto. Then we looked at the other options and I just felt like, “No, I think it has to be this one.” After we put the “1999” theme into the song, it really brought everything to life and it was the one. I'm really proud how it really knocks people off on the first [listen]. I think all my group members said the same thing as well. Everyone was like, “I did not expect something like ‘1999.'” I think it's a good thing.


Between solo work and the many groups you've been in, you have a big music catalog. Do you find yourself wanting to surprise people because you've done quite a bit already?












	Just because I wanted to. I did want to as well, but just me as an artist, I realized that there were so many different types of genres that I could have pulled off to be my title track. It was actually harder for me to choose which genre. I realized that's just what I have in me. I guess just meeting the right meaning and meeting the right objective of the song, it makes it easier for me to choose the genre.


Do you feel that this album or even the work you've put in over the last few years has changed the way you view performing and making music? Or do you find it's evolving as you get older yourself?


	I think it's both. I grow as this album made me grow at least five years, I feel like. I get to know what type of an artist and performer I imagine myself being on stage. That's why for “1999,” too, we usually use headsets, but I imagine myself using a handheld mic. When it comes to actually singing live and all these different performing elements, it's a mixture of strategy and also just my growth.


Do you have a favorite track on the album yourself?


	I love all of them. Did you hear “Mom's Interlude?” I think that's my current favorite because I can't believe I actually put that on the album. I can't believe it made it on the album. It's so vulnerable and it's not even a song, it's just me talking with my mom, but I just love it so much.


Between that and “Toronto's Window,” which I saw that you posted a video today of it that was very cinematic and cool. That's not something you typically get to do on an album. Is it exciting to get to do that in this space?












	Every aspect of this album feels like it's something that I've never done. “Toronto's Window,” too. I got that beat from [producer] Code Kunst and to put that on the first track of the album…. I feel like it's easier putting it this way. [On] all of the albums I've released before, I don't think I've ever seen an intro track like this one before. I think that's the feedback that my group members told me as well. It really just sets the mood for the album in the most perfect way. So this album, it's like an autobiography, so it has to start with Toronto because that's where it all began.


Did you find yourself anxious to show this music to your group members or other people in your life? You said it's very personal to you, so did you feel a little bit more precious with it?


	I felt like it was very, very precious, but at the same time I was kind of worried if this would be the right choice. I actually had a conversation with my dad, who said, “I'm actually very surprised on how honest and vulnerable you made this album and it actually kind of inspired me as your dad.” That conversation made me realize this was the right choice. I was kind of proud of myself, too.


Is there anything else you think is important to mention about The Firstfruit?


	I just want to say that I'm not asking for the world to love this album, but I am in a way requesting for the world to take the moment to listen to this album from start to finish at least once because then they'll get to know me better.

Ready for another trip into the whimsical, yet emotionally nuanced world of Wes Anderson? The auteur has kept unusually busy over the last few years, releasing “The French Dispatch” in 2021 after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, “Asteroid City” in 2023, “The Wonderful World of Henry Sugar and Three More” in 2024, and now “The Phoenician Scheme” in 2025. His latest ensemble adventure is set in the world of 1940s espionage and stars returning Anderson players Benicio del Toro, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Rupert Friend, Benedict Cumberbatch, Bill Murray, and Willem Dafoe, as well as newcomers to his troupe Michael Cera, Mia Threapleton, and Riz Ahmed. Watch the trailer below.

Shot at Babelsburg Studios in Germany where Anderson produced “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and “Isle of Dogs,” “The Phoenician Scheme” sees del Toro as Zsa-zsa Korda, one of the richest men in Europe and father to Threaplton's character, Sister Liesl. Cera will portray her tutor, Bjorn Lund, with all three being wrapped up in a globe-trotting conflict involving the family business. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Speaking with French publication Le Monde in 2023 as he was planning the project, Anderson said of the film, “My next feature film will be linear, with Benicio Del Toro in every shot. I can't tell you much more than that except that it will be about espionage, a father-daughter relationship, and, let's say, with a rather dark tone.”

Anderson wrote the screenplay himself, but conceived the story for “The Phoenician Scheme” with frequent collaborator Roman Coppola, who's credited on the screenplay of “The Darjeeling Limited” and also contributed to “Isle of Dogs,” “The French Dispatch,” and “Asteroid City.” The last script he fully co-wrote with Anderson was 2012's “Moonrise Kingdom,” which was nominated for Best Original Screenplay. However, not joining Anderson for the first time in the writer/director's career is his loyal cinematographer Robert Yeoman. Instead, “The Phoenician Scheme” was shot by French DP Bruno Delbonnel, whose credits include the recent Apple TV+ limited series from Alfonso Cuarón, “Disclaimer,” as well as “Across the Universe,” “Inside Llewyn Davis,” and “Darkest Hour.” Alexandre Desplat, who scored 6 of Anderson's films, was also part of the team.

 










“The Phoenician Scheme” is expected to be announced as part of the 2025 Cannes lineup on April 10, with Anderson having previously premiered three of his features there in the past (“Moonrise Kingdom,” “The French Dispatch,” and “Asteroid City”). Focus Features is set to distribute the film in the U.S., while the studio's parent company, Universal Pictures, will handle the international release.

“The Phoenician Scheme” will receive a limited release on May 30, followed by a nationwide rollout on June 6 from Focus Features.

Sixty-two came in and now 42 will have to face off in a new head-to-head round to earn the 20 remaining spots.

	Gil Kaufman



	Like gladiators entering the arena, 62 aspiring American Idol contestants survived the first round of Hollywood Week only to run into the buzzsaw of Sunday night's (April 6) Showstopper rounds. Performing live for the first time in front of an audience at the Orpheum Theatre, as judges Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie worked to trim 38 aspiring stars from the roster, the singers had to turn things up a notch to make the cut.


	In the end four made the first cut.


	Gabby Samone wowed the room with her passionate, jazzy cover of Nina Simone's “Four Women,” which showed off her towering range and emotional maturity on the powerful 1966 anthem that tracks four Black women's journey from slavery to the present. “My skin is black/ My arms are long/ My hair is wooly/ My back is strong,” Samone sang over subtle piano accompaniment before climbing into a crystal-clear high note that had Richie up on his feet in amazement.

	The youngest singer in the competition, Eagleville, TN's Mattie Pruitt, has rolled through the competition so far despite saying in her opening package that she sometimes has had trouble finding her place in a family with 12 siblings. Though feelings of self-doubt continue to creep in — “I'm not pretty enough, I'm not good at singing” — the high schooler said the Idol stage is the first time she's felt truly comfortable in her skin.


	She proved she belongs in the mix with a cover of James Brown's “It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World,” making the 1966 soul classic her own by slowing it down to a funky stroll and luxuriating in the notes like a seasoned pro used to having crowds in the palm of her hand.


	Another early favorite, 17-year-old aspiring preacher Canaan James Hill, also proved that age ain't nothin' but a number with his roof-raising cover of Marvin Sapp's “Never Would Have Made It.” The teen poured some Al Green grit on the gospel great's 2007 ballad, again inspiring Richie to hop up and testify to some powerful vocals. “Go on man, go on do what you gotta do!” Richie said, shaking his head in wonder, with Bryan saying “he is one of the best singers I have ever seen!”


	The last of the four to make it through was Zaylie Windsor, who squeaked by in an earlier round, only to prove that she'd definitely earned her spot with a mesmerizing cover of Billie Eilish's “Happier Than Ever.” The Radiohead-like acoustic take featured Windsor's emotional vocals, climbing from a near whisper to a roar, filling the theater with ecstatic joy as she wailed the final notes. “Welcome to the Zaylie show!” Underwood said afterwards.

	











	While those four made the cut and will go to the top 24, Jmarie, Will Carter, Santina Madden, Isaiah Moore, Samantha Ray and Jazzy Mae were sent home and the remaining 42 singers will have to fight it out on Monday night (April 7) in head-to-head rounds; that round airs at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.


	Check out the four performances below.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about the Season 3 finale of HBO's The White Lotus, created by Mike White. 


Sam Nivola just went down in The White Lotus history for playing the first murder victim who lived to tell the story. His character Lochlan Ratliff did not even realize he got this close to being (accidentally) killed by his own father.


	If you thought that Lochlan finally facing his brother Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) over that drug-infused Episode 6 brother-on-brother sex act would be his biggest moment in the finale, you were not even close. Yes, Saxon finally confronted Lochlan over the events of that night on the yacht, and Lochlan's explanation — while pretty weird — seemed to squash the incest speculation that had surrounded Season 3 from the start, reaching fever pitch after Episode 6.

	











	“In a family of narcissists … I am a pleaser and want to be give people what they want,” Lochlan told Saxon, explaining that since all his brother cares about is “getting off,” he felt Saxon was “left out” during the sex romp so he decided to help his brother out. OK…




			Watch on Deadline		







	There was also Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) rejecting her brother Lochlan's offer to spend a year with her at Thailand's Buddhist center. But the real drama surrounding the Ratliff family came when dad Timothy (Jason Isaacs), facing financial ruin, concocted a plan to poison everyone but Lochlan since the youngest sibling seemed to be the only one in the family who thinks he can live without money.


	Timothy changed his mind at the last minute but there were some seeds of the poisonous “suicide tree” fruit left in the blender, and they got into Lochlan's protein shake the next morning. He threw up but then seemingly died, with his family flashing before his eyes and visions of drowning as, from the surface, four monk-like figures look at him from above.


	His father, who somehow slept through the blender noise despite finally running out of Lorazepam the night before, was stricken by grief when he found his son lying by the pool, motionless. Only after Rick (Walton Goggins) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) got shot to death did Lochlan come back to life, waking up in his father's arms.

	In an interview with Deadline after the Season 3 finale, Nivola spoke about Lochlan's near-death experience and what may have saved him. He discussed filming the “death” scene with Issacs as well as the underwater sequence, revealing another version of it that didn't make the final cut, which would've thrown viewers off even more as it had Lochlan in one of The White Lotus‘ signature body bags. (The Episode 6 line from the Buddhist monk's speech to Timothy, “You die, you land back into the water” already gave the drowning scene a strong death vibe.)


	Nivola shared the extended version of another finale scene that was trimmed and addressed Lochlan's heart-to-heart with Saxon. He dissected Lochlan's justification for his actions, explained whether Lochlan is sexually attracted to his brother and addressed again his sexuality. Nivola also revealed how the viral scene of Saxon and Lochlan wearing each other's swim trunks after the yacht sex scene came about. 


	He also spoke about why Lochlan wanted to stay in Thailand with Piper, what may be next for the Ratliffs, would Lochlan choose UNC over Duke and whether the trip and near-death experience has changed him. Nivola also addressed whether his and Schwarzenegger's similar upbringing as children of well known actors factored into the duo's close personal relationship.


DEADLINE: When did you find out that Lochlan would have a near-death experience in the finale? 


NIVOLA: When I read the script right at the beginning. We got sent all the scripts just a few days before we flew out to Thailand, so I knew it all coming in, which, thank god. It's so annoying sometimes with these big shows, they're so secretive that they don't let the actors read the script, which really frustrates me, because it's like what, you think the actors are gonna leak their own material? We need to know what the f*ck is going on in the show if we're gonna do a good job.


DEADLINE: When you read that scene with Lochlan by the pool, did you have any inkling that he would survive? It looked like a real death…


NIVOLA: Yeah, I totally thought he was gonna die before I got to the end of the episode, and then I was happy he didn't. I think it's a good little red herring because I think it would have been too sad if he died, and it's a great distraction from the people who actually die because then you don't expect that even more. It's great storytelling from Mike, as always.


DEADLINE: Was this your first death scene? 


NIVOLA: Yes, it was.


DEADLINE: Did knowing that Lochlan is headed to that near-death experience impact how you played him throughout the season? 


NIVOLA: I didn't actually play him differently. I think Walton and Aimee Lou's storyline, for example, feels very much like there's a Chekhov's Gun involved, and some sh*t is gonna hit the fan and someone's gonna die, and I think they did a great job of playing that suspense the whole time. I think what made it easier for me —  but also just made sense — is that I don't feel like it's really expected. It's not like Lochlan is living in some sort of very dangerous situation. And so, I played him just like how I would play him normally because it's not like he knows he's gonna potentially die.


DEADLINE: To be clear, was it the vomiting that allowed Lochlan to survive the poisoning?


NIVOLA: I think so, yeah, I think he got it all out. And also, I think maybe it wouldn't have killed him anyway, because obviously Timothy doesn't know about the dosage, how much of these seeds you need to actually kill someone. He's got a couple of fruits, but then I only got the residue of it in the blender. 

	











DEADLINE: How was it filming the scene where Jason Isaacs is holding Lochlan's lifeless body? Was it emotional for you?


NIVOLA: It was because I love him so much, and it was sad seeing him sad. He got himself really worked up, and he was saying that he was thinking of his own kids dying, and that made me really sad, because I had also just met his kids who were so sweet. Yeah, it's emotional, especially because this show makes you so close to your character because you're living in the same place that your character lives and you're hanging out with your family members.


DEADLINE: What about the underwater “death” scene? 


NIVOLA: We filmed that fully underwater. It was really scary, It was kind of amazing. I was down there, probably 10 feet underwater, with scuba divers all around me giving me their oxygen masks. I couldn't see, obviously, because I didn't have goggles on. We shot it all day, and we did a couple versions of it where I was in a body bag and crawling out of a body bag in my dream. 


	And that was so scary, because I had to be zipped in a body bag with no air, and then unzip myself. Of course, it was all safe. They wouldn't have put me in a in a unsafe situation, but it was really scary in a fun way.


DEADLINE: Mike White is known for filming longer episodes before trimming them down. Was there another scene that didn't make the final cut?


NIVOLA: Part of the scene that I have with Timothy where he says, You think you could live with no money? and I say, Yes, I think I could. The rest of that scene got cut out. He says, What are you reading? And I'm like, I'm reading this book about tsunamis, and f*cking 300,000 people died, or however many it was. How do you find any meaning in life when it can all just change like that on a dime, which I think was a cool way of describing the turmoil that he's going through. And then Timothy says, What if money doesn't matter or something? And I'm like, Okay, I don't see how that's related to what I just said and he is just totally thinking about his own thing. That was a funny little bit.


DEADLINE: We have to discuss Lochlan's conversation with Saxon in the finale. He seems to be trying to put all that incest talk to rest. It was an extreme people pleaser situation where Lochlan didn't have sexual intentions toward Saxon; he just wanted to be nice to his brother because he felt he was left out. Is that right? 


NIVOLA: Yeah, I think that's exactly it. He's a people pleaser. His brother's whole thing is, I'm the sex guy, I'm really into sex, one of my passions in life is sex and money, basically, and working out. The reason Lochlan wants to get laid is because he wants to do what his brother wants him to do, he just wants approval from him because he looks up to his brother, and so then the whole sex act is just a really f*cked up, extreme way of trying to make him happy and proud.


DEADLINE: Did we find out anything more about Lochlan's sexuality or was that still left open?


NIVOLA: I don't think he's sexually attracted to his brother. To me, that wasn't something I was thinking about, like he's gay or straight or whatever he is. I don't think it really matters for his purposes, or for my purposes as an actor because I think his whole struggle isn't about sex, and it's not about love, and it's not about sexuality. It's more about just people and his relationship to people, whether they'd be male or female or anything in between.

	











DEADLINE: Lochlan and Saxon swapped swim trunks coming off the yacht. Was it something you did for fun and everybody got obsessed over it, or was it an accident?


NIVOLA: No, It was Mike's idea. He thought it would be really funny. We were about to start shooting the first scene that took place the next day. He was like, wait, you can swap, it would be really funny. And we did it.


	I'm happy people are noticing it. We didn't think anyone was going to notice, but I think it's pretty hilarious because they also don't fit: my shorts are way too tight on him, and his are way too baggy on me, and it looks ridiculous.


DEADLINE: What lies ahead for the Ratliffs? It seems like Lochlan is the most adjusted to the new reality because he doesn't care about money that much. What do you see happening? Will Lochlan go to UNC over Duke now because it's a public university and significantly cheaper in-state. Is college even an option?


NIVOLA: I don't know. It's such an earth-shattering thing that's happening to them, I don't know what's going to happen, how their way of life is going to change. I think of all of them, Lochlan is probably best prepared to deal with the no money, not for good reasons, but because he is already so lost that he can't really get much more lost than he already is.


	So I think he'll be all right. I don't even know if he'll go to college, I don't even know if that's the right thing. I don't know what he needs, and he definitely doesn't know what he needs.


DEADLINE: There was a moment where Lochlan didn't even want to go back to America; he was prepared to stay in Thailand a whole year with Piper. What was that about?


NIVOLA: That's just about wanting to connect with his sister. It's very similar to the other thing, actually. He just wants the approval and love and attention and respect of his siblings who he really looks up to and who he's really close to, and I think he just wants Piper to like him. And so he's like, I'll do the thing you're doing. And that's why, again, it's really confusing to him when she's like, I don't want you to come. Like, why, I thought that would be a fun thing for us to do together.


DEADLINE: When he woke up, Lochlan told his dad “I saw God.” Will this change him you think?


NIVOLA: No, I don't think it will. I think he wants to have a spiritual experience. For example, I think God and religion are a really beautiful way that many people find identity and find a way to define themselves and figure out what kind of a person they are — I think he wants that for sure. And he's been watching Piper go through that spiritual journey as well. I think he's just grasping at straws. I don't think he really does change very much. He's still in the really sh*tty circumstance that he's in, and he still has all these insecurities.


DEADLINE: You'd mentioned in an interview that Lochlan came to Thailand completely lost and is leaving completely lost. So he's taking nothing away from this experience?


NIVOLA: No, I don't think so. I think he definitely takes away the fact that you shouldn't sleep with your brother, and that that's a bad thing. I think he definitely knows that now. But I think part of what's so good about Mike's writing is that it would be too simple if it were The White Lotus is a hotel that changes you: you come in one person, you leave another person. That's just not really how life works. 

	











	Some people change when they go through intense, traumatic experiences, some people never change, and that's just how life goes. And that's not to say that he won't ever change. He is 18 years old, he's got a long life to live, and most people haven't figured out who they are at 18. I'm 21, I still don't know who I am. I think he will figure it out. But I don't think this week at a hotel, even though all that crazy stuff happened, will change him very much.


DEADLINE: You have spoken about your off-screen bond with Patrick Schwarzenegger. Could it be your similar upbringing that brought you closer together? You both have been in the spotlight since you were little with famous parents?


NIVOLA: It's very different. His dad is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and my parents are amazingly talented, brilliant people [actors Emily Mortimer and Alessandro Nivola], but they're a lot less in the public eye. He grew up with security, and his dad was the governor of the state of California. It was definitely different in a lot of ways but also similar. And I think we did bond on that but also on so many other things. I feel just as close with Sarah Catherine as I do to him because I think we have the shared lived experience of being young actors and going around and also the shared experience of being in Thailand all together, which was such a specific, strange, beautiful thing that only we really understand, and everyone else in this cast.


DEADLINE: The White Lotus has been a big series for you: first on-screen kiss, first sex scene, first death.


NIVOLA: Yeah, a lot of firsts. First time to Thailand.  I'm sad it's coming to an end, and I love all those people I worked with. I've loved to have them all as friends, and I'm so grateful that everyone is liking the show.

Ten of the season three stars united on Sunday to watch and break down the action-packed finale.


							By

[This story contains major spoilers from The White Lotus season three finale, “Amor Fati.”]


	As the season three finale of The White Lotus arrived on Sunday night, 10 members of the show's cast gathered at the Four Seasons Westlake Village hotel to watch the episode together and give their immediate thoughts. 




Jason Isaacs, Leslie Bibb, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Tayme Thapthimthong, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola, Jon Gries, Nicholas Duvernay and Charlotte Le Bon were in attendance at the finale event, as they watched the finale for the first time — and emotionally witnessed the deaths of Wood's Chelsea, Walton Goggins‘ Rick and Scott Glenn's Jim Hollinger.

	“We were all crying backstage, we held each other for a long time,” Isaacs told the crowd. “I don't know because if it's this thing is coming to an end or because it's just such a beautiful story.” 


	Wood was particularly emotional over the death of her character, noting how “for about two weeks before we shot it, I felt super weird. It was like this odd, ominous thing that was just hanging over us, and then it was like the hottest day ever and Walton had to like carry me so many times and it was so hot.”


	“And also, you know, Chelsea doesn't know what's gonna happen to her, but I know, so it's this odd thing,” she continued, musing it also “looked exactly how it felt, which is really strange” while also admitting “it's not soaked in.”


	Thapthimthong's security guard character Gaitok shoots Rick as he's trying to get help for a wounded Chelsea, as the actor explained, “At first I felt like I don't want to shoot him in the back, let's turn around and have little gunfight… but we had a discussion with [creator] Mike [White] and I remember he said like, ‘Trust me, it will be justified.' And I feel like it really was,” as Wood sadly shook her head.


	Plenty also went on with the Ratliff family in the finale, as Isaac's patriarch makes a plan to poison his family before changing his mind at the last minute, only for youngest son Lachlan to be accidentally poisoned and nearly die. 


	The group then heads home to their soon-to-be-disrupted lives, as Isaacs mused of what's next, “I think the Ratliff wing at Duke University was probably pulled down. He, ironically, of all the characters that Mike throws into this mix, he's the one that actually, genuinely finds real spiritual enlightenment at the end, and is OK when he looks in the water at the end.”

	











	“What will happen to them? They'll have to get jobs. I think that's going to stick in Victoria's throat quite hard,” Isaacs joked of the other family members. “I doubted them and they will be fine, they just won't be fine in gigantic houses with huge Tesla trucks.” 


	Schwarzenegger — joking his character Saxon “went through the ringer, with these two girls and my brother really put me through it” — said he only read his character's parts of the finale and was still processing the ending. He admitted to crying for Wood in the finale and said he had this “really weird feeling right now, just spending so much time with all these cast members and then watching someone die; I don't know how to describe it, you feel like something really happened.”


	Hook said of her character's turn in deciding she couldn't handle a year at the monastery in Thailand, “I guess she is her mother's daughter” and raved about the storyline, saying, “She's just a little rich girl and that's The White Lotus, and it's so good. And I actually feel like she kind of did the reverse of everyone” in other characters finding enlightenment and Piper coming to terms with being spoiled. 


	Nivola added of shooting Lochlan's near-death, “It was really emotional. I never died in anything before, and I didn't in this! It was fun to get to do that, like it's a new, weird thing to pretend to die.” And Bibb reflected on the fan love of her character's trio with Carrie Coon and Michelle Monaghan, recalling when they first read the scripts, and actresses were “like, uh, our storyline is kind of boring. Compared to, like, jerk-offs… we're like, ‘No, you're amazing. Oh my god, did you see what she was doing?'” But when a crew member told her their storyline was his favorite, Bibb said, “I looked at Michelle and I was like, maybe we're not stuck. Maybe something will happen.” 

	











	Gries, who has appeared in all three past seasons, also shot down the idea he may appear in the fourth, saying, “I don't think so, but I don't know so. All I can say is every time I leave, I assume it's over.”


	Wood summed up the finale by celebrating how “there was a lot of hope in it and a lot of softness. All of the connections, the way the ladies connect with each other and the way the family did, I found it incredibly uncynical, especially for The White Lotus. It was very, very, very moving.”


	“Obviously being the one that dies, this whole time I've been so sad, like Mike kills hope! Because Chelsea is hope and he kills her,” she continued. “And it's like yeah, but then what I saw just then was like there's so much love in it, and that's why it's so much more painful because you're having to hold it all at the same time. But that's life isn't it? It's love and pain all the time.”

This post contains spoilers for the third season finale of The White Lotus, “Amor Fati,” which is now streaming on Max. 


	The finale of The White Lotus Season Three begins with a montage of various characters getting ready for their final full day at the Thailand resort, including Piper and Lochlan waking up after their night at the monastery. The head monk greets all his guests with a speech about the elusive nature of life itself, acknowledging that it brings with it many questions when we want resolution. Life gets easier, he suggests, once we accept that there is no resolution. 


	As a mostly self-contained season of scripted television, The White Lotus does not allow itself to be as mysterious or unknowable as the monk argues that our own lives are. So “Amor Fati” offers resolution aplenty. But given how predictable, contrived, and/or outright silly these resolutions are, maybe it would have been better if there had been none at all? 


	This was already the bumpiest of the series' three seasons. Expanding to eight episodes (after six in the first season and seven in the second) resulted not in more depth, but in certain ideas — Tim's murder-suicide fantasies, the friends' decades-old resentments — being repeated much too often. The stories of both Belinda and Gaitok felt badly underfed, as Lotus creator Mike White's level of interest in the non-wealthy — and/or non-white — characters has dipped with each passing season. If not for the specter of the mass shooting teased in the season-opening flash-forward, the whole thing would have felt like a meandering tone poem, elevated by some good performances (especially by Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood, and Carrie Coon), the occasional zinger (mostly from Parker Posey's Victoria), and random bits of sexual experimentation (Lochlan giving his brother a hand, Frank's monologue about his ladyboy fantasies). 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But having seen the shooting in context, as well as all the other climaxes — or lack thereof — I wonder if maybe these deaths aren't now the promotional cart driving the narrative horse. Or if White has simply run out of things to say about the terribleness of the idle rich, but has become too successful himself through this show to stop. The first (and still best) and second seasons reached their creative high points in their respective finales, where “Amor Fati” just summed up all the things that weren't working about Season Three.

	For the final time, let's break it down character group by character group: 


	We have to start at the end regarding the trio of old friends. They are first-person witnesses to one murder, and are at least in the vicinity when four other people are shot and killed, and their reaction is … what? We have no idea, because we literally do not hear them speak in the aftermath of those five deaths. There is a brief glimpse of the pals cuddling up together on the boat taking them back to the mainland for their flights home. But if they are traumatized by the ordeal, or are simply using it as another reason to cast all their petty grudges aside and embrace their friendship, we have no idea. 


	As a whole, the finale doesn't seem to know what to do with the idea of this huge and horrifying burst of violence happening in the middle of the resort, since Belinda, Zion, and the Ratliffs seem similarly untroubled to have been on the property at the time. (When Tanya shot up all the gays who were trying to murder her in the Season Two finale, that at least was on a yacht, and not at the hotel itself.) But the others get to talk about something in the season's closing minutes, where the friends are all but ignored — a frustrating but somewhat fitting conclusion to a subplot that was buoyed much more by the three actors involved in it than by the material they were asked to play.

	When you hand Coon — a.k.a. one of the greatest and most emotionally raw actors working today — a heartfelt monologue like the one that Laurie delivers at the friends' final Thailand dinner, of course it's going to be at least a little effective. But the words she was delivering with such force were wildly at odds with how the character was portrayed throughout the season. The idea that she was scared straight after her bad night with Aleksei, followed by the glimpse of the other two happily playing together in the pool, didn't make sense after we had watched her so clearly hate both of them for the rest of the week. Maybe if they'd saved the speech for after, again, the three of them were witnesses to a mass shooting, it might have seemed more honest?  


	What a bummer! It's not that Belinda is corrupted by the life-changing bribe she and Zion are able to negotiate with Greg. It's that her corruption felt inevitable and unearned at the same time. Belinda felt like a rich and complicated person in the first season. Her relationship with Tanya had many layers, and wasn't just about a wealthy woman emotionally leeching off of a poor one. Brought back for a new season, Natasha Rothwell didn't have a lot to do, and Belinda was a much thinner sketch this time around. And compared to pretty much every other younger character in the show's history — from the Mossbacher siblings in the first season to the Ratliffs here — Zion was granted zero depth. He was just a cartoon chasing after dollar signs. 

	











	That Belinda does to Pornchai what Tanya once did to her is ironic, but not in a particularly interesting way. The series' worldview about what money does to people is so unwavering, and so relatively one-note, that of course she was going to abandon the guy once she had some cash in hand.  


	As with Belinda, White goes for some simplistic irony here. She's the woman who thinks of herself as good, but who gladly accepts $5 million to look the other way about a murder, while he's a Buddhist who doesn't want to hurt anybody, yet gets rewarded — with both a promotion and the affection of the woman of his dreams (who's in fact not that great and only going to corrupt him) — for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back. And … that's it. Maybe Lisa from Blackpink is such an inexperienced actor that White didn't feel he could give her an actual three-dimensional character to play, or maybe he just didn't care, but this was another subplot where there was no there there. 


	Well, if nothing else, we have found a brand that is about to be much more upset about being associated with Tim Ratliff than Duke University has proved to be. The second the camera offered a close-up of the logo on the blender that Tim tried to use to blend poisoned cocktails for everyone in the family but Lochlan, you can assume Bosch's crisis PR department moved into high gear. 


	But Chekhov's Blender just felt silly. Not just because it seemed as if the older Ratliffs all drank about as much of the concoction as poor Lochlan did after he diluted what was left in the blender with protein powder and water. And also not just because — 17-year-old prestige TV spoilers follow — Tim was attempting to pull the same terrible murder-suicide stunt that a Walton Goggins character did (in the finale of The Shield), on a show that also featured Walton Goggins. Primarily, it felt silly because the show had presented so many fake-out fantasies of Tim killing himself and/or his loved ones that by the time it happened, it was hard to watch either scene with the poisoned drinks and believe someone was actually going to die. The decision to cut between Lochlan seemingly dying by the side of the pool and him having a vision of drowning in the pool only leaned into the bait-and-switch quality, so that by the time his eyes flickered open in front of his grief-stricken father, it had all become a bad and ineffective joke. 

	











	And then White somehow backed even further from the ledge he had seemingly placed the family, by showing that Tim had somehow made it through this ordeal finally learning a lesson about the importance of family over material assets. It's supposed to be a more bittersweet ending than, say, the Mossbachers being brought together by the bogus robbery attempt in Season One, since we know the Ratliffs are about to lose all their money and that Tim is going to prison for a bit. But the story up until now was played much darker than most anything in prior seasons, so to end on even a slightly upbeat note didn't ring true to what had come before. 


	After teasing the idea, in Sam Rockwell's memorable fifth episode monologue, that Frank experiments with gender whenever he drinks and does too many drugs, the finale backed off that in favor of just showing him dancing manically in his underwear surrounded by (presumably hired) young women the morning after he fell off the wagon. But if that part of the story didn't go where it seemingly should have, the Rick part went exactly where everyone knew it would, at least regarding the true nature of his relationship with Jim Hollinger. Jim didn't kill his father, because of course Jim was his father.


	And Rick killed him. And got Chelsea, and then himself, killed in the process. 


	To this subplot's credit, Goggins and Wood were wonderful throughout the season, particularly both of them in the finale sequence where it seemed like Rick actually had finally let go of the grief he'd been carrying all his life, and Goggins at the climax when an utterly haunted and ruined Rick couldn't stop himself from seeking vengeance. But if Tim Ratliff successfully pulling off a murder-suicide of most of his family would have played as incredibly dark for White Lotus, it also would have been at least somewhat in the series' fundamentally comedic DNA. When Tanya began shooting up the yacht and then fell to her death from it, that was all played for laughs, after all. This was presented as straight drama (other than perhaps Fabian squealing and falling into the water), which badly disrupts the tone of the show, and invites a level of scrutiny it simply isn't built for. If the true nature of Jim and Rick's relationship was meant to be a surprise, it wasn't. If Rick was meant to be a crack shot capable of taking out both of Jim's bodyguards with relative ease, it would help to know literally anything about his past other than that his mother died when he was young and that he and Frank used to party together.

	And if the resort was going to be host to such a horrific event — not so long after people died violently either on or near two other White Lotus properties over the past few years — then the show needs to be prepared to deal with the consequences of that. You can't just put everyone on boats like everything is normal, and have Pornchai and the other staffers waving goodbye from shore, when everyone would be getting interviewed by the local police at this point.


	It was simultaneously predictable and nonsensical. The finale was followed by clips of White talking about his goals for this season, while also teasing what's to come with the upcoming fourth season. “There's always room for more murders in the White Lotus hotels!” he promised. At a certain point, aren't the TripAdvisor reviews alone going to ruin their business model?

Actor Kevin Bacon has not spoken much about Bernie Madoff since he and his wife were victims in the Ponzi scheme that led to Madoff's arrest in 2008.

However, in an interview with Esquire that was published on April 4, they asked if it was okay to discuss Madoff.  

“There's not that much to say, really,” Bacon answered. “If it seems too good to be true, then it's too good to be true.” 

The interviewer followed that up by noting that Bacon and his wife, Kyra Sedgwick appeared to be not “too jaded from the experience”

 “No, not jaded,” he answered. “More careful. But not jaded.”

“I go to this gym. It has a few machines and only a handful of people there at any given time. There's no showers, it's very bare bones,” he added. “But there's a leg press machine. A leg press can be brutal… The machine is right next to a window, and when I look out that window, I'm looking right at the building where Madoff was.” 

“I'm in excruciating pain, doing the leg press, staring out that window,” Bacon continued. “It's perfect, in a funny way, because I also have to think, I can get through this. And that's how we felt about Madoff.

Bacon has never revealed the exact amount he lost to Madoff, but Madoff's Ponzi scheme is said to have defrauded people of an estimated $64.8 billion total. 

While it was a very tough time for Bacon after they learned they had been defrauded by Madoff, he leaned on his family to help him get through it. 

“It sucked, and we were certainly angry and all the things,” Bacon explained to Esquire. “But then we woke up the next day and said, ‘What do we got? We love each other. We love our children. We're healthy. No one took away our ability to make a living.' So we got back to work.”

In 2022, Bacon appeared on the Smartless podcast, hosted by Jason Batemen, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes, and opened up about how he was impacted by Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. 

Specifically, Bacon revealed that he and Sedgwick “had most of our money in Madoff” and admitted that he received a “portion” of the losses returned, but not everything.

“Certainly, you get angry and stuff, but I have to say, there were a lot of people who were much worse off than we were – old people, people whose retirement funds were completely decimated,” Bacon said on Smartless. “So there's always going to be somebody that's going to have it a lot worse than you.”

HGTV star Tarek El Moussa is sharing how is dynamic with his ex-wife Christina Haack has improved. 

While speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025, Tarek El Moussa, who shares his older children Brayden, 9,  and Taylor, 14, with Haack, said filming the series, “The Flip Off,” alongside his ex-wife bettered their relationship. The HGTV series, which premiered in January 2025, featured Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, competing against Haack to see who could make a better profit when flipping a house. Haack's estranged husband, Josh Hall, was originally her partner until he left the series following their July 2024 split. 

Tarek El Moussa said filming the series “was more fun than [he] thought it was going to be.” 

“It was better for our family. It was better for our relationship. It brought everybody closer and, in the end, it did such amazing things for our family. I wouldn't change a thing,” said Tarek El Moussa to the publication. 

He also said that he and Haack were able to positively communicate with each other during the production of the show. 

“The show gave me and Christina an opportunity to apologize for things we did to each other. It gave Christina and Heather an opportunity to bond even closer. I mean, we're going to dinners now. So, honestly, it's just about working together, spending time together and creating some really fun TV together,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview.

Tarek El Moussa spoke about filming with Haack for “The Flip Off” during a January 2025 Us Weekly interview, alongside his wife. He said he was not worried about working with his ex-wife again because they have “been in a really good place” for “the last couple of years.” 

“It took us almost 10 years to get there, so going back into shooting together, it's a lot more of an intimate relationship. There were some reservations. But as the show has gone on, we've realized it's just business,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

He also said that he and Haack did argue while filming the HGTV series. According to Tarek El Moussa, he took issue with Haack “because she always wants to get her way.” 

“She doesn't want to have rules,” said Tarek El Moussa to Us Weekly.

Heather Rae El Moussa also shared that he and Haack's dynamic is similar to how siblings fight.

During a November 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Haack said Hall took issue with her dynamic with Tarek El Moussa while filming “The Flip Off.” 

According to Haack, Hall viewed her relationship with her ex-husband as flirty. She said, however, that she views Tarek El Moussa like a sibling.

The hit HBO series' music supervisor Gabe Hilfer explains why you didn't hear any songs from the chart-topping megastar: “I feel like you're crossing a boundary because they're no longer their fictional character.” 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	“[The White Lotus] is the well-established brainchild of Mike White,” music supervisor Gabe Hilfer told The Hollywood Reporter of working on the hit HBO show. “It's his sandbox to play in, and we're all there to help him just make it as exactly what he wants it to be.”


	Hilfer, who joined for the show's second season, said his main task as music supervisor is to take viewers into the each season's resort setting. He noted that season two was “very distinctly” Italian, while season three, which wrapped up its run Sunday night, is distinctly Thai. He added that they always strive for authenticity but that getting into the point of view of each season's guests is important.

	“You're immersed when you enter The White Lotus, and we want music to be a part of that too,” Hilfer said, adding that he was vaguely familiar with Thai music prior to season three due to past projects. “I also reached out to a lot of people that I know who have contacts in Thailand, and we ended up having a couple great resources in Bangkok, who were immensely helpful because basically their whole job is working on music licensing with Thai artists.”


	With the show heavily featuring the music of Thai artists and having one of the biggest pop stars in the world in the cast, it begs the obvious question: Why wasn't Lisa's music in the show? “I've worked on a lot of things that have musicians as actors, and I kind of feel like you're crossing a boundary because they're no longer their fictional character,” Hilfer explained. “It's just a little meta if you're hearing their music while you're seeing them on screen, but they're not playing themself.”


	The music supervisor says there was a discussion with her label but that it never came up in the body of the show. “If she was playing Lisa on vacation at the White Lotus, maybe it would've been kind of a fun little wink, but as she is Mook in this and has a different role, I think it would've been a little too self-aware or meta,” he said, adding, “Obviously, she's such a megastar, and Blackpink is its own phenomenon.”


	Hilfer also weighed in on fans' passionate online debates for things such as the main title sequence. “The show is a phenomenon in popularity and gets talked about so much,” he said. “Popularity just brings more eyeballs and more opinions and scrutiny. If you work on something that is incredible, but nobody watches it, nobody's really commenting and giving you their opinion on specific stuff.”

	











	He added, “When I hear the stuff — and I'm not deaf in terms of reading the stuff online and I see what people say — I look at it as almost flattery because it means that people are paying attention so much and they've loved it so much before that they're having a hard time with change.”

The sketch had the pair, plus Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, singing up in the air.

	A couple is ready to “take it the next level” after a nice date in the “Making Love” sketch that aired on SNL Saturday night (April 5). Silk pajama-clad lovers-to-be (Jack Black and Sarah Sherman) turn the night into a musical performance, with a little help from Bowen Yang and Brandi Carlile — and with all four of them flying.


	Black, the host of Saturday Night Live‘s latest episode, and Sherman are lifted up as they sing (and making swimming motions in the air). 


	“First we do things to me for a while,” Black sings, “and then we do things to you for not that long.”

	They try to incorporate some dirty talk, and get the champagne flowing — right into Sherman's eyeballs.


	“That was so romantic,” Sherman musters, to which Black agrees: “For me as well.” Together, they harmonize: “Because we're making love.“


	“Then without even saying a word, we both know it's time to bring in a third,” they sing.


	“Hello, I'm here to fix your problems,” croons Yang, who appears out of nowhere. “And this will definitely end well.”


	Spoiler: Black panics, feels weird for inviting a guy from work to join them, and decides the way to make things all right and “dandy” is “to bring in a fourth … and the fourth is Brandi.”


	Watch the “Making Love” sketch below to hear the always-cool Carlile croon her words of wisdom while mid-air.


	Elsewhere on Saturday night's show, the singer-songwriter fulfilled her duties as musical guest with Elton John, performing “Little Richard's Bible” and “Who Believes in Angels?” from their new album released this week. Carlile and John's collaborative project, Who Believes in Angels?, was released on Friday (April 4).

The classified Kosmos satellite trio has sparked intrigue in space-tracking circles.

A trio of secretive Russian satellites launched earlier this year has released a mysterious object into orbit, sparking interest among space trackers and analysts.

The three satellites, designated Kosmos 2581, 2582 and 2583, launched on a Soyuz-2.1V rocket from Plesetsk cosmodrome early on Feb. 2 (GMT). Since then, the satellites, whose purpose is unknown, have displayed interesting behavior, while in a near-polar orbit roughly 364 miles (585 kilometers) above Earth.

In March, the satellites appeared to be conducting potential proximity operations, or maneuvering close to other objects in space, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist and spaceflight activity tracker.

Following this, the U.S. Space Force cataloged a new object in orbit, which was possibly released by Kosmos 2581 on March 18.

Russia has provided no details about the satellites and their mission. Many Kosmos missions are classified.

The released object could be used for a number of objectives, including military experiments, such as satellite inspection or target practice, testing technology for docking or formation flying. It may also be a scientific payload or even the result of an unintentional fragmentation, though this would usually result in numerous pieces of debris.

The Kosmos (or Cosmos) designation has been used by the Soviet Union and later Russia for a very wide range of military and scientific satellites since 1962. The satellites have covered a range of apparent uses, some of which are experimental, secret, or part of military programs, including early ASAT (anti-satellite) tests and satellite inspection, reconnaissance and electronic intelligence.

Satellite trios flying in formation in orbit is not unusual. Both the United States (for example, the Naval Ocean Surveillance System) and China (Yaogan) have launched numerous sets of satellite triplets, many of which are thought to be for electronic intelligence purposes, along with other satellite series.

However, it remains to be seen what the three Kosmos satellites and their new companion will get up to in orbit.

What could technological advancements in AI, declining birth rates, psychedelics, and UFO sightings possibly have to do with Donald Trump's political rise and reshaping of modern conservatism? Ross Douthat is on a mission to find out for The New York Times.

Interesting Times With Ross Douthat, a new podcast from the Times Opinion section, isn't aiming to be an explicit foray into the conservative podcast ecosystem, according to the host. Instead, “It's trying to be a window from The New York Times into a changed world with a conservative guide,” Douthat tells Vanity Fair. Each Thursday, starting April 10, the conservative opinion writer will explore the New Right through discussions with newsmakers in an attempt to offer a place within the Times that “tries to engage with a world that has been deeply unsettled.”

The new podcast will serve as a place where this “strange new world meets the concrete realities of politics,” Douthat explains in an interview, telling me that the podcast will touch on the modern conservative movement, political party realignment, organized religion, technology, pop culture, and even aliens. Douthat, who often writes about religion, said he plans to explore “the weirder edges of religion right now—from psychedelics to UFOs. Not just what's going on with Catholicism, but what's going on with unidentified flying objects and people having wild spiritual encounters while taking ayahuasca,” he says.

“The conceit of the show is that these weird things have some kind of real connection to what's happening in normal politics,” he adds. “We're going to be trying to make that connection clear.”

Douthat, 45, joined the Times in 2009 after a stint at The Atlantic and with two books already under his belt: Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class and, with Reihan Salam, Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream. Douthat's since been one of the Times' most reliable conservative voices on the Opinion page, providing an intellectual perspective from the right that's surely more palatable to Times readers than a MAGA firebrand. Douthat's also knocked out five more books in that time and cohosted the paper's Matter of Opinion podcast, which typically featured columnists from varying political points of view. It's on Matter of Opinion where Douthat also flew solo this year in interviews with conservative and contrarian voices like Steve Bannon, Chris Rufo, and Marc Andreessen.

“We knew pretty much immediately after the election that we wanted to do a show like this,” Kathleen Kingsbury, the Times opinion editor, tells me. “What we were trying out in the last few months, and you saw this a little bit with those interviews, was trying to figure out what the format should be.” According to Kingsbury, those interviews performed particularly well with Times readers consuming the content in all forms—audio, video, and transcript. “People were hungry for understanding and guidance for this moment, in a way that just blew us away,” she says.

Trump's return to power has sparked a fresh wave of calls for a better understanding of the right, with California governor Gavin Newsom, for one, kicking off his new podcast with Charlie Kirk, followed by Michael Savage and Bannon. Douthat tells me his podcast was green lit following the success of his interviews with figures on the right, which he said are a “good example of what the show wants to do,” while ensuring me that's “not going to be all that the show is, by any means.”

“It wasn't something we decided a year ago or something. It was much more in the last few months, where there was just sort of this sense that after the election, the landscape had shifted and I might be a good person to help Times readers understand what was going on,” he adds. While he is “slightly intimidated” to transition from Matter of Opinion cohost to the host of his own podcast, Douthat says that opinion leadership has been “very enthusiastic about the idea.”

Kingsbury, who took over the Opinion section in 2020, says she's been “committed to bringing a broader range of viewpoints into the section, and that particularly includes conservative voices.” Douthat, she says, “has long been a brilliant voice in text for Opinion, and I feel even better that we're going to be able to bring this show around him, his interests, and his ideas going forward.”

While the Times has built out their opinion offerings by bringing writers with varying political views together via roundtables, the paper sees a niche for Douthat in the audio space, pushing him to the forefront of his own show, using similar tactics that allowed for the success of the Ezra Klein Show, one of the Times' fastest-growing podcasts.

Douthat's show will also be available as a video podcast on YouTube, a strategy that has been particularly successful for Ezra Klein, an opinion columnist who, like Douthat, cut his teeth in the aughts political blogosphere, albeit from the left. “We're basically making that show video first, knowing that we find a larger and different audience on YouTube than we do if we just continue to publish on site,” Kingbury says. “We're really focused on figuring out how to think more broadly. I think Opinion is the part of the Times that has probably made the most inroads in this, but you see it across the Times. We're trying to figure out how to offer our audiences more and more ways to interact with our journalism and engage with it.”

“Like a lot of big successful organizations, the Times is not a dominant presence on YouTube, or anything like that,” says Douthat, adding that “there's certainly room for Times audio to grow.”
