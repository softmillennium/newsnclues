                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is set to premiere Nicholas Bruckman's NFT documentary Minted in key global territories this week, including in North America. of the NFT, provides audiences with “a front-row seat to the explosive emergence of the turbulent NFT (non-fungible token) phenomenon as it erupts into a $40 billion digital gold rush.” It debuts Wednesday on Netflix in North America, the UK, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. Minted held its world premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival, followed by an international premiere at CPH:DOX in Copenhagen. It was broadcast on the PBS series Independent Lens earlier this year. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming In some sense, NFTs represent an inherent contradiction. But using block chain technology a single artwork or piece of music, for instance, can be made unique and therefore collectible. “It begins with the artist known as Beeple, whose record-shattering $69 million digital art sale sends shockwaves through the traditional art world,” notes a release. “Following Beeple and a pioneering group of multidisciplinary artists from the U.S., Latin America, and Africa, Bruckman explores the soaring highs and chaotic lows of this polarizing movement as it unfolds, examining the intersection of technology, artistic expression, and value.” In a statement, Bruckman said, “I'm ecstatic to see Minted reach new audiences as it rolls out on Netflix. Love or hate NFTs, we hope the film entertains viewers and sparks big conversations about how art, finance, and tech are colliding.” But similar to cryptocurrency, it's a highly speculative enterprise, complicating any attempt at forecasts. Bruckman's credits include the Emmy-nominated Not Going Quietly (PBS POV, Hulu) about the late activist Ady Barkan, and the immigration documentary La Americana (PBS America Reframed, Nat Geo).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been appointed as an adviser to Pakistan's Crypto Council, a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing the country's embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets. Zhao will advise the regulatory body on cryptocurrency regulation, infrastructure and adoption, Bloomberg reported. CZ is seen signing documents during his appointment by Pakistan's Ministry of Finance. For Pakistan, Zhao is a high-profile appointment that could potentially help the country lure foreign investment in an industry that has taken on new strategic importance. In March, the CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council, Bilal bin Saqib, told Bloomberg that the country plans to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Related: Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao to advise Kyrgyzstan on blockchain tech Pakistan has long been considered a potential hub for crypto adoption due to its growing population, large diaspora and thriving black market for foreign exchange trades. The value of cash sent to Pakistan through formal remittance channels surged at the end of last year amid a countrywide crackdown on black market dollar trades. “This increase might be because remittances that had previously been sent using the black market are now being sent via official channels,” John Ashbourne, an economist at Fitch Solutions, told Bloomberg. Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto's most prominent use cases in regions with high demand for US dollars due to currency depreciation. Although data on stablecoin usage in Pakistan is slim, a 2023 KuCoin survey revealed that 33% of local crypto investors use digital assets to hedge against the rupee's devaluation. A more recent survey conducted by Bitget found that 46% of respondents in South Asia — a region that includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and others — use digital assets for speed and accessibility of transactions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum faced heightened selling pressure for a lengthy period due to the volatility in the broader crypto market, causing its price to undergo a sharp pullback close to the $1,400 mark. However, recent trends show that ETH seems to be entering a calmer phase as bulls are gradually taking control of the market in anticipation of a rebound. Although Ethereum's price has declined sharply below key support levels, investors' sentiment is starting to shift toward a more positive outlook. A report from Darkfost, an on-chain data and technical expert, reveals bullish behavior from investors on one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance. As reported by Darkfost, ETH is showing early signs of a potential turnaround to a calmer phase on Binance, as selling pressure appears to be slowly fading. The drop in sell-side pressure on the crypto exchange is a sign that bears or sellers are losing control of the market after a period of intense downward movement in ETH's price. Darfost revealed the development after a thorough examination of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric on Binance. A 7-day Simple Moving Average (SAM) view of the taker buy-sell ratio shows that the volume has flipped into positive territory, rising above level 1. In the meantime, the easing selling pressure may act as a launchpad for price stabilization or a price recovery in the short term as bullish momentum picks up. However, the expert noted that the trend is still too weak to make any clear conclusions, even though it is an encouraging sign for Ethereum's price dynamics. Thus far, Investors are closely monitoring whether bulls can take advantage of the change and propel ETH toward a short-term recovery. However, the altcoin‘s pullback is more likely to extend after its recent drop below a key chart pattern. Following his examination of Ethereum's price action, Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst, has identified a massive multi-year Triangle formation, which ETH has fallen below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy Says Q1 Profit Doubtful Given Nearly $6 Billion in Unrealized Bitcoin Losses Strategy is not expecting a first-quarter profit, given billions of dollars in unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, the company said on Monday. “We may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our digital assets,” the company said, adding that a $1.69 billion tax benefit should partially offset its unrealized losses in the first quarter. As U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have battered risk-on assets, Bitcoin's price has dropped to a five-month low. Since Strategy started buying Bitcoin in 2020, the company has spent $35.6 billion on the asset, acquiring it for an average price of $67,485 per Bitcoin, according to Saylor Tracker. Strategy has taken on $8.2 billion worth of debt to buy more Bitcoin than it could otherwise, while issuing products like convertible debt and perpetual preferred stock. Between its so-called “Strife” and “Strike” offerings, Strategy is required to pay $146 million in dividends annually. Before it became a Bitcoin-buying machine, Strategy was known for its enterprise analytics software business, which “has not generated positive cash flow” in recent periods and may not help it satisfy its financial obligations, according to the company. In order to fulfill its financial obligations, Strategy said it plans to take on more debt, issuing common shares, or conduct more offerings of preferred stock and convertible debt. Strategy hasn't had a profitable quarter since the company posted an earnings per share of $0.32 on $124 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to Macrotrends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is teasing those all-time highs, and suddenly every altcoin looks like it's waking up from hibernation. Whale activity is back, and major players are throwing serious money at projects with real utility. What sets Qubetics ($TICS) apart is how it's fixing one of crypto's biggest headaches—blockchain interoperability. It's not just slapping together buzzwords but offering a real-world solution that's already grabbing attention. Alongside Qubetics, Render and Theta are pushing their own tech limits, giving this list some serious heavy hitters ready to shine when the market explodes. Let's dive into the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Its interoperability framework is built to make data, assets, and applications move seamlessly between blockchains, unlocking a whole new level of utility. Think about a Toronto-based NFT creator wanting to sell digital art on a Solana marketplace while their assets sit on Ethereum. The platform's AI-driven QubeQode IDE handles it, shifting assets across networks without breaking a sweat. For small businesses, professionals, and regular folks tired of getting stuck in one ecosystem, this is a game-changer. It means no more worrying if a project's on the wrong chain or missing out on opportunities because of network limitations. It's in stage 29, and over 506 million $TICS tokens are already out there, snapped up by more than 24,300 holders. And here's the kicker: $TICS is still sitting at just $0.1573 per token. If $TICS touches $1 post-presale, backers are looking at a 535% ROI. Try finding another project throwing down numbers like that. Because Qubetics isn't just a whitepaper fantasy. Its real-world interoperability solution is built for the long haul, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Render has been turning heads in the digital art and AI scene. With more demand for graphics rendering than ever—from Hollywood studios to indie game developers—Render's decentralized GPU network steps in where traditional services choke. Lately, Render's been scoring major partnerships and expanding its use cases. The platform's supporting AI-generated content, AR/VR projects, and even big-time animation studios. With Nvidia GPUs priced like luxury cars, Render gives artists, designers, and creators affordable access to serious horsepower. Render's growing relevance in AI, virtual production, and digital content makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. This project isn't just following trends—it's leading them. Theta has always been about flipping the script on video streaming. Instead of relying on centralized servers that cost a fortune and lag under pressure, Theta uses a decentralized model where users share bandwidth and resources—and get paid for it. It's gearing up to dominate the next phase of internet content delivery. THETA token holders are loving the network's new use cases, and buyers are snapping up tokens expecting a serious surge once the market heats up again. Its evolution into edge computing and AI-backed content delivery locks it in as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. Finding the best altcoins to buy for next bull run isn't about chasing hype—it's about locking in projects solving real problems. Qubetics is breaking blockchain barriers with next-level interoperability. Render's changing how graphics rendering and AI content are created, while Theta is pushing video streaming and edge computing into the future. With Qubetics' crypto presale heating up and Render and Theta setting up for major growth, these three look like serious contenders. Qubetics delivers game-changing interoperability while offering huge ROI potential in its ongoing presale. Render's decentralized GPU network is booming thanks to rising demand in AI, gaming, and digital content creation. Theta's EdgeCloud now powers AI computing, edge rendering, and advanced content delivery—making it a serious contender. Analysts predict $10-$15 after mainnet launch, which could mean over 9,434% ROI for early backers. All three solve major real-world problems with proven use cases, making them the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.</p>

A widely followed analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) could break out of its slump with a massive counter-trend rally.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 890,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical trends, a huge test is coming for the top crypto asset by market cap, one that could see it skyrocket after it dips to its 2024 highs near the $72,000 level.

According to Cowen, BTC has immediate support near the March 2024 highs, but may also tap a previous downward resistance line currently at around $60,000.

“I'm still thinking that there's a good chance that Bitcoin will retest the 2024 high, and if it tests that trend line, sort of the lower high trend line, it would probably be a good short-term trade.

If it were to test that trend line all the way down, [it] would be a really good short-term trade by Bitcoin. You probably get a massive counter-trend rally off of that level, but I wouldn't necessarily be that optimistic for the remainder of the cycle if it were to in fact play out like that.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $75,366, down nearly 8% in the last 24 hours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin mining stocks are taking it on the chin alongside broader equity markets as competition ramps up to an all-time high and traders panic-sell equities amid tariff-led uncertainties. Most mining stocks fell more than 10% on Monday, adding to last week's sell-off. Other crypto-linked stocks, such as Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), also slid more than 10%. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs added uncertainties to the market and a trade war with China added more concerns for the miners. If the tariffs hold, they will likely make mining more expensive for those who are already navigating higher energy costs and lower profit margins following the recent halving that cut their rewards by half. Hashprice, a measure of daily income relative to hash power — has fallen to a record low $42.40, squeezing the miners even further. Aoyon Ashraf is CoinDesk's managing editor for Breaking News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. rolled out a sweeping new set of tariffs, creating ripples throughout global supply chains. Almost every imported product now faces at least a baseline 10% duty, but some nations felt the pinch more than others. China, in particular, saw significant hikes with tariffs reaching up to 54% on critical sectors like electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar cells. Vietnam didn't escape either, with a hefty 46% tariff impacting its key exports—think textiles and electronics. Vietnam is now looking at discussions and negotiations on the tariffs along with 50 other countries that have reached out to US for negotiations. And if you're shopping for a new ride, take note: a 25% tariff now hits all imported automobiles, affecting nearly half of U.S. auto sales. China responded swiftly, implementing a 34% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. imports starting April 10, 2025. These changes aren't just numbers—they're shaking up trade relationships, causing uncertainty, and forcing businesses everywhere to rethink their global strategies. For companies shipping electronics from Vietnam to the U.S., these shifting trade policies aren't just headlines—they're operational headaches. Meanwhile, your CFO asks whether rerouting production to another country would save millions. Artificial Intelligence can digest complex tariff codes and regulatory changes in real time, flagging risks before goods even leave the port. Blockchain, on the other hand, acts as a digital notary, locking in proof of where products were made, how they moved, and who handled them. Together, these technologies offer a smarter way to handle global trade friction. With AI models constantly scanning trade databases and tariff announcements, the logistics team can get immediate updates on the best shipping routes and cost projections. They change with political winds, react to global events, and often lack the clarity needed for confident decision-making. Businesses operating on tight margins can't afford guesswork. In this new era, having a digital infrastructure that supports transparent, automated, and verifiable decisions isn't just smart—it's necessary. Across the globe, startups and innovators are already working on this. Take OpenSC, an Australia-based platform that tracks products from origin to shelf using blockchain. Similarly, Everledger, a U.K.-based company, is applying blockchain to authenticate the origin of diamonds and other luxury goods. Now imagine applying that same concept to industrial goods—steel, semiconductors, lithium batteries—where origin determines tariff rates. What if every bolt, battery, or board came with a blockchain-verified passport? Predictive models are already helping companies assess the long-term cost implications of sourcing from one country over another. If tariffs on Vietnamese semiconductors jump next quarter, an AI model could suggest alternatives in real time—backed by real trade data, not assumptions. This allows companies to pivot faster, avoid disruptions, and maintain compliance. Recent research by the World Trade Organization found that misclassification of goods contributes to billions in lost revenue annually. AI's ability to detect errors or fraud in trade documentation can help minimize those losses dramatically. Blockchain's immutable ledger makes it virtually impossible to forge shipment logs or fake a product's origin. AI can then audit this data for inconsistencies or red flags, alerting compliance teams before issues become legal problems. Truebit's verification layer adds computational transparency—ensuring AI systems calculating tariffs are themselves accountable. This is vital in scenarios like the Trump administration's complex tariff structure, which included universal rates around 10% and country-specific duties, such as Cambodia's 49%. "While blockchains can immutably record shipping records, and AI can analyze tariff patterns, there's a critical verification gap between them,” said Jason Teutsch, Founder and Chief Scientist at Truebit. “Companies need proof that the AI's calculations themselves are trustworthy, especially with tariffs now ranging from 10% to nearly 50% depending on the country of origin. Like a notary for computational processes, verification technology can create proof that an AI system correctly applied the correct tariff rates and pulled data from legitimate sources – something customs authorities are increasingly demanding." Davide Costa, co-founder of the Quadrans Foundation, reinforced this with his experience: “We discovered that blockchain alone wasn't enough when tracking products across international borders. The moment data moves between systems or undergoes AI analysis, verification becomes critical. Verification technology ensures that customs authorities and trading partners can trust not just the records, but the calculations and transformations applied to that data—essential when regulatory compliance and billions in tariffs are on the line.” Even new stealth startups like Robotax are being built around this pain point. "The Trump administration's tariff reciprocity plan has a blind spot: we can't actually prove products are taxed correctly,” said David Deputy, a finance and regulatory tax software professional. “Blockchain can track a product moving from Nigeria to France to the USA, but it can't verify if the correct tariffs and sales or VAT tax were actually applied at each step. AI monitors the data flow, scanning for anomalies or mismatches against tariff rule sets. The future of tariffs doesn't have to be murky. As countries tighten regulations and implement digital customs systems, the companies that win will be those who lean into innovation. Tariffs may never go away—but the confusion, inefficiency, and risk associated with them? It's time for businesses to stop fighting yesterday's trade wars with outdated tools. The new era of global trade demands tech that's proactive, predictive, and permanent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Losses extended across altcoins, with major ones like Ether, XRP, and Solana suffering double-digit losses ahead of the US stock market opening. Bitcoin fell below $75,000 today, its lowest level since November, as crypto markets tumbled amid growing concerns over President Trump's new global tariff policies impacting Asian markets, CoinGecko data shows. The crypto market selloff intensified with major altcoins posting severe losses. Ether dropped 17% to trade under $1,400, levels not seen in March 2023. XRP declined 16% to $1.7, with its market cap falling to $102 million and losing its position among the top three crypto assets. The total crypto market capitalization decreased by over 10% to $2.5 trillion, representing approximately $100 billion in lost value within 10 hours. The decline coincided with sharp falls on Asian stock markets. Taiwan's benchmark index plunged nearly 10%, its largest single-day drop since 1990. Shares of major Taiwanese companies like TSMC and Foxconn tumbled nearly 10%, triggering automatic trading halts. Singapore's Straits Times Index wasn't spared either, slipping nearly 8%. Markets in Australia and New Zealand followed the downtrend. The ASX 200 in Australia dropped 6.3%, and New Zealand's NZX 50 slid more than 3.5%. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, said Monday he's been actively purchasing Bitcoin while maintaining a cautious stance on altcoins. “Been nibbling on $BTC all day, and shall continue,” Hayes said, indicating an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy amid market volatility. The analyst points to cheaper altcoins but expects Bitcoin's dominance – its share of the total crypto market cap – to increase towards 70%, implying Bitcoin's market-leading gains. “Shitcoins are getting in our strike zone,” he said, “but I think #bitcoin dominance keeps zooming towards 70%. So we are not gorging at the shitcoin supermarket.” Hayes reiterated that the catalyst for Bitcoin's growth is the central banks' continued use of monetary stimulus in response to economic slowdowns.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins play a key role in mainstream adoption, but the absence of a federal framework for stablecoins makes it difficult for financial services and enterprises to scale adoption. File this under things you couldn't say two years ago: Blockchain technology is maturing, and its potential for compliant, mainstream use is growing. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Karen Webster. Now, hundreds of billions of dollars move across blockchains while being stored in traditional financial institutions like banks or United States treasuries. “When we started the business in 2014, that wasn't yet a concept,” he said. Yet, challenges remain around global policy frameworks and the integration of concurrent advances such as artificial intelligence into on-chain ecosystems. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” he said, adding that as the conversation around crypto regulation evolves, providing clarity, compliance and insight will become more critical. Over a decade later, it boasts a dataset spanning 70 countries, capable of providing deep insights into how crypto is used, abused and regulated. As it relates to the growth of stablecoins, tracking real dollars rather than merely crypto tokens has broadened the scope of blockchain monitoring. “We now track not just cryptocurrency tokens, but … real dollars that are being used to settle financial transactions, remittances and payments all across the world on these rails.” Chainalysis is uniquely positioned to monitor the entire “supply chain of scam activity,” offering insight into how scammers procure tools and sell illicit services, Levin said. “We've helped the government seize more than $10 billion worth of crypto assets from criminal proceeds,” he said. “The cryptocurrency transactions that we've been able to link to those types of activities is actually a smaller percentage of the overall activity,” he said. “It started off much higher, but now it's consistently below 1% of the transactions that we can associate directly to these types of actors.” “Even the people who are advocating for the technology … don't also advocate for the fact that cryptocurrency has been much more effective as a tool for both enterprises identifying risky activity off-boarding bad clients from their platforms and law enforcement being able to hold scammers to account,” Levin said. Chainalysis itself continues to invest in educating enterprises about how blockchain works, using AI to simplify complex concepts for regulators and industry participants. “I'm very optimistic about the potential for AI to actually contextualize some of the transactions and concepts for people,” Levin said. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The partnership will also focus on training young professionals, government employees, and specialists in blockchain technologies, virtual asset management, and cybersecurity. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce proposed legislation to create licensed crypto banks that would offer regulated banking services related to digital assets. The introduction of crypto banks is expected to increase transaction volumes, boost tax revenues, and create new jobs in the fintech sector, positioning Kyrgyzstan as a regional hub for financial innovation. In a separate move to stabilize the sector, Kyrgyzstan's Cabinet of Ministers significantly raised the minimum authorized capital required for crypto exchanges, from 100 million KGS to 10 billion KGS, a hundredfold increase. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce, which initiated the reform, stated that the measure is designed to ensure the financial stability of crypto platforms, safeguard user interests, and foster a transparent and secure virtual assets market. Existing exchanges have until January 1, 2026, to comply with the new capital requirements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A whale's Ethereum worth $105 million was liquidated after ETH dropped $1,650, despite the whale adding 2,160 ETH to delay the liquidation. Ethereum faced intensified selling pressure in the past 24 hours, resulting in a sharp 19% decline that brought its price down to $1,460. This steep descent has unsettled the market and triggered significant liquidation events, including the collapse of a massive whale position tied to a $105 million collateralized loan. This effort slightly improved the collateral ratio from 152.13% to 160.25%. This drop activated liquidation protocols on the loan. A second liquidation of roughly 32,076 ETH against the same DAI value followed, and smaller liquidations were recorded again. These events totally liquidated the 67,500 ETH position, fully repaying a 74.4 million DAI loan. He also added 2,160 ETH of collateral to lower the liquidation line. While one position was fully liquidated, another whale narrowly avoided a similar fate by adjusting their holdings just in time. This second position originally held 57,000 ETH with a liquidation price set at $1,564. The market drop pushed ETH close to that threshold, posing a serious risk of forced liquidation. Roughly 90 minutes before hitting that margin, the wallet sold 3,920.8 ETH and exchanged it for 5.775 million DAI. Now holding 53,000 ETH, the adjusted liquidation threshold sits at $1,495, still within a vulnerable range given ongoing market volatility.

The EOS price has dropped significantly, but a potential ascending trend seems to be imminent. The bulls are trying hard to revive a rebound, which could elevate the levels back to $0.6 very soon. However, volume remains low, which could adversely impact the pace of recovery. Moreover, the 50-day MA is offering a strong base, which collides with the lower bands of Bollinger. Therefore, the FARTCOIN price is expected to trigger a rebound or else may drop to test the support levels and later trigger a rebound. However, the Bitcoin price has triggered a decent recovery, and if it rises above $78,000, the path towards a strong recovery may be activated. Otherwise, a plunge below $72,800 could further drag the entire crypto markets lower. Search keywords to find relevant professionals. Search keywords to find relevant market currencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kremlin-backed social network VK will close its NFT platform this month, following a year of deepening losses and a planned $1.36 billion share issue to reduce debt. Russian social media company VK plans to shut down its marketplace for non-fungible tokens, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, the team said, ending a service that was launched in December 2022. After April 15, the special visual markers on VK associated with NFTs — small neon diamonds that appeared on avatars — will be removed, leaving users who purchased NFTs for this feature with nothing. These included South Korean tech giant LG shutting down its LG Art Lab, as well as the closures of X2Y2, and Bybit's NFT marketplace, among others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Satoshi Street is witnessing a major selloff as the crypto market crash in response to escalating global tensions triggered by Trump's renewed tariff war. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have dropped 6–12% in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations exceeding $900 million. The steep correction has prompted analysts to question Bitcoin's “digital gold” narrative and its reliability as a hedge amid growing volatility. On Monday morning in Asian trading hours, crypto market crashed as risk-ON assets faced heavy volatility. Top markets like China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, hit circuit breakers in the early trading hours on Monday, with their indexes crashing 10%, sending the global markets into a situation of absolute turmoil. As per the Coinglass data, BTC's 24-hour liquidations have surged to $322 million. Based on the Bitcoin technical chart, $77,500 is a crucial support level for BTC. If it fails to hold these levels, further correction could be deeper. Although Bitcoin price showed resilience to the Dow Jones crash last week, it is down by 7% today. However, it is still performing better as Asian indices are down 9-10% today. Following today's crypto market crash, Peter Schiff took the opportunity to add: “After a delayed reaction on Friday, crypto is finally starting to crack. It could be a long day for those trapped in Bitcoin ETFs”. As Donald Trump's tariff war increases odds of US recession, debates over Bitcoin's “digital gold” status have picked up once again. Long-term players still continue to remain bullish about BTC despite this volatility. A global, digital, apolitical store of value — controlled by no nation — looks increasingly differentiated. The altcoins market correction has extended further with Ethereum (ETH) price crashing 13.5% at press time and plummeting to $1,550. However, on-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that whales are buying the ETH price dips. XRP price is down 14.5%, dropping under the crucial $2 support, while analysts predict a further crash to $0.65 ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum network has reached a historic milestone with 200,000 addresses holding stablecoins. This record adoption is establishing itself as the backbone of a more mature digital economy, potentially reshuffling the cards for this altcoin whose price struggles to take off. Ethereum has just crossed a historic threshold: more than 200,000 unique addresses now hold stablecoins. Unlike previous bullish cycles marked by speculation, the adoption of stablecoins follows a stable and sustainable trajectory. USDT dominates the market, while USDC and DAI are gradually gaining ground. This figure of 200,000 addresses takes on great importance when considering that it represents a significant share of users who are truly active on Ethereum. This stability has become essential to attract new users who are less inclined to endure the extreme fluctuations of assets like bitcoin or Ethereum itself. This increased liquidity facilitates more efficient transactions and paves the way for more accessible and less costly cross-border financial services than traditional solutions. Regulators' attention is intensifying, particularly regarding the transparency of reserves and compliance with anti-money laundering rules. This record adoption of stablecoins comes at a paradoxical time for Ethereum. The upcoming Pectra update, scheduled for May 7, 2025, could also play a crucial role in this dynamic.
