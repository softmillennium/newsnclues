Key Takeaways:

VK, one of Russia's largest social media platforms, announced that it would shut down its NFT marketplace, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, due to mounting financial losses.

The move follows VK's 2024 net loss of 94.9 billion rubles (around $1.1 billion), nearly triple its 2023 losses of 34.3 billion rubles.VK Financial Struggles and the Collapse of Its NFT Marketplace

To reduce its debt load, VK plans to issue $1.36 billion in new shares, a decision made amid deepening financial setbacks.

The company has urged users to move their NFTs to external wallets before April 15 to avoid losing access to their assets.

After that date, the platform will remove the neon diamond icons on user avatars that once indicated NFT ownership.

Users who bought NFTs mainly for avatar integration will lose their visual indicators on VK.

While the VK NFT community page will remain accessible, the company has not confirmed whether it plans to return to the NFT or digital asset space in the future.

VK's exit comes during a downturn in the NFT sector, reflecting broader trends across the industry.

1/ After an incredible 3-year journey, I have some important news to share: X2Y2 will be sunsetting as an NFT marketplace on April 30, 2025. The contracts will remain live, but the platform itself will shut down.‚Äî TP | X2Y2 (@tp_x2y2) 

Recently, NFT marketplace X2Y2 and crypto exchange Bybit also announced closures of their respective NFT platforms.

This momentum led brands, artists, musicians, and sports organizations to create their own digital assets and collectibles.

Yet, much like the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, the NFT market proved unsustainable in the long run, fueled more by speculation than lasting value. 96% of highly-ranked NFTs in 2022 are worthless today/ Source: NFTEvening

Collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw record prices during the boom.

The shutdown shows digital asset platforms must build sustainable operations and ensure clear asset protection. It firmly warns that relying solely on market hype leaves platforms vulnerable to abrupt exits. How might this decision influence future market models for digital content? 

The closure could prompt a redesign of market models that focus on secure, transparent digital commerce. Stakeholders may adopt new criteria to evaluate underlying asset value rather than transient market trends. What role do emerging technical standards play in light of such platform exits? 

New tech standards can boost security and compatibility. As providers reevaluate operations, updated protocols may offer clearer benchmarks for verifying digital assets and managing custody efficiently.

President Donald Trump's aggressive new tariff policy last week has sent markets reeling, with crypto investors feeling the pain after trillions of dollars were wiped from global stock indices.

On Monday, Bitcoin's price recovered slightly after dropping below $75,000 during early morning trade. The crypto is hovering near $80,000, up 3% over the last 24 hours. 

Still, more volatility is to come as investors try to navigate a new global economic order under Trump. Paying attention to the U.S. bond markets is key. 

As pointed out by macro expert and crypto analyst Lynn Alden on X, bond yields on Monday jumped while the stock market plunged. But why should crypto investors or Bitcoiners care? 

"It's a lot of things that are not explained with a simple narrative, Michael Lebowitz, portfolio manager at RIA Advisors, told Decrypt. "Likely, when people sold their stock, they didn't need the bond with the hedge anymore, so they sold the bonds too."

"I'm always very careful not to say, well, maybe China was selling, or maybe they think that tariffs are inflationary, because there's just so much volatility in these markets," he added.

When investors buy U.S. treasuries, they are paid a yield. As treasuries rise in high demand, the fixed income is lower; when the treasuries are not as sought after, the yield goes up.

Monday's yield surge, particularly on the 10-year, meant demand for U.S. treasuries fell. This sometimes happens when investors sell treasuries to raise cash, a typical safe-haven, as other investments drop in price‚Äîin today's case, stocks.

Typically, a rising yield signals expectations of stronger growth or higher inflation, while a falling yield often reflects flight to safety or a weaker economic outlook.

Experts told Decrypt the rise in yields was a sign of harsher market forces at play, in particular, slow growth and expectations of higher inflation. 

Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, Greg Magadini, noted that Trump's tariffs could become ‚Äúdirect contributors to inflationary forces.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere's another more worrying risk‚Äîwhat if instead of merely experiencing a trade war, our international creditors protest [against] buying treasuries?‚Äù he said.

In other words, as other countries retaliate against Trump's strict tariffs, they could sell off U.S. treasuries. 

‚ÄúRising yields in the face of falling equities sends a clear message: The market thinks the Fed's hands are tied,‚Äù Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. 

‚ÄúIf inflation proves stickier than expected, central banks may have no choice but to keep conditions tighter for longer,‚Äù adding that this was ‚Äúnot great for risk assets.‚Äù

Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have typically traded with other risk assets like tech stocks, and have done well in a low-interest rate environment. 

While Bitcoin was trading down on Monday, its reaction to rising bond yields wasn't as inverse as stocks. 

Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, told Decrypt that while 10-year Treasury yields surged on Monday, Bitcoin's reaction was ‚Äúnotably subdued.‚Äù 

‚ÄúUnlike in 2022, rising yields did not trigger a wave of forced liquidations or volatility in crypto markets, suggesting that BTC may be decoupling from old macro sensitivities,‚Äù he added.  

The decoupling narrative‚Äîthat Bitcoin is not trading like tech stocks‚Äîhas been circulating Crypto Twitter again lately. Could it be finally happening?

Silicon Valley has always been known for causing disruption. But now, it's getting disrupted itself. From the outside, the logos haven't changed; Meta, Google, Apple and the venture capital elite still roam Sand Hill Road.

But underneath all that, a silent change is underway. Crypto isn't just a tech trend floating through the Bay. It's gutting the system from its roots‚Äîhow innovation is funded, who gets to build and where value goes.

It's no longer just about startups; it's about sovereignty, and Silicon Valley doesn't run the table anymore.

Before we go deeper, let's be clear‚Äîcrypto didn't only challenge finance. It cracked open the core assumptions of how Silicon Valley operates.

From Ethereum to Solana, from DAOs to NFTs, from meme coins to decentralized storage networks‚Äîwe're watching the infrastructure of the Valley get reverse-engineered in real time. And this time, it's not coming from a garage in Palo Alto.

Let's check it all out!

Back in the day, if you had a big tech idea, you needed to pitch it to a handful of gatekeepers. You flew out to Menlo Park, ran through your slides and hoped a VC partner would give you a term sheet. That funnel of funding? It decided who got to build and who didn't.

But crypto broke that model.

The 2017 ICO boom (yes, the Wild West days) proved a new thing: you didn't need VCs to raise capital‚Äîyou just needed a whitepaper and a global internet connection.

EOS raised $4.1 billion without a product. Filecoin raised $257 million. Even now, with regulations tightening, token-based fundraising and community presales still generate millions.

More importantly, crypto flipped the power structure. Projects could rally global communities, not just accredited investors.

Now in 2025, data shows that early-stage crypto projects are raising significant rounds from hybrid models (part private, part public) using smart contract-managed treasuries instead of board-controlled bank accounts.

And yes, the gambling world took notice as well. With such smooth payments and privacy benefits, blockchain-based sportsbooks surged in 2024.

This is where people like Kim Weidemann come in. After spending years covering online gambling and Web3 integration, she reviewed more than 70 crypto-betting sites before publishing her picks for the best crypto sports betting sites for April 2025.

Her list wasn't all about flashy UX or low fees‚Äîbut it focused on decentralization, fairness and user ownership‚Äîvalues you rarely saw celebrated by old-school Silicon Valley products.

And that's where the real break happens.

In the Valley, users are the product. Whether it's your clicks on Facebook, your location via Uber, or your playlists on Spotify, data extraction has always been the name of the game.

Platforms monetize you. In crypto? The ideal flips. Users are stakeholders. Token models, even in betting, share profits, governance rights and influence. You don't just use the product, you help shape it.

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) turned this concept into reality. They're not experimental governance toys‚Äîthey're fully operational economic engines.

In 2024 alone, more than 2,100 DAOs had assets under management exceeding $30 billion globally. And none of them needed CEOs, boards, or Delaware C-corps to scale.

Let's not sugarcoat it‚ÄîSilicon Valley loves a hero story. Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, Zuck, Tim Cook. You know the drill. The myth of the lone genius leading a team of hundreds‚Äîit's a narrative that props up investor confidence and helps power media cycles.

But crypto couldn't care less.

Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever they are, disappeared. Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin remains the closest thing to a figurehead, but even he's constantly pushing decisions to the community and minimizing his influence. Many projects now launch anonymously or with pseudonymous teams, and they do just fine.

Because it's not about who builds it. It's about who maintains it.

But with smart contracts, protocol upgrades and community governance, charisma is no longer a prerequisite for leadership. This breaks Silicon Valley's top-down hierarchy‚Äîthe very thing that kept innovation locked behind Stanford resumes and VC intros.

In the Valley, proprietary tech is your moat. You file patents, close your source code, build walled gardens and sue if someone gets too close.

In crypto? You launch open-source by default. If someone forks your code, great. Let the market decide.

This radical transparency pushes development, and ironically, increases trust. Users know what's under the hood.

Developers can contribute without gatekeeping, and ecosystems grow fast, instead of being stifled by legal departments and licensing fees.

Ethereum, one of the most successful crypto platforms to date, is entirely open-source‚Äîwith hundreds of teams building on top, around and underneath its core protocol.

The Solana ecosystem added more than 2,800 new developers in 2024 alone, with open dev tools and real-time feedback loops across thousands of GitHub repos.

You simply don't see this level of organic, distributed innovation inside a traditional FAANG team.

Silicon Valley figured out how to scale platforms. Facebook doesn't post content. Uber doesn't own cars. Airbnb doesn't own property. Spotify doesn't make music.

But guess who owns the profits? The platforms.

Crypto rearchitected this model‚Äîjust imagine a ride-sharing service where drivers earn directly in tokens, vote on protocol upgrades and receive long-term value for their participation.

Or a betting site where the odds, rules and rewards are all on-chain, and the revenue gets distributed among the people who play and promote it.

It's not theory anymore‚Äîthis is happening now.

Take Audius, a decentralized music platform. It now has more than 7 million monthly users and pays artists directly, without intermediaries.

Of course, nothing in crypto moves without friction. Regulatory pushback is real. In the U.S., the SEC continues targeting high-profile projects.

Coinbase, Ripple, Uniswap‚Äîall have faced intense scrutiny. In 2023, the SEC filed 46 crypto-related enforcement actions, up from 30 in 2022.

But the innovation isn't stopping there‚Äîin fact, Silicon Valley's own elite are now split, with some turning toward crypto entirely. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has now deployed more than $7.6 billion into Web3. PayPal launched its own stablecoin. Stripe resumed support for crypto payouts.

Even Apple is quietly bringing more crypto-friendly features, including wallet compatibility and developer APIs that support NFT handling.

So, while the government tries to define crypto in legal terms, builders are moving on‚Äîand fast.

The Valley isn't going anywhere‚Äîand it still has the money, the minds and the influence. But it no longer has a monopoly on innovation.

Crypto opened the gates‚Äînot just to new technology, but to a new model of value creation. One that rewards users, decentralizes power and moves faster than any board meeting ever could.

For decades, Silicon Valley prided itself on changing the world. Now crypto is doing the same‚Äîwithout asking for permission.

Navigating the world of technology can be challenging, but Katerina Orr loves riding into the eye of the storm. Her biggest strength is her knack for translating complex concepts into accessible content. Balancing a thriving career in content creation on entrepreneurship and technology, she finds solace in her cozy home with a loving husband and an energetic dog.

The tech world was abuzz as President-elect Donald Trump announced his latest appointment: David Sacks, a Silicon Valley stalwart, as the new czar for artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency.

Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has reportedly been appointed to advise Pakistan on Web3 and blockchain technology.

Local media in Pakistan is reporting that CZ has joined the Pakistan Crypto Council as a strategic advisor for the country of 247 million.

Says Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Minister of Pakistan, of CZ's involvement,

‚ÄúThis is a landmark moment for Pakistan.

We are sending a clear message to the world: Pakistan is open for innovation. 

With CZ onboard, we are accelerating our vision to make Pakistan a regional powerhouse for Web3, digital finance, and blockchain-driven growth.‚Äù

Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council said,

‚ÄúPakistan is opening its doors to the future of finance.

And who better to guide us on this journey than CZ ‚Äî a pioneer who built the world's largest crypto exchange and changed the way billions think about financial freedom.‚Äù

According to CZ, Pakistan offers ‚Äúlimitless‚Äù potential to crypto.

Last week, the Binance founder also inked a deal to advance crypto technologies in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan.

Said CZ at the time,

‚ÄúI officially and unofficially advise a few governments on their crypto regulatory frameworks and blockchain solutions for gov efficiency, expanding blockchain to more than trading. I find this work extremely meaningful.‚Äù

 Corporate Bitcoin holdings have sunk to about $54.5 billion from nearly $59 billion on April 2. 

Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries collectively shed more than $4 billion in value after US President Donald Trump's tariffs triggered a global market sell-off, data shows. 

As of April 7, corporate Bitcoin holdings are worth approximately $54.5 billion in the aggregate, down from roughly $59 billion before April 2, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net.

The cryptocurrency's volatility has also weighed on publicly traded Bitcoin holders' share prices. 

The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) ‚Äî an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking a diverse basket of corporate Bitcoin holders ‚Äî has lost more than 13% since Trump announced sweeping US import tariffs on April 2, according to Yahoo Finance.

Even shares of Strategy ‚Äî the de facto Bitcoin hedge fund founded by Michael Saylor that pioneered corporate Bitcoin buying ‚Äî are down, clocking losses of more than 13% since April 2, Google Finance data showed. 

The losses highlight ongoing concerns about Bitcoin's increasing popularity as a corporate treasury asset. Historically, corporate treasuries hold extremely low-risk assets like US Treasury Bills. 

‚ÄúCryptocurrencies' high volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape are misaligned with the fundamental goals of treasury management [such as] stability, liquidity, and capital preservation,‚Äù David Krause, a finance professor at Marquette University, said in a January research publication.

In 2024, surging Bitcoin prices pushed Strategy's shares up more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. 

Strategy's success has inspired dozens of copycats, but investors are becoming skeptical.

In March, GameStop lost nearly $3 billion in market capitalization as shareholders second-guessed the videogame retailer's plans to stockpile Bitcoin. 

‚ÄúThere are question marks with GameStop's model. If bitcoin is going to be the pivot, where does that leave everything else?‚Äù Bret Kenwell, US investment analyst at eToro, told Reuters on March 27.

Still, adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries can ‚Äúpotentially be a valuable hedge against growing fiscal deficits, currency debasement, and geopolitical risks,‚Äù asset manager Fidelity Digital Assets said in a 2024 report.

That thesis may already be playing out as Trump's tariffs rattle markets, Binance said in an April 7 research report.  

‚Äú[I]n the wake of recent tariff announcements, BTC has shown some signs of resilience, holding steady or rebounding on days when traditional risk assets faltered,‚Äù Binance said.

Investors ‚Äúwill be watching closely to see if BTC is able to retain its appeal as a non-sovereign, permissionless asset in a protectionist global economy,‚Äù according to the report.

Bitcoin prices fell below a key psychological threshold on Monday as the financial markets sell-off intensified, but cryptocurrency experts believe it's likely to hold up better than other asset classes if a global trade war drags on.

The cryptocurrency, which trades around the clock, was at $79,000 Monday afternoon, down fractionally since the morning and recovering some of its earlier losses. It is now down about 15% in the year so far.  

Bitcoin is a digital currency and virtual payment system designed to exist outside the control of any central entity, in contrast to fiat currencies which are controlled by governments, like the U.S. dollar or the Swiss franc.

Prices for many cryptocurrencies surged after the November election when Donald Trump pledged to cut regulation and create a strategic bitcoin reserve. Trump also launched a meme coin just days before being inaugurated in January.

‚ÄúSince the election stocks are down and bitcoin is up,‚Äù said Matthew Sigel, head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, which has $113.8 billion in assets under management, including in several cryptocurrency funds. ‚ÄúIt feels to me like the White House's attempts to reorder global trade may actually be working in bitcoin and crypto's benefit.‚Äù

Despite its origins as an alternative asset class, bitcoin has tended to trade in the same direction as riskier stocks. As the global financial rout continues, bitcoin has also sold off, noted Austin Campbell, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. But that's been tempered by another trend, as global markets lose confidence in the U.S. dollar, which has long been seen as the world's most important currency.

‚ÄúHistory so far has shown us there is not another individual currency that people are rallying around right now,‚Äù Campbell said. ‚ÄúInstead, you would look to gold and bitcoin as neutral assets, stores of value, the kinds of things that has been used for, for thousands of years. And in bitcoin's case, aspirationaly, trying to be the digital version of gold.‚Äù

That's why bitcoin has been volatile ‚Äì moving up and down ‚Äì but not making many big moves one way or the other, Campbell said.

While bitcoin has long had true believers, it has also had detractors who question its purpose. But Sigel told USA TODAY, ‚ÄúWe're very positive on bitcoin in the longer term. We see continued adoption.‚Äù

Since early 2024, exchange-traded funds have been able to hold bitcoin, rather than just futures contracts tied to its price. Many large firms now hold the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets, as well, Sigel noted. ‚ÄúWe have high conviction that will continue.‚Äù

But it's possible some of the White House's policies may wind up at odds with others, Campbell pointed out. Trump's support for cryptocurrency ‚Äì which by definition defies national borders ‚Äì is ‚Äúinternally inconsistent‚Äù with his administration's stated goal of nationalist populism, he said.</p>

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the market could see another 20% drop, but that the current drawdown is a buying opportunity in the long term as the current situation doesn't pose systematic risk.



‚ÄúI see it more as a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity, but that doesn't mean we can't go down further,‚Äù Fink said during an appearance at the Economic Club of New York on Monday.



He noted that inflationary pressure is higher than market participants expect and that many already believe the U.S. to be in a recession. As a result, he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.



Last month, Fink published a letter to shareholders, warning about Bitcoin's (BTC) threat to the U.S. dollar, which could weaken if Americans believe the cryptocurrency to be a safer asset than the dollar.



Markets, including the crypto market, have been in turmoil since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a host of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. BTC is currently trading 5% lower over the past five days and 11% lower in the past month. Stocks were hit even worse with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down 13% and 15%, respectively.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is set to premiere Nicholas Bruckman's NFT documentary Minted in key global territories this week, including in North America.


	The film, subtitled The Rise (and Fall?) of the NFT, provides audiences with ‚Äúa front-row seat to the explosive emergence of the turbulent NFT (non-fungible token) phenomenon as it erupts into a $40 billion digital gold rush.‚Äù It debuts Wednesday on Netflix in North America, the UK, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand.


Minted held its world premiere at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival, followed by an international premiere at CPH:DOX in Copenhagen. It was broadcast on the PBS series Independent Lens earlier this year.

	In some sense, NFTs represent an inherent contradiction. They are digital assets ‚Äì meaning, in theory, they can be reproduced endlessly and perfectly. But using block chain technology a single artwork or piece of music, for instance, can be made unique and therefore collectible. The market for NFTs took off four years ago, the timeframe when the documentary opens.




			Watch on Deadline		







	‚ÄúIt begins with the artist known as Beeple, whose record-shattering $69 million digital art sale sends shockwaves through the traditional art world,‚Äù notes a release. ‚ÄúFollowing Beeple and a pioneering group of multidisciplinary artists from the U.S., Latin America, and Africa, Bruckman explores the soaring highs and chaotic lows of this polarizing movement as it unfolds, examining the intersection of technology, artistic expression, and value.‚Äù


	The release continues, ‚ÄúAgainst the backdrop of the NFT market's dramatic rise and collapse, Minted places the phenomenon within the broader arc of art history and offers a nuanced perspective on its evolution and enduring impact.‚Äù


	In a statement, Bruckman said, ‚ÄúI'm ecstatic to see Minted reach new audiences as it rolls out on Netflix. Love or hate NFTs, we hope the film entertains viewers and sparks big conversations about how art, finance, and tech are colliding.‚Äù


	By some estimates, the market for NFTs will reach more than $350 billion by 2032. But similar to cryptocurrency, it's a highly speculative enterprise, complicating any attempt at forecasts.


Minted is directed, written, and produced by Bruckman; produced and executive produced by Rahilla Zafar; and written and produced by Shawn Hazelett. The film is a production of Bruckman's film, TV, and branded content studio People's Television, Inc.

	











	Range Media Partners negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmaker, with global sales agency CAT&Docs handling international sales of the film.


	Bruckman's credits include the Emmy-nominated Not Going Quietly (PBS POV, Hulu) about the late activist Ady Barkan, and the immigration documentary La Americana (PBS America Reframed, Nat Geo).

Ethereum faced heightened selling pressure for a lengthy period due to the volatility in the broader crypto market, causing its price to undergo a sharp pullback close to the $1,400 mark. However, recent trends show that ETH seems to be entering a calmer phase as bulls are gradually taking control of the market in anticipation of a rebound.

Although Ethereum's price has declined sharply below key support levels, investors' sentiment is starting to shift toward a more positive outlook. A report from Darkfost, an on-chain data and technical expert, reveals bullish behavior from investors on one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance.

As reported by Darkfost, ETH is showing early signs of a potential turnaround to a calmer phase on Binance, as selling pressure appears to be slowly fading. This suggests a decrease in the amount of ETH being offloaded by traders and investors on the platform, marking an encouraging moment for the altcoin and its price trajectory.

The drop in sell-side pressure on the crypto exchange is a sign that bears or sellers are losing control of the market after a period of intense downward movement in ETH's price. Darfost revealed the development after a thorough examination of the Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio metric on Binance. 

Specifically, the taker buy-sell ratio is a key metric that compares the volume of buy orders to the volume of sell orders in the order book. Furthermore, it aids in visualizing the prevailing tendency, which appears to be changing at the moment.

A 7-day Simple Moving Average (SAM) view of the taker buy-sell ratio shows that the volume has flipped into positive territory, rising above level 1. Looking at the chart, the recent move above the level marks the third time since the beginning of this year, indicating investors' resilience in volatile periods.

In the meantime, the easing selling pressure may act as a launchpad for price stabilization or a price recovery in the short term as bullish momentum picks up. Darkfost highlighted that it might contribute to the formation of a bottom and, at the very least, temporarily stop the bloodbath in Ethereum if the pattern persists.

However, the expert noted that the trend is still too weak to make any clear conclusions, even though it is an encouraging sign for Ethereum's price dynamics. Thus far, Investors are closely monitoring whether bulls can take advantage of the change and propel ETH toward a short-term recovery.

The easing selling pressure might have raised the possibility of ETH experiencing a rebound in the short term. However, the altcoin‚Äòs pullback is more likely to extend after its recent drop below a key chart pattern.

Following his examination of Ethereum's price action, Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst, has identified a massive multi-year Triangle formation, which ETH has fallen below. According to the analyst, its break below the pattern would lead to an extension of the ongoing pullback, with ETH dropping as low as $1,105 in the upcoming months.

Crypto markets have been flipping the script again. Bitcoin is teasing those all-time highs, and suddenly every altcoin looks like it's waking up from hibernation. Whale activity is back, and major players are throwing serious money at projects with real utility. With the next bull run potentially around the corner, smart community members are scouring the market for the best altcoins to buy for next bull run‚Äîand there's no shortage of contenders.

What sets Qubetics ($TICS) apart is how it's fixing one of crypto's biggest headaches‚Äîblockchain interoperability. It's not just slapping together buzzwords but offering a real-world solution that's already grabbing attention. Alongside Qubetics, Render and Theta are pushing their own tech limits, giving this list some serious heavy hitters ready to shine when the market explodes. Let's dive into the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Qubetics is making waves by solving one of blockchain's nastiest problems‚Äîgetting separate networks to talk to each other. Its interoperability framework is built to make data, assets, and applications move seamlessly between blockchains, unlocking a whole new level of utility.

Think about a Toronto-based NFT creator wanting to sell digital art on a Solana marketplace while their assets sit on Ethereum. With Qubetics, they don't need a middleman or deal with double fees. The platform's AI-driven QubeQode IDE handles it, shifting assets across networks without breaking a sweat. Or picture a North Carolina logistics firm wanting to manage shipments on VeChain but needing payments processed on Polygon. Qubetics makes that combo possible‚Äîsmooth, fast, and secure.



For small businesses, professionals, and regular folks tired of getting stuck in one ecosystem, this is a game-changer. It means no more worrying if a project's on the wrong chain or missing out on opportunities because of network limitations.

Right now, the Qubetics crypto presale is lighting up the scene. It's in stage 29, and over 506 million $TICS tokens are already out there, snapped up by more than 24,300 holders. The presale pulled in a solid $15.8 million. And here's the kicker: $TICS is still sitting at just $0.1573 per token.

Analysts aren't holding back either. If $TICS touches $1 post-presale, backers are looking at a 535% ROI. A $5 jump spikes it to 3,078%. At $6, it's a wild 3,713%. Some see it blasting to $10 or even $15 once the mainnet drops‚Äîwhich would mean 6,256% to 9,434% returns. Try finding another project throwing down numbers like that.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics isn't just a whitepaper fantasy. Its real-world interoperability solution is built for the long haul, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Render has been turning heads in the digital art and AI scene. With more demand for graphics rendering than ever‚Äîfrom Hollywood studios to indie game developers‚ÄîRender's decentralized GPU network steps in where traditional services choke.

Lately, Render's been scoring major partnerships and expanding its use cases. The platform's supporting AI-generated content, AR/VR projects, and even big-time animation studios. With Nvidia GPUs priced like luxury cars, Render gives artists, designers, and creators affordable access to serious horsepower.

The token's performance reflects that buzz. RNDR has been climbing the charts, riding bullish sentiment driven by the explosion of AI and digital content. More creators are locking in Render as their go-to platform, and community members are taking notice.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Render's growing relevance in AI, virtual production, and digital content makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. This project isn't just following trends‚Äîit's leading them.



Theta has always been about flipping the script on video streaming. Instead of relying on centralized servers that cost a fortune and lag under pressure, Theta uses a decentralized model where users share bandwidth and resources‚Äîand get paid for it.

Recently, Theta rolled out its EdgeCloud platform, boosting its capabilities way beyond just streaming. It now supports AI computing, edge rendering, and video-based AI agents. In plain English? It's gearing up to dominate the next phase of internet content delivery.

Partnerships with major media outlets and sports organizations keep pouring in, and the community's backing is growing fast. THETA token holders are loving the network's new use cases, and buyers are snapping up tokens expecting a serious surge once the market heats up again.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Theta's taking on a massive industry with a solution that actually works. Its evolution into edge computing and AI-backed content delivery locks it in as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Finding the best altcoins to buy for next bull run isn't about chasing hype‚Äîit's about locking in projects solving real problems. Qubetics is breaking blockchain barriers with next-level interoperability. Render's changing how graphics rendering and AI content are created, while Theta is pushing video streaming and edge computing into the future.

With Qubetics' crypto presale heating up and Render and Theta setting up for major growth, these three look like serious contenders. Community members aiming to ride the next bull run won't want to sit this one out.

Qubetics delivers game-changing interoperability while offering huge ROI potential in its ongoing presale.

Render's decentralized GPU network is booming thanks to rising demand in AI, gaming, and digital content creation.

Theta's EdgeCloud now powers AI computing, edge rendering, and advanced content delivery‚Äîmaking it a serious contender.

Analysts predict $10-$15 after mainnet launch, which could mean over 9,434% ROI for early backers.

All three solve major real-world problems with proven use cases, making them the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

After holding relatively stable during last week's global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.

Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound.

Bitcoin's prices haven't been this low since just after President Donald Trump's Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin's price broke $100,000 in December. Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year. 

Bitcoin's backers say it is a type of digital gold that can act as a hedge against volatility. But Garrick Hileman, an independent cryptocurrency analyst, said bitcoin's price slide shows that thesis still hasn't proven to be true.

‚ÄúIt's just not there today,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú(Bitcoin) trades like a risky tech stock.‚Äù

Other major digital assets saw even bigger one-day percentage drops on Monday morning.

Ether, the second most popular crypto token, was trading at about $1,500 on Monday morning. It's lost about half of its value since Trump's son, Eric Trump, encouraged his followers on social media to buy ether in early February.

President Trump's own meme coin, which he launched just before taking office and once hit a high of more than $70, dipped below $8 Monday morning.

Stock prices of crypto-focused companies also saw declines in early trading Monday.

Bitcoin and most altcoin prices continued their strong downtrend on Monday as market participants braced for a recession. 

Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $74,428 on April 7, its lowest level since November 6, and down by over 31% from its highest point this year.

Altcoins did much worse as many investors exited their positions. Ethereum (ETH) crashed below $1,500 and moved to its lowest level since 2023. The other top laggards were coins like Berachain (BERA), Zcash (ZEC), Litecoin (LTC), and Maker (MKR).

The ongoing crypto market crash mirrored the stock market's performance, with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 each falling by over 5% but has staged a late morning comeback.

These assets plunged after Donald Trump remained adamant that his Liberation Day tariffs would continue, citing the large US trade deficits. This trade war has pushed more analysts, including those from Goldman Sachs to boost their recession odds. 

Still, there are two main reasons why stocks and crypto prices may bounce back soon. First, there are signs that Trump is open to negotiations with other countries. In a statement on Friday, he said that Vietnam was ready to eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods. 

In another statement on Monday, he said that talks were underway with Japan, a top trading partner. Japan is now sending a team of negotiators to the U.S., which could result in a significant deal, including a purchase agreement.

With the U.S. stock market under pressure, there's a likelihood that Trump will seek a major deal with countries like China and those in the European Union.

Second, there is a likelihood that the Federal Reserve will intervene as it has done in the past black swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Global Financial Crisis. Traders expect five interest rate cuts this year, including an emergency one. In a note, a Bloomberg analyst said:

‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve may soon not have a choice but to cut rates. Tariffs raise the ugly specter of inflation, true, but if growth turns pear-shaped, the Fed will have no choice but to prioritize the economy.‚Äù

Therefore, a combination of interest rate cuts and trade negotiations could help reverse the ongoing crypto market crash. For example, Bitcoin and altcoins surged to record highs in 2021 after the Fed slashed interest rates and implemented quantitative easing during the pandemic.

WeBank Technology Services has unveiled POTOS (Portal of the Orient Symposium for Web3), a new blockchain and real world asset (RWA) tokenization infrastructure targeting Hong Kong's Web3 ecosystem. In its initial phase, POTOS provides a three layer ‚Äòvalue exchange' infrastructure solution for institutions: a high performance blockchain to connect different asset types, cross chain protocols enabling atomic swaps, and advanced security technologies including zero knowledge proofs.

‚ÄúWe hope that this value exchange evolution, driven by the trust machine, can truly solidify the foundation of trust for the advancement of Hong Kong's Web3 ecosystem,‚Äù said Henry Ma, EVP and CIO of WeBank. As a wholly owned subsidiary of WeBank in Hong Kong, the company aims to leverage its blockchain expertise to help position Hong Kong as a hub for compliant and innovative Web3 practices. WeBank was founded by Tencent, the owner of WeChat Pay, and still retains a 30% interest in the company.

POTOS is built on the FISCO BCOS blockchain platform, a Chinese open source initiative spearheaded by WeBank. The system boasts financial grade performance with processing capacity of up to 200,000 TPS and horizontal scalability. Since becoming fully open source in 2017, the platform has been implemented in over 500 digital transformation projects and established a community of more than 5,000 institutions and 100,000 individuals.

This development aligns with broader trends in WeBank's blockchain strategy. At a 2023 conference in China, a senior WeBank executive discussed the potential for an ‚ÄúOpen Consortium Chain 2.0‚Äù to target Web3 opportunities. While China restricts cryptocurrency and public blockchains, WeBank is working to transition from permissioned consortium chains to blockchains ‚Äúwith a public spirit.‚Äù By 2023 the bank's  blockchain had processed over 400 million transactions with around 30 applications.

Meanwhile, in the competitive landscape, WeBank's main rival Ant has focused its international blockchain efforts on cross border payments, including tokenized deposits and stablecoins. Ant recently announced partnerships with Standard Chartered and OCBC bank for its Whale platform, including for enabling 24/7 real time payments between Singapore and Malaysia.

Economic tariffs could be helped with technology.

getty

Blockchain and AI may soon feel the effects of sweeping changes in global trade policies, as tariffs became the talk of the town in April 2025‚Äîand not just in trade circles. The U.S. rolled out a sweeping new set of tariffs, creating ripples throughout global supply chains. Almost every imported product now faces at least a baseline 10% duty, but some nations felt the pinch more than others.

China, in particular, saw significant hikes with tariffs reaching up to 54% on critical sectors like electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar cells. Vietnam didn't escape either, with a hefty 46% tariff impacting its key exports‚Äîthink textiles and electronics. Vietnam is now looking at discussions and negotiations on the tariffs along with 50 other countries that have reached out to US for negotiations.

Europe, Japan, and India weren't left out of the tariff wave either, facing new duties of 20%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. And if you're shopping for a new ride, take note: a 25% tariff now hits all imported automobiles, affecting nearly half of U.S. auto sales.

The reaction? China responded swiftly, implementing a 34% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. imports starting April 10, 2025. These changes aren't just numbers‚Äîthey're shaking up trade relationships, causing uncertainty, and forcing businesses everywhere to rethink their global strategies.

For companies shipping electronics from Vietnam to the U.S., these shifting trade policies aren't just headlines‚Äîthey're operational headaches. Imagine you're running a supply chain for a hardware startup. Your team scrambles to determine whether the latest tariff rates affect your products, and if so, by how much. Meanwhile, your CFO asks whether rerouting production to another country would save millions. This is where emerging tech‚ÄîAI and blockchain‚Äîsteps in, not as buzzwords, but as lifelines.

Artificial Intelligence can digest complex tariff codes and regulatory changes in real time, flagging risks before goods even leave the port. Blockchain, on the other hand, acts as a digital notary, locking in proof of where products were made, how they moved, and who handled them. Together, these technologies offer a smarter way to handle global trade friction.

Circle back to that hardware company. With AI models constantly scanning trade databases and tariff announcements, the logistics team can get immediate updates on the best shipping routes and cost projections. Blockchain ensures that customs officers‚Äîand auditors‚Äîcan verify the country of origin without endless paperwork or risk of fraud. The time and cost savings are huge, but the real win is agility.

Tariffs, by nature, are unpredictable. They change with political winds, react to global events, and often lack the clarity needed for confident decision-making. Businesses operating on tight margins can't afford guesswork. In this new era, having a digital infrastructure that supports transparent, automated, and verifiable decisions isn't just smart‚Äîit's necessary.

Across the globe, startups and innovators are already working on this. Take OpenSC, an Australia-based platform that tracks products from origin to shelf using blockchain. By scanning a simple QR code, buyers‚Äîand regulators‚Äîcan trace exactly where a good came from. In a tariff-heavy landscape, that level of transparency could mean the difference between paying a 25% duty or none at all.

Similarly, Everledger, a U.K.-based company, is applying blockchain to authenticate the origin of diamonds and other luxury goods. Now imagine applying that same concept to industrial goods‚Äîsteel, semiconductors, lithium batteries‚Äîwhere origin determines tariff rates. What if every bolt, battery, or board came with a blockchain-verified passport?

AI isn't sitting idle either. Predictive models are already helping companies assess the long-term cost implications of sourcing from one country over another. If tariffs on Vietnamese semiconductors jump next quarter, an AI model could suggest alternatives in real time‚Äîbacked by real trade data, not assumptions. This allows companies to pivot faster, avoid disruptions, and maintain compliance.

Recent research by the World Trade Organization found that misclassification of goods contributes to billions in lost revenue annually. AI's ability to detect errors or fraud in trade documentation can help minimize those losses dramatically. A 2022 McKinsey report noted that combining AI and blockchain in customs and compliance systems could reduce processing costs by 30% or more, while increasing speed and accuracy.

There are even efforts underway to tackle the misuse of origin labeling, a tactic sometimes employed to dodge tariffs. Blockchain's immutable ledger makes it virtually impossible to forge shipment logs or fake a product's origin. AI can then audit this data for inconsistencies or red flags, alerting compliance teams before issues become legal problems.

While AI can analyze tariffs and blockchain can secure records, there's a critical missing piece: verification. That's where technologies like Truebit come in. Truebit's verification layer adds computational transparency‚Äîensuring AI systems calculating tariffs are themselves accountable. This is vital in scenarios like the Trump administration's complex tariff structure, which included universal rates around 10% and country-specific duties, such as Cambodia's 49%.

Truebit is already deployed in real-world supply chains. It supports Quadrans, the blockchain behind the EU-funded TRICK project, a ‚Ç¨8 million initiative tracking cross-border textile and food supply chains. "While blockchains can immutably record shipping records, and AI can analyze tariff patterns, there's a critical verification gap between them,‚Äù said Jason Teutsch, Founder and Chief Scientist at Truebit.

‚ÄúCompanies need proof that the AI's calculations themselves are trustworthy, especially with tariffs now ranging from 10% to nearly 50% depending on the country of origin. Like a notary for computational processes, verification technology can create proof that an AI system correctly applied the correct tariff rates and pulled data from legitimate sources ‚Äì something customs authorities are increasingly demanding."

Davide Costa, co-founder of the Quadrans Foundation, reinforced this with his experience: ‚ÄúWe discovered that blockchain alone wasn't enough when tracking products across international borders. The moment data moves between systems or undergoes AI analysis, verification becomes critical. Verification technology ensures that customs authorities and trading partners can trust not just the records, but the calculations and transformations applied to that data‚Äîessential when regulatory compliance and billions in tariffs are on the line.‚Äù

Even new stealth startups like Robotax are being built around this pain point. "The Trump administration's tariff reciprocity plan has a blind spot: we can't actually prove products are taxed correctly,‚Äù said David Deputy, a finance and regulatory tax software professional. ‚ÄúBlockchain can track a product moving from Nigeria to France to the USA, but it can't verify if the correct tariffs and sales or VAT tax were actually applied at each step. This is where computational verification becomes essential."

So, what does this look like in action? A company exporting textiles from Southeast Asia might deploy a system where every step‚Äîfrom fabric sourcing to final packaging‚Äîis logged on-chain. AI monitors the data flow, scanning for anomalies or mismatches against tariff rule sets. If a discrepancy arises, the system flags it before the shipment ever leaves the dock. That's not just smart‚Äîit's transformative.

The future of tariffs doesn't have to be murky. Yes, global trade will always be shaped by diplomacy and politics, but how businesses navigate those waters can be upgraded. Blockchain and AI give companies the tools not just to react‚Äîbut to plan, adapt, and lead.

As countries tighten regulations and implement digital customs systems, the companies that win will be those who lean into innovation. Tariffs may never go away‚Äîbut the confusion, inefficiency, and risk associated with them? That can.

It's time for businesses to stop fighting yesterday's trade wars with outdated tools. The new era of global trade demands tech that's proactive, predictive, and permanent. Blockchain and AI don't just offer a way through the tariff storm‚Äîthey offer a way forward.

Bitcoin hovered below the $77,000 level in early Monday trading as the broader crypto market downturn deepened. Losses extended across altcoins, with major ones like Ether, XRP, and Solana suffering double-digit losses ahead of the US stock market opening.

Bitcoin fell below $75,000 today, its lowest level since November, as crypto markets tumbled amid growing concerns over President Trump's new global tariff policies impacting Asian markets, CoinGecko data shows.

The crypto market selloff intensified with major altcoins posting severe losses.

Ether dropped 17% to trade under $1,400, levels not seen in March 2023. The sharp price drop forced the liquidation of an Ethereum whale, who suffered losses surpassing $100 million.

XRP declined 16% to $1.7, with its market cap falling to $102 million and losing its position among the top three crypto assets. Solana and Dogecoin each fell 16%, while Cardano dropped 15%.

Binance Coin and TRON showed more resilience, declining 8% and 6% respectively. The total crypto market capitalization decreased by over 10% to $2.5 trillion, representing approximately $100 billion in lost value within 10 hours.

The decline coincided with sharp falls on Asian stock markets. Taiwan's benchmark index plunged nearly 10%, its largest single-day drop since 1990.

Shares of major Taiwanese companies like TSMC and Foxconn tumbled nearly 10%, triggering automatic trading halts. In response, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) introduced temporary short-selling restrictions in an effort to stabilize the market.

The ripple effect was felt across the region. Japan's Nikkei index plunged over 8% on April 7, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index sank roughly 12%. China's CSI 300 Index also dropped sharply, falling 7%.

In South Korea, the Kospi shed more than 5% early in the session, prompting a five-minute circuit breaker. Singapore's Straits Times Index wasn't spared either, slipping nearly 8%.

Markets in Australia and New Zealand followed the downtrend. The ASX 200 in Australia dropped 6.3%, and New Zealand's NZX 50 slid more than 3.5%.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, said Monday he's been actively purchasing Bitcoin while maintaining a cautious stance on altcoins.

‚ÄúBeen nibbling on $BTC all day, and shall continue,‚Äù Hayes said, indicating an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy amid market volatility.

The analyst points to cheaper altcoins but expects Bitcoin's dominance ‚Äì its share of the total crypto market cap ‚Äì to increase towards 70%, implying Bitcoin's market-leading gains.

‚ÄúShitcoins are getting in our strike zone,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I think #bitcoin dominance keeps zooming towards 70%. So we are not gorging at the shitcoin supermarket.‚Äù

Hayes reiterated that the catalyst for Bitcoin's growth is the central banks' continued use of monetary stimulus in response to economic slowdowns.

              Highlights            



                        Traditional financial institutions are now handling hundreds of billions of dollars in blockchain transactions, underscoring how the cryptocurrency space is maturing.                      


                        The integration of AI tools offers the potential for enhancing crypto literacy, compliance and the fight against illicit financial activity.                      


                        Stablecoins play a key role in mainstream adoption, but the absence of a federal framework for stablecoins makes it difficult for financial services and enterprises to scale adoption.                      

File this under things you couldn't say two years ago: Blockchain technology is maturing, and its potential for compliant, mainstream use is growing.

‚ÄúBanks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,‚Äù Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Karen Webster.

In particular, Levin said the adoption of stablecoins is one of the most significant shifts in blockchain usage, at least since Chainalysis began in 2014. The shift has been monumental. Now, hundreds of billions of dollars move across blockchains while being stored in traditional financial institutions like banks or United States treasuries.

‚ÄúWhen we started the business in 2014, that wasn't yet a concept,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain, including the U.S. dollar.‚Äù

Yet, challenges remain around global policy frameworks and the integration of concurrent advances such as artificial intelligence into on-chain ecosystems.

There is a push for a federal framework around stablecoins, and it's important for industry confidence Levin said.

‚ÄúWithout a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,‚Äù he said, adding that as the conversation around crypto regulation evolves, providing clarity, compliance and insight will become more critical.

Chainalysis, a blockchain data company, was founded with a mission to illuminate the traditionally opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. Over a decade later, it boasts a dataset spanning 70 countries, capable of providing deep insights into how crypto is used, abused and regulated.

As it relates to the growth of stablecoins, tracking real dollars rather than merely crypto tokens has broadened the scope of blockchain monitoring. This evolution has transformed blockchain from a niche technology to a mainstream component of financial infrastructure, Levin said.

‚ÄúWhat we are starting to see with OCC guidance and SEC guidance ‚Ä¶ is that this is something that is going to be possible for banks to do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe now track not just cryptocurrency tokens, but ‚Ä¶ real dollars that are being used to settle financial transactions, remittances and payments all across the world on these rails.‚Äù

Still, a persistent criticism of cryptocurrency is its alleged use in illicit activities, and scams and fraud remain separate challenges. Estimates from Chainalysis highlight that between $10 billion and $12 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions annually are linked to scams.

Chainalysis is uniquely positioned to monitor the entire ‚Äúsupply chain of scam activity,‚Äù offering insight into how scammers procure tools and sell illicit services, Levin said.

‚ÄúWe've helped the government seize more than $10 billion worth of crypto assets from criminal proceeds,‚Äù he said.

There has also been progress made in combatting the use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for money laundering and other financial crimes.

‚ÄúThe cryptocurrency transactions that we've been able to link to those types of activities is actually a smaller percentage of the overall activity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt started off much higher, but now it's consistently below 1% of the transactions that we can associate directly to these types of actors.‚Äù

This decline is largely thanks to improved regulation and the ability of blockchain monitoring tools to help detect illicit transactions more accurately when compared to many traditional financial systems.

One area of excitement shared by stakeholders within the Web3 ecosystem is the potential for AI to improve crypto literacy and compliance. Despite the inroads blockchain has made to date, widespread misunderstandings about the technology's opacity persist.

‚ÄúEven the people who are advocating for the technology ‚Ä¶ don't also advocate for the fact that cryptocurrency has been much more effective as a tool for both enterprises identifying risky activity off-boarding bad clients from their platforms and law enforcement being able to hold scammers to account,‚Äù Levin said.

Chainalysis itself continues to invest in educating enterprises about how blockchain works, using AI to simplify complex concepts for regulators and industry participants.

‚ÄúI'm very optimistic about the potential for AI to actually contextualize some of the transactions and concepts for people,‚Äù Levin said.

‚ÄúWe still got work to do,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut the progress is real. And the potential is enormous.‚Äù

Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency has signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. According to the agency, Binance will assist Kyrgyzstan in several key areas, including the development of blockchain infrastructure and the creation of a national cryptocurrency reserve.

The partnership will also focus on training young professionals, government employees, and specialists in blockchain technologies, virtual asset management, and cybersecurity. In addition, Binance will provide support in establishing a management system for virtual assets and blockchain technology in Kyrgyzstan source.

While public interest in cryptocurrencies continues to grow in Kyrgyzstan, the market remains poorly regulated. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce proposed legislation to create licensed crypto banks that would offer regulated banking services related to digital assets. The ministry stressed the need to integrate crypto assets into the national financial system, citing the rapid advancement of digital technology and the economic potential of legalizing cryptocurrency transactions. The introduction of crypto banks is expected to increase transaction volumes, boost tax revenues, and create new jobs in the fintech sector, positioning Kyrgyzstan as a regional hub for financial innovation.

In a separate move to stabilize the sector, Kyrgyzstan's Cabinet of Ministers significantly raised the minimum authorized capital required for crypto exchanges, from 100 million KGS to 10 billion KGS, a hundredfold increase. The Ministry of Economy and Commerce, which initiated the reform, stated that the measure is designed to ensure the financial stability of crypto platforms, safeguard user interests, and foster a transparent and secure virtual assets market. Existing exchanges have until January 1, 2026, to comply with the new capital requirements.
