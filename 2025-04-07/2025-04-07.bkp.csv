            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court on Monday to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.
    


            The emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court hours before the 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline established by a lower court judge to return him to the US.
    


            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.

            The Justice Department told the Supreme Court ordering officials to return the man is “unprecedented” as it sounded now familiar themes arguing that federal courts are overstepping their power.
    


            “Even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable,” recently confirmed Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in the filing Monday. “The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.”
    


            “While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was an administrative error … that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight,” Sauer added.
    


            Abrego Garcia was in the country illegally, but an immigration judge in 2019 – after reviewing evidence – withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family's pupusa business.”
    


            For the next six years, court records show, Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland, checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime.
    


            But Abrego Garcia wound up on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15. Several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump's invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act – an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia, the administration has said, was deported under different authorities.
    


            On Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis explained in an opinion why she had ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday.
    


            White House officials have publicly mocked the judge's order and assert they have no ability to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.
    


            “Marxist judge now thinks she's president of El Salvador,” Trump adviser Stephen Miller posted to social media on Friday.
    


            But under oath, the Justice Department has been far less clear about the removal. Pressed by Xinis last week about why the US couldn't return Abrego Garcia, DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni said he didn't have an answer.
    


            “The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” Reuveni responded.
    


            The Department of Justice has since placed Reuven and his supervisor on leave.
    


            The request to the Supreme Court came minutes before a ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denying DOJ's request to lift the lower-court order.
    


            The panel rejecting the appeal was: Judge Stephanie Thacker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, and Judge Robert King, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.
    


            Thacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the “United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process.”
    


            “The Government's contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” she wrote, adding later that the “irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to Abrego Garcia every minute he is in El Salvador.”
    


            “And the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the Government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the United States,” she added.
    


            In a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning, Wilkinson said he thinks it is “legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate' the plaintiff's return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law.”
    


            “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” he continued. “Thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.”
    


            But Wilkinson said he read Xinis' order “as one requiring that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia's release, rather than demand it.” He said that reading it as a requirement for the administration “would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far.”

Follow:


Speaking to reporters Sunday on Air Force One, President Donald Trump defended his new global tariffs with a familiar series of false claims about tariffs and trade.
    


            As he has before, Trump wildly exaggerated the US trade deficit with China — describing it as more than three times higher than it actually is. He repeated his frequent false claim that China paid the tariffs he imposed during his first presidency on imported Chinese products; these payments were made by US importers. And he once again falsely described trade with Europe, wrongly saying the continent doesn't buy “anything” from the US. In reality, the European Union purchased about $649 billion worth of US exports in 2024.
    


            Trump's Sunday remarks also included inaccurate assertions about other subjects, but we'll stick to tariffs and trade in this article. Here is a fact check.
    


            Trump said Sunday that the US has a trade deficit with China of $1 trillion or more.
    


            “We have a tremendous deficit problem with China. They have a surplus of at least a trillion dollars a year. I think it's like a trillion-one,” he said.

            As we've noted in previous fact checks, those numbers are not close to accurate. In fact, official federal statistics show the 2024 trade deficit with China in goods and services trade was about $263 billion. Even if you exclude the services trade, at which the US excels, and count only trade in goods, the 2024 deficit with China was about $295 billion.
    


            The US has never approached a $1 trillion trade deficit with China. The deficit in goods trade alone hit a record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years.
    


            Trump repeated his regular assertion that China paid the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports during his first presidency, wrongly declaring, “I took in, during my four year(s), hundreds of billions of dollars from China.”
    


            In fact, US importers, not foreign exporters like China, make the tariff payments to the US government, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump's first-term tariffs on China. It's easy to find specific examples of companies that passed along the cost of the tariffs to US consumers.
    


            Trump made a series of false claims about trade with Europe, all repeats from previous comments.
    


            He said Sunday: “They don't take our cars. They don't take our food products. They don't take anything. And we take their cars: Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW. You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm product. They don't take anything. “
    


            None of this is correct.

            “They don't take anything” is far from the truth. While the European Union certainly has some trade barriers that make it harder for US companies to export products there, the official federal statistics show the US exported about $649 billion worth of goods and services to the European Union in 2024.
    


            It's similarly false that “they don't take our farm products.” While the EU does have some trade barriers that impede US agricultural exports, the US Department of Agriculture says the EU bought $12.8 billion worth of US agricultural exports in 2024, making it the fourth-largest export market for US agricultural and related products behind Mexico, Canada and China.
    


            And while US automakers have often struggled to succeed in Europe, Trump went too far when he said, “They take no cars.” According to a report last month from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, “164,857 US-made cars were exported to the EU in 2024,” valued at about $8.4 billion at current exchange rates. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.)

            Two former top federal labor protection officials were reinstated to their posts Monday by the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals – at least for now – amid a lengthy legal dispute over President Donald Trump's ability to fire leaders from independent government agencies.
    


            In a 7-4 decision, the full appeals court wiped away a previous ruling from a three-judge panel that allowed Trump to fire the officials: Cathy Harris, the chairwoman of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal firings and can reinstate wrongly terminated employees, and Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board.
    


            With these two officials returning to their posts, a quorum has now been restored at the NLRB and MSPB, allowing them to function at full strength and process cases involving federal employment disputes. These agencies are a critical bulwark against Trump's efforts to rapidly reduce the size of the federal workforce and fire thousands of employees.
    


            Both officials are Democrats appointed by former President Joe Biden whose statutory terms weren't set to expire for years. Federal law says they can only be dismissed for cause, but Trump is trying to fire them anyway, and the Justice Department has argued that it's unconstitutional to restrain the president's firing powers.
    


            This is not the final say in the matter, which many legal observers believe is eventually headed to the Supreme Court.
    


            The full DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday wiped away an emergency order from the three-judge panel letting Trump fire the officials while the appeals play out. But a smaller three-judge panel is still set to review the underlying merits of the case, and a hearing is scheduled for May 16.
    


            “The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,” the DC Circuit majority wrote in its ruling Monday.
    


Previous Supreme Court rulings about presidential firing powers, which the Trump administration wants to overturn, “remain good law” and are still “in place,” the judges wrote, citing earlier cases.
    


            All seven of the DC Circuit judges who supported reinstating the labor officials were appointed by Democratic presidents, and the four dissenting judges who opposed it were appointed by Republicans.
    


            CNN has reached out to the MSPB and NLRB for comment.
    


            Both women challenged their firings in court, and trial judges concluded that their terminations were unlawful. The Justice Department then appealed those decisions and later secured a court order letting Trump fire the officials on a temporary basis while the appealed played out. That temporary order was vacated Monday, reinstating the officials.

            Nintendo found what works — and it's not turning back.
    


            That's the impression the company gave last week when it introduced the Switch 2, which launches June 5 and costs $450 — substantially more than its $300 predecessor.
    


            Nintendo's next-generation console is a significantly upgraded version of its popular gaming device from eight years ago, a testament to the Switch's popularity but also a gamble that its success will endure for the better part of the next decade. While the 2017-era Switch introduced gamers to the concept of a home console that also serves as a portable game machine, the Switch 2 doubles down on that idea — amid growing competition from PC rivals like Valve and Lenovo that have emerged over the last three years.
    


            Nintendo is also launching its most important product in years at what may be the worst time — just before President Donald Trump introduced a slew of tariffs on foreign goods, which heavily target Asia, where many tech supply chains are based. As a result, the gaming giant on Friday postponed its April 9 US preorder date to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”
    


            “As you look at the prices that were announced … they factored in previous tariffs and how they had been administered, and where they had been administered,” Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CNN ahead of the company's decision to delay US preorders. “… We're currently actively assessing what steps we may need to take, and what may be next.”
    


            Sticking with the same formula is a bold move for Nintendo, which rarely does the same thing twice. But if you ask Bowser, the Switch 2 continues what could be a long line of Nintendo devices that mix stationary and mobile gaming.
    


            “We do believe that this idea of having a singular device that you can play as a handheld on the go, that you can set up in tabletop … and play with a friend, or that you can dock at home and play as a console-like device — we think that resonates with players,” he said when asked whether Nintendo would consider a new style of device in the future.
    


            The Switch 2 is entering a much more competitive environment than its predecessor did in 2017. Just about every major gaming brand has introduced a handheld console, with Valve's Steam Deck being the most popular.
    


            The Steam Deck launched in 2022 as an answer to the Switch for PC gamers, allowing players to access their library of computer games on a dedicated mobile gaming device rather than a laptop or desktop. Since the Steam Deck's launch, a handful of other computing giants, such as Asus, Lenovo and Logitech, have introduced their own handheld game machines.
    


            Valve — also known as the developer of Team Fortress, Dota and other popular video games — is the leader among these PC rivals with 48% of the PC handheld market in 2024, according to the Verge, citing data from the International Data Corporation.
    


            Still, those statistics indicate the market is far behind Nintendo, with just under 6 million units shipped compared to the 150 million Switches that have been sold thus far. Nintendo sold 15.7 million hardware units in its fiscal year that ended in March 2024 alone, according to its earnings statement.
    


            It's an indication that Nintendo is onto something — and one of its biggest rivals has taken notice, too.
    


            Sony launched the PlayStation Portal in 2023, a handheld device that can stream games from a PlayStation 5, so that gamers don't have to hog the living room TV when playing. Microsoft, meanwhile, has pushed the idea that any device can be “an Xbox” by streaming games from its cloud service.
    


            With the Switch 2, Nintendo is bridging some of the gaps between its older handheld console and its competition. It has more powerful hardware, including more storage, 4K support, a larger screen and an improved cooling system. Plus, the new Joy-Con controllers can be used like a computer mouse, perhaps another indication that Nintendo is looking to woo the computer gaming crowd.
    


            “While the form factor is the same, everything inside has completely been either upgraded or enhanced or is new,” Bowser said.
    


            However, hardware is only half the story. Nintendo is best known for its universe of exclusive games and iconic characters, from Mario to Zelda and Kirby. But it's making a much bigger push into third-party software with the Switch 2, as evidenced by the slew of popular titles — such as Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077 — showcased during Nintendo's presentation last week.
    


            That could potentially prevent consumers from having to choose between a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, the latter of which typically offers a much wider variety of non-Nintendo games.
    


            “It's about appealing to the broadest set of players that we possibly can,” Bowser said when asked whether the focus on third-party titles was intended to court Steam Deck fans.
    


            In addition to its hardware and software, the Switch 2's higher price also puts it in closer competition than ever before with rivals from Sony, Microsoft and Valve, among others. The Switch 2 starts at $450, while Sony and Microsoft offer certain editions of their PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles for $400 and $450, respectively. The Steam Deck starts at $399.
    


            Games are also seemingly getting a price hike, with Mario Kart World costing a whopping $80.
    


            The higher price arrives in a challenging economy in which consumers are struggling to afford everyday items, let alone game consoles and more competition. But Nintendo is banking on its signature charm and quirkiness to distinguish the Switch 2 as a worthwhile investment.
    


            For example, one of the Switch 2's hallmark new features is a social system called GameChat, through which players can share their screen while chatting and use dedicated camera to see each other while playing.
    


            Nintendo is also experimenting with new ways to use the Joy-Con controllers, such as by dragging them across a surface to move characters on screen.
    


            And then of course, there's Mario. Nintendo didn't reveal a new mainline Mario title during its Switch 2 announcement, but Bowser hinted that it may only be a matter of time.
    


            “Stay tuned,” he said. “You know, we have a long, long catalog, and a long list of (intellectual property) that I'm sure will make its way to the platform.”

Follow:


            The CIA is reviewing its authorities to use lethal force against drug cartels in Mexico and beyond as the Trump administration moves to make taking on the cartels a major priority for the intelligence agency, according to a US official and three people briefed on the matter.
    


            The review does not indicate President Donald Trump has ordered the CIA to take direct action against the cartels. But it is designed to help the agency understand what kinds of activities it could legally undertake and what the potential risks would be across the suite of options, the sources said — underscoring how seriously the Trump administration is considering the possibility.
    


            It also highlights some US officials' concerns that using traditional counterterrorism tools against cartels — as the Trump administration has said it intends to do — carries a much higher risk of collateral damage to American citizens than similar operations conducted in the Middle East, far from US soil.

CIA flying covert drone missions into Mexico to spy on drug cartels



            Among the issues agency lawyers are examining is the CIA's and its officers' liability if an American is accidentally killed in any operation, according to one of the people briefed.
    


            Agency officials are “cautious” about using “assets traditionally going after what were seen as military targets now being employed against cartel targets,” the US official said.
    


            The Trump administration earlier this year designated a number of cartels as foreign terrorist organizations — a maneuver some current and former US officials believe is designed to build a predicate for lethal action — and the CIA is already flying surveillance drones that are capable of being armed over Mexico.
    


            The CIA declined to comment.
    


            CNN was not able to determine whether the effort was ordered by the White House or CIA Director John Ratcliffe, or whether it was undertaken as a prudent planning measure by agency staff in response to clear signals from the Trump administration that it wants national security agencies to ramp up pressure on the cartels.
    


            “If any administration is pushing us to do something that has potential significant adverse ramifications for the agency, [the CIA] is going to want to double and triple check: ‘Is it legal?' and ‘Do we have extraordinarily clear policy direction to do what we're going to do?'” said one former CIA official with experience building this kind of review.
    


            “Just because something is legal under [the law of armed conflict] doesn't mean it's something you should do,” this person said, referring to protocols regulating the conduct of states during war. “There's an ethical component. There's a practical component. There's a pragmatic component.” 



            The CIA has the legal authority to either conduct lethal strikes itself or provide targeting information or other support to another nation to carry out a lethal strike, as long as it's properly authorized by the president and abides by the interlocking constellation of US laws and regulations that govern armed conflict.
    


            But to do so against cartel actors in an area where there are, comparatively, far more US-born citizens and green card holders — people who might have the standing to sue the US government if they are harmed — is novel for the CIA.
    


            “It's not a question of whether they can or cannot use lethal force. They can,” said one of the people briefed on the review. “It's more about the implications of Americans being potentially injured or killed based on their broader presence in the space.”
    


            Collateral damage could also blow back on any partner nation that either allows the CIA to conduct direct action inside its borders or that accepts intelligence support from the agency to conduct its own lethal operations, the US official noted. If the CIA support creates a political problem for the partner nation — Mexico, for example — its government could refuse to allow the agency to operate there going forward.
    


            Former officials have also warned about the risks of retaliation by cartels, some of which maintain a presence inside the United States.
    


            “Mexican cartels are not merely criminal organizations; they operate as paramilitary entities with deep financial resources, global supply chains, and sophisticated logistical networks that extend into the United States,” Doug Livermore, a specialist in irregular warfare and a former Defense Department official, wrote in a recent study for the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank. “Cartels are highly likely to retaliate” and “possess a substantial capacity for terrorism that, when coupled with their established presence within the United States, could escalate conflict.”
    


            One of the people briefed on the review said it reflected a deep institutional memory of the George W. Bush administration's “enhanced interrogation” program, which lawmakers and the Obama administration subsequently deemed to be torture. In that instance, former officials said, the agency pushed its operations to the limit of what they believed the law could bear. Critics, of course, contend the agency and the administration went beyond what was legal, and in the years following, the CIA and its officers were put through a series of public and high-profile investigations into the propriety of their actions.
    


            This sort of review, the people briefed on the matter said, reflects an understanding that the agency may be called to account for any action it takes against cartels — especially if there is blowback. And especially if the agency conducts operations that are ultimately seen as disproportionate to the threat from cartels — key criteria that lethal action must meet under the law of armed conflict.
    


            The US intelligence community's annual threat assessment, published last month, led with the threat from drug cartels for apparently the first time in the report's nearly 20-year history. Many current and former national security officials, however, have repeatedly argued that while cartels are a serious problem, they are not an existential threat to the country.
    


            “I think it's very understandable that people are mindful of [the history of “enhanced interrogation”] to the extent that they actually don't believe we're in a crisis,” said one of the former officials.

            The start of a rugby game in France was delayed on Sunday after a parachutist became entangled in the stadium roof prior to kickoff.
    


            The parachutist was part of a pre-match ceremony that was tasked with carrying the match ball to the field ahead of the European Rugby Champions Cup game between Toulouse and English club Sale.
    


            However, after his fellow parachutists had landed safely on the pitch, one unfortunate dardevil ended up delaying the game by 40 minutes.
    


            The man, reportedly a French army parachutist, had been following his colleagues and was seen descending quickly into the stadium before getting snagged on the roof.
    


            As he dangled over the stands, stadium officials – as well as the Toulouse team mascot dressed as a lion – raced to create a makeshift crash mat by using inflatables found nearby.
    


            Eventually, footage showed fire services reaching the parachutist and bringing him down to safety on a crane, sparking huge cheers inside the Stadium de Toulouse.
    


            It appeared as though the man was unhurt from the experience, as he lapped up the reception.
    


            CNN has reached out to European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) – the governing body which organizes the European Rugby Champions Cup – and Toulouse for comment.
    


            “Following the incident at the Stadium de Toulouse, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to all involved at the stadium, both clubs and the emergency services for safely returning the parachutist to the ground,” EPCR chairman Dominic McKay said in a statement on social media Sunday.
    


            The players, who had initially returned to the dressing room, came back onto the pitch before Toulouse won 38-15. The French side will now play RC Toulon in the quarterfinals.
    


            Toulouse posted an Instagram video about the pre-match drama, joking: “We know seats are going fast but you're forcing it here.” It also thanked the emergency services for saving the day.

Live Updates


            • Trump meets with Netanyahu: Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is set to meet with President Donald Trump today at the White House, marking his second visit since January. The leaders are expected to discuss Trump's new tariffs on Israel, the war with Hamas and other key issues. The top White House adviser said it will be Trump's first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate the tariffs announced last week.
    


            • Markets tumble: The meeting comes as US stocks have been extremely volatile today as traders search for any sign Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted. US stocks tumbled for the third straight day Monday, and the S&P 500 entered bear market territory. Stocks in Asia and Europe also plunged, though more sharply in Asia.
    


            • Trump's trade war: Trump urged patience this morning and defended the state of the US economy. With the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation, fears of a global recession are mounting. The European Union is “ready to negotiate” with the US and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, the president of the European Commission said.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday he's ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing's retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets.
    


            He said the additional tariffs would take effect midweek if China doesn't remove its 34% retaliatory tariff by Tuesday.
    


            He also said meetings China had requested would be canceled, though he said other countries would begin negotiating on trade immediately.
    


                    “Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            “Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” he went on.
    


            “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”
    


Some context: Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10% additional duties on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US. Last week, Trump announced an additional 34% on all Chinese goods, which is set to take effect Wednesday. If his latest threat of an additional 50% went into effect, Chinese goods arriving in the US would effectively be subject to tariffs of 104%.
    


This post has been updated with additional details. 



            A federal appeals court declined on Monday to put on hold a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.



            The decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals comes just hours before the administration faces an 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US.
    


            The ruling came minutes after the administration asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to lift the preliminary injunction issued late last week by US District Judge Paula Xinis.
    


            It's not every day that financial markets go from deep in the red to well into positive territory and then back down to the red again — all in the span of minutes.
    


            But that's exactly what happened on Monday.
    


            With banners flashing on CNBC and posts piling up on social media that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs with the exception of China, investors breathed a huge sigh of relief. But then it turned out that they got a little too excited.
    


            A White House official told CNN any such reports are “fake news.”
    


            Much of the reporting traced back to an interview President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, had on Fox News this morning. Hassett was asked if Trump can call a “90-day timeout” on tariffs.
    


            Hassett responded: “I think the President will decide what the President is going to decide.” Several news networks took that to mean Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. However, there was no official reporting on that.
    


            White House director of communications Steven Cheung also denied reports of a 90-day pause being under consideration. He reposted a NewsMax post on X post of Hassett with his own comments: “Not true. Nobody can point to a transcript …  because it was never said.”
    


            President Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court today to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.
    


            The emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court on a short fuse: A lower court judge has ordered the Trump administration to return him to the US by 11:59 p.m. Monday.
    


            Trump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.

            The wild swings in financial markets on Monday morning underscore how badly investors want President Donald Trump to pause the trade war.
    


            US stocks surged off their lows and even briefly turned positive on rumors of a 90-day pause. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced.
    


                    “That was a good example of what would happen if we actually got some rational thought mixed in with the ignorant tariff policy,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview Monday. “The stock market vigilantes have spoken loudly that we need rational thought mixed in with this trade policy. And there is none so far.”
                





            Oversold markets desperate for good news are subject to wild swings that can quickly reverse, Hogan added.
    


            The European Union is “ready to negotiate” with the United States and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Monday.
    


            “These tariffs come first and foremost at immense costs for US consumers and businesses but, at the same time, they have a massive impact on the global economy,” the head of the EU's executive arm said at a news conference in Brussels.
    


            Following US President Donald Trump's announcement of hefty tariffs on dozens of countries last week, EU exports to the US face a 20% “reciprocal” tariff, while its steel and auto industry face a 25% tariff. Von der Leyen said the tariffs, which have caused a global market rout, represent a “major turning point” for the US.
    


                    “Nonetheless, we stand ready to negotiate with the United States. Indeed, we have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners, because Europe is always ready for a good deal,” she said.
                





            Asked when the EU tabled the zero-tariff offer, von der Leyen said the offer was made “long before” Trump's latest tariff announcement and “repeatedly, for example, in the automotive sector.” She stressed that the EU has long gone “zero for zero with other countries that also have a strong automotive sector.”
    


            At the same time, the EU is willing to play hardball: Although the EU would prefer to strike a “negotiated settlement,” the bloc is also “preparing a potential list (of US imports) for retaliation,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, the head of the EU's executive arm said the bloc would explore new opportunities, citing deals it has already made with Mexico and Switzerland, as well as new trade agreements it is exploring with India, Indonesia and other countries in the Indo-Pacific.
    


            “We will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States – vast opportunities – and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners,” she said at a news conference in Brussels.
    


This post has been updated with additional information. 



            US stocks were extremely volatile Monday as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.
    


            Markets around the world had tumbled over concerns about how Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth. US stocks opened the day in bear market territory but surged an hour later on rumors that the Trump administration may pause tariffs – perhaps for several months.
    


            That rumor turned out to be just that, it seems. And the Dow, which had risen nearly 900 points, was back down once again.
    


            The Dow was lower 500 points, or 1.3%. The broader S&P 500 edged lower. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% lower.
    


            At the open, the S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory – a decline of 20% from a recent peak – before pulling back. The decline in US stocks came after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.
    


            The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic).
    


            Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday's meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump will be the first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate on the tariffs announced last week.
    


                    “Israel is the first meeting today,” Hassett said, alluding to all the countries trying to negotiate. “President Trump has talked to world leaders all weekend.”
                





            “I'm sure they will talk about trade policy and Middle East policy as well,” Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.
    


            Hassett emphasized that the US is prepared for a “good deal.”
    


            The US imposed a 17% tariff on Israel, according to Trump's announcement last week.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that “countries from all over the World” are talking to the United States after he announced reciprocal tariffs last week and that “tough but fair parameters are being set,” specifically mentioning the Japanese prime minister sending negotiators.
    


                    “Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things.'”
                





            Trump also highlighted China as a particular focus, suggesting that trade relations with China need significant changes.
    


            “It all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!”
    


Asian markets dip: Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.
    


CNN's Juliana Liu and John Liu contributed to this report. 



            Last week Vietnam offered to lower its tariffs on American exports to 0% in exchange for the same treatment, according to a report published by the Vietnamese government on Friday. That came after President Donald Trump spoke with Vietnam's General Secretary Tô Lâm on Friday in a call Trump labeled “productive.”
    


            But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday that Vietnam's offer is not being taken seriously.
    


                    “Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said in a CNBC interview on Monday.
                





More context: Vietnam is among the nations set to see the highest “reciprocal” tariff rates of 46% come April 9, according to the new tariff regime the Trump administration unveiled last week. Vietnam was the United States' sixth-largest source of imports last year, according to US Commerce Department data.
    


            The tariffs Trump is set to impose could raise the price for a slew of goods which the US relies heavily on from Vietnam, including electronics, apparel and footwear
    


            US stocks opened lower Monday as markets around the world tumbled over concerns about how President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth.
    


            Markets opened in bear market territory – a decline of 20% from a recent peak – after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.
    


            The Dow fell 1,200 points, or 3.2%. The broader S&P 500 was 3.4% lower and opened in bear territory. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.96%. The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).
    


            Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has surged to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic as investors fret over the market's next move. CNN's Fear and Greed Index has slumped to its lowest levels this year.
    


            President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on trading partners could derail the global move toward green energy, aimed at preventing the worst impacts of climate change.
    


            The tariffs will likely make key green technologies more expensive and could also force governments to divert resources from addressing the climate crisis into propping up their economies.
    


            China is the world's largest producer of many of the materials that are crucial for clean energy technologies. Among others, it exports vast amounts of lithium and lithium batteries as well as the materials used to build wind turbines and solar panels.
    


            The E3G independent climate change think tank said in a research paper that the tariffs will increase the cost of manufacturing of low-carbon technologies and could eventually result in higher prices for consumers — at a time when prices were going down, encouraging faster transition.
    


            Climate policies are already being changed because of the tariffs.
    


More context: The UK government on Monday scrapped some electric vehicle sales targets, specifically quoting the “new era of global insecurity” as one of the reasons. While the government kept the 2030 deadline to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars, it gave companies more flexibility up until then, and it also slashed the fines for those who don't meet the targets.
    


            After the Canadian government scrapped the consumer carbon tax last month, some Canadian provinces followed suit and stopped other carbon levies, quoting the US tariffs among the reasons.
    


            To avoid the worst of the climate crisis, the world needs to quickly transition to clean energy. With governments and businesses facing economic pressures, resources could be diverted away from green projects. That will likely backfire as failing to invest in emission cutting now will make more costly to deal with the consequences in the future.
    


            President Donald Trump urged patience and warned against becoming “panican” in a post Monday ahead of markets opening in the United States.
    


                    “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!),” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he went on.
                





            Trump was writing as markets traded sharply lower in Asia and Europe, and a US futures tumbled. Earlier this morning, Trump defended the US economy and claims tariffs will boost revenue
    


            White House national economic council director Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump's tariffs on Monday, responding to billionaire Trump supporter Bill Ackman who criticized and said the “economic nuclear war” is triggered by tariffs.
    


            “I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease the ease off the rhetoric a little bit,” Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.
    


                    “I think a lot of us at the White House think that these are these economic responses are exaggerated by critics, even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP as the idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,” Hasset said responding to Ackman.
                





            Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president, said Sunday that America was heading toward a self-inflicted “economic nuclear winter” because of Trump's tariff policy rollout.
    


            Hassett also responded to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who has issued a bunt warning about Trump's tariff policy. Dimon said America's “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's “America First” foreign policy could undermine that standing.
    


            “Trump came into office with the biggest debt to GDP that we've seen in the US ever since World War 2,” Hassett said. “And what we're doing right now is we're fixing that,” he added in response to Dimon.
    


            Trump's announcement last week, targeting nearly all the US trading partners last week, including a 10% tariff on all imports and higher tariffs on certain countries, triggered a sharp and ongoing decline in global markets, with several nations imposing retaliatory tariffs on goods.
    


            The global market rout sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs deepened in Asia and Europe on Monday, with the US bracing for a further slump when its markets open shortly.
    


            Although the president has doubled down on his trade policy, members of his administration failed to offer a coherent message about his strategy over the weekend. Some of Trump's billionaire backers are now calling for a return to freer trade.
    


Here's what you need to know:



            • Asian markets plummet: With trading now over for the day, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% down – its worst day since 1997. The city's financial markets had been closed Friday for an annual festival.
    


            • Europe also slumps: Stocks indexes in Europe are down around 5% halfway through the day's trading. Meanwhile, European Union trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a response to Trump's tariffs.
    


            • US markets set to open: If the US stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration that a bull market has turned into a bear market in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.
    


            • Dimon sounds alarm: JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump's tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America's standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.
    


            • Trump doubles down: After his trade policy wiped trillions of dollars off global markets last week, Trump told reporters late Sunday that he doesn't want “anything to go down,” but that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” On Monday morning, Trump defended his policy in a Truth Social post, saying tariffs would bring in billions of dollars in revenue.
    


            • Musk breaks rank: Elon Musk has said he would be in favor of a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU, after the man he helped elect as president imposed a 20% tariff on the bloc. Bill Ackman, another of Trump's billionaire backers, has also criticized the president's trade policy.
    


            • MAGA's mixed signals: Top Trump administration officials offered mixed messaging over whether countries can negotiate their way out of tariffs, or if the levies are here to stay. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama, said the administration “doesn't have a coherent message on why it's implementing the largest tax increase” seen in the US in 50 years.

            President Donald Trump's trade plan could cause a repeat of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs from 1930 that worsened the Great Depression, former Federal Reserve official James Bullard warned on Monday.
    


                    “This has dramatically raised the risk of a Smoot-Hawley type outcome,” Bullard, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told CNBC. “Global trade collapsed and the Great Depression was on. That's what really has people worried about this.”
                





            Economists widely blame the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act with making the Great Depression worse than it had to be. The act surged tariffs on US imports to protect workers. A half-century later, the infamous legislation was featured in an iconic scene in “Ferris Bueller's Day Off.”
    


            Bullard, who now serves as dean of Purdue University's Mitch Daniels School of Business, told CNBC that Trump's tariffs are setting up a situation where “you could get a dramatic downturn in the economy.”
    


            Bullard added, however, that this does not have to be a repeat and noted that it's not clear the tariffs will even stay in place.
    


                    “What's the chance this will stick through the courts? Because I think this is probably executive overreach,” Bullard said, arguing that the executive branch likely needs the support of Congress to make these kinds of sweeping decisions on trade. “Who wants to invest when you don't know what the rules are going to be?”
                





            President Donald Trump took to social media Monday to argue that the US is in a strong economic position, despite the fact that the US and global markets have tanked.
    


                    “Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow-moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





            The president claimed that the country will earn billions of dollars from the tariffs he placed on other countries, even as the stock market faces its worst start to a presidential term in modern history.
    


                    “This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate. They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA! Our past “leaders” are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump's post continued.
                





            Trump on Sunday aboard Air Force One said he does not want “anything to go down,” but stressed “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” with the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation.
    


            The sweeping tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump last week are set to add to the pain inflicted on US farmers by the tariffs imposed during his first term, a union boss has warned.
    


                    “It's not fun, we still haven't recovered from the last tariffs that the president put on,” Bob Kuylen, Vice President of the North Dakota Farmers Union, told CNN Monday.
                





            He added that farmers “haven't gotten (those) markets back yet and now he's picking on Canada and Mexico and China.” Farmers are being “held down to almost surf levels, just barely getting by,” he said.
    


            “We raise thousands and thousands of acres of corn and soybeans and wheat and other products and we export just about half of what we raise in the United States,” he said.
    


            Farmers often receive government funding to protect them when prices fall due to weather or market fluctuations – but in 2018 they needed bailing out to protect them from the Trump administration's trade policies. During Trump's first term, the government spent billions of dollars bailing out farmers feeling the pinch from the president's trade war.
    


            Over the weekend, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was unable to clearly state whether Trump's new tariffs are here to stay, or whether there was room for deals.
    


            Rollins indicated there could be support for farmers affected by the most recent tariffs, pointing to the previous relief during Trump's first term.
    


            JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about President Donald Trump's tariff policy: It threatens to raise prices, drive the global economy into a downturn and weaken America's standing in the world.
    


                    “The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” Dimon warned in his annual letter to shareholders. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”
                





            Dimon said America's “extraordinary standing” in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's “America First” foreign policy could undermine that standing.
    


                    “If the Western world's military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken over time,” he said.
                





            Despite a recent plunge in markets, stocks could tumble much farther still, Dimon argued. The US stock market is set to open in bear market territory after hitting a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19 – the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).
    


                    “Even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high,” Dimon said. “These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious.”
                





            US President Donald Trump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the precipice of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history.
    


            If the stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration a bull market has turned into a bear in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.
    


            These same tariffs may also take a booming economy and turn it into a recession.

            We know there's a lot of chatter about the impact of the tariffs, and one word being thrown around is recession.



            So, what is a recession? And why are economists concerned the world may be impacted by it?
    


            The traditional (and official) definition of a US recession is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”
    


            That's according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organization has a very important role, when it comes to these downturns: Its Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of peaks, troughs, expansions, contractions — and yes, recessions — in the business cycle.
    


            The committee, in making its recession determination, uses three criteria: depth, diffusion and duration.
    


            This is where it gets a little squishy.
    


            While each of those need to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions in one of those areas can offset weaker conditions in the others.
    


            Also, it's often the case that the US already is in a recession by the time the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially deems it so.
    


            Prognosticators have turned to other gauges as potential recessionary indicators; however, they don't always prove true.
    


            The biggest rule of thumb or nonofficial recession indicator is the technical notion of back-to-back quarterly contractions in real gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity.
    


            As the European Union seeks to respond to the punishing 20% tariff the White House has placed on its exports, the bloc could negotiate with the United States on issues of energy security and military trade, a Latvian official said Monday.
    


            Artjom Uršulskis, parliamentary secretary of Latvia's foreign ministry, hinted at where the EU is looking to negotiate with the US, in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting of EU trade ministers.
    


                    “It could be energy security, it could be military trade, it could be new technologies – but we should really focus on that to find a common ground, because the trade wars are never favorable for everyone,” Uršulskis said.
                





            One area the EU could target is US services, rather than just goods – which would punish US tech giants. But Uršulskis said this would be the wrong focus.
    


                    “I don't think that we should target services,” he said. “Once again, it's much more needed to find some positive agenda and to show our partners that we can find common ground and not start new wars and new battlefields.”
                





            Goldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street bank to warn that US President Donald Trump's trade war could crash the US economy into a damaging recession.
    


            As financial markets plunged, Goldman Sachs economists delivered a report to clients titled “Countdown to Recession” that slashed their 2025 GDP forecast to 0.5% and raised their 12-month recession probability from 35% to 45%.
    


            The investment bank cited the “sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed.”
    


            The new recession warning from Goldman Sachs is lower than the 60% recession forecast from JPMorgan Chase last week. But that's because Goldman's forecast hinges on an assumption that Trump won't allow all his threatened tariffs to kick in.
    


                    “If most of the April 9 tariffs do take effect, then the effective tariff rate will rise by an estimated 20 percentage points once those increases and likely sectoral tariffs take effect, even allowing for some country-specific agreements at a later date,” Goldman Sachs economists wrote. “If so, we expect to change our forecast to a recession.”
                





            In other words, if Trump doesn't blink, Goldman Sachs believes a recession is likely on the cards.
    


            The bank now expects the Fed to cut rates starting in June (versus July previously) followed by twice more later in the year. If a recession becomes more likely, Goldman said the Fed would likely slash interest rates by two full percentage points over the next year.
    


            After Elon Musk said he was in favor of “zero tariffs” between the United States and European Union – in opposition to policies of the US president he helped elect – Germany's economy minister said Musk was showing signs of “weakness” and “fear.”
    


            “Yes, I read what Elon Musk said,” Robert Habeck said Monday, referring to Musk's comments this weekend that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU.
    


            “I think it's a sign of weakness and maybe of fear, because the acting politics are completely different,” Habeck said as he arrived at a meeting of EU trade ministers.
    


                    “If he has something to say, he should go to his president and say, ‘Before we're talking about zero tariffs, let's stop the nonsense, the mess you have just made in the last week,'” Habeck said.
                





            “This is ridiculous, and the only interpretation I have is that he now sees that his own companies, but even the economies are going to crumble because of the mess they have made, so he's afraid,” he added, referring to Tesla's tanking stock price.
    


            Habeck called for a return to the policies of globalization that had “served all economies” around the world, and especially the US.
    


            Markets are notoriously unpredictable – it's not easy to pinpoint the mood on the Street.
    


            That's why a little over a decade ago, journalists at what was then called CNNMoney created the Fear & Greed Index — a kind of Wall Street vibe check that's been garnering extra attention in recent days as global markets have tumbled in response to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.
    


            The index is an easy-to-read barometer of investors' risk appetite on a 100-point scale, from extreme fear (0) to extreme greed (100).
    


            It was designed to give a sense of how much markets are being driven by fear (selling stocks, buying safer assets like Treasury bonds) or greed (buying stocks, loading up on risk).
    


            On Friday afternoon, in the middle of a massive global selloff, the index was at a 4, firmly in “extreme fear.”
    


            The story of the index begins in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis.
    


            “So, March 2009, the market bottoms, and there's some sense of recovery, but we were all trying to figure out how to measure where we were, beyond just the daily ups and downs” Lex Haris, former executive editor of CNNMoney, said in an interview. “And I was just very drawn to this concept of these two emotions driving the market.”
    


            When the index launched in the spring of 2012, CNNMoney's executive editor at the time, Chris Peacock, said it “captures in an eye-blink the underlying forces driving investors' money moves.”
    


            US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a colossal set of tariffs on America's trading partners is tantamount to “economic nuclear war,” according to billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president.
    


            In a post on X Sunday, Ackman said “business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets” if many of the new levies come into force on April 9. “We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,” he added in the post viewed 8.9 million times.
    


            Trump's baseline 10% tariff went into effect Saturday, while many countries are bracing for higher levies still, due to kick in Wednesday.
    


            The CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management called for a 90-day “time out” in which Trump could negotiate with trading partners and “resolve unfair asymmetric tariffs deals” and warned that “the president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe.”
    


            “This is not what we voted for,” he wrote.
    


            Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% lower on Monday, making it the worst single one-day drop since 1997, according to the index's website listing its biggest daily losses.
    


            The city's financial markets were closed on Friday for the annual Tomb Sweeping Festival.
    


            The Hang Seng index includes stocks from some of Hong Kong's and mainland China's largest listed companies, such as Alibaba, HSBC, Tencent, Meituan and Xiaomi.
    


            Chinese tech champions Alibaba and Tencent closed nearly 18% and more than 12.5% lower, respectively. Banking corporation HSBC plunged 14.8%, Chinese delivery giant Meituan plummeted 15% and consumer electronics firm Xiaomi finished down 20.6%.
    


Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, has called for swift action in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs that has caused global markets to plummet.
    


                    “The situation on the international equity and bond markets is dramatic and threatens to deteriorate further. It is therefore more urgent than ever for Germany to restore its international competitiveness as quickly as possible,” Merz told Reuters Monday.
                





                    “The issue must now be at the center of the coalition negotiations,” Merz said, referring to ongoing talks in Germany over the formation of its next government following February's election, which was won by his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
                





            As a member of the European Union, Germany has been hit by a 20% “reciprocal” tariff on all exports to the US, while its steel and auto industry faces a separate 25% tariff.
    


            Since February's election, Germany's parliament voted to cancel its historic “debt brake” – a constitutional mechanism designed to limit government borrowing. The move will enable the usually fiscally conservative country to spend hundreds of billions of euros on its infrastructure and defense.
    


            Although analysts had hailed the attempt to revive Europe's largest economy, Trump's tariffs are set to inflict further economic pain on Germany, halting its hoped-for recovery.
    


Oil prices plunged Monday, with investors worried about the economic fallout from Donald Trump's decision to impose massive tariffs on America's trading partners.
    


            Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, plunged 3.5% to trade at $63.30 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, also fell 3.5% to $59.84 by 4.16 a.m. ET. Both are trading at their lowest levels since early 2021 when the world was still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.
    


            The falls in prices come after OPEC+, the coalition of the world's top oil producers, surprised investors last week by deciding on a much bigger boost in oil supply than planned earlier: Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of the group agreed on larger production increases starting in May than previously announced.
    


            As Trump's tariffs rock global markets, countries are scrambling to negotiate concessions – but China is taking a different approach.
    


            Their message is clear: China is well prepared to weather a trade war, and come out stronger on the other side.
    


            “US tariffs will have an impact (on China), but ‘the sky won't fall,'” a commentary in the ruling Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily said Sunday.
    


            “Since the US initiated the (first) trade war in 2017 – no matter how the US fights or presses – we have continued to develop and progress, demonstrating resilience – ‘the more pressure we get, the stronger we become,'” read the commentary, which was also on the front page of the paper's Monday edition.
    


            Just 48 hours after Trump's shocking announcement, the world's second-largest economy swiftly retaliated with its own punitive measures on US goods and firms, signaling that it's prepared for the long haul.
    


            Read the full analysis here.
    


            US stock futures plunged before market open Monday after US President Donald Trump intensified his global trade war last week, prompting retaliation from China.
    


            Dow futures were 5.5% lower and S&P 500 futures 6% down at 4.01 a.m. ET. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, was set to open 5.8% lower.
    


            The massive declines in futures follow the worst two-day stretch for stocks in five years – since the pandemic.
    


            And market analysts said investors aren't done selling yet.
    


            “Last week's brutal selling pressure is set to continue on Monday, as the market is telling us that investors still lack clarity on the implications of tariffs, tariff retaliation and are worried that economic growth is likely to slow to a complete stall or recession,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research.
    


            When US President Donald Trump unveiled his “reciprocal” tariffs chart, trade economists were flummoxed.
    


            Near the top of the list was Vietnam, which had imposed a 90% average tariff on US goods, according to the chart – far higher than the actual rate.
    


            But the crude methodology used by the White House to calculate the “reciprocal” global tariffs quickly became clear, as was first pointed out by financial journalist James Surowiecki.
    


            The Trump administration used a simple formula: It took each country's trade deficit with the United States, divided it by the value of that country's exports to the US, then divided this figure by half, in a gesture of “kindness.”
    


            Let's take this step by step, using official US data.
    


                    In 2024, Vietnam sold $136.6 billion worth of goods to the US.
                





                    Because Americans want to buy things like Nike shoes a lot more than Vietnamese want to buy things like Ford cars, the US sold just $13.1 billion of goods to Vietnam that year.
                





                    This gave Vietnam a trade surplus of $123.5 billion with the US. But one man's trade surplus is another man's trade deficit – which Trump finds unpalatable, akin to being “ripped off.”
                





                    Dividing $123.5 billion (Vietnam's trade surplus) by $136.6 (Vietnam's exports) gives 0.90, or 90% when translated into tariffs. In a supposed act of “kindness,” Trump nearly halved this, meaning Vietnam will now face a tariff of 46%.
                





            And so Trump's tariffs were designed to punish countries for having trade surpluses with the US – not for imposing actual tariffs
    


            US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of selloffs that wiped away more than $5.4 trillion in market value. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under President Barack Obama, joined CNN's Jessica Dean to discuss the chaos.
    


            As White House officials offered mixed messages Sunday on whether tariffs are here to stay or a negotiating ploy, Summers wrote on X that he has “never seen as much incoherence and irrationality” from Trump administration officials.
    


                    “This Administration doesn't have a coherent message on why it's doing the largest tax increase the country's had in 50 years. Usually when you do something consequential, you have a clear rationale that's consistently delivered, and we're not getting that,” Summers said.
                





            Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs, downplaying severe market volatility.
    


            US President Donald Trump has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture.
    


            More than 50 countries – including Vietnam, India and Israel – have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs, officials said Sunday.
    


            That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”
    


            But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


                    “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,” he told Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
                





            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also could not say whether tariffs are here to stay.
    


                    “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
                





Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a key aide to US President Donald Trump, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States.
    


            Musk's comments – in a video interview Saturday with Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini – are the strongest sign of splits within the Trump administration over the president's tariff announcement that sparked a global market rout.
    


                    “At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said, in contrast to the trade policy of the US president he helped elect.
                





            Musk has seen Tesla sales plunge in recent months amid his controversial cost-cutting role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Sales fell 49% in Europe alone in the first two months of the quarter, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
    


            Musk's comments come as questions swirl about his future in the White House. Last week, Politico reported – citing MAGA insiders – that Musk had overstayed his welcome in Washington and could be ousted within weeks. The White House called the Politico report “garbage” and Musk dismissed it as “fake news.”
    


            Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by US President Donald Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs.
    


            Germany's Dax opened down 9%, while London's FTSE was about 5% lower. European markets were, on the whole, faring better than Asian markets in early trade. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.
    


            In mainland China, where markets reopened after a public holiday, the Shanghai Composite Index closed more than 7% lower. The blue-chip CSI300 index also lost about 7%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index last traded just under 12% lower. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent were each down more than 14% and 10% respectively.
    


            Trading volumes in Hong Kong surged on Monday, which she said was “a clear sign of widespread forced liquidations and what can only be described as a full-blown panic.”
    


            Asian markets are tracking the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of sell-offs that wiped away over $5.4 trillion in market value.
    


            US stocks fell sharply on Friday after China retaliated fiercely, imposing a 34% tariff on all US goods, raising fears of an escalating and damaging trade war fueled by continuing trade tension between the world's two largest economies.

            Despite his tariffs wiping away trillions from the market value of global stocks, US President Donald Trump appeared untroubled late Sunday evening.
    


            “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
    


            In his “Liberation Day” announcement last week, Trump claimed that the US has been “ripped off for more than 50 years,” saying this is “not going to happen anymore.”
    


            Although Trump's tariffs were billed as “reciprocal,” the levies were calculated to punish countries like Vietnam and Cambodia with whom the US has large trade deficits.

Follow:


            Rats don't always have the best reputations, but one named Ronin with a super sense of smell is working to change that.
    


            Ronin and his landmine-sniffing rat pack are making a name for rodents everywhere by saving innocent civilians from hidden explosives.
    


            The African giant pouched rat recently set a new world record for the most landmines detected by a rat. Between August 2021 and February 2025, Ronin uncovered 109 landmines and 15 other pieces of unexploded ordnance in a region close to Siem Reap in Cambodia, according to Guinness World Records.



            “Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of rats,” his main handler Phanny told the Guinness publication.
    


            Landmines are a major issue in former conflict zones. The explosive weapons, hidden in the ground, are designed to injure or kill anyone who passes over them. In Cambodia alone, they have caused more than 65,000 deaths and injuries since the fall of the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.



            Their use is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and the threat they pose for decades after a conflict has ended, killing and maiming and hampering land development in war-ravaged areas.
    


            They are also notoriously difficult and dangerous to detect. That's where rats come in;  their high intelligence, speed and keen sense of smell make them adept at identifying explosives. They are also too light to trigger landmines.
    


            It's crucial work. An estimated 110 million landmines are still buried in over 60 countries around the world, said landmine detection nonprofit APOPO. In 2023, landmines caused 5,757 casualties globally — 37% of which involved children, according to the 2024 Landmine Monitor.



            Ronin is one of more than 100 rats trained by APOPO to detect the scent of the explosive chemicals and point landmines out to their handlers.
    


            The rats are highly versatile and have also been trained to detect tuberculosis in medical settings, helping to prevent the spread of infectious disease.
    


            The Belgian nonprofit's team of landmine-sniffing rats can search an area the size of a tennis court in 30 minutes – something that could take a deminer with a metal detector up to four days.
    


Ronin, who is 5 years old and was born in Tanzania, is much larger than your average pet rat. He is more than 2 feet long – about the length of a cat – and weighs 2.6 pounds, according to APOPO.
    


            Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, where Ronin was deployed has one of the highest landmine densities in the world following decades of conflict in the 20th century, including heavy bombing by the US during the Vietnam War.
    


            The US dropped 2.7 million tons of ordnance – including cluster bombs and submunitions – in a four-year carpet-bombing campaign in Cambodia. Up to a quarter of the cluster bombs failed to explode, meaning they stayed active and dangerous but out of sight, according to a 2019 report by the US Congressional Research Service.
    


            Despite years of demining efforts, there are still an estimated 4 to 6 million unexploded landmines in Cambodia, according to APOPO.

            Two U.S. border inspectors in Southern California have been charged with taking thousands of dollars in bribes to allow people to enter the country through the nation's busiest port of entry without showing documents, prosecutors said.
    


            U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were assigned to immigration inspection booths at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. They were charged after investigators found phone evidence showing they had exchanged messages with human traffickers in Mexico and discovered unexplained cash deposits into their bank accounts, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.
    


            Surveillance video showed at least one instance in which a vehicle with a driver and a passenger stopped at a checkpoint but only the driver was documented as having entered the country, prosecutors said.
    


            Prosecutors said the officers waved dozens of vehicles carrying people without documents. They said both men were paid thousands for each vehicle they waved through.
    


            It wasn't immediately known if Almonte has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.
    


            Rodriguez's attorney, Michael Hawkins, said the case was still in the “infant stages” and that Rodriguez has the presumption of innocence.
    


            “We look forward to working through the current situation,” Hawkins said in an email in which he described Rodriguez as hardworking and loyal.
    


            The investigation on Almonte and Rodriguez started after three migrant smugglers who were arrested last year told federal investigators they had been working with U.S. border inspectors, federal prosecutors said.
    


            While Almonte was in custody, investigators allegedly seized nearly $70,000 in cash they believe his romantic partner was trying to move to Tijuana. Prosecutors wrote in a court filing that Almonte is potentially facing additional charges for money laundering and obstruction of justice, The San Diego Union Tribune reported.
    


            “Any Customs and Border Protection agent who aids or turns a blind eye to smugglers bringing undocumented immigrants into the U.S. is betraying their oath and endangering our national security,” Acting U.S. Attorney Andrew Haden told the newspaper in a statement.
    


            There have been five U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers assigned to the San Diego area to face similar corruption charges in the last two years.
    


            Last year, former U.S. border inspector Leonard Darnell George was sentenced to 23 years in prison for taking bribes to allow people and drug-laden vehicles to enter the country through the San Ysidro border crossing. Two other former border officers at the Otay Mesa and Tecate ports of entry were charged last year with similar charges. They are expected to go on trial this summer.

Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian-American teenager and wounded two others in the occupied West Bank on Sunday night, according to Palestinian officials, after the Israeli military said it targeted a group throwing stones at cars.
    


            Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam said the 14-year-old Palestinian-American boy was shot dead by Israeli troops in the village of Turmusaya. Two other Palestinian-American boys, ages 14 and 15, were injured in the incident, according to the mayor of Turmusaya, Lafi Shalabi.
    


            The Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire during a counterterrorism operation in Turmusaya when they saw three “terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving.”
    


            The soldiers killed one and hit the other two, the military said.
    


            The military shared a blurry video purportedly showing the incident, in which three figures are seen. At the end of the short clip, one of the figures appears to hurl an object. The Israeli military said it would continue operating in the West Bank “to protect the residents in the area.”
    


            The injured boys were shot in the abdomen, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society.
    


            One severely injured boy and another with minor wounds were taken to a hospital in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority health ministry said.
    


            The killing of a Palestinian-American teenager came just hours before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in the United States to meet President Donald Trump. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
    


            The killing or detention of American citizens in occupied Palestinian territories by Israelis and concerns about a lack of accountability date back years. In 2003, American activist Rachel Corrie, 23, was crushed by an Israeli army bulldozer while trying to block it from razing Palestinian homes in Gaza. Nine years later, an Israeli civil court ruled her death an accident.
    


            In spring 2022, prominent Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed while reporting in the West Bank. That November, Defense Minister Benny Gantz confirmed that Israel would not cooperate with a US probe into her death. A CNN investigation suggested that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces, despite wearing a vest marked “Press.”
    


            In February last year, Florida-born US citizen Mohammed Khdour, 17, was killed by Israeli forces who shot him in the head while he was in his car. The teenager was taking the car out during a study break, snacking on chocolate waffles, posing for Instagram.

Israeli outposts have proliferated in the West Bank since Oct. 7, analysis shows. Palestinians fear annexation could be next.



            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) referred questions about Khdour's case to the Israeli Security Agency, known as the Shin Bet, which did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Three weeks before Khdour's death, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old Palestinian-American who grew up in Louisiana, was also shot in the head by apparent Israeli gunmen. The IDF told CNN they received a report that an off-duty police officer and an Israeli civilian shot at a Palestinian “suspected of throwing stones” – which his family vehemently denied – and that the Israeli Police were investigating the shooting.
    


            Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank have intensified since late January following the launch of an expanded military campaign there almost immediately after the Gaza ceasefire began. Since then, roughly 40,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes.
    


            The Israeli military says it is targeting Palestinian militant groups who have mounted attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, but Palestinians and human rights groups say the expanded assault is increasingly indiscriminate – killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure in a manner consistent with collective punishment. In late February, Israel deployed tanks to the occupied West Bank for the first time in two decades.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Alysa Liu is back in love with a sport she once grew to hate","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/sport/alysa-liu-figure-skating-spt/index.html","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:50:00 GMT","


            It's a comeback that had looked so unlikely, even Alysa Liu's coaches tried to talk the American teenager out of returning.
    


            The 19-year-old is surely glad she didn't listen though after becoming the first US woman in 19 years to win a world figure skating title, dethroning three-time defending champion Kaori Sakamoto from Japan in the process. It's an accomplishment Alysa herself describes as “insane.”
    


            “I haven't even been training for a whole year yet. I never would have expected to do this good. I'm really proud of myself and my team. It was just such a great experience that whole week. It was my first worlds since I retired. It was my last competition, actually. So, coming back, it was really emotional and bittersweet, but I skated two great programs and I just happened to walk away with the gold,” Liu told CNN Sports.
    


            “So, coming back and medaling again was really crazy. It's such a wild story,” she added.
    


            A story that's even more remarkable because, in 2019, Liu was a history-making child prodigy who at just 13 years of age became the youngest US champion ever. She would then compete at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. Liu – the oldest of 5 children – even medaled at that year's World Championships before shocking the skating world by announcing she was retiring from competition at just 16.
    


            “Back then, honestly, I really was just a kid wanting to be with my siblings and make memories with them. I hadn't gone on vacation ever in my life until after I quit skating. So, it's just human moments that I really craved. I just felt very isolated back then, traveling everywhere for training purposes. And I mean, I knew it had to be done because the Olympics was right around the corner, but it was really hard for me back then,” said the California native.
    


            “When everyone wants you to win gold and all you want to do is be with your friends and family, it's really hard because you're doing something not for yourself. And I never really liked training. I didn't like doing anything hard.  I wasn't living at home at all, and all the traveling, it got me really sick. I just really wanted to be at home and just enjoy hobbies and find myself. I feel like everyone was telling me who I was, and I never had that moment of clarity to realize anything about myself.”
    


            Liu at one point admits she grew to even hate certain aspects of the sport.
    


            “Yeah, I really did. I went through such highs and such lows. I felt like it was so extreme, and I wanted a break and at that time, I thought it was going to be a permanent break from the sport, but life goes on and I went through the extreme of being in the sport and the extreme of being completely out of it, and now I think I have a really healthy medium,” she said.
    


            In fact, the recently crowned world champion – who's now a psychology major at UCLA – is in an altogether much better place and totally reinvigorated. Something for which she credits an impromptu skiing trip to Lake Tahoe with friends during her time away from skating – a trip that would change everything.
    


            “I hadn't skated at all, and I would never step in the ice rink. I would avoid it at all costs.  I wouldn't talk about it. I wouldn't watch skating. I completely disconnected myself from that world. And when I skied, you know, it's cold, you have a lot of adrenaline,” Liu recalls.
    


            “It takes a good amount of physical strength to get down those hills. It's so similar to skating, and that was the first time I had felt that since competition and since quitting. And I really enjoyed it. So, I thought, why not step back out on the ice, since it's easier to access than the mountains,” she added.
    


            Liu's momentous victory in Boston follows a devastating last few months for the tight-knit figure skating community. Earlier this year, a plane crash claimed the lives of 67 people, including 11 young skaters, four coaches and 13 family members who'd attended the US Figure Skating Championships in Kansas. Liu poignantly chose to dedicate her historic win to not just her team but also everyone on that plane.
    


            “Everyone just inspires me so much and especially because the worlds were in Boston, I really felt like I was skating with everybody,” she said. “It was really powerful, and I think this is what skating's all about. When I watch back some of the skaters, their skating is really good, and I even took something. I learned from watching them and the support and just their skating in general, it really makes our community.  They had so many friends and skating, they inspired so many people, they had fun with so many people
    


            She added, “I just like to think they're with all of us every step of the way and in everyone's skating journey. It's about never forgetting them and remembering who they were as people and skaters.”
    


            For Liu now, future hopes are firmly focused on next year's Winter Olympics in Italy.
    


            “I'm really excited. I hope I'm there. My first Olympics was really fun, and I thought, why not do another Olympics? And I'm pretty confident in my team moving forward. I think I'm going to be a whole lot better next season. I'm really excited for my own growth,” the teenager said.  “I'm just trying to visualize two awesome programs I can put out. Something I can be proud of that I would love to showcase at the Olympics one day because it's the biggest stage. It's the biggest honor.”
    


            With a newfound joy and passion, Liu is once again preparing to scale new heights. Quite appropriate considering that in 2023 she joined a group that embarked upon a grueling journey of over 30 miles to Mount Everest base camp, more than 17,000 feet above sea level.
    


            Liu may have climbed to the top of the world in her sport but as far as one day summitting Everest is concerned, she says that's simply not an option.
    


            “The hardest part of the trek, like up the actual peak is the beginning with all the glaciers. Although I'm good with ice, I don't know if I'm good with that type of ice. I'm going to avoid that,” she said. “I think I'll just stick with hiking!”

UK households should prepare 72-hour emergency survival kits over fears that Russia could sabotage Britain's energy pipelines, potentially leading to significant disruptions, the Daily Mail reported on Sunday, citing unnamed security experts. Russia has repeatedly denied speculation it has plans to damage Western energy infrastructure.

According to the British tabloid, the UK's energy system has faced challenges and came close to blackouts during the past winter, relying on emergency reserves and electricity imports from Denmark to maintain supply. The situation has also been complicated by the British government's push to phase out fossil fuel and nuclear power plants in favor of renewable energy.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail pointed out that this could leave the UK vulnerable to potential sabotage of the energy infrastructure that connects Britain to the outside world, particularly by Russian ships.

In light of this, security experts told the paper that British households should also follow the EU's advice of assembling a three-day survival kit. This kit should include water, non-perishable food, medicines, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, identity documents, and a Swiss Army knife. 

“We know that the Russians are active in the North Sea and have the power to cripple our energy links. We need to become much more self-sufficient, and quickly. And households should be ready for all eventualities,” the source said.

While the paper claimed that the fears about potential Russian sabotage also hinge on the fact it “was linked to a string of apparent sabotage incidents in the Baltic Sea” in recent months, Western investigators have failed to find any proof of any Russian connection to the incidents. Moscow has also vehemently denied speculation about its potential involvement, calling it “absurd.”

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer intends to “reignite [] industrial heartlands” through carbon capture, storage, wind farms and defense spending, a government source told Daily Mail.

Still, the paper's source also noted that the government currently has no plans to encourage households to pack survival kits.

In January, the Russian embassy in the UK dismissed claims that Moscow poses a threat to underwater infrastructure. Officials noted at the time that the British establishment and media were fueling “anti-Russian hysteria” to justify increased military presence in regions such as the Baltic and North Seas.

The Bitcoin price has dropped below $75,000 for the first time in five months as investors braced for financial market turbulence, following the rollout of US President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs. The majority of the top 100 altcoins also saw their value plunge by around 15% or more following the steepest decline in US equities since 2020.

The Trump administration imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all countries starting April 5, with some hit with steeper rates, including China at 34%, the EU at 20%, and Japan at 24%. The measures have stoked fears of a global trade war that could potentially drag the American economy into a recession.

The price of Bitcoin dropped beneath a key technical level – $79,000 to $80,000 – over the weekend. It plunged further below $75,000 on Monday and then settled at $76,000 after hitting almost $90,000 just a week earlier. Ethereum dropped 14.19% to $1,551.52, while XRP fell 14.52% to $1.81. Binance Coin declined by 6.51%, and Solana tumbled 13.96%.

Bitcoin's decline sparked a wave of long liquidations, as traders who had bet on rising prices were forced to sell off their positions to cover mounting losses. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin accounted for more than $247 million in long liquidations, according to CoinGlass. Ether followed closely behind, with $217 million in long positions wiped out during the same period.

In total, the crypto market recorded over $1.38 billion in liquidations, with the majority coming from long positions. Around $1.21 billion was erased from traders betting on prices to rise, according to Coinglass.

Mounting fears over the widespread impact of the tariffs sent shockwaves through global markets. European stock markets fell on Monday morning, continuing a global selloff that had already rattled Asian markets.

“There is a lot of noise at the moment,” Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered's head of digital assets research, was quoted by CNBC as saying.

“I think Bitcoin will become a hedge against tariff risks this time around. US isolationism is akin to increased risks of holding fiat, which will ultimately benefit Bitcoin,” he added.

Trump, however, defended the tariffs on Sunday, saying they were necessary to fix trade deficits with China, the EU, and others. He acknowledged the market sell-off, noting that while he was aware of the downturn and didn't want to see values decline, he had no intention of easing the tariffs.

Thousands of people in the UK have been detained and questioned by police over online posts deemed threatening or offensive, The Times has reported, citing custody data.

According to figures published on Friday, officers make around 12,000 arrests annually under Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 and Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988. These laws criminalize causing distress by sending messages that are “grossly offensive,” or by sharing content of an “indecent, obscene or menacing character” via electronic communications networks.

In 2023 alone, officers from 37 police forces made 12,183 arrests – around 33 per day. The Times said this marks a 58% increase from 2019, when 7,734 arrests were recorded.

At the same time, government data shows that convictions and sentencings have dropped by nearly a half. While some cases were resolved through out-of-court settlements, the most commonly cited reason was “evidential difficulties,” particularly when victims declined to proceed.

The statistics have sparked public outcry, with civil liberties groups accusing the authorities of overpolicing the internet and undermining free speech through the use of “vague” communications laws.

The Times highlighted the case of Maxie Allen and Rosalind Levine, who were arrested on January 29 after raising concerns in a private parents' WhatsApp group about the hiring process of their daughter's school. Six uniformed officers arrived at their home, detained them in front of their youngest child, and took them to a police station.

The couple was questioned on suspicion of harassment, malicious communications, and causing a nuisance on school property after the school alleged they had “cast aspersions” about the chair of governors. They were fingerprinted, searched, and locked in a cell for eight hours.

“It was hard to shake off the sense that I was living in a police state,” Allen told the Daily Mail, adding that the messages contained “no offensive language or threat” but were simply a “bit sarcastic.”

Support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has reached parity with the country's conservative CDU/CSU alliance, according to a new national poll. The development comes as the CDU/CSU remains in talks to form a new government, weeks after a federal election.

The survey, conducted by the INSA institute for the Bild newspaper and published on Sunday, showed that the AfD and the long-established coalition of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) both have 24% public support.

Compared to the last poll in February conducted shortly after the federal election, the CDU/CSU lost 2% while the AfD gained 1%. Meanwhile, Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) – whose rating plummeted under Chancellor Olaf Scholz – maintained 16% support, while the Greens and the Left Party each polled at 11%. 

The survey interviewed 1,206 voters between March 31 and April 4.

Bild described the poll's results for the CDU/CSU – which was formerly led by ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel – as “the worst-case scenario” for the bloc. One unnamed CDU official cited by Bild went as far as to predict that “by Easter, the AfD will be ahead of the Union in the polls.”

The federal election in February saw the CDU/CSU emerge as the leading party with 28.5% of the vote. Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, is currently engaged in coalition negotiations to form a government and is the presumed next chancellor.

However, Merz has ruled out any talks with the AfD on its participation in the coalition, explaining that the party “stands against our Western orientation, it stands against the euro, it stands against NATO.”

At the same time, the CDU has said it will implement stricter migration policies, even if it requires support from the AfD.

Migration concerns have been at the heart of the AfD's rise for several years as Germany faces challenges in accommodating asylum seekers. The debate has been amplified by incidents involving migrants, such as the arrest of a 19-year-old Syrian in Berlin in February for a stabbing attack near the Holocaust Memorial, which authorities described as motivated by anti-Semitism.

Asian stock markets plunged on Monday, extending a global sell-off sparked by US President Donald Trump's new tariff hikes and China's retaliatory measures.

Last week, Trump imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and announced additional “reciprocal” duties on dozens of countries with what he called unfair trade imbalances. China responded with a 34% tariff on US goods, mirroring Trump's levy. Other countries also signaled plans to impose retaliatory tariffs. The moves triggered fears of a trade war and a potential US recession, leading to a market rout that erased nearly $5 trillion in value off US stocks last week.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped nearly 9% in early Monday trading, its lowest since October 2023. It recovered slightly but was still down over 7% by midday. Japan's bank stock index fell as much as 17%.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng had plunged nearly 14% as of 7:30 GMT, while Shanghai's Composite index was down 7.3%. Shares of Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent dropped 17% and 12% respectively. Taiwan's exchange fell almost 10% on opening – its largest one-day percentage and point loss on record. South Korea's Kospi index dropped 5.5% and was briefly halted. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed down 4.2%, marking its worst session since the Covid-19 pandemic.

The European markets also started the day with losses. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index, which tracks the 600 leading companies in Europe, slumped by over 6% at market open, to its lowest level since early December 2023. US markets also appeared headed for losses. S&P 500 futures slid 2.5%, with similar trends for the Dow and Nasdaq.

“Wherever we look this morning, it's a bloodbath,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, in a note to The Guardian. “The S&P500 is down by almost 4%... and the week hasn't even started yet.”

US markets had already posted their worst drop since the 2020 Covid-19 crash last week, with the S&P 500 down 6%, the Dow off 5.5%, and the Nasdaq falling 5.8% at Friday close. Billionaire US investor Bill Ackman warned on X on Sunday that Trump had triggered an “economic nuclear war” which could hurt domestic economy, and urged him to reverse course.

Trump, however, defended the tariffs. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late on Sunday, he said that while he is aware of the market sell-off and doesn't “want anything to go down,” he will not ease on the tariffs.

“Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he stated. “What's gonna happen with the market I can't tell you… but I do wanna solve the deficit problem that we have with China, with the EU, and other nations. And they're gonna have to do that.”

Authorities in Latvia are planning to remove Soviet memorials dedicated to those who died while driving out Nazi forces from the country during World War II, TASS reported on Monday, citing Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The demolitions, under the pretext of false archaeological research, are allegedly intended to overshadow the celebration of the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany on May 9.

Riga views the period when Latvia was part of the USSR as a foreign occupation. Along with neighboring Lithuania and Estonia, it has been working to erase landmarks related to that era, including memorials to Soviet soldiers killed during the war.

“The Latvian authorities, in their relentless drive to overshadow the May 9 celebration this year, are working on plans for the mass destruction of military memorials,” the SVR stated, as cited by the news agency.

Riga intends “to get rid of about a third of the monuments over the mass graves of Soviet liberator soldiers within the shortest possible time,” according to the SVR.

The scheme allegedly involves carrying out fake archaeological excavations intended “at any cost, to debunk the existence of mass graves beneath the memorials.”

According to the SVR, Latvia has mobilized a team to desecrate the graves and fabricate “necessary” reports indicating the absence of burial traces “for a reasonable fee.”

It also asserts that the Latvian authorities “are going to start with the Orthodox Tornakalns Cemetery and the Military Brothers' Cemetery located in Riga.”

Since declaring independence in 1991 Latvia has adopted a slew of policies that alienate the country's sizeable ethnic Russian minority still living in the Baltic state, and removed several Soviet WWII memorials.

Soviet and Russian symbols are banned in the country, meaning that over the past two years, Latvian police have detained dozens of people during Victory Day celebrations.

No EU country would enforce the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant for Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has claimed.

During last week's visit from the Israeli prime minister, Hungary announced its intention to withdraw from the Rome Statute, the treaty that grants authority to the ICC. The court, which depends on national jurisdictions to execute arrests, accuses Netanyahu of war crimes in the Gaza conflict.

De Wever, leader of the nationalist New Flemish Alliance and head of a five-party coalition, expressed understanding for Budapest's defiance during an appearance on VRT's Terzake program last week, admitting, “We would do that too, to be completely honest.”

“There is also realpolitik. I don't believe there is any European country willing to arrest Netanyahu if he were on its soil,” he added.

The ICC has criticized Budapest, with spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah stating that “Hungary remains under a duty to cooperate” with the judicial body.

Members of Belgium's ruling coalition distanced themselves from De Wever's comments, asserting that he had not consulted with them. Meanwhile, opposition parties criticized the prime minister for stepping onto a “dangerous slippery slope,” in making a call that they believe should be reserved for the judiciary and siding with “dubious European leaders who shamelessly disregard international law.”

Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and now-former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for allegedly committing grave atrocities, including using starvation as a method of warfare, in response to a deadly 2023 raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Earlier this year, Warsaw offered Netanyahu safety guarantees should he attend the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz Nazi death camp by the Red Army. The Israeli prime minister declined to make the trip.

Outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted last week that he “cannot imagine” arresting Netanyahu should the latter visit his country. The French government has argued that the Israeli prime minister should have diplomatic immunity under the Rome Statute, an opinion that the ICC disputes.

Billionaire fund manager tries to persuade US president over tariffs, which have wiped $6tn off US stocks

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

“The president has an opportunity to call a 90-day time out,” Ackman said on Sunday in a post on X, to resolve trade issues via negotiation.

“If, on the other hand ... we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.”

Though Trump made imposing tariffs a part of his victorious 2024 electoral campaign, which Ackman endorsed, the billionaire fund manager's X post said: “This is not what we voted for.”

Ackman's post came after Trump's tariffs wiped $6tn off US stocks. Asia and Europe's markets slumped, too.

The Trump tariffs are 10% across the board, with higher rates aimed at about 60 countries.

Late Sunday on Air Force One, Trump told reporters he had spent the weekend speaking to leaders from Europe and Asia who tried to convince him to lower his tariffs – some that are as high as 50% and are due to take effect this week.

But Trump said that those counties would need to pay “a lot of money on a yearly basis” for him to reconsider.

In his post, Ackman also said: “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.”

Staying the course would mean “heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down”, Ackman's post also said. “May cooler heads prevail.”

There were no immediate indications that pleas such as Ackman's would persuade Trump. During his Air Force One talk with reporters on Sunday, he said: “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan echo president and key ally as experts express fears for ‘bedrock constitutional principles'

As Donald Trump and Elon Musk widen their radical attacks on US judges who have stalled some of Trump's executive orders and Musk's slashing of federal agencies, they're gaining backing from top House Republicans and other politicians, including some to whom the tech billionaire made big campaign donations.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump's attacks on judges, and a judiciary subcommittee hearing on 1 April explored “judicial overreach” and ways to curb judges who have stymied some Trump orders or Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and its draconian cuts to the federal government.

Veteran Republican consultants say the hefty campaign-spending muscle of Musk, the world's richest person, who spent about $300m helping Trump win last year, is likely to boost many Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.

“Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Musk to make a lot of donations to them in 2026,” said longtime Republican consultant Charlie Black. “But it's likely that such donations will be coordinated with the president's preferences.”

The verbal assaults on judges by Trump and his allies have been fueled by multiple rulings adverse to some Trump executive orders, including major court decisions in March that sought to halt deporting Venezuelan immigrants and blocking penalizing law firms that Trump deemed political enemies.

Washington DC judge James Boasberg incurred Trump's wrath for trying to halt the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison with a nationwide injunction challenging the tenuous legal basis for the administration action. Boasberg's ruling spurred Trump to falsely label him a “radical left lunatic”, urge his impeachment, and then call for him to be disbarred.

Musk has repeatedly used X, the social media platform he owns and on which he has over 200 million followers, to urge impeaching judges whose rulings he doesn't like. “The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,” he said on 25 February.

Legal scholars say Trump and Musk's radical threats of impeachment or disbarment for judicial rulings that stall or block administration moves undermine the rule of law.

“Trump and Musk are playing with fire,” said retired Massachusetts judge Nancy Gertner, who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “They're undermining bedrock constitutional principles.”

She added: “You can't shut down a court just because you disagree. The judges have done nothing wrong or inconsistent with their oaths, and nothing outside their judicial roles.”

Trump's call for impeaching Boasberg drew a sharp and broad rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who last month said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.

Further, contrary to Trump's baseless charges against Boasberg, the judge's rulings have hardly been one-sided. One example: Boasberg sided with Trump in 2017 to stop the IRS from sharing his tax returns which a long-shot lawsuit sought.

Besides Boasberg, three other Washington DC judges last month ruled against Trump executive orders targeting law firms he viewed as political foes for retribution, which the judges argued were on dangerous or dubious legal ground.

Among other things, the Trump orders seek to take away security clearances for some of the law firms and sharply curtail their government business.

To ratchet up pressures on judges, after judge Beryl Howell issued a decision in March to temporarily block Trump from penalizing the law firm Perkins Coie, the justice department, in a rare move, tried to have Howell removed from the case, alleging she was biased.

In a blistering response, Howell wrote: “This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented.”

Two other DC judges in March backed law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which sued the administration on first amendment grounds to block executive orders aimed at hurting the firms financially for their separate ties to key lawyers who led a special counsel inquiry into how Russia worked to help elect Trump in 2016.

Judge John Bates, an appointee of George W Bush who issued a restraining order blocking Trump's sanctions against Jenner & Block, called Trump's punitive move “disturbing” and “troubling”, noting the order targets the firm's and its lawyers' rights under the first amendment, and due process.

Legal scholars and former judges are raising alarms about the rising dangers to the rule of law and the physical safety of judges sparked by the attacks from Trump and his congressional allies.

“While the threats to impeach federal judges based on their decisions are largely performative, they are also designed to foment disrespect for the judiciary and the rule of law,” said former federal judge John Jones, who is now the president of Dickinson College.

“In addition, many of the calls for impeachment are accompanied by the unconscionable disclosure of personal information about individual judges that jeopardize the personal safety of those judges and their family members.”

Other legal experts worry that Trump's judicial attacks, which some congressional allies are parroting even though the odds of impeaching judges are long, could spark violence.

“The real risk comes not from Congress, but the fringe elements in Trump's camp, who might be stirred up to threaten or actually inflict harm on the targeted judges,” said former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman.

“Judges are rightly worried about their safety, and the measures in place to protect them may prove inadequate if the dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from the Trump camp continues.”

Despite such fears, many of Trump's hardcore loyalists in Congress are jumping on board to further fuel Trump's attacks on judges, while benefiting from Musk's campaign largesse.

At least seven Republican members, including Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Brandon Gill of Texas, who echoed Trump's call for impeaching Judge Boasberg, or advocated other “action” against judges who ruled against Trump orders, received checks from Musk for $6,600, the maximum he could donate.

Although Republican leaders have suggested that impeachment of judges won't happen because they don't have the votes, their public efforts to bolster Trump's war on judicial independence has been accelerating, with allies exploring other avenues to curb judges.

Johnson turned up the heat on judges on 25 March when he vowed that “desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act”. One option eyed by Trump's Republican allies came up at a judiciary subcommittee hearing last week that focused on banning nationwide injunctions by judges. A House bill to ban such injunctions is expected to pass in coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Charles Grassley, the senator who leads his chamber's judiciary committee and has received a donation from Musk, held a hearing that also explored bans on nationwide injunctions by judges; Grassley in March introduced a bill that would end the “practice of universal injunctions”, but Senate passage is deemed a long shot.

Some former Republican congressmen are highly critical of Trump's congressional allies for amplifying his attacks on judges, and predict that the House GOP will try to “monetize” Trump's fury at a growing number of judges.

“The investigation into judges by Chairman Jordan, and calls by Gill and Ogles for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against Trump, are more examples of blind loyalty to Trump by a bunch of sycophants,” said former Michigan member Dave Trott.

“It would not be such a big deal except for the fact that their conduct is helping create a crisis involving the constitution they swore to uphold.”

Trott added: “And just in case these sycophants suddenly decide to stand up to Trump, Elon is using his billions to help Republicans get re-elected. This will ensure the GOP stays in line. The concentration of great wealth and power is a problem that will have serious consequences for our country.”

Other ex-Republican members voice similar concerns.

“I think this is a talking point and a fundraising tool,' said Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, adding that members will attack judges for “impeding Trump's agenda, and they'll try to monetize it for campaign purposes”.

Some former prosecutors say the judicial attacks by Trump and his GOP allies jibe with Trump's broader blitz to expand his powers

“Trump has, believe it or not, a strategic plan to disable all opposition,” said former prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig.

Part of that plan “involves eliminating internal oversight, like inspectors general, and cowing external opposition, by threatening law firms. The final piece is to eliminate the last independent check on his authority – judges. To do this he is falsely accusing them of bias and enlisting his sycophantic supporters, like Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, in the effort.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US president tells reporters foreign governments will have to pay ‘a lot of money' to lift levies

Stock markets across Europe slumped on Monday after Donald Trump said foreign governments would have to pay “a lot of money” to lift sweeping tariffs that he characterised as “medicine”.

Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One late on Sunday, the US president indicated he was not concerned about market losses that have already wiped out nearly $6tn (£5tn) in value from US stocks. “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said.

Trump's comments triggered a mass sell-off on Asian stock markets overnight and prompted the billionaire investor Bill Ackman, one of the US president's backers in the 2024 race for the White House, to call for a moratorium, saying that sweeping tariffs “on our friends and our enemies alike” had caused an “economic nuclear war”.

In Europe, stock markets plunged in early trading on Monday. The FTSE 100 fell as much as 6%, before recovering slightly to a fall of 3.5%, while Germany's Dax, France's CAC 40 and Italy's FTSE MIB fell about 6%.

On the FTSE 100, the industrial groups Babcock, Rolls-Royce and Melrose were among the biggest fallers, as well as investment companies and Barclays Bank, which has large operations in the US, as concerns over a tariff-induced global recession continued to rip through markets.

Overnight, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbled 8%, and Hong Kong and Chinese stocks also dived, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 12%. Shares in the Chinese tech companies Alibaba and Tencent fell more than 8%. In South Korea, trading on the Kospi index was halted for five minutes at 9.12am as stocks plummeted.

In Taiwan, the market fell almost 10%, the largest one-day point and percentage loss on record. Falls were driven by the tech companies TSMC and Foxconn, triggering circuit breakers.

More than $160bn was wiped off the Australian stock markets.

Oil prices sank, continuing a trend over the last week. Brent crude fell by more than $10 to $63.84, sending shares in oil majors sliding down. BP, which has lost two-fifths of its value over the past year, tumbled another 5% and Shell lost almost 6%.

After falling over the last week, gold rose slightly to $2,362. Gold has proved to be a safe haven asset during the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine, doubling its value since 2020.

Investors also reacted to the prospect of deeper interest rate cuts on Monday. Traders increased their predictions for UK rate cuts, pricing in three quarter-point drops in the UK, from 4.5% to 3.75% with a 90% expectation of a cut in May, while the Bank of Japan, which has been increasing interest rates, was expected to pause.

Trump said he had spoken over the weekend to leaders from Europe and Asia, who hope to convince him to lower tariffs that are as high as 50% and due to take effect this week. “They are coming to the table. They want to talk but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis,” Trump said.

Trump's tariff announcement last week jolted economies around the world, triggering retaliatory levies from China and sparking fears of a global trade war and recession. On Sunday morning talkshows, Trump's top economic advisers sought to portray the tariffs as a savvy repositioning of the US in the global trade order. They also tried to minimise the economic shocks from last week's tumultuous rollout.

The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said more than 50 nations had started negotiations with the US since last Wednesday's announcement.

Bessent said there was “no reason” to anticipate a recession, citing stronger-than-anticipated US jobs growth last month, before the tariffs were announced.

The US president spent the weekend in Florida, playing golf and posting a video of his swing to social media on Sunday.

US customs agents began collecting Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on all imports from many countries on Saturday. Higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11% to 50% on individual countries are due to take effect on Wednesday at 12.01am eastern daily time.

Some governments have already signalled a willingness to engage with the US to avoid the duties.

In his first significant intervention since the US ushered in a new economic era last week, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the government would step in to support key British industries.

He is to announce plans to give carmakers more flexibility over how they meet a target to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. Other sectors to be hit by Trump's tariffs are expected to receive support later in the week, with life sciences likely to be among them.

Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said uncertainty was another factor dragging down markets after US administration officials gave contradictory statements “causing investors to question the existence of a master plan”.

He said: “Investors had assumed Trump's trade taxes were a bargaining tool, as during the first term. That depends on competent policymaking to balance the benefits of trade negotiations against the damage of tariffs.

“If the competence of policymaking is questioned, markets will worry that economic damage will be lasting”

A search for safe havens benefited European and other industrialised nations, and the value of their bonds rallyied and the cost of borrowing fell.

The two-year gilt yield, which is a proxy for the interest rate, fell to its lowest since September 2024 at 3.814%, down 12 basis points (bps) on the day, while 10-year yields sank to their lowest since December at 4.379%, down 6 bps, before recovering to be 3 bps lower.
 “With Europe facing both recession and disinflation from global trade disruption, we suspect ECB/BoE terminal rate pricing can shift lower still,” market strategists at the US bank Citi wrote in a note to clients.

Goldman Sachs increased its predictions for a US recession over the next 12 months, from a 35% chance to 45%.

Tariff-stunned markets face another week of potential turmoil after the worst week for US stocks since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago.

The White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett denied the tariffs were part of a Trump strategy to crash financial markets to pressure the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. He said there would be no “political coercion” of the central bank.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič says bloc in a ‘tough spot' with 70% of exports being subjected to tariffs 

Šefčovič says the EU is “in early stages of discussions” with the US, complicated “because the US view tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure.”

But he says that “ while the EU remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not weigh endlessly until we see tangible progress.”

The EU has prepared a “robust list of countermeasures” on steel and aluminium after receiving feedback from over 600 stakeholders.

“After carefully reviewing all of it, we have worked to table a robust list of countermeasures, while balancing the burden across all member states, we will be sending the final list and tariff levels to them later today,

The vote is set for 9 April, with the final list adopted on 15 April, and then duties on products will kick in on that day for the first set of measures, and on 15 May for the remaining ones.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said the EU-US trade was “in a tough stop” but he hoped the EU and EU would “sooner or later” end up at a negotiation table, as he hoped for a negotiated solution to prolonging uncertainty surrounding US president Donald Trump's tariffs (16:18).

But the Slovak politician admitted that “until now, despite of efforts … we haven't seen the real engagement which would lead to the mutually acceptable solution” from the US side (16:12), as he warned that the Trump administration seemed to be determined to send an ideological signal to markets (16:30).

Šefčovič also spoke about a “clear difference of opinion” on figures in EU-US trade, arguing it it is wrong to look at trade in goods in isolation, without services, mutual investment, and other instruments.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen earlier said that “Europe is always ready for good deal,” but signaled the bloc was “also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests” (15:00).

Outgoing German economy minister Robert Habeck offered a brutal takedown of the US tariffs, saying the underlying calculations were “nonsense,” and “wrong,” as he urged US to “stop the nonsense … the mess you have made in the last week” (11:12).

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

British prime minister Keir Starmer spoke about US tariffs this afternoon too, warning that global consequences of Trump's move “could be profound.”

Nobody is pretending that tariffs are good news. You know that better than anyone – 25% tariffs on automotive exports and 10% on other goods, that is a huge challenge for our future, and the global economic consequences could be profound.

Starmer said we live in a new era, where the old assumptions don't apply any more, that he calls the age of insecurity.

For more on his comments and the UK's plans, see Andrew Sparrow's UK live blog here:

In response to the final question of the conference, Šefčovič says the EU and the US have “a clear difference of opinion” about the figures as he says it is wrong to look at trade in goods in isolation, without services, mutual investment, and other instruments.

In a hint at a potential US vulnerability, he adds: “I'm not even going into the direction of billions the US companies are generating from online advertising and different digital services that they're offering in Europe.”

He eventually says that the actual deficit that would need rebalancing is not higher than 50 billion euros.

“If we know that this is the issue, I think then we can sort it out very quickly. 

But my feeling is that at this stage it is more of a, I would say, decision of US administration to … transform the global trading system, and they see the tariffs as a corrective measures for many of the political goals, which I'm sure the US administration can describe much better, much better than I [can.”

They conclude the press conference here.

Šefčovič says he sees today's market reactions as “a kind of black day for the markets … all over the world,” saying ministers described it “as the most important paradigm shift in global trading patterns since the second world war.”

“This introduces a lot of uncertainty, lack of predictability, inflation fears and the fact that tariffs are, in the end, the taxes which will be paid by the businesses, but especially by the final consumers,” he says.

He says the tariffs prompted fears among consumers on spending, inflation, jobs, and future prospects.

“So these are the I would say the debates which are now taking place, I would say all across the world … and I'm not even going to tell you [about] the distressed phone calls we are getting from emerging economies and from the developing countries,” he says.

He repeats that the EU will be “careful” and respond in a “measured and well calibrated way.”

“We know what kind of impact this might have on the real economy and on the people, and therefore you see that we are really progressing step by step in this regard. 

But I wouldn't dare to speculate if it would have an impact on decision making across the Atlantic.”

On a slightly more upbeat note, Šefčovič says that he hopes that “sooner or later, we'll be sitting at the negotiating table … and I hope that we'll be able to arrive at the mutually acceptable compromise, which would restore our close trading relationship.”

He says the focus in any such talks would be on “looking at the ways how to lower or get rid of the tariffs … on cars and industrial goods in February, and we would focus our efforts on that effort, how to create this transatlantic marketplace for industrial goods, for the technologies of the future and for the good cooperation between two transatlantic allies.”

Šefčovič says the EU remains “prepared to engage” and says the bloc's preference would be to find a negotiated solution.

But he then says that “until now, despite of efforts … , we haven't seen the real engagement which would lead to the mutually acceptable solution, because it has to be fair for both sides.”

He says that there are questions from the US on VAT – which was repeatedly criticised by Trump – but he says the EU would not be prepared to change its rules.

He then adds that:

“We are ready to discuss, to look at things, but it has to be a mutually advantageous solution.”

EU trade commissioner Šefčovič says the EU's timeline on countermeasures on steel and aluminium is driven by legal analysis.

But he adds “it is not possible now to delay the entry into force” as some countries, such as Italy, appeared to be asking for it.

“We expect the vote on Wednesday and if the vote is positive, then we will proceed with 15 April,” he says.

More broadly, he says “we are ready to consider all options.”

“All options are on the table, and we will consult with the stakeholders and with our member states, how to use all the instruments we have at our disposal,” he says.

Šefčovič gets asked about the proposed “zero-for-zero” tariff deal with the US, and the reception it got from the US.

The Slovak politician says it was floated in his first meeting with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

He says the US focus appears to be on “Big Five” areas: cars, pharmaceutical, metals, lumber and semiconductors.

Šefčovič says the EU was ready to change rules on personal vehicles and find a deal, with a “zero-for-zero” deal, and potentially extending it to other industrial products.

“I hope that in future we would be ready to come back to this discussion, not now. [but] I believe that in the future this would be still the possibility,” he says.

Šefčovič says that while the focus so far has been on finalising steel and aluminium countermeasures, the announcement of the new “so-called reciprocal tariffs … forces us to look at additional steps.”

“We got some valuable input from the member states, from the ministers, which we of course, evaluate, and we will proceed, as always, in the close consultations with our member states and with the key stakeholders,” he says.

Šefčovič says the EU is “in early stages of discussions” with the US, complicated “because the US view tariffs not as a tactical step, but as a corrective measure.”

But he says that “ while the EU remains open to and strongly prefers negotiations, we will not weigh endlessly until we see tangible progress.”

The EU has prepared a “robust list of countermeasures” on steel and aluminium after receiving feedback from over 600 stakeholders.

“After carefully reviewing all of it, we have worked to table a robust list of countermeasures, while balancing the burden across all member states, we will be sending the final list and tariff levels to them later today,

The vote is set for 9 April, with the final list adopted on 15 April, and then duties on products will kick in on that day for the first set of measures, and on 15 May for the remaining ones.”

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič says that the EU's trade situation with the US is “in a tough spot.”

He says that “70% of our total exports are facing tariffs of 20% of 25% or even higher.”

He acknowledges recent meetings with his US counterparts, as he says the two sides agree that “the EU-US trade relationship could benefit from a fresh look and a boost in strategic areas,” noting both markets “face similar challenges.”

He repeats von der Leyen's comment from last half hour that the EU “we have offered zero for zero tariffs for cars and all industrial goods.”

Opening the briefing after the ministerial council on trade, Polish deputy economy minister Michał Baranowski says “the message that came out from the council is very much a message of unity.”

“It's very clear that there are no winners, and this was something that was emphasised by all the member states. All of us would prefer a negotiated solution that takes us away from the potential trade war that can lead to a loss of jobs, lead to loss of wealth,” he says.

He says that the EU has a “prepared response” on steel and aluminium which will be put forward “soon”, but stressed that, at the moment the bloc is not focusing on “the so called reciprocal tariffs.”

He says he describes them as “so calls reciprocal tariffs” as “the methodology used by the US side is not yet entirely clear to us.”

As we wait for the press conference after the ministerial meeting, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen shared her views on US tariffs, as she welcomed Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre to Brussels.

She said that the US tariffs “come … at immense costs for US consumers and businesses,” as she insisted the EU “stand ready to negotiate with the United States.”

“Europe is always ready for good deal. So we keep it on the table,” she said, adding the EU “offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods, … because Europe is always ready for good deal.”

But she added the EU was “also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,” as it looked to step up its protection against “indirect effects [of] trade diversion.”

Von der Leyen said she engaged with key industrial stakeholders across the bloc to consult on next steps.

She also stressed that the EU should work on “strengthening our single market [by] getting rid of remaining barriers” in response to tariff disruptions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Combatants' testimonies describe how areas were destroyed to create ‘a death zone of enormous proportions' 

Israel's military razed huge swathes of land inside the perimeter of Gaza and ordered troops to turn the area into a “kill zone” where anybody who entered was a target, according to testimony by soldiers who carried out the plan.

Israeli combatants said they were ordered to destroy homes, factories and farmland roughly 1km (0.6 miles) inside the perimeter of Gaza to make a “buffer zone”, with one describing the area as looking like Hiroshima.

The testimonies are some of the first accounts by Israeli soldiers to be published since the latest war started in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israel. They were collected by Breaking the Silence, a group founded in 2004 by Israeli veterans who aim to expose the reality of the military's grip over Palestinians. The Guardian interviewed four of the soldiers who corroborated the accounts.

Titled “The Perimeter” and published on Monday, the report said the stated purpose of the plan was to create a thick strip of land that provided a clear line of sight for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to identify and kill militants. “This space was to have no crops, structures, or people. Almost every object, infrastructure installation, and structure within the perimeter was demolished,” it said.

Soldiers were “given orders to deliberately, methodically, and systematically annihilate whatever was within the designated perimeter, including entire residential neighbourhoods, public buildings, educational institutions, mosques, and cemeteries, with very few exceptions”, the report added.

The ultimate result, however, was the creation of “a death zone of enormous proportions”, the report said. “Places where people had lived, farmed, and established industry were transformed into a vast wasteland, a strip of land eradicated in its entirety.”

It stretches along the frontier with Israel, from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the strip's south-east corner next to Egypt.

A sergeant in the combat engineers corps said that once an area in the perimeter “was pretty much empty of any Gazans, we essentially started getting missions that were about basically blowing up houses or what was left of the houses”.

This was the routine, they said: “Get up in the morning, each platoon gets five, six, or seven locations, seven houses that they're supposed to work on. We didn't know a lot about the places that we were destroying or why we were doing it. I guess those things today, from my perspective now, are not legitimate. What I saw there, as far as I can judge, was beyond what I can justify that was needed.”

Some soldiers testified that commanders viewed the destruction as a way of exacting revenge for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which sparked the current war when Palestinian militants killed hundreds and kidnapped Israeli and foreign citizens.

While Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is fighting allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”.

The IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the report and combatants' accounts.

One of the soldiers who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity said their unit was told to shoot anyone in the perimeter area on sight. The mentality in their unit, they said, was that there was no such thing as a “civilian” and everyone who walked into the perimeter would be considered a “terrorist”.

Rules on who can be killed on sight appeared to vary for different units, according to the accounts.

A sergeant in the armoured corps said that in 2024 he was given “shoot to kill” orders for any male adult who entered the perimeter. “For women and children, [the order was] ‘shoot to drive away', and if they come close to the fence, you stop [them]. You don't kill women, children, or the elderly. ‘Shoot to drive away' means a tank fire,” he said.

But a captain in an armoured corps unit who operated in Gaza earlier in the war, in November 2023, described the border area as a “kill zone”, saying: “The borderline is a kill zone. Anyone who crosses a certain line, that we have defined, is considered a threat and is sentenced to death.”

Another captain said there were “no clear rules of engagement at any point” and described a “generally massive use of firepower, especially, like with tanks”. They added: “There was a lot of instigating fire for the sake of instigating fire, somewhere between [wanting to produce] a psychological effect and just for no reason.

“[We] set out on this war out of insult, out of pain, out of anger, out of the sense that we had to succeed. This distinction [between civilians and terrorist infrastructure], it didn't matter. Nobody cared. We decided on a line … past which everyone is a suspect.”

How Palestinians would know they were crossing an invisible line was not made clear to them, the soldiers said. “How they know is a really good question. Enough people died or got injured crossing that line, so they don't go near it.”

Before the latest war, Israel had previously established a buffer zone inside Gaza that extended to 300 metres, but the new one was intended to range from 800 to 1,500 metres, according to the testimonies.

Satellite imagery has previously revealed the IDF destroyed hundreds of buildings that stood within 1km to 1.2km of the perimeter fence, in a systematic demolishing act that rights groups say may constitute collective punishment and should be investigated as a war crime. Last week, Israel's defence minister said the military would seize “large areas” in Gaza in a fresh offensive.

The perimeter accounts for just over 15% of the Gaza Strip, which is entirely off-limits to Palestinian residents. It represents 35% of the strip's entire agricultural land, according to the report.

Despite shoot-to-kill orders, a warrant officer stationed in northern Gaza said Palestinians kept going back to the area “again and again after we fired at them”.

The officer said the Palestinians appeared to want to pick edible plants growing in the area. “There was hubeiza [mallow] there because no one went near there. People are hungry, so they come with bags to pick hubeiza, I think.”

Some got away with their food and their lives, the officer said. “The thing is that, at that point, the IDF really is fulfilling the public's wishes, which state: ‘There are no innocents in Gaza'.”

In an interview with the Guardian, the same officer said the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 made many Israelis feel the “need to pick up a gun”.

“A lot of us went there, I went there, because they killed us and now we're going to kill them,” they said. “And I found out that we're not only killing them – we're killing them, we're killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs. We're destroying their houses and pissing on their graves.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Economist Warwick McKibbin says ‘economic and policy flexibility' puts Australia in better position to escape fallout from Trump tariffs

A global trade war will not drive Australia's economy into recession, new Treasury modelling suggests, even as Jim Chalmers says he is realistic about “substantial” risks to growth from Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.

The treasurer sought to soothe Australians rattled by Monday's dramatic share market plunge – the worst in five years – saying the country was “better placed and better prepared” than others to weather the coming storm.

As fears grow that America will suffer a deep downturn that could reverberate around the world, Chalmers unveiled updated departmental modelling that showed the trade shock would trim just 0.1% off Australia's economic growth in 2025 and add 0.2 percentage points to inflation.

“We expect more manageable impacts on the Australian economy, but we still do expect Australian GDP to take a hit and we expect there to be an impact on prices here as well,” he said on Monday.

“I can assure people that in a world of volatility and uncertainty, Australia is better placed and better prepared than our peers.”

In contrast, the US economy would be 0.8% smaller by the start of 2027, with most of the damage in this year, the modelling showed; and Americans would suffer a 1.4 percentage-point spike in inflation this year. China would also be hit hard, with the economy 0.6% smaller than otherwise.

“This is one of the many reasons that we describe the tariff decision to be ill-considered and unwarranted,” Chalmers said.

The official modelling reflected sanguine forecasts in Treasury's pre-election budget update, which revealed no change in Australia's economic outlook since the 25 March budget.

While Australia's economy was expected to continue to grow, the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) document highlighted that “the increase in tariffs announced over the past few days have been more significant than expected”.

“The potential magnitude and persistence of the economic effects of these announcements has resulted in greater-than-usual uncertainty around the outlook,” PEFO said.

Investors, however, were less assured.

The Australian dollar briefly dipped below 60 US cents on Monday, after dropping 3 US cents late last week – including its biggest single-day drop in more than 15 years.

Reflecting the potential for local fall-out from Trump's one-man war on the global trading system, financial markets were now, according to ANZ, pricing in four rate cuts over the coming four Reserve Bank board meetings.

That included the chance of a double rate cut of half a percentage point on 20 May.

As JP Morgan lifted its estimated chance of a US recession to 60%, the director of the ANU's Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis, Warwick McKibbin, agreed that Australia could navigate a worst-case trade war scenario relatively unscathed.

“While the ‘liberation day' tariffs are damaging to the world economy, Australia is impacted relatively less than other countries, except for sectors exposed to China such as mining,” McKibbin said.

“Just as Australia escaped a recession during the Asian financial crisis, Australia's economic and policy flexibility, such as the capacity of RBA to respond, puts Australia in a better position than many countries,” he said.

As China and the EU threatened to follow Canada and retaliate against Trump's so-called “reciprocal tariff”, due to kick in on 9 April, McKibbin modelled the impact of a trade war on a range of countries.

The yet-to-be-released analysis shows Australian growth would be about 0.2 percentage points lower this year under this worst-case trade scenario, before rebounding in 2026.

As in the Treasury modelling, the impact on inflation would be negligible.

McKibbin, who travelled to Washington DC to do the economic modelling for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said “the flexibility of the exchange rate and capacity to expand exports into the rest of the world minimises the losses”.

“The Australian government not responding with additional tariffs is the right response. It is better to focus on open and expanded trade with the other 80% of the world economy.”

The modelling – which reflected more of a worst-case scenario than the Treasury analysis – showed the hit to the US from a global trade shock would be severe.

Assuming the rest of the world retaliates against Trump's reciprocal tariffs, McKibbin's modelling finds American consumers will suffer a nearly 3 percentage point spike in inflation this year.

There will be a 0.6 percentage-point hit to US economic growth in 2025, extending to 1.6 percentage points next year. By that time the American economy will be 2% smaller, the analysis shows, despite a series of deep rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.

While McKibbin's modelling shows Australia escaping unscathed, preliminary modelling by KPMG showed a much larger hit to our economy from a global trade war – highlighting the inherent uncertainty in modelling.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

London gallery's competition marks 200th anniversary and opening of Sainsbury Wing after two-year overhaul

As far as sleepovers go, it's a one of a kind: an overnight stay in a luxury bed in the middle of the National Gallery's exhibition rooms, dreaming under the world's greatest paintings.

Perhaps you'll be inspired by the venerated artworks to pick up a paintbrush, or you'll have a surreal experience like Ben Stiller in Night at the Museum, whose character – a night security guard – finds its exhibits come to life after sunset. You could even unearth a long-buried conspiracy, and find your discoveries adorning the pages of the next Dan Brown novel.

For the first time in its history, the National Gallery in London is offering an overnight stay to the lucky person who wins its new prize draw, which has been launched before its public reopening next month.

Marking the gallery's 200th anniversary, the competition will select the first member of the public to enter the gallery's Sainsbury Wing after its two-year closure and experience the biggest rehang of the entire collection, entitled CC Land: The Wonder of Art.

Anyone over 18 who subscribes to the National Gallery's newsletter will be entered into the draw to sleep in the bed, which will be on the “bridge” that connects the Sainsbury Wing with the rest of the gallery. The competition is open until 6pm on 28 April, and the winner will be randomly selected.

According to the gallery, the evening will start with a dinner for two at its soon-to-be-opened restaurant, Locatelli; then, once the gallery's doors are closed to the public, the winner will receive their own private tour of the exhibition with Christine Riding, National Gallery director of collections and research.

As they make their way through the gallery, they will see more than 1,000 works of art, which trace the development of painting in the western European tradition between the 13th and 20th centuries, from familiar masterpieces to paintings that have never been seen in the National Gallery.

“This is the first time that we have had such an exciting opportunity to rethink, and refresh, how we present one of the greatest art collections in the world, under one roof,” Riding said. “Our visitors will discover anew some of the most famous and iconic works of art ever created, alongside personal favourites and recent discoveries and acquisitions.”

The next morning, the winner will also receive a breakfast hamper before having the gallery to themselves to explore before the first public opening of the Sainsbury Wing at 10am on 10 May.

The National Gallery's rehang is its most extensive in years. The gallery's 200th anniversary celebrations this year also include the opening of a supporters' house, for members and other supporters, and a learning centre.

The National Gallery is no stranger to overnight events. In January, it opened its doors for 24 hours for the final weekend of its sellout Van Gogh exhibition, which was visited by more than 200,000 people. It was the second time in its history the gallery stayed open overnight (the first being for Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan in 2012).

Sir Gabriele Finaldi, the director of the National Gallery, said: “Our bicentenary provides the perfect opportunity to consider a new way to tell the story of the incredible paintings in our collection, and include some exciting surprises.

“So we feel it is fitting that through this prize draw one of our visitors should receive a first look at the newly transformed National Gallery and Sainsbury Wing and have these wonderful pictures to themselves for one special night.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The value of one Australian dollar dropped to a low of 59.64 US cents, its lowest point since April 2020

Consumers and travellers will face higher prices after the Australian dollar fell to Covid-era lows, as markets reel from Donald Trump's “liberation day” tariff plan.

Fears of a global recession dragged the Australian dollar sharply lower on Monday against the country's major trade partners and to its lowest point against the Euro, pound and US dollar since 2020.

A lower Australian dollar will translate to higher prices for customers buying overseas goods, even if prices settle in coming weeks, according to Kelly Slessor, an e-commerce expert.

“The cost of a dress or something overseas yesterday is significantly more expensive today, [especially] if you're buying it from the US,” she said.

“Temu, Shein and stuff like that will probably hold for a little while but their prices may go up over the next couple of weeks.”

The value of one Australian dollar fell to a low of US59.64c, its lowest point since April 2020, on Monday. This was down more than 6% on last week's 64c level before Trump's tariffs were unveiled.

While Australians import goods from all over the world, the prominence of the US dollar could make it hard to avoid higher prices, according to Mark Baartse, a retail consultant.

“A lot of transactions are pegged to US dollars, regardless of where you buy from,” he said.

Shoppers could turn to local Australian businesses or make their purchases sooner before trade-exposed businesses hike their prices, Baartse said.

Overseas travel will also be more expensive after the Australian dollar lost value in top destinations including New Zealand, Indonesia and India.

Nearly a million Australians travelled to Japan in 2024, helped by a strong exchange rate of over 100 yen to the dollar, but Monday's sell-off resulted in it falling below 90 yen for the first time since 2023.

The Australian dollar's value is tied to demand for commodities such as iron ore, which would suffer if economic activity slowed around the world, and especially in China, as a result of a global trade war.

My Bui, an economist at AMP, said investors bought the Australian dollar when they expected a global boom and sold it when they feared a crash.

“When there is concern about a global slowdown, and particularly from the tariff and global trade war, then there is less demand for our commodities,” Bui said.

Other global currencies were performing better against the US dollar as markets placed bets on where Trump's tariff regime would have the heaviest impact.

The Euro and Japanese yen rose against the US dollar, while India and South Korea suffered falls.

Australian markets have grown increasingly fearful of a global recession, with the share market shedding $160bn in value early on Monday as China and the European union make plans to retaliate against US tariffs.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Wall Street swings in and out of red as turmoil from US president's assault on world trade enters second week

Extreme volatility plagued global stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as Donald Trump defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new US tariffs to medicine.

A renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.

On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped by as much as 4.1% – entering bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its most recent peak, in February – before launching an extraordinary reversal to turn positive.

While markets were fleetingly boosted after Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, signaled that Trump was open to considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries but China, the relief did not last long. By late morning, the S&P was trading down 1.4%.

As the turmoil headed into a second week, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2%.

The FTSE 100 shed 4.6% in London, after the Nikkei 225 slumped 7.8% in Tokyo.

Trump, who has previously used market rallies as a barometer of his success, tried to brush off the sell-off this weekend. “I don't want anything to go down,” the US president said on Sunday. “But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

He stood firm on Monday. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid!”

As China prepares to retaliate, Trump threatened to further increase US tariffs on the country – an additional rate of 50% – if it hits back. All talks with Beijing over potential meetings have been “terminated”, he said.

Major share indices have fallen dramatically since he unveiled his controversial plan to overhaul the US economy last week. The Trump administration imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imported goods this weekend, and is set to follow with higher tariffs on products from specific nations from Wednesday.

While senior figures in corporate America have been reluctant to criticize Trump since his inauguration in January, a handful have started to sound the alarm in recent days.

The JPMorgan Chase boss, Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, warned on Monday that Trump's tariff plan was “likely” to exacerbate inflation. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.

Dimon added: “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.”

The billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump's campaign for the presidency, has also demanded the administration reconsider its plan. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Peter Navarro, Trump's top trade adviser, insisted in a television interview on Monday morning that the market would find a bottom. Less than hour later, when New York opened for trading, the search continued.

The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite started the day down 4.3%, before briefly turning positive. By mid-morning, it was down 1%. The VIX “fear index” of volatility rose as high as 60 for the first time since August.

Oil prices also came under pressure, with Brent and WTI benchmarks stooping to their lowest levels in four years, as growing economic tensions between Washington and Beijing stoked fears that a global downturn would challenge demand.

Sir Richard Branson, co-founder of Virgin Group, argued the “predictable and preventable” market chaos would have “catastrophic” implications for people in the US and around the world, and claimed companies were already going bankrupt as a result of the weaker dollar and higher costs.

“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course,” Branson wrote on X. “Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Hospital waiting lists among worst in UK and children with special needs waiting a year for support, report finds

Northern Ireland's public services, including hospitals, schools and police, are being “crippled” by lack of funding, impinging on the quality of life for many people, a report by a government committee has concluded.

The Northern Ireland select committee found patients waiting more than 12 hours to be seen in accident and emergency departments and mental health needs 40% greater than anywhere else in the UK. Hospital waiting lists are among the worst in the country.

Its investigation was also told that Northern Ireland “recently held the world record for prescribing the most anti-depressants per head of population”. It also found that children with special needs were waiting more than a year for support.

The budget for the Northern Ireland Police Service has been static since 2010, despite the special challenges it faces including cross-community recruitment and efforts to stamp out paramilitarism, one of the last vestiges of the Troubles.

One witness, the Law Society of Northern Ireland, said public services were “at risk of collapse”.

The former MP Stephen Farry, a co-director of Ulster University's strategic policy unit, told the committee it was vital that the political classes in London understood just how bad public services were in NI compared with Great Britain.

He said: “The sheer scale of the crisis is that much greater.”

The committee chair, Tonia Antoniazzi, said: “The crisis afflicting public services in Northern Ireland has gone on for far too long with the crippling effects of underfunding impinging on the day to day lives of people across communities. The current hand to mouth approach when it comes to funding has often been too little, too late.”

The committee is calling on the government to ensure funding for the next fiscal year 2026 to 2027 is “according to NI's level of need”.

Northern Ireland has the highest public spending per person in the UK, but raises the least revenue per person, the report found. It relies predominantly on what is known as a “block grant” allocated to the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

According to the so-called Barnett formula used to calculate funding, each nation receives the same pound for pound rise in funding per capita as the national funding. So, for example, if education in England is £100 a head, devolved governments must also get that level of finance.

In recognition of the dire state of Northern Ireland's public services, the previous government raised funding to give NI's public sector £124 a head.

The committee noted that research was being conducted to see if that needed to be raised again.

“During our predecessor committee's inquiry in 2023–24, it heard that the funding and delivery of public services in Northern Ireland were under enormous pressure. One year on, little appears to have changed,” it said.

When power-sharing resumed in 2024 after a 24-month hiatus, the government provided a £3.3bn package, but as part of the settlement the Stormont government was encouraged to raise more revenue itself for public services.

The committee's investigation found that this has proved to be “politically difficult” with few options open to the devolved government.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

UK index loses nearly 4.5% as Trump's team dismiss rumours of a 90-day pause on tariffs as ‘fake news'

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.

Elsewhere, Germany's DAX is down 4.3%, France's CAC is down 4.8%, Italy's FTSE MIB is down 5.2% and Spain's IBEX is down 5.1% in further signs of the turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs.

In London, stocks were heavily depressed during Monday's session, although they briefly swung higher during a rollercoaster afternoon amid conflicting reports over a potential pause in tariff policy.

The FTSE 100 declined by 352.9 points, or 4.38%%, to close at 7,702.08.

Monday's session began with firm drops in the Asian markets after more reciprocal tariff announcements over the weekend weighed on trading sentiment.

Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at IG, said: “The global stock market sell-off intensified on Monday after China retaliated against the US with reciprocal tariffs.

“Some Asian stock indices fell by 10% on the day with the S&P 500 entering bear market territory with several European indices close on its heels.”

The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% or 352.90 points at 7,702.08, representing a third day of heavy falls for the London market.

Major UK banks have been invited to a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the effects of Donald Trump's tariffs, which have wreaked havoc on lenders' share prices.

The Guardian understands that lobby group UK Finance is holding a working level call with public policy staff from some of the country's largest lenders, as they try to understand the ripple effects of US import taxes.

While Trump's tariffs are focused on physical goods rather than services, it will impact business borrowers and large corporate clients who sell products to the US.

The harm caused by tariffs could dampen appetite for loans and investment banking services – which provide support for mergers, takeovers and fundraising.

Tariffs could also make it harder for companies to repay their debts. That could, in turn, force banks to start putting aside money for potential defaults in their first quarter results, which are due later this month.

After holding relatively stable during last week's global market turmoil, cryptocurrencies have joined the sell-off.

Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency dipped below $75,000 Monday morning before seeing a slight rebound, AP reported.

Bitcoin's prices haven't been this low since just after president Donald Trump's Election Day victory last year launched a bull run in crypto prices. Trump, whose tariff announcements led to massive stock sell offs, has been a major promoter of the crypto industry and previously took credit when bitcoin's price broke $100,000 in December.

Bitcoin has been on a relatively steady slide in price since Trump took office earlier this year.

London's FTSE 100 is set to close and is likely to see another significant fall.

We will bring you the final figures once we get them.

President Donald Trump has threatened further tariffs on China if Beijing does not withdraw retaliatory measures, increasing trade war concerns.

On his Truth Social network, Trump posted:

Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.

Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.

Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Richard Branson has posted on X describing Donald Trump's tariffs as a “colossal mistake” and has called on the president to reverse his decision.

America could be left “facing ruin for years to come”, he said.

He posted:

The ongoing market response to last week's US tariff announcement was both predictable and preventable.

Even if you agree with the premise of these tariffs, every reasonable effort should be made to give US companies sufficient time to adapt.

The billionaire added:

This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course.

Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come

A quick recap…

It's turning into another very volatile day in the financial markets, as investors grow more fearful that Donald Trump's trade war will trigger a recession.

European stock markets are in the red in late trading, with the FTSE 100 index down 2.5%, or 205 points, at 7849 points.

Germany's DAX is down 3.5% in early trading, while France's CAC has lost 4%.

It's been a roller-coaster rise on Wall Street – stocks initially plunged, but then rocketed higher following a report that Trump was considering a 90-day pause to many of his new tariffs.

However, that rally fizzled out as the White House denied this claim.

So was that 90-day tariff pause tweet (now proven entirely false) the largest fake news-driven market swing in market history?

Goldman Sachs added to the pressure on the White House, by raising the chances of a US recssion to 45%.

JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned that it may be “hard to reverse” the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs, which he said would drive prices higher and make a US recession more likely.

Donald Trump supporter and billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman has said the president is losing the confidence of business leaders and should pause his trade war – which could cause an economic collapse while damaging his supporters the most.

The turmoil in financial markets today has overshadowed a co-ordinated push by UK regulators to show they are responding to chancellor Rachel Reeves' demand for them to help spur economic growth.

On Monday, the FCA announced it was planning to loosen rules for more than 600 hedge funds, private equity and venture capital firms in a move that it says will “make it easier for firms to enter the market, grow, compete and innovate.”

The City regulator said it was looking to raise the threshold at which funds are subject to main rules for the sector, meaning they will only apply to those with more than £5bn under management (compared to €100m previously).

That will mean take the number of firms facing more burdensome administrative from around 699 to just 64, its consultation paper suggested.

It comes as regulators come renewed pressure to support UK growth. In the City, this has so far meant easing rules on the financial services sector, with Reeves having also encouraged more risk-taking across the industry.

The CEO of private equity lobby group, the BVCA, welcomed the move, saying:

“More effective, less burdensome regulation will make the UK private capital industry more globally competitive and help it to boost investment from the UK and international investors into growing British businesses.

Elsewhere, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) cheered the fact that new consumer protection rules had come into force, which ban fake reviews and drip pricing - where fees are added to the displayed price. The CMA will also be able to decide whether laws have been breached, and decide on compensation and fines, without having to go through the courts.

Ofwat, too, has tried to have a moment in the sun, telling water companies to build new reservoirs and other major projects more quickly in the coming years. In a letter to water company bosses, the watchdog said they must find ways to “deliver (projects) more efficiently, effectively and achieve earlier completion”.

Here's a chart showing how US stocks jumped following that dubious report that Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause to tariffs, but then fell back as the reports were dismissed.

The White House says any suggestion that President Donald Trump is considering a 90-day pause in tariffs is “fake news,” CNBC reports.

We've just seen a wild few minutes in the financial markets, following a confusing report about a possible delay to Trump's tariffs.

After plunging in early trading, Wall Street surged into positive territory. A few minutes ago the S&P 500 index was UP by 1.76% at 5,163 points, a gain of 89 points. However, that rally has now petered out again.

The Dow Jones industrial average jumped too – it was briefly up 1.44%, or 551 points, at 38,866 points, having been DOWN over 1,000 points in early trading.

But that rally has fizzled out too, leaving the Dow down 747 points (for the next few seconds, anyway).

This dizzying roller-coaster follows a suggestion on CNBC that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has, apparently, suggested that Donald Trump is considering a 90 day pause on tariffs for all countries other than China.

That would obviously be a game-changer for the markets, and bolster hopes that negotiations might lead to reductions in the large tariffs announced by Trump last week.

However, we haven't yet managed to stand up exactly what Hassett has said on this point. He WAS asked about the possibility of a 90-day pause on Fox News earlier, but he didn't explicitly say it was under active consideration.

Stocks had briefly bounced back in London too, but the FTSE 100 is currently down 214 points or -2.6% today at 7842 points.

The chief executives of some of the world's biggest banks have reportedly held private talks about the carnage in financial markets and the global economy precipitated by President Donald Trump's new tariffs.

Sky News has learnt that bosses from lenders including Bank of America, Barclays, Citi and HSBC Holdings held a call on Sunday to discuss the ongoing chaos as plunging equity markets reflect fears of a worldwide recession.

Thet add:

Sources said that Sunday's call was convened by the Bank Policy Institute, a Washington-based public policy group.

Brian Moynihan of BoA, Barclays' CS Venkatakrishnan and Georges Elhedery of HSBC were among those who took part in the call, according to one overseas bank executive.

The current stock market turbulence is “a huge worry”, Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool's Management School, tells us.

Prof Milas suggests there's a possibility that central banks might need to take action, if the market turmoil continues, which would set an unfortunate precedent …

From a historical point of view, investors react to periods of high uncertainty (like the current one) by reducing their exposure or fleeing the stock market altogether and investing in government debt (the so-called “flight to quality“ or “flight to safety“).

This means that stock market liquidity will soon dry up and company investments will freeze. If the stock market turbulence continues throughout this week, the Fed, Bank of England and ECB might be forced to act together by cutting interest rates before the Easter break.

If this was what Trump wanted, then he will get the message that he can always get his way towards dictating interest rates through, for instance, tariff threats...","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Transport secretary says overhaul in response to Trump tariffs supports car firms and climate goals

Labour's changes to electric vehicle (EV) rules in response to Donald Trump's tariffs will have a negligible impact on emissions, the transport secretary has said.

Keir Starmer has confirmed plans to boost manufacturers, including reinstating the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.

But regulations around manufacturing targets on electric cars and vans will also be altered, to help companies in the transition, and new hybrids will be on the market for a further five years.

Heidi Alexander said the taxes on imports announced by the US president last week, which spurred reciprocal action by some affected countries, “are bad news for the global economy, because it's bad for global demand, it's bad for prices and it's bad for consumers”.

Speaking on BBC Breakfast about the impact on carbon emissions of the government's changes to electric vehicle rules, she said: “The changes we are making have been very carefully calibrated so as not to have a big impact upon the carbon emissions savings that are baked into this policy. In fact, the impact on carbon emissions as a result of these changes is negligible.”

Under the measures, luxury supercar companies such as Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep producing petrol cars beyond 2030 because they manufacture only a small number of vehicles a year.

New hybrids and plug-in hybrid cars will be allowed to be sold until 2035. Petrol and diesel vans will be able to be sold until 2035, as well as all hybrid models.

The Green party MP Siân Berry said: “The government is wrong to apply the brakes on the sale of EV cars.

“This is just the latest in a series of boosts the Labour government has given fossil fuel industries. We've also seen the green light being given to airport expansion and a new road tunnel under the Thames.

“This suggests Labour is weakening its climate commitments, and its health-related policy goals because all these moves will have a detrimental impact on air quality.

“Slowing down the move away from fossil-fuelled transport makes no economic sense either, since green sectors of the economy are growing three times faster than the overall UK economy.”

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “In weakening the mandate elsewhere by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of standard hybrids between 2030 and 2035, the government risks reducing the competition it has stimulated between manufacturers, meaning prices for families seeking an EV might not fall as fast, and sales could slow.

“The growth of the secondhand EV market, where most of us buy our cars, would in turn be stunted, leaving millions of families stuck in petrol and hybrid cars paying a petrol premium of hundreds, and even thousands, of pounds a year.”

Alexander said the government had “struck the right balance” between protecting British businesses and cutting carbon emissions.

Asked if the retention of a 2030 target for the phasing out of all pure petrol and diesel cars would restrict free markets at a time when the car industry was on its knees, she said: “It is an opportunity for the car industry to remain at the cutting edge of the transition to EVs, but it's right that we're pragmatic.

“It's right that we are looking at how we can be flexible in the way in which car manufacturers make this transition, because we want cheaper EVs to be available for consumers. We want people to be able to benefit from those lower running costs as well.

“And so it's important that, as a government, we do everything that we can – not only to support British businesses and manufacturing to grow the economy, but also to cut those carbon emissions, and I think we've struck the right balance in the package that we're announcing today.”

Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if Starmer was prepared to use the relationship he has built with Trump to ask him to change course, she said: “Obviously when the prime minister has discussions internationally with allies he will be honest about what is in the best interests of the British people.”

Challenged that the EV measures were planned before the announcement of the tariffs and were a tweak to policy rather than dramatic change, she told Today: “These are significant changes to the car industry. You are right to say we started the consultation on Christmas Eve and that we closed the consultation in the middle of February.”

She said Trump's imposition of tariffs meant the UK government had to look at its EV plans with “renewed urgency”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            The big question as global stock sell-offs point to another week of plunging markets in the US is how much pain President Donald Trump is prepared to inflict to test his tariff theories.
    


            Trump said Sunday evening that he's “open to talking” to world leaders about new deals as he put a brave face on the chaos unleashed by his trade wars after a weekend playing golf at his exclusive Florida properties. Trump also claimed that he'd spoken to “many countries” and that despite fury abroad over his “Liberation Day” trade attacks, “They're being very nice.”
    


            But as he flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One, stocks tumbled at the opening in Tokyo, leading Asian markets downward, and US futures suggested more huge losses are likely on Wall Street on Monday.
    


            “What's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you, our country has gotten a lot stronger, and eventually it'll be a country like no other,” Trump said, while downplaying stock losses that have damaged the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
    


            “I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said.

            With markets closed over the weekend after days of pummeling losses, the administration had the chance to take stock. But there is no fresh clarity over its strategy as the political stakes become more fraught.
    


            Top officials sent conflicting signals Sunday over whether Trump sees the economic warfare he unleashed last week as a lever for near-term dealmaking — or whether he's serious about a bid to remake the world economy that could take years.
    


            The confusion came against a backdrop of rising discomfort among some Republican lawmakers about the trade onslaught and as massive crowds across the country held anti-Trump protests in the largest show of dissent of his second term.
    


            The president and his senior aides also seem oblivious to anxiety in the country over the possibility his policies could cause a recession — or feel so sure in their views they don't really have to care. Trump posted a video of himself teeing off in Florida, and the White House put out a bizarre statement noting his win in a golf club championship match.
    


            It was a reminder that Trump and his millionaire and billionaire friends don't share the worries of regular American families, who are concerned about their retirement savings and how they'll afford groceries and cars when tariffs hike prices. While the president insists his plans for tax cuts will leave everyone more prosperous, he's still taking a gamble after winning a second term in part because voters felt the Biden administration did a poor job tackling inflation.
    


            The rationale for Trump's tariffs on 185 nations and territories is that the rest of the world has spent decades ripping off America and that the most aggressive protectionism in decades will return jobs to hurting US industrial heartlands.
    


            It's true that the profits of globalization — which saw many US jobs disappear overseas — have not been equally shared. But the United States is the richest, most powerful nation in history, and profited most from the free trading system Trump seeks to destroy.
    


            And the impact of his bigger-than-expected tariffs threatens to cause so much disruption that it throws the US and the world into a recession, causing huge job losses and wrecking the finances of millions of people. Such fears are partly behind the meltdown on global markets last week and fears that worse is to come.
    


            It was left up to Trump's Cabinet on Sunday to try to explain the method behind his tariff warfare, an approach he's long wanted to implement but that many economists regard as foolish and dangerous.
    


            CNN's Jake Tapper asked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins how long the tariff chaos would last and whether it was a negotiating tactic. Her answer laid bare the policy contradiction that is causing deep uncertainty and haunting stock markets.
    


            “This is a national security issue. This is about reshoring thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs,” Rollins said on “State of the Union,” seeming to confirm that Trump is bent on a fundamental reordering of the global economy with an attempt to re-create the manufacturing strength of the height of the industrial era.

            But Rollins then said that 50 countries were “burning the phone lines into the White House” and implied the tariffs were meant simply as leverage. “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government,” she said.
    


            This was consistent with Trump's later remarks on Air Force One that he was willing to talk to China and the European Union about reducing trade deficits with the United States. The comments might be seen in some quarters as an attempt to limit the damage expected to hit stock markets Monday.
    


            Bilateral negotiations with scores of countries could conceivably yield new trading conditions that could improve the position of the United States. But such an approach would not be sufficient to re-create the late 19th century golden age of manufacturing that Trump is promising. And it's questionable whether the gains would justify the economic destruction the president is wreaking.
    


            The administration seems to be interested only in the kind of “deals” that would require other countries to embrace total capitulation. “This is not a negotiation,” Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” He warned that offering the US a zero tariff wouldn't be sufficient, and signaled nations must cede to White House demands on other issues, including non-tariff barriers and currencies.
    


            While Trump's concern for Americans left behind by the 21st century economy is laudable, his obsession with trade deficits and the trade in goods represents an archaic worldview. It ignores how the US economy has become a tech and services behemoth and how it will never be able to produce basic goods such as clothes as economically as lower-wage economies abroad. Making basic goods in the United States would cost more, would raise the cost of living and would harm the prosperity of many Americans.

Trump's ‘reciprocal' tariffs aren't quite what they seem. Here's the real story



            While Rollins seemed to be following the example of Trump last week by suggesting tariffs were leverage, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick dug in on Sunday.
    


            “There is no postponing,” he said of the duties due to come into force Wednesday. “They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,” Lutnick said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” He added: “The president needs to reset global trade. … The countries of the world are ripping us off, and it's got to end.”
    


            Lutnick appears to be betting that US strength can force weaker nations to fold. He told CNN's Pamela Brown last week that it would be unwise to retaliate. “If you're angry and you fight back to the greatest customer in the world, you're going to lose. We are the sumo wrestler of this world.”
    


            Such is the power of the US that it might triumph in one-on-one showdowns with most other nations. But the administration rarely talks about the impact of multifront tariff retaliation simultaneously from all the great trading powers. China, for instance, now faces a cumulative 54% tariff on its imports to the US, which means that buying power of US shoppers will be severely constrained since — despite Trump's insistence that other countries pay for tariffs — consumers will foot the bill. This could hammer US retailers and squelch consumer confidence, setting up the conditions that could lead to a recession. China also imposed a 34% tariff on US imports, making a tough-to-crack market even more difficult for American firms.
    


            Enormous losses on US stock markets last week — the Dow and the S&P 500 were both down by more than 5% on Friday alone — alarmed millions of Americans whose retirements depend on their 401(k) plans.
    


            But Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted there didn't need to be a recession and dismissed the long-term impact of stock market losses, using words like “choppiness” and “adjustment process” to explain the panic. And speaking on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Bessent rejected the idea that people who want to retire soon had taken a serious blow. “Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening,” Bessent said. He added: “The reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.”
    


            Technically, Bessent is correct, and over years and decades, stocks have been a sound investment, through market corrections and recessions. But his comments were the latest remarkably tone-deaf commentary from a multimillionaire Cabinet member. Bessent is a wealthy former hedge fund manager.
    


            Such attitudes raise the question of whether the president's strategy will cost him public support — especially if the tariffs remain in place for months and price hikes begin to really punish families. Recent national surveys from The Wall Street Journal, CBS News and Marquette University Law School, all taken before Trump's “Liberation Day” announcement, found majorities of Americans disapproved of the president's tariff policies.
    


            Some Republican senators are already nervous. Several have signed on to a measure backed by GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley to require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would have to approve them within 60 days or they would expire.
    


            Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat co-leading the effort with Grassley, said Sunday that bipartisan momentum was growing behind the bill and that seven GOP senators were now listed as co-sponsors in an unusual break with Trump.
    


            “I'm sure they listen to their constituents. Consumer challenges are already starting to surface, and certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people,” Cantwell said on CBS. The measure, however, faces a far harder path in the House, and it's doubtful at this point it could amass veto-proof majorities.
    


            After months of mourning their November loss, Democrats are showing signs of life. A liberal candidate won a wide victory in a race for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat last week. And the size of protests against Trump and Elon Musk in many cities Saturday may augur an awakening of a resistance movement more a year and a half before the 2026 midterm elections.
    


            But Trump is showing no sign of a course correction. He wrote on his Truth Social network on Saturday that “we have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,' but not any longer.” The president added: “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH.” The next day, he was back on the golf course.

            An image of and quote from Harriet Tubman have been removed from a National Parks webpage about the “Underground Railroad,” following several prominent changes to government websites under the Trump administration.
    


            The National Parks Service webpage for the “Underground Railroad” used to lead with a quote from Tubman, the railroad's most famous “conductor”, a comparison on the Wayback Machine between the webpage on January 21 and March 19 shows. Both the quote and an image of Tubman have since been removed, along with several references to “enslaved” people and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.
    


            The Washington Post first reported on the changes. The webpage now leads with commemorative stamps of various civil rights leaders with text including the phrase “Black/White Cooperation.” Whereas previously, the article started with a description of enslaved peoples' efforts to free themselves and the organization of the Underground Railroad after the Fugitive Slave Act, the article now starts with two paragraphs that emphasize the “American ideals of liberty and freedom” and do not specifically mention slavery.
    


            Tubman's removal from the “Underground Railroad” page “is both offensive and absurd,” Fergus Bordewich, a historian and the author of a book about the Underground Railroad, told CNN Sunday. He described the new webpage as “diminished in value by its brevity.”
    


            “To oversimplify history is to distort it,” Bordewich went on. “Americans are not infants: they can handle complex and challenging historical narratives. They do not need to be protected from the truth.”
    


            Janell Hobson, a professor of women's studies at the University at Albany, State University of New York, described Tubman as “one of our greatest American heroes and definitely the greatest liberator in this nation” in an email to CNN.
    


            “I hope that National Parks Service realize they owe it to her and other heroes like her to stand in the truth of what this history has been,” she said.
    


            There is a separate National Park Service webpage dedicated to Harriet Tubman, who was born into slavery in Maryland before fleeing to Philadelphia. She returned to Maryland over a dozen times to help free other slaves, guiding them through the “Underground Railroad,” a secret network of routes and safe houses. The park service webpage on Tubman does not seem to have been changed since January 28, 2025.
    


            CNN has reached out to the National Park Service for comment.

            The past few months have also seen other controversial changes to government websites as the Trump administration enacts a campaign to eliminate DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion. The removal of the words “transgender” and “queer” from a National Parks Service webpage about Stonewall Monument in New York City triggered protests in February.
    


            In March, the Pentagon seemingly took down a page about Jackie Robinson, the trailblazing baseball player who became the first Black Major League Baseball athlete in the modern era, before restoring it.
    


            Articles about topics seemingly unrelated to DEI – including the Holocaust, cancer awareness, and sexual assault – have also been removed from Pentagon webpages. Pentagon officials were instructed to search for keywords like “racism,” “ethnicity,” “LGBTQ,” “history” and “first” when identifying articles and photos to remove, multiple defense officials previously told CNN.
    


            In his second term, President Donald Trump has taken multiple steps to take control of American cultural and historical institutions, gutting the board of trustees at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC and targeting the Smithsonian Institution in an executive order in late March.
    


            In his order, Trump specifically identified the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum as carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate.

            Top Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs, framing the move as a necessary economic reset and downplaying severe market volatility and uncertainty.
    


            President Donald Trump has long cast himself as a dealmaker — and has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture about the possibility of relief.
    


            Trump last week announced tariffs of at least 10% across all countries, with rates going even higher for 60 countries deemed the “worst offenders.” The universal 10% rate went into effect Saturday, while the customized rates will take effect Wednesday.
    


            More than 50 countries have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs in the aftermath of Trump's announcement, officials said Sunday.

            That outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' “Face the Nation,” shows “that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.”
    


﻿Though the president has previously paused tariffs to allow for negotiation in other situations, Lutnick made clear that the administration plans to follow through on the tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday.
    


            “There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious. The president needs to reset global trade,” he said, adding, “He announced it, and he wasn't kidding, the tariffs are coming.”
    


            Meanwhile, Trump said Sunday evening that he has been fielding calls from tech executives and world leaders over the weekend on tariffs.
    


            “I've spoken to many countries. … Every country is calling and being very solicitous, very, very nice,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.
    


            Trump indicated Sunday he was open to negotiating — if countries address their trade deficits with the US.
    


            “I do want to solve the deficit problem we have in China, with the European Union and other nations, and they're going to have to do that. And if they want to talk about that, I'm open to talking,” the president said.
    


CNN has reported that the Trump administration is in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about the possibility of bespoke trade deals, with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to meet with Trump at the White House on Monday for direct talks.
    


            But asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.
    


            “This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,” he said during an appearance on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
    


            Navarro added, “But I want to just say to the world here: If you want to come and talk to us, don't say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it. It's the non-tariff cheating. Stop manipulating their currency, stop dumping stuff in.”
    


            Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was also unable to clearly state whether tariffs are here to stay or whether there was room for deals.
    


            “This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. … But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”

            And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Trump has “created maximum leverage for himself.”
    


            “It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks,” he told NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Elon Musk, one of Trump's most influential advisors and the face of the administration's Department of Government Efficiency, said Saturday that he hopes for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the United States, indicating room for negotiation.
    


            “At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said in a video-link interview with Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister and the leader of the far-right League party, during a League congress in Florence.
    


            On Sunday, the administration officials repeatedly downplayed the economic upheaval rocking markets. By the time the market closed Friday, the Dow had posted its biggest back-to-back losses since March 2020, during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening, and stocks were set to open sharply lower Monday.
    


            Navarro urged American investors to “sit tight” and “not to panic.”
    


            “The smart strategy is not to panic, just stay in. Because we are going to have the biggest boom in the stock market we've ever seen under the Trump policies. … People should just sit tight — let that market find its bottom. Don't get shook out by the panic in the media, and life is going to be beautiful under Donald John Trump,” he said.
    


            With economists escalating concerns about the possibility of recession, Bessent said he rejected the assumption.
    


            “There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week? What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity,” he said.
    


            Goldman Sachs analysts in a note last week said economic growth driven by Trump's fiscal policies would not be able to make up for the damage done by his massive tariff plan.

            Rollins took issue with the characterization of the markets crashing and characterized it as an adjustment.
    


            “As the economy, the market, begins to adjust, we will see a more positive — as we move, I believe, very quickly,” she told CNN.
    


            Rollins also indicated there could be support for farmers impacted by the tariffs, pointing to previous relief during Trump's first term.
    


            “We have to be prepared that if there is longer-term damage … we will make sure that we have the funds in working with the senators and working with the appropriators, that we can do what we did last time,” she said.
    


            For his part, the president returned to familiar patterns as anxious Americans watched their retirement accounts plummet, spending each of the past four days at one of his South Florida golf properties.
    


            As protesters assembled to demonstrate against Trump's tariff policies across the country — including in West Palm Beach — the White House offered an official statement announcing that the president won a golf tournament at his club Saturday.
    


            “The President won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, FL, and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow,” the statement said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California told NBC's “Meet the Press” that the split-screen image “may end up being the most enduring image of the Trump presidency”
    


            “That is — the president out on a golf cart while people's retirement is in flames,” he said.

BRUSSELS (AP) — America's trading partners wrestled with responses to U.S. President Donald Trump's blast of tariff hikes and some planned to send negotiators to Washington, while the head of the European Union's executive commission offered mutual reduction of tariffs - while warning that retaliation was an option too.

“We stand ready to negotiate with the United States,” said commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Indeed, we have offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners. Because Europe is always ready for a good deal.”

But she warned that “we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests.”

China has already hit back against the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs and similar actions from Europe and elsewhere remain a significant possibility.

The U.S. and the EU had a zero-for-zero deal on wine and spirits from 1997 to 2018, and reducing many tariffs to zero was a goal of complex negotiations for a US-Europe free-trade deal before negotiations stalled in 2016. 

Yet there was little indication Trump is ready to deal. The EU trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, spoke for two hours with Trump administration Friday and would say only that “we stay in touch.” 

And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports would not lead to a pullback on the the newly announced 46% levy on its imports to the U.S. 




“Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,” Navarro said on CNBC

Major trade partner China was taking a tougher line and accused the U.S. of “bullying” after imposing a 34% tariff on Friday on all US goods, the exact same rate Trump slapped China with in his latest round of new import taxes.

Several other countries said they were sending trade officials to Washington to try to talk through the crisis, which has cast uncertainty over the global economic outlook, hammered markets and left U.S. allies wondering about the value of their ties with the world's largest economy. 

European Union trade ministers were closeted Monday in Luxembourg to weigh possible steps that could include taxes on U.S. tech companies like Google, Apple and Amazon. The European Union's executive commission - which handles trade issues for the 27-country bloc - is set to impose tariffs on Jeans, whiskey and motorcycles on Wednesday in response to Trumps increase in steel and aluminum tariffs.

But it hasn't decided a response yet to Trump's “reciprocal” tariff of 20% on European goods announced Wednesday and a 25% tariff imposed on autos from everywhere. French officials have raised imposing tariffs on services like internet commerce or financial services, where the U.S. sells more than it buys from Europe and is in theory more vulnerable than in goods trade. 

Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, was defiant as he arrived, saying the premise of the wide-ranging tariffs was “nonsense” and that attempts by individual countries to win exemptions haven't worked in the past. 

It's important for the EU to stick together, he said. That “means being clear that we are in a strong position — America is in a position of weakness.” 

So far the European approach has been to selectively target politically sensitive goods rather than impose sweeping retaliation since like most economists officials they view tariff wars as a lose-lose game. 

China, which hit back Friday at Washington with 34% tariffs on U.S. products and other retaliatory moves, sharply accused the U.S. of failing to play fair. “Putting ‘America First' over international rules is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,” Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.

The ruling Communist Party struck a note of confidence even as markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai crumpled. “The sky won't fall,” declared The People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece. “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of U.S. taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal.”

China's Commerce Ministry said officials met with representatives of 20 American businesses including Tesla and GE Healthcare over the weekend and urged them to take “concrete actions” to address the tariffs issue.

During the meeting, Ling Ji, a vice minister of commerce, promised that China will remain open to foreign investment, according to the readout by the ministry. 

South Korea's Trade Ministry said its top negotiator, Inkyo Cheong, will visit Washington this week to express Seoul's concerns over the 25% tariffs on Korean goods and discuss ways to mitigate the damage to South Korean businesses, which include major automakers and steel makers. Asian countries are among the most exposed to Trump's tariffs ranging from a baseline 10% to 50% since their export-oriented economies send a lot of goods to the U.S. 

Pakistan also planned to send a delegation to Washington this month to try negotiate over the 29% tariffs on its exports to the U.S., officials said. The prime minister ordered Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to assess the tariff's potential impact on Pakistan's fragile economy and draw up recommendations. 

The U.S. imports around $5 billion worth of textiles and other products each year from Pakistan, which heavily relies on loans from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. 

In Southeast Asia, Malaysia's Trade Minister Zafrul Abdul Aziz said his country will seek to forge a united response from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to Trump's sweeping tariffs.

As chair of the 10-nation body this year, Malaysia will lead a meeting Thursday in its capital Kuala Lumpur to discuss broader implications of the trade war on regional trade and investment, Zafrul told reporters.

“We are looking at the investment flows, macroeconomic stability and ASEAN's coordinated response to this tariff issue,” Zafrul said. 

He said that he had met with the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia to try to clarify how the U.S. came up with its 24% tariff. 

Indonesia, one of the region's biggest economies, said it would work with businesses to increase its imports of U.S. wheat, cotton, oil and gas to help reduce its trade surplus, which was $18 billion in 2024. 

Coordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto told a news conference that Indonesia will not retaliate against the new 32% tariff on Indonesian exports, but would use diplomacy to seek mutually beneficial solutions. 

Some Southeast Asian neighbors, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, face tariffs of over 40%, giving Indonesia a slight advantage, he noted.

“For Indonesia, it is also another opportunity as its market is huge in America,” Hartoto said. He said Indonesia would buy U.S.-made components for several national strategic projects, including refineries.

The beatings keep coming for financial markets worldwide as worries worsen Monday about whether President Donald Trump's trade war will torpedo the global economy.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are falling in a manic Monday after President Donald Trump doubled down on his tariffs, despite seeing how much financial markets would love to see him do the opposite. 

The S&P 500 was down 1.4% in midday trading, coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020. The index, which sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts, has lost nearly 20% since setting a record less than two months ago.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 744 points, or 1.9%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.1% lower. 

Earlier in a heart-racing morning, the Dow fell as many as 1,700 points shortly after trading began, following even worse losses worldwide on worries that Trump's tariffs could torpedo the global economy. But it suddenly surged to a leap of nearly 900 points before pulling back lower. The S&P 500 at one point went from a loss of 4.7% to a gain of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. 

The whipsaw swings shook the market as a White House account on X said a rumor circulating that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs was “fake news.” That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how hard investors are straining to see hopes that Trump may let up on his stiff tariffs, which have started a global trade war.

Within less than an hour of that “fake news” announcement, though, Trump threatened to raise tariffs further against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products. 




It's all a slap in the face to Wall Street, not just because of the sharp losses it's taking, but because it suggests Trump may not be moved by its pain. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling.

On Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he does not want markets to fall. But he also said he wasn't concerned about a sell-off, saying “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”

Trump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them. 

“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. He's one of the most influential executives on Wall Street. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.” 

The financial pain once again hammered investments around the world. Stocks in Hong Kong  plunged 13.2% for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil briefly dropped below $60 for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week. 

Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.

It also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero during downturns. By slashing interest rates to make borrowing easier for U.S. households and companies, along with other more untraditional moves to juice the economy, the Fed helped the U.S. economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID crash and other bear markets.

But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because the conditions are so much different. For one, instead of a coronavirus or a system built up on too much belief that U.S. home prices would keep rising, this market downturn is mostly because of economic policy from the White House.

Perhaps more importantly, inflation is also higher at the moment than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation. Expectations for inflation are already swinging higher  because of Trump's tariffs, which would likely raise prices for anything imported.

“The idea that there's so much uncertainty going forward about how these tariffs are going to play out, that's what's really driving this plummet in the stock prices,” said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at the Asia Group.

If the S&P 500 finishes the day 20% below its record, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that's moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10% drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious. 

Nathan Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said more countries are likely to respond to the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs. Given the large number of countries involved, “it will take a considerable amount of time in our view to work through the various negotiations that are likely to happen.”

“Ultimately, our take is market uncertainly and volatility are likely to persist for some time,” he said.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that he won't back down on his sweeping tariffs on imports from most of the world unless countries even out their trade with the U.S., digging in on his plans to implement the taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system.

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he didn't want global markets to fall, but also that he wasn't concerned about the massive sell-off either, adding, “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” 

His comments came as global financial markets appeared on track to continue sharp declines once trading resumes Monday, and after Trump's aides sought to soothe market concerns by saying more than 50 nations had reached out about launching negotiations to lift the tariffs.

“I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,” Trump said. “They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.”

The higher rates are set to be collected beginning Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said unfair trade practices are not “the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.” The United States, he said, must see “what the countries offer and whether it's believable.”




Trump, who spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, posted online that “WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy.” His Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy. 

“There doesn't have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?” Bessent said. “What we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.”

U.S. stock futures dropped on Sunday night as the tariffs continued to roil the markets. S&P 500 futures were down 2.5% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.1%. Nasdaq futures were down 3.1%. Even the price of bitcoin, which held relatively stable last week, fell nearly 6% Sunday.

Asian shares, meanwhile, nosedived. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost nearly 8% shortly after the market opened. By midday, it was down 6%. A circuit breaker briefly suspended trading of Topix futures after an earlier sharp fall in U.S. futures. Chinese markets also tumbled, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropping 9.4%, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 6.2%.

Trump's tariff blitz, announced April 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of global trade. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the U.S. He is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision.

Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly.

AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on more U.S. airstrikes in Yemen.

Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are “angry and retaliating,” and, he said, “by the way, coming to the table.” He cited the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks.

Adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting American allies and adversaries alike, including Israel, which is facing a 17% tariff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House and speak at a press conference with Trump on Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with Trump along with the war in Gaza and other issues.

Another American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. Trump said Vietnam's leader said in a telephone call that his country “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” And a key European partner, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump's move but was “ready to deploy all the tools — negotiating and economic — necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away. 

“The tariffs are coming. Of course they are,” he said, adding that Trump needed to reset global trade. But he committed only to having them “definitely” remain “for days and weeks.”

In Congress, where Trump's Republican Party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease.

Several Republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said Sunday that he would introduce a House version of the bill, saying that Congress needs to restores its powers over tariffs.

“We gave some of that power to the executive branch. I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake,” said Bacon, adding that getting a measure passed would be challenging unless the financial markets continue to react negatively and other indicators such as inflation and unemployment shift.

Wyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 member of the Senate's GOP leadership, said Trump is “doing what he has every right to do.” But, he acknowledged, “there is concern, and there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets.” 

“There'll be a discussion in the Senate,” Barrasso said of the tariffs. “We'll see which way the discussion goes.”

Trump's government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, had been relatively silent on Trump's tariffs, but said at a weekend event in Italy that he would like to see the U.S. and Europe move to “a zero-tariff situation.” The comment from the Tesla owner who leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency drew a rebuke from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.

“Elon, when he is on his DOGE lane, is great. But we understand what's going on here. We just have to understand. Elon sells cars,” Navarro said. He added: “He's simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do.”

Trump indicated he disagreed with Musk, saying Sunday of the European Union, “They want to talk, but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.”

Lawrence Summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said Trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners. 

If other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the U.S, does, too, he said, “it's just making a deal, then we don't raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the United States. If it's a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the United States, then we're going to have these tariffs permanently. So the president can't have it both ways.”

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — During the final sweet moments of UConn's 12th national title, Geno Auriemma and Paige Bueckers embraced after the star guard departed her final game with the Huskies.

It was the moment they wanted all along.

“They've all been gratifying, don't get me wrong,” Auriemma said. “But this one here, because of the way it came about and what's been involved, it's been a long time since I've been that emotional when a player has walked off the court.”

Bueckers, Azzi Fudd and Sarah Strong led the way as UConn returned to the top of women's college basketball by rolling to an 82-59 victory over defending champion South Carolina on Sunday.

Fudd, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, scored 24 points. Strong had 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Bueckers scored 17 points for UConn (37-3).

“Well, it's amazing to have three players, three people like that on the same team,” said the 71-year-old Auriemma, who became the oldest coach in major college basketball to win a championship. “And Sarah, you would think Sarah was graduating the way she plays, right? All three of them complement each other so well. They all have such unique skill sets.”

Bueckers capped her stellar career with the Huskies' first championship since 2016, ending a nine-year drought for the team. That was the longest period for Auriemma and his program without a title since Rebecca Lobo and Jen Rizzotti led the Huskies to their first championship in 1995.

Since then the Huskies have had dominant championship runs, including in the early 2000s led by Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, 2009-10 with Maya Moore and finally the four straight from 2013-16 with Breanna Stewart. All were in attendance in Florida on Sunday to see the Huskies' latest title.




“You just never know if you'll ever be back in this situation again,” Auriemma said. “And there were so many times when I think we all questioned, ‘Have we been here too long? Has it been time?' And we kept hanging in there and hanging in there and that's because these players make me want to hang in there every day.”

Bueckers, the expected No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft on April 14, delivered for the Huskies throughout their championship season.

Winning a title was the only thing missing from an incredible UConn career that was slowed by injuries. She was the first freshman to win AP Player of the Year before missing a lot of her sophomore season with a tibial plateau fracture and meniscus tear. She then tore an ACL before the next season.

“It's been a story of resilience, gratitude of overcoming adversity and responding to life's challenges,” Bueckers said. “I wouldn't trade it for the world.”

UConn closed the first half up 10 points and then put the game away in the third quarter, with Fudd, Strong and Bueckers combining for 23 of the team's 26 points in the period. UConn was up 50-39 with 3:21 left before closing with a 12-3 run.

Fudd and Strong got it started with back-to-back 3s, and the rout was on. Auriemma subbed Bueckers, Fudd and Strong out with 1:32 left in the game.

UConn's leading trio finished the tourney with 368 points, including an NCAA freshman record 114 for Strong. It was the highest point total for three teammates in a single NCAA Tournament, according to Stats Perform. Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randell scored 363 points for Tennessee in the 1998 women's tournament, and Glen Rice led the way for a trio of Michigan men that had 366 points in 1989.

The UConn trio proved to be way too much for South Carolina.

Dawn Staley's team was trying for a third title in four years and fourth overall. It would have tied her with Kim Mulkey for third most behind Auriemma and former Tennessee Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt, who had eight.

“Our kids gave it all they had. When you can understand why you lost and when you've been on the other side of that three times, you understand it,” Staley said. “You can swallow it. We lost to a very good basketball team.” 

UConn had reached the title game only once during its drought since 2016. The Huskies had been eliminated by heartbreaking last-second losses in the Final Four on buzzer-beaters. The Huskies' last title game appearance came in 2022 when Staley's team beat UConn to start the Gamecocks' current run of success, a game that ended Auriemma's perfect record in title games.

There seemed to be no nerves early for either team as the game got off to a fast start. The teams traded baskets for the first few minutes before the defenses started to clamp down. The Huskies led 19-14 after one quarter and then extended the advantage to 36-26 at the half. Fudd had 13 points and Strong added eight points and 11 rebounds.

The storm system resulted in at least 16 deaths by early Sunday, with overnight tornado and flash flood warnings setting up more severe weather that forecasters say could cause rising waterways for days to come. Drone footage showed the severe extent of the flooding in the Kentucky towns of New Haven and Dawson Springs.

FRANKFORT, Kentucky (AP) — Rivers rose and flooding worsened Sunday across the sodden U.S. South and Midwest, threatening communities already badly damaged by days of heavy rain and wind that killed at least 18 people.

Even as the rain moved out of some of the hardest hit areas in Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky, water levels crept up in some communities, swirling into homes and businesses and submerging roads. 

In Frankfort, Kentucky, rescue crews checking up on residents in the state capital traversed inundated streets in inflatable boats. Workers erected sandbag ramparts to protect homes and businesses and turned off utilities as the swollen Kentucky River kept rising.

“As long as I've been alive — and I'm 52 — this is the worst I've ever seen it,” said Wendy Quire, the general manager at the Brown Barrel restaurant in downtown Frankfort.

AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports on the weekend's heavy rains and floods across the U.S. South and Midwest and what affected areas can expect for the rest of the week.

The river's depth had risen above 47 feet Sunday and was expected to crest above 49 feet Monday morning to a potentially record-setting level, according to Frankfort Mayor Layne Wilkerson. The city's flood wall system is designed to withstand 51 feet of water.

Forecasters said that flooding could persist as torrential rains lingered over several states. Tornado watches were in effect through much of the day Sunday in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Florida.

For many, there was a sense of dread.

“This flooding is an act of God,” said Kevin Gordon, a front desk clerk at the Ashbrook Hotel in downtown Frankfort. The hotel was open Sunday and offering discounted stays to affected locals, but Gordon said it could eventually be forced to close.

The 18 reported deaths since the storms began on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee. A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky was caught up in floodwaters while walking to catch his school bus. A 5-year-old boy in Arkansas died after a tree fell on his family's home and trapped him, police said. A 16-year-old volunteer Missouri firefighter died in a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.

The National Weather Service said on Sunday dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a “major flood stage,” with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.

In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking River. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.

The storms come after the Trump administration cut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.

A northwestern Tennessee town of about 200 people that flooded after a levee failure in February was almost entirely underwater on Sunday after the Obion River overflowed. Domanic Scott went to check on his father in Rives, Tennessee, after not hearing from him in a house where floodwater had reached the doorsteps.

“It's the first house we've ever paid off. The insurance companies around here won't give flood insurance to anyone who lives in Rives because we're too close to the river and the levees. So if we lose it, we're kind of screwed without a house,” Scott said.

For others that fled to higher ground, grabbing the essentials also meant taking a closer look at the liquor cabinet.

In Kentucky, with water rising up to his windowsills, Frankfort resident Bill Jones fled his home in a boat, which he loaded with several boxes filled with bottles of bourbon.

As of early Sunday, Memphis had received 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain since Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. West Memphis, Arkansas, received 10 inches (25 centimeters).

The rain and fierce winds moved further east on Sunday, felling trees in Alabama and Georgia.

Forecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.

The U.S. military's Central Command has released video showing fighter planes taking off for operations against Yemen's Houthi rebels. The U.S. administration has linked its airstrikes on the Iran-backed Houthis to an effort to pressure Tehran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.

The strikes in Saada killed two people and wounded four others, with footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showing a strike collapsing what appeared to be a two-story building.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Suspected U.S. airstrikes over the weekend targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least six people, the group said Sunday, while a bombing video posted by U.S. President Donald Trump suggested casualties in the overall campaign may be higher than the rebels acknowledge.

A strike Sunday night in Sanaa, the rebel-held capital of Yemen, hit a house, killing at least four people and wounding 16 others, the Houthis said. Their al-Masirah satellite news channel showed images of the damaged home and people receiving care in a hospital. 

The strike on the house in Sanaa's Shu'ub district allegedly targeted a Houthi leader, part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders. The intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters — related to the Israel-Hamas war — has killed at least 73 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis.

Earlier Sunday, the Iranian-backed Houthis said other suspected U.S. airstrikes killed at least two people in the rebel stronghold of Saada and wounded nine others. Footage aired by al-Masirah showed a strike collapsing what appeared to be a two-story building. The rebels aired no footage from inside the building, which they described as a solar power shop.

The Houthis have not acknowledged any casualties among their security and military leadership — something challenged after an online video posted by Trump.

Early on Saturday, Trump posted what appeared to be a black-and-white video from a drone showing over 70 people gathered in a circle. An explosion detonates during the 25-second video. A massive crater is left in its wake.

“These Houthis gathered for instructions on an attack,” Trump claimed, without offering a location or any other details about the strike. “Oops, there will be no attack by these Houthis! They will never sink our ships again!”

The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees Mideast military operations, has not published the video nor offered specific details about the strikes it has conducted since March 15. The White House has said over 200 strikes have targeted the Houthis.

The rebel-controlled SABA news agency in Yemen, citing an anonymous source, described the bombing as targeting “a social Eid visit in Hodeida governorate.” Muslims around the world just celebrated Eid al-Fitr at the end of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. SABA had published images of other commanders meeting fighters during the holiday, though not any high-level Houthi officials.

“Those present at that gathering had no connection to the operations carried out by the (Houthis), which are implementing the decision to ban navigation on ships linked to the American and Israeli enemy,” the SABA report said, adding that the attack killed and wounded “dozens.”

The Houthis previously have not acknowledged any strike on Hodeida during that time with such a high casualty count. The SABA report also did not describe those killed as civilians, suggesting they did have ties to the rebels' security or military forces. Hodeida has been a site of Houthi attacks into the Red Sea.

Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister for Yemen's exiled government opposing the Houthis, claimed the strike killed some 70 Houthi fighters and leaders, as well as “experts” from Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. He offered no evidence for the claim, though Iran has backed the Houthis. 

Neither the Iranian government nor the Guard has acknowledged the attack. However, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, said Saturday that “no Iranian individual has been martyred” in Yemen and described the claim of fatalities as “psychological warfare.” 

Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert of the Basha Report risk advisory firm, cited social media condolence notices suggesting a colonel overseeing police stations for the Houthis in Hodeida had been killed in the strike Trump highlighted, alongside his two brothers.

“The strikes have expanded significantly, hitting multiple governorates simultaneously, alongside telecommunications infrastructure, command nodes, properties tied to senior Houthi leadership and previously untouched tunnel networks in mountainous areas,” al-Basha told The Associated Press.

“We've also seen direct targeting of Houthi force gatherings, indicating a more aggressive and evolving shift in the targeting strategy,” al-Basha said.

An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.

The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.

The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.

The attacks greatly raised the profile of the Houthis, who faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers in Yemen amid a decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.

A new study from the Network Contagion Research Institute follows an uptick in political violence in the wake of Luigi Mangione's alleged killing of UHC CEO Brian Thompson. (US the Story)

A disturbing new report reveals that violent political rhetoric online, including calls for the murder of public figures like President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, is being increasingly normalized, particularly on the left.

The report, from Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), found that a growing number of people are willing to justify and even applaud killing in the name of politics and a warped sense of social justice. The chilling change appears to have accelerated in recent months.

""What was formerly taboo culturally has become acceptable,"" Joel Finkelstein, the lead author of the report, told Fox News Digital. ""We are seeing a clear shift – glorification, increased attempts and changing norms – all converging into what we define as ‘assassination culture.'""

The NCRI study traces the cultural shift back to the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson by Luigi Mangione in December 2024. What followed, researchers say, was a viral wave of memes that turned Mangione into a folk hero. 

According to the study, these memes have sparked copycat behavior targeting other figures associated with wealth and conservative politics.

NEW STUDY FINDS DEI INITIATIVES CREATING 'HOSTILE ATTRIBUTION BIAS'

""It's not just Luigi anymore,"" Finkelstein said. ""We're seeing an expansion: Trump, Musk and others are now being openly discussed as legitimate targets, often cloaked in meme culture and gamified online dialogue.""

A ballot measure in California, darkly named the Luigi Mangione Access to Health Care Act, is just one real-world outgrowth of this online movement.

In this chart, over half of left-leaning respondents said killing Donald Trump would be at least ""somewhat justified,"" according to NCRI's national survey. The study found that 55% of self-identified left-of-center participants justified Trump's assassination to some degree, while 48% did the same for Elon Musk. Researchers say the findings reflect a growing tolerance for political violence among ideological extremists. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

NCRI conducted a nationally representative survey of more than 1,200 U.S. adults, weighted to reflect national census demographics. The findings were stark: Some 38% of respondents said it would be at least ""somewhat justified"" to murder Donald Trump, and 31% said the same about Elon Musk.

When counting only left-leaning respondents, justification for killing Trump rose to 55% and Musk to 48%. 

""These are not isolated opinions,"" the report states. ""They are part of a tightly connected belief system linked to what we call left-wing authoritarianism.""

""Trump represents the perfect target for assassination culture. He's powerful, he's rich and he's provocative,"" said Finkelstein to Fox News Digital. ""That puts him on the highest shelf for those who glorify political violence.""

""Trump represents the perfect target for assassination culture. He's powerful, he's rich and he's provocative. That puts him on the highest shelf for those who glorify political violence.""

When asked whether destroying a Tesla dealership was justified, nearly four in 10 respondents agreed it was, to some degree. Among self-identified left-of-center participants, support for vandalism and property damage was significantly higher.

""Property destruction wasn't just an outlier opinion, it clustered tightly with support for political assassinations and other forms of violence,"" said Finkelstein. ""This points to a coherent belief system, not just isolated grievances.""

Among left-of-center respondents, a large share rated the murder of Trump and Musk as either ""somewhat"" or ""completely justified,"" according to this histogram. The chart highlights the skew in support for political violence along ideological lines, with far-left participants scoring highest across all metrics. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

""Tesla has become a stand-in for broader frustrations about capitalism, tech power and conservative politics. Burning down a dealership isn't just a protest, it's a performance, a signal of belonging to a radical in-group.""

Finkelstein said that while some level of violent sentiment exists on the right, ""What we found was a statistically higher endorsement of political murder on the left, 41% more than among right-leaning participants.""

The report singles out BlueSky, a social media platform favored by progressive users, as a major amplifier of extremist ideation. 

""BlueSky was modeled as a safe alternative to Twitter for the left, but what it's become is an extremist platform,"" Finkelstein said. ""It functions today much like 4chan or Gab once did for far-right ideologies. These platforms are now lead indicators of violent real-world trends."" 

This correlation matrix shows that support for assassinations, property destruction and Mangione are all tightly linked, forming a belief system NCRI calls ""assassination culture."" The study finds that left-wing authoritarianism was the strongest predictor for all categories of political violence. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

According to NCRI's open-source analysis, BlueSky saw a spike in engagement on posts referencing Mangione, Trump and Musk, crossing over 200,000 posts and 2 million engagements in just months. Reddit currently hosts pro-Mangione communities with tens of thousands of members.

Finkelstein believes the psychological roots of ""assassination culture"" are a mix of ideological radicalism and feelings of powerlessness, particularly in the aftermath of electoral losses.

""When people feel like they have no say, no future and no leadership offering vision, they become susceptible to radical ideation,"" he said. ""And that's when the memes turn into permission structures for real violence.""

Multivariate regression analysis reveals that far-left ideology, the use of BlueSky and a sense of powerlessness (external locus of control) are the leading predictors of support for political violence. The chart breaks down which psychological and demographic traits most strongly align with justifying the murder of Musk and Trump or attacks on Tesla dealerships. (Network Contagion Research Institute)

A key predictor identified in the study is external locus of control, which is the belief that one's life is governed by outside forces.

""Combine that with extreme partisanship, and you get an explosive mix,"" Finkelstein said.

Finkelstein does not believe censorship will end ""assassination culture,"" but strong leadership just might.

""We are not an anti-free speech organization,"" said Finkelstein. ""But we know what a threat is. And what's happening online on platforms like BlueSky represents a significant threat to American democratic values. If leaders on the left explicitly condemn these trends and reassert moral norms, they can dismantle this culture quickly,"" he said. ""It's about reminding people there is a future worth striving for that doesn't involve glorifying political violence.""

""It's about reminding people there is a future worth striving for that doesn't involve glorifying political violence.""

The NCRI report ends on a sobering note: The normalization of assassination ideation is already spilling into real-world violence. Whether it's attacks on Tesla dealerships or assassination attempts on public officials, the NCRI warns that political violence is no longer fringe but culturally fashionable in some corners of the internet.

""With economic instability and ideological echo chambers feeding radicalism, the threat environment is shifting beneath our feet,"" Finkelstein said.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on the judicial system's handling of executive power cases, controversy surrounding alleged MS-13 Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia's deportation, the Luigi Mangione case and chatter about President Trump seeking a third term.

A federal appeals court voted en banc Monday to block President Donald Trump's firings of two federal board members, reversing an appellate court ruling and clearing the way for the Trump administration to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

Judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit voted 7-4 Monday to restore the positions of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) member Cathy Harris – two Democratic appointees who were abruptly terminated by the Trump administration earlier this year. 

The majority cited Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey's Executor and Wiener v. United States as the backing for their decision, noting that the Supreme Court had never overturned or reversed the decades-old precedent regarding removal restrictions for government officials of ""multimember adjudicatory boards"" – including the NLRB and MSPB.

They noted that the Supreme Court has not yet overturned these precedents, or instructed lower courts to act otherwise.

""The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,"" judges noted in their opinion. 

Monday's ruling from the full panel means that both Wilcox and Harris can return to their positions, at least for now. It is likely to spark intense backlash from the Trump administration, which has lobbed accusations of so-called ""activist judges"" that have slowed or halted some of Trump's executive orders and actions.

Also on Monday, the appeals court rejected the Trump administration's request for an administrative stay, which would have allowed their removals to remain in place while the challenge continued to play out in federal court.

The panel found that the administration had not demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its appeals, nor did it show irreparable injury if they did not grant the stay – the legal requirements needed to satisfy an emergency court intervention. 

The en banc ruling reverses a decision reached just 10 days earlier by a three-judge panel for the same appeals court. That panel ruled 2-1 in favor of the Trump administration and allowed the firings to proceed, prompting plaintiffs to file a request for the appeals court to hear the case again en banc, or with all appellate court judges present.

The appellate court's decision to hear the case again, even after a three-judge appellate panel from the same court ruled on the issue late last month, is likely to be met with intense scrutiny by Trump and his allies. 

It also all but ensures that the Trump administration will move quickly to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court for emergency review.

Since taking office, Trump has signed more than 300 executive orders and actions, including sweeping personnel moves, the restructuring of federal agencies, and the creation of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE – a temporary agency that has drawn scrutiny for its broad oversight powers and access to sensitive government data.

Critics argue that the flurry of early executive actions warrants an additional level of legal scrutiny, and judges have raced to review a crushing wave of cases and lawsuits filed by terminated employees or brought on behalf of agency employees. 

The Trump administration has appealed its early losses to the Supreme Court – a strategy it appears poised to continue in the NLRB and MSPB terminations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","These ex-Tesla employees want to launch a new Roadster before Elon Musk","https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-tesla-employees-want-launch-new-roadster-before-elon-musk-2025-4","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 09:15:00 GMT","

Tesla fans are still waiting for a new Roadster — and now two ex-Tesla employees are launching an EV startup that could steal Elon Musk's thunder.

Musk promised the updated Tesla Roadster would be ""the fastest production car ever made, period"" when he unveiled it in 2017, but eight years later, the $200,000 rocket-boosted EV is nowhere to be seen, leaving some reservations holders with a serious case of buyers regret.

Daniel Davey and fellow Tesla veteran Mark Tapscott are looking to fill that void.

The two electric car enthusiasts founded British EV startup Longbow in 2023 along with Jenny Keisu, the former CEO of electric boat maker X Shore, and are now looking to disrupt their former employer with a range of lightweight electric sports cars.

Longbow's first vehicle will be the Speedster, a limited-production £84,995 ($112,000) open-top sports car that the company describes as a ""statement of intent,"" with deliveries beginning next year.

That will be followed by the Roadster, a £64,995 ($85,500) production vehicle that serves as a nod to Elon Musk's infamously delayed supercar.

""The Tesla Roadster was announced in 2017. On the day, people were paying deposits by credit card there and then for $250,000. It was called the Tesla Roadster 2020,"" said Davey.

""We will deliver a Roadster before Tesla delivers a Roadster. And ours will be lighter and cooler,"" he added.

Davey and Tapscott joined Tesla in the early 2010s and helped launch the Roadster and the Model S, the brand's first two vehicles, in Europe — a process that was far from smooth.

""I was employee 650, spent some time in California, then came Europe with the Roadster back when there was no charging infrastructure, no one knew who Tesla or Elon was, and all of it was uphill,"" said Davey.

Tapscott says he joined Tesla after being wowed by the original Roadster. After contacting Musk and former Apple exec George Blankenship, he was tasked with selling the first two Model S vehicles in the UK.

""I was driving up and down the country, showing those cars to everybody, charging at whatever pub or hotel you could stop off at,"" said Tapscott, who worked for Tesla for seven years.

""The first ever test drive with the Model S in the UK, the guy turned up in his Ferrari, crashed the car, and pretty much wrote it off,"" he added.

The two Tesla veterans went on to work with a whos-who of EV companies, including Lucid, Hyundai, and Chinese automakers like BYD.

Davey, who returned to Tesla in 2018 to launch the Model 3 in Europe (""Elon was sleeping on the sofa, no one else at the company had any sleep,"" was how he described that period), told BI that harnessing their wealth of experience would be key to avoiding the fate of other failed EV startups.

""We have done this multiple times, and all our peers who could do this are moving their way up to Vice President/Senior VP level and working in VCs because they're not crazy enough to apply that knowledge at the beginning again,"" he said.

After a boom in the early 2020s, the past few years have seen numerous once-promising EV startups collapse as electric vehicle sales growth has slowed and funding has dried up.

Meanwhile, legacy automakers have also sought to launch increasingly affordable, mass-market electric offerings as they look to boost adoption and sales.

That makes it an unusual time to launch a mid-range electric sportscar — but Longbow's cofounders believe the lack of competition gives the startup an opening.

""It's a scandal that no one else is focusing on this segment,"" said Davey.

""We're passionate about the products in the segment, but from a logical perspective, it is the best place to be building cars. You have the best margins, and there is no competition,"" he added.

Tapscott said that Longbow's approach to building its cars was centered on the concept of ""speed of lightness.""

Rather than choosing to build the majority of components in-house — a process that has seen other startups like Tesla and Rivian face an EV ""valley of death"" as production has scaled up before profits — Longbow plans to buy most of its components off the shelf from outside suppliers.

Davey and Tapscott argue that will allow the startup to be more flexible, improve margins, and take advantage of an EV supply chain that is far more developed than when Tesla began building the first Roadster.

""We don't have to build a billion-dollar factory just to get a single motor,"" said Tapscott.

Although Longbow is making an effort to prioritize local suppliers in the UK, some of its supply chain will likely include Chinese EV tech.

Having worked with Chinese EV companies in the past, Tapscott and Davey described the technology coming out of the world's most competitive auto market as ""breathtaking.""

""A lot of components come from China, where it's appropriate, especially [battery] cells, right? We will leverage that,"" said Davey.

""But we really want to lean into and support the local supply chain,"" he said, adding that Longbow expects to finalize its supply chain nine months before deliveries begin in late 2026.

Davey and Tapscott declined to say how many reservations Longbow has received so far but described the response to the Speedster and the Roadster as highly encouraging.

""Tesla builds 2 million cars a year … but at some point, the disruptors become the disrupted,"" said Davey.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Here's what the smartest people in markets and economics are saying about Trump's tariffs","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-liberation-day-tariffs-reactions-commentators-2025-4","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 03:23:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2 — and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering.

Here's what big names in business and economics have been saying:

Joshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs ""run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters."" He added: ""Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.""

He said the Business Roundtable ""supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners"" but called on him to introduce ""additional reasonable exemptions"" and a ""transparent, predictable exclusion process.""

""Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much,"" Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. ""The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion.""

Summers added that the tariffs were the most expensive and ""masochistic"" the US had imposed in decades.

""The price action in global financial markets in the immediate aftermath of the US tariff announcement points to major worries about global economic growth,"" Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant PIMCO and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on X.

""These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs,"" Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's ""Peston"" program.

Boaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: ""I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. This is not a buy-the-dip opportunity. It's a sell the dip opportunity.""

""So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? What is with that adverb 'again' which is defined as 'returning to a previous condition'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household … too bad we don't all live at the average!),"" David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, said on X.

""Have tariffs really stood in the way of wealth creation in America? I think the title should simply be the truth: 'Let's Make the World Poor Again' (and then we can buy it at a discount),"" Rosenberg added.

Nouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the ""Liberation Day"" label was ""Orwellian doublespeak.""

""Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be — ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world,"" he said on X.

""He's gone full-on crazy,"" Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter.

""If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them,"" Krugman added.

""March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth,"" wrote Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column.

""Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings),"" he added.

""The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.3% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household consumer loss of $3,800 in 2024$. Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,700,"" wrote the Yale Budget Lab in a new analysis published on April 2, shortly after Trump's blanket tariff announcement.

""Tthe United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries,"" said Jared Bernstein, the US's former chief economist, in his newsletter. ""That means, as Trump has correctly argued, we can hurt them more than they can hurt us. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners.""

""First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices — as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points — and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2,"" he added.

""Monstrously destructive, incoherent, ill-informed tariffs based on fabrications, imagined wrongs, discredited theories and ignorance of decades of evidence. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else,"" said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky.

""If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth,"" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, on BlueSky.

""Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built,"" she added.

The latest set of tariffs is ""a similar event to going off the gold standard in 1971. It's an epic event. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance,"" Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC.

""I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%,"" said Gross, who's also known as ""Bond King.""

Gross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to ""catching a falling knife.""

""Tariffs attack US trading partners but, in effect, attack US corporate profit margins first,"" wrote Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. ""The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. The macro risk hitting markets is real, but only accentuates the devaluation process.""

""Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising,"" Blitz wrote.

Jim O'Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the ""sensible"" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services.

He said this would be ""very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in.""

If the US wants to continue down this ""kamikaze path,"" the UK will have to respond, O'Neill added. ""It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves.""

""Just had a journalist ask me to explain ""Liberation Day,"" Stephanie Kelton, the author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. ""I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets.""

George Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said in a Friday note that markets were pricing in a global recession.

""This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. The countries that respond the quickest and most forcefully to this shock are those whose currencies will likely be the most resilient. And, on the flipside, the more the US fiscal strategy under the Trump administration lacks visibility, the more the market will punish the dollar and US assets.

""One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. Remember that during the European supply-shock of 2022, the ECB turned hawkish. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed.""

Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a ""significant risk"" to the global economy.

""We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,"" she said in a statement on Thursday.

Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, told Ireland's Newstalk that the tariffs would be ""negative the world over.""

She said Trump's move ""will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate.""

Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, posted on X on Friday:

""The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Why not give them a chance? Make the 10pct min tariff immediate but defer the ""reciprocal"" part 6 mos. Take the win! The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning…I'm there now!""

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations.

""While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,"" Powell said at a conference for business journalists. ""The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.""

The central bank president repeatedly said it was too early to tell what the Fed's response might be.

""We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said.""

Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs, which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes ""no economic sense.""

""The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc,"" Corinth wrote. ""But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold.""

In a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could ""hit imminently and extend until next year"" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate.

""Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario,"" he predicted.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV, veteran analyst Ed Yardeni said he hoped the ""message that the stock market is sending to the administration is being heard.""

""The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy,"" he added.

Brad Setser, the former senior advisor to the US trade representative and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the latest round of tariffs will be ""painful.""

""I think what the announcement on Wednesday showed is that the decision of the administration, not surprisingly, was to follow President Trump's instincts, not the instincts of his more moderate advisors, to go all in,"" Setser said on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast.

Setser said the goal is to ""radically restructure the US and global economies using tariffs as a tool, with some flexibility perhaps to negotiate at the edges. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs.""

Greg Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young, told Yahoo Finance that ""the risk of a recession are very real"" with the tariffs in place.

""The risks of a particularly severe recession are real, because if these tariffs remain in place on a persistent basis, you would see a drag on US economic activity worth about 1% to 1.5% of growth,"" he said. ""In an economy that is expected to grow around 1.5%, that puts the economy essentially into stagnation. Add to that a 1% to 1.5% lift on inflation, and you have stagflation.""

Douglas Irwin, the trade historian and economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in The Economist that Trump's tariffs ""blow an enormous hole"" in the trade policy that the US has advanced since World War II.

""The president now touts his tariffs as mainly 'reciprocal': 'Whatever they charge us, we charge them.' This makes them sound fair. Far from it,"" Irwin said.

""Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this week's events is the ability of one person to completely remake American trade policy. A situation in which the occupant of the White House can make such momentous changes on his own, unchecked, reflects serious political decay in American politics.""

One day before Trump's latest tariff announcement, the economist Thomas Sowell told the Hoover Institution that the president's tariffs could lead to a global trade war.

""It's painful to see a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated,"" Sowell said. ""If you set off a worldwide trade war, that has a devastating history.""

""Everybody loses because everybody follows suit,"" he continued. ""And all that happens is that you get a great reduction in international trade.""

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on X that the US's global economic war against the world risks destroying confidence in America as a trading partner and investment destination.

Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square, suggested a 90-day time-out to negotiate and resolve ""unfair asymmetric tariff deals."" 

""If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,"" wrote Ackman.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their probability for a US recession from 35% to 45% on a sharp tightening in financial conditions, overseas consumer boycotts, and a spike in policy uncertainty that will depress capital spending.

The forecast is based on their assumption that the effective tariff rate rises by 15 percentage points — which is less than what has been announced. If most of the tariffs take effect on Wednesday, that would raise the effective tariff rate by 20 percentage points. In that case, the analysts expect a recession, they wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Jamie Dimon warns of 'stagflation' and slowing growth in a wide-ranging shareholder letter","https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimons-annual-letter-to-investors-stagflation-2025-4","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:15:00 GMT","

In a wide-ranging letter to shareholders, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he saw ""stagflation"" dangers slowing the economy as the stock market dropped in response to President Donald Trump's trade wars.

""Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,"" Dimon said in the 58-page letter, which was released Monday and addressed various topics, including immigration and the state of civil discourse.

""While inflation has come down,"" he wrote, ""most of what I see in the future is inflationary: continued high fiscal deficits, the remilitarization of the world and the need for infrastructure investment, including the green economy and the restructuring of trade and tariffs.""

Dimon said he expected rising costs to create a ""tug-of-war"" over the direction of interest rates, with long-term borrowing costs ultimately heading higher. ""All things being equal, the slower the growth, the lower the interest rates, and the higher the inflation, the higher the interest rates,"" he said.

He even referenced ""stagflation,"" a term popularized before the turn of the century to describe an unpleasant cocktail of high inflation, high unemployment, and tepid economic growth.

""This tug-of-war can go on for some time, but it's good to remember that in the stagflation of the 1970s, recessions did not stop the inexorable trend of rising rates,"" he wrote.

Dimon stopped short of saying the economy is headed for a recession. Following a two-day stock sell-off last week, the dreaded R-word has been on everyone's lips.

He also suggested that the stock market pain may not be over.

""No matter how you measure it, equity valuations are still well above their historical averages,"" he said, adding: ""Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing. I am not so sure.""

The CEO's much-anticipated annual letter to shareholders comes as the leaders of corporations seek to understand where the economy — and the nation — is headed under Trump, who has bold plans for reorganizing the federal government and US foreign policy.

Dimon used his letter to opine on various problems facing the US, as well as prospective solutions.

""To be able to attack our problems at home and abroad, we must be strong. And our core strength is based upon our commitment to our values, as well as our ability to work hard and think intelligently about our problems,"" Dimon wrote, adding that he supported some policy positions of both Democrats and Republicans.

The letter also touched on what he deemed ""common sense"" solutions to the nation's problems, including tightening security at the border and doing away with special interests, or what he called ""selfishness on the part of our citizens and elected officials.""

Some Wall Street watchers have long suspected that the billionaire banker — a regular pontificator on world events — has harbored ambitions to seek public office, though he said last year that he would not seek a position in the Trump administration.

Dimon bemoaned the increasingly acrimonious tone infecting the public discourse. Indeed, he said that Americans are ""meaner to each other"" and that ""a little more kindness and understanding would go a long way.""

Dimon added: ""I am a firm believer that we should constantly talk with each other, air our views, hold each other accountable and try to respect all sides of an argument."" He said social media algorithms had amplified the problem.

JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion in profit in 2024 and has since called employees back to the office five days a week, a mandate that has led some employees to explore their options, including unionization.

Last year, the bank also earned a record $58.5 billion in net income, up from $49.6 billion the year before, it said in its earnings filings. The firm's stock is up about 6% over the past year, trading as of early April at about $210 a share.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The latest victim of Trump's tariffs: IPOs","https://www.businessinsider.com/ipo-comeback-victim-trump-tariffs-stock-market-crash-2025-4","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 08:09:00 GMT","

Public offerings were about to take off. Instead, they've hit the massive Trump Slump.

A few months ago, after years of abysmal performance, it looked like IPOs were finally set for a comeback. ServiceTitan, a software platform for general contractors, saw its stock soar by 35% after its debut in December. A bunch of hot companies were lined up to go public: the buy-now, pay-later lender Klarna, the ticket reseller StubHub, and the AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave. Silicon Valley, it seemed, was about to return to the good old days, when snazzy new startups could expect a huge payoff on Wall Street. ""All signs were pointing to 2025 as the year when we would finally get some IPOs,"" says Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance Capital.

But now, the long-anticipated boom in IPOs has suddenly gone bust. CoreWeave's public offering in March was the biggest tech IPO since 2021, but it was forced to price itself well below the expected range. And on Friday, StubHub and Klarna both delayed their planned IPOs, as Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a huge slide in the stock market. IPO analysts at Renaissance now estimate that there could be as few as 150 deals this year, which would make 2025 the fourth straight down year for IPOs.

""This is going to shut down the IPO market,"" Kennedy says. ""The question is, for how long?""

The Great IPO Depression is bad news for everyone. With public offerings continuing to sputter, founders and venture capitalists have less of an incentive to innovate and take risks. At the same time, mom-and-pop investors have fewer chances to strike it big with the next Facebook or Airbnb. While their pensions may be invested in high-growth companies through venture capital funds, they aren't able to get in on the game directly, further deepening the divide between the stock market haves and have-nots.

""Yet again, we are sequestering the majority of the upside of our prosperity to the private markets that consist mostly of 0.1 percenters and institutional investors,"" Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur and marketing professor at New York University, recently observed. As long as IPOs remain stagnant, average Americans have few ways to share in Silicon Valley's wealth.

The numbers show how bleak things have gotten. In 2021, 311 companies raised a record $119 billion. From there, things went off a cliff. Over the next three years combined, according to data compiled by University of Florida professor Jay Ritter, 164 companies raised only $39 billion. For most startups, the promised land of Wall Street was no longer an option.

The continued slump in IPOs has bankers, venture capitalists, and investors wondering if a more permanent shift is underway. The most obvious change is that high-profile companies don't need the public markets in the same way they once did — they can raise all they want from private investors and avoid the scrutiny that comes with being a publicly traded company. Examples abound: SpaceX is buying back its own stock. Stripe has made clear it sees no need to rush into the public markets. OpenAI, one of the fastest-growing companies in history by revenue, remains in private hands.

""Companies are staying private for longer in part because there is so much availability of capital in the private sphere,"" says Craig Coben, the former global head of equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""They don't have to deal with all the complications and obligations of being public.""

But while high-profile companies can afford to stay private, smaller startups are having a hard time going public. ""There is a class of companies that can have very successful IPOs and early public lives,"" says Jeremy Abelson, the founder and CEO at Irving Investors, which owns venture investments as well as public equities. But the ""vast majority"" of companies in the IPO pipeline, he adds, face challenges that make it tough for them to make a name for themselves in the market.

Case in point: There are fewer sell-side analysts researching small companies than there were during the IPO boom 25 years ago. Complex algorithms, rather than an actual person reviewing balance sheets and financial statements, determine which companies to bet on. And that means it's harder for startups to get the exposure they need to attract investors.

Another barrier to IPOs is the widespread economic uncertainty that's been generated by the Trump administration. ""It's really hard to go public in a market this volatile,"" says Kennedy, the Renaissance Capital analyst. ""Nobody knows what anything's worth."" Going public requires a company to project its future growth — and that's hard to do in the midst of a trade war whose targets seem to shift on an almost daily basis. And when growth is slow, companies have less of a cushion to meet investor expectations, making it much more likely they might miss a quarterly performance metric.

""Back in 2020 and 2021, it was easy,"" says one banker who asked for anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. ""You were able to lock in 30% growth from your existing customer base. Now, your growth relies on new customers — and that is far less certain.""

But another reason for the slump in IPOs, analysts say, may be the unrealistic expectations of investors. The boom times of just a few years ago created the impression that public markets could ask for the moon — and get it. Yet as outlooks have softened, investors continue to expect sky-high payoffs from IPOs. As a result, plenty of companies that would like to go public find themselves struggling to generate the enthusiasm they need to do so successfully.

""We've had a very tough stretch in private markets, and some of it has been self-inflicted,"" says one Bay Area venture capitalist who wasn't authorized to speak on the record. ""The valuations of hot companies back in the 2021 time frame got so far ahead of themselves that a lot of them haven't even grown into those."" Translation: Companies overpriced themselves during the boom years — and investors continue to expect the astronomical growth rates they were promised, even though the numbers were never realistic in the first place.

So, what could spur a more robust market for IPOs? If the market manages to recover from its anxiety over Trump's tariffs, companies would likely need to lower their valuations, bringing them more in line with the post-boom era. That's what Klarna did back in 2022 when it raised money by cranking its valuation down to $6.7 billion — a staggering 85% decline from a year earlier. While the drop in valuation was painful for early investors, it set the stage for an IPO that was expected to be priced as high as $20 billion before the current market turmoil postponed the offering. If IPOs recover, analysts say, other companies may have to follow suit if they hope to attract jittery investors. ""Without taking some kind of a haircut or a big restructuring, it may be difficult for them to go public,"" says Kamran Ansari, a venture capitalist who was head of corporate development and strategy at Pinterest.

Despite the continued slump in IPOs, some investors are holding out that things will rebound in the second half of the year. ""We've got a very large pipeline of deals that have lined up to go public,"" says Kennedy. ""When markets recover, or at least stop falling, we'll have that backlog. I think we'll start to see activity emerge. I just don't know when.""

For weeks, the stars of ""The White Lotus"" have been tight-lipped about viewers' most burning question: Who dies?

That question was answered in the season three finale of the HBO hit, which aired on Sunday night — and some of the show's stars are finally getting to air their real feelings about their characters' fates.

Arguably no character has a more tragic arc in season three than Walton Goggins' long-suffering Rick. Rick arrives at the resort for a vacation with his younger girlfriend, Chelsea, but he's also there on a revenge mission against the man he believes killed his father.

Rick operates from pain and desperation. He's so obsessed with his past that he's often blind to the love Chelsea is offering him. In episodes seven and eight, he finally finds brief moments of absolution and lightness — moments of joy that are cut short when both he and Chelsea are killed off in the show's finale.

In the hours after the finale aired, Goggins took to Instagram to share a 235-word tribute to his character.

""Rick + Chelsea. With the heaviest of hearts… To me, ours was a love story. It was only ever a love story, hindered by unresolved, childhood trauma,"" Goggins wrote.

""We all have them… but can we move past them. In the depths of our despair there is always beauty around us. If we can sit with our pain, just sit with it… not react… not be defined by it…It's there… the love the world is constantly giving in any given moment is there,"" he continued.

A post shared by Walton Goggins (@waltongogginsbonafide)

Goggins thanked the show's creator, Mike White, writing, ""Thank you Mike White for your imagination, your tender heart, for the privilege of giving us the opportunity to tell it.""

He also thanked Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea, and Sam Rockwell, his scene mate and longtime friend.

The show was filmed over several months, primarily on the Thai island of Koh Samui. Wood told The Sunday Times that the cast accidentally found themselves going into Method acting during filming.

Season three featured both big names in Hollywood and some newcomers. Among the industry vets featured in this season are Parker Posey, Michelle Monaghan, and Jason Isaacs. The show pays all characters the same, non-negotiable salary.

Goggins' Instagram post after the finale aired drew reactions from fans, many of whom expressed love for the two ill-fated characters — and from at least one of his costars, Patrick Schwarzenegger.

""I'm crying,"" Schwarzenegger wrote on the post.

Anything crypto-related is frequently greeted with a high degree of skepticism. Within that, one of the most controversial companies for a long time has been Tether, the company behind the popular stablecoin USDT. But despite people predicting otherwise, the company has boomed. It's insanely profitable. It's one of the largest holders of US Treasuries in the world. And because of the change in the US administration, it's gathering fans in Washington, DC. In this episode, we speak with Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino about what it's like to run this business, how they work with law enforcement, future growth opportunities, and why, after all these years, it's still never had a formal audit.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Elon Musk's DOGE:

Credit unions, banks and nonprofits are alarmed by an executive order targeting Community Development Financial Institutions, which support projects in low-income areas.

Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. 

Banking usually doesn't make for great cinema unless a heist is involved. But one classic movie moment is the exception: the famous bank run scene in It's a Wonderful Life, in which a community rallies around a public-minded savings and loan. It's a poignant depiction of the powerful metaphor of community lending.

That ideal — local money funding local enterprise and development — explains the angst over a March 14 executive order by President Donald Trump that targeted, among other institutions, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. This bipartisan program provides capital for local credit unions and banks to help develop lower-income communities. Trump's directive ordered that the government corporation's functions be reduced to the statutory minimum required by law.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Future of B-Schools:

Nelson Amenya hoped to help establish better business practices in his native Kenya. But after calling out a lucrative government project, he might not have the option to return home.

Nelson Amenya in France on Feb. 13.

 When Nelson Amenya decided to enroll in HEC Paris business school in the fall of 2023, he thought the MBA program would provide a good education in how businesses are run and how the corporate world works. “It would give me an opportunity to move from midlevel management to the C-suite,” Amenya says. After more than four years working in retail in his native Kenya, where he felt he'd taken the job as far as he could, he was ready for a bigger challenge.

 Amenya also planned to take what he's learned in school back to his homeland, citing what he sees as a need for establishing good governance as Kenya's economy develops. “I want to see my country move away from tribal and kingpin politics,” he says. But once he receives his MBA in June, Amenya will have to be a force for good from afar. Last July he blew the whistle on a proposed $2 billion airport construction project in Nairobi involving Adani Group, triggering a chain of events that subsequently led to the deal's cancellation. (An Adani Group representative declined to comment.) As a result, Amenya says he has received threats that will keep him out of Kenya for the foreseeable future.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

With President Donald Trump insisting he won't back down from the barrage of tariffs unleashed last week, market professionals are gaming out worst-case scenarios for the companies most exposed to the levies. What they're expecting is grim.

The prospect of prolonged levies and the economic damage they will bring is so bleak for pricey technology stocks that Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth manager at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management said he wouldn't be surprised if some of the shares drop another 50%. He cited high tech company valuations and the expected hit to profits from the tariffs on imports. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

While the stock-market rout is accelerating around the world, measures of risk indicate the US is leading the way. 

The surge in the Cboe Volatility Index last week took the gauge of expectations for US equity moves to its highest level since the early Covid days of 2020 relative to similar measures from India, South Korea and Australia.

Attempts to rationalize slumping stock markets show how money managers mistook the president for their guy.

Donald Trump was expected to be positive for financial assets, a view that's being rapidly revised.

President Donald Trump's decision to hit America's trading partners with sweeping and clumsily designed tariffs is forcing investors to reassess their shared belief that his second term would be positive for financial assets and the economy. Hearing money managers try to rationalize this unravelling reveals a lot about how Wall Street got Trump so wrong.

While the president's populist tendencies and extreme views on trade were known risks, his wealthy backers were more focused on his promises to cut taxes and regulations. The inclusion of several billionaires in his administration instilled confidence he'd do little to jeopardize their stock market portfolios. Yet buoyed by his resounding election victory and surviving an assassination attempt, Trump seems willing to countenance a recession and higher inflation to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped more than 2% and 3%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell close to 1% and shares of Wingstop sank 3%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.

Few restaurant stocks were in the green. Shares of Dutch Bros., a fast-growing rival of Starbucks, rose more than 3% in morning trading after tumbling nearly 10% on Friday. Cava gained more than 3%, while Domino's Pizza rose slightly.

Ted Christie, CEO of Spirit Airlines, is stepping down from his role leading the embattled carrier, effective Monday, the company said.

A group of several company executives — Chief Financial Officer Fred Cromer, Chief Operating Officer John Bendoraitis and General Counsel Thomas Canfield — has been tapped to lead the airline until a successor is found.

Christie had been president and CEO of Spirit since 2019 and saw the airline through the Covid pandemic.

Spirit filed for bankruptcy protection in November after years of mounting losses, a failed merger, increased competition and more demanding consumer tastes.

The budget carrier, which had reshaped the industry with its no-frills tickets, was the first major U.S. airline to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy since 2011.

Spirit last month emerged from bankruptcy protection.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Monday that an offer by Vietnam to eliminate tariffs on U.S. imports would not be enough for the administration to lift its new levies announced last week.

""Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters,"" Navarro said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

The examples of nontariff ""cheating"" cited by Navarro included Chinese products being routed through Vietnam, intellectual property theft and a value-added tax.

The comments from Navarro come after President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the Monday interview, Navarro revised his statement to say that the offer of zero tariffs would be a ""small first start.""

Trump announced widespread tariffs last week that sparked a sharp sell-off in the stock market. Wall Street is watching closely for news about potential negotiations that could lead to those tariffs being reduced.

Vietnam is a manufacturing hub for many companies that sell products in the U.S., including apparel retailers like Nike. The Trump administration said it would apply a 46% levy to imports from that market. The VanEck Vietnam ETF (VNM) fell 10% on Thursday after the tariffs were announced.

A value-added tax is a system used by many countries around the world and is in some ways similar to sales taxes in the U.S. The Trump administration's argument that the tax should count as a trade barrier is not widely accepted.

""We have tried at the World Trade Organization since the 1970s to get VAT-tax relief, and they've told us no every single time,"" Navarro said Monday.

The trade advisor also said Monday that the value-added tax would be an issue in any negotiations around tariffs with the European Union.

This is CNBC's live coverage of how the White House, U.S. trade partners, industries and employers are responding to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.

What you need to know

CNBC's reporters are covering the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

Trump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden.

Trump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the acquisition again to assist ""in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate,"" according to a presidential action issued by the White House.

U.S. Steel shares spiked about 9% in reaction to the decision.

— Spencer Kimball

Restaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending.

Investors pulled back across restaurant segments, from fast food to full-service dining.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Read the full story.

— Amelia Lucas

U.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say.

The industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. And airline stocks have fallen as investor concerns have grown about Trump's tariff policies, among other things.

""The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be the reality six months from now,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said.

TD Cowen, in a note Friday wrote, ""We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist U.S. to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines.""

""We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers,"" TD Cowen said.

— Leslie Josephs and Michele Luhn

A large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC — 69% — said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump's sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week.

And more than half of them said they expect that the downturn will come this year.

""This is the Trump recession,"" said one of the 22 CEOs who received the flash survey.

""Disappointingly stupid and illogical,"" another CEO said of the tariffs.

— Kevin Breuninger

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy.

""Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters,"" Navarro said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" 

Those non-tariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said.

Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a ""small first start.""

— Jesse Pound

Tech stocks wobbled after Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans.

Apple shares have tumbled more than 5%, Tesla shares are down about 4% and Microsoft shares have slipped more than 1%. Shares of Google are mostly flat, but Amazon, Nvidia and Meta are all up around 1%.

The Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff last week. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onset of the pandemic and entered a bear market.

--Ashley Capoot and Samantha Subin

Trump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News.

Trump's golf rounds in Florida are like ""going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,"" the official said.

""The economy will be fine,"" the official said.

— Dan Mangan

Trump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports.

Trump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the ""reciprocal"" duties unveiled at the White House last week.

Trump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand.

China's action came ""despite my warning"" that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs ""will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,"" Trump wrote.

""Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Two Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Union President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU.

""Let's take that deal,"" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen's offer. ""Much to gain.""

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., replied in a tweet, writing, ""Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee.""

""At some point you have to take YES for an answer,"" Johnson wrote.

U.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump's latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella.

Trump announced blanket 34% tariffs on Beijing last week, which come on top of existing 20% duties on Chinese imports.

Trump's latest tariff action would slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods, unless China drops its 34% retaliatory tariff on the U.S.

— Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella

Billionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. ""will face ruin for years to come"" if the Trump administration does not immediately ""change course"" on its tariff policies.

""The US government can still turn things around, but it must act in the next few hours,"" the Virgin Group co-founder wrote on X.

""This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come,"" he wrote.

— Kevin Breuninger

The White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days.

""Fake news,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council.

Trump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, ""Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening.""

""President Trump is not going to bend,"" Bartiromo said in the video.

- Dan Mangan

Trump writes that it's ""not sustainable"" for the U.S. to ""lose $1.9 trillion on trade"" in a post just now on Truth Social.

Trump's post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can't lose money on trade ""and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations.""

— Erin Doherty

Tesla shares are trading around 20% lower than they were when Lutnick urged people to ""Buy Tesla"" last month.

Lutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News.

""It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap,"" Lutnick said. ""It'll never be this cheap again.""

As it turns out, it would be.

— Dan Mangan

Canada filed a dispute with the the World Trade Organization concerning Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts imported from Canada into the U.S.

Canada requested WTO dispute consultations with the U.S. concerning the new levies, the global trade organization said. The WTO says the request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the organization.

Consultations will give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO.

Canada claims the measures are inconsistent with the U.S.' obligations under various provisions of the ""General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade"" of 1994.

People who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November's election — and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market.

CNBC's All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters. 

And of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock.

— Dan Mangan

Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk's swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO's trade views and those of the Trump administration.

Navarro told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro ""ain't built s---.""

Musk appeared to delete that post.

But Musk kept up another post that said ""a PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing,"" a shot at Navarro's alma mater.

""I'll probably see him today in the Oval. It's no big deal,"" Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk's comments.

Navarro praised Musk's work with DOGE on slashing government spending.

However, he then took a swipe at the billionaire.

""When it comes to tariffs and trade,"" Navarro said, Musk ""is a car manufacturer — but he's not a car manufacturer, he's a car assembler.""

Navarro noted that parts of the Tesla cars assembled at its Texas plant are from overseas.

""What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis,"" he said.

— Kevin Breuninger

""Countries from all over the World are talking to us,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, and ""tough but fair parameters are being set.""

Trump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and ""he is sending a top team to negotiate.""

""They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs,"" Trump says in the post, adding, ""it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!""

— Erin Doherty

Europe will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariffs.

""Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing.

""So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners."" 

Von der Leyen mentioned existing deals with Mexico and Switzerland, and potential deals with India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Europe stands ready to respond to Trump's aggressive tariff agenda with counter measures if necessary, she said, but the region still stands ""ready to negotiate"" with the U.S. if possible.

— April Roach

Top White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump's plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all.

""Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won't take long,"" Navarro said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

He then pointed to the first Trump administration securing protective equipment faster than expected at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

""So don't tell me that America doesn't have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff,"" he said.

A CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more.

— Kevin Breuninger

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump's tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.

Dimon addresses the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, which has become closely read.

""Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, there are some – or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects,"" Dimon writes.

 ""We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.""

""Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,"" he adds.

Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.

His remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should ""get over"" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.

— Hugh Son

Elon Musk posted a video on X of Milton Friedman advocating for free trade, in one of the strongest examples yet of the billionaire SpaceX founder's break with Trump on tariffs.

Over the weekend, Musk publicly criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro.

He also said said he hopes Europe and the U.S. can move ""to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone,"" during a virtual appearance at a meeting of Italy's far-right League party.

Musk's comments were at odds with Trump's hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports.

Musk is Trump's biggest campaign donor and the leader of DOGE, Trump's massive effort to slash the federal workforce.

Trump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months. 

— Erin Doherty

Markets across the globe continue to crash for a third day as a result of Trump's tariffs.

Taiwan:

Japan:

China:

Kuwait:

Norway:

— Adam Jeffrey

Ackman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being ""indifferent"" to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it.

""It was unfair of me to lash out at @howardlutnick,"" writes Ackman.

""I don't think he is pursuing his self interest. I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don't know how the sausage was made.""

The new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.

""I just figured out why @howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes,"" Ackman wrote Sunday night.

""It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It's an irreconcilable conflict of interest.""

— Kevin Breuninger

Trump is touting the steep drop in oil prices — driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession — as a policy win.

""Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,"" Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post.

""This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate,"" he writes. ""They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!""

Trump also blames America's past leaders for ""allowing this"" to happen.

— Christina Wilkie

Trump has two significant public events on his schedule today.

11:00 a.m. ET: Trump will host the World Series-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House, according to his official schedule.

2:30 p.m. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House. 

The last time Netanyahu visited the White House was in February, as the U.S. worked to finalize the second phase of a cease fire deal in Gaza. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza.  

CNBC's latest CEO survey finds that a majority of the CEOs polled say they now expect a recession before the end of the year. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate.

One in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump's tariff policies.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that tariffs announced by President Donald Trump last week will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.

Dimon, 69, addressed the tariff policy Trump announced on April 2 in his annual shareholder letter, which has become a closely read screed on the state of the economy, proposals for the issues facing the U.S. and his take on effective management.

""Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs – and, of course, there are some – or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects,"" Dimon said. ""We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.""

""Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,"" he said.

Dimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets tumble.

Though the JPMorgan chairman has often used his platform to highlight geopolitical and financial risks he sees, this year's letter comes at an unusually turbulent time. Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's announcement shocked global markets, causing the worst week for U.S. equities since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020.

His remarks appear to backtrack earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said people should ""get over"" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.

Trump's tariff policy has created ""many uncertainties,"" including its effect on global capital flows and the dollar, the impact to corporate profits and the response from trading partners, Dimon said.

""The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,"" he said. ""In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel's back.""

While the U.S. economy has performed well for the past few years, helped by nearly $11 trillion in government borrowing and spending, it was ""already weakening"" in recent weeks, even before Trump's tariff announcement, according to Dimon. Inflation is likely to be stickier than many anticipate, meaning that interest rates could remain elevated even as the economy slows, he added.

""The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,"" Dimon said.

The JPMorgan CEO has been sounding a note of caution since at least 2022, when he said a ""hurricane"" was heading for the U.S. economy, thanks to the unwinding of Federal Reserve policies and the Ukraine war. But propped up by high government and consumer spending, the U.S. economy defied expectations until now. The election of Trump in November initially boosted hopes around what a pro-growth administration would do.

Dimon struck a somewhat ominous note in his letter Monday, considering how much U.S. stocks have already fallen from their recent highs. According to the CEO, both stocks and credit spreads were still potentially too optimistic.

""Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing,"" Dimon said. ""I am not so sure.""

Under Dimon's roughly two decades of leadership, JPMorgan has become the largest U.S. bank by assets and market capitalization. Last year was its seventh in a row of record revenue, he noted.

But the bank is reliant on ""whether the long-term health of America, domestically, and the future of the free and democratic world are strong,"" Dimon said. Both the U.S. and world are at a ""critical crossroads,"" he said.

While the word ""Trump"" didn't appear once in his 59-page letter, Dimon affirmed several of the president's priorities, including immigration; addressing trade imbalances, especially with China; and deregulation.

But Dimon argued for deep reform and strengthening of a global system that has led to decades of peace and prosperity, led by America since the end of World War II, rather than abandoning that order.

""If given the opportunity, that is exactly what our adversaries want to happen: Tear asunder the extensive military and economic alliances that America and its allies have forged,"" Dimon said.

""In the multipolar world that follows, it will be every nation for itself – giving our adversaries the opportunity to set the rules and use military and economic coercion to get what they want.""

Dimon had several prescriptions to meet the challenges of the day, including restoring civic pride, acknowledging and addressing problems including immigration and unfair trade policies with common sense, and maintaining the U.S. military ""at whatever cost.""

""Economics is the longtime glue, and America First is fine,"" Dimon said, ""as long as it doesn't end up being America alone.""

Nintendo on Wednesday unveiled details for the Switch 2. It'll include a bigger screen and controllers and is a faster version than its predecessor, which sold more than 150 million units since its 2017 release.

The Switch 2 will hit store shelves on June 5 for $449.99, up from $300 for the original Switch. Like the first Switch, gamers will be able to use the Switch 2 as both a handheld console and hook it up to a television. Nintendo on Friday said it would delay preorders for the device following President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs.""

The device will launch with the game ""Mario Kart World."" Other games coming for the Switch 2 include ""Donkey Kong Bananza,"" ""Street Fighter 6,"" ""The Duskbloods"" and ""Kirby Air Riders.""

Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser sat down with technology correspondent Steve Kovach in a CNBC exclusive interview on April 2 after unveiling the new console's details. Bowser touched on the technology boosts in the Switch 2, upcoming games, the future of Nintendo's efforts in film and entertainment beyond video games, and what Trump's new tariffs mean for console prices in the U.S.Watch the video for the full interview.

In this article

Technology stocks teetered in volatile trading Monday as President Donald Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans following last week's devastating selloff.

The Magnificent Seven stocks —  Nvidia, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet — were largely lower after briefly rallying amid a short-lived broader market attempt to stage a rebound. Stocks temporarily  jumped on speculation of a possibly delay in the tariffs, but the White House later dismissed talk of a pause.

The technology sector is coming off a brutal week. The Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onslaught of the pandemic and entered a bear market.

Trump held firm on his aggressive global tariffs plans over the weekend, with an initial unilateral 10% tariff going into effect Saturday. Wall Street hoped for progress on negotiations between the administration and other countries or news of a possible delay in reciprocal tariffs slated for April 9.

The plan has already received widespread backlash in corporate America. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that the new levies will hike prices on domestic and imported goods and pressure the slowing U.S. economy. Many car companies have already announced a pause in shipments, price hikes and other measures. Trade groups have also warned of higher prices at the grocery store and hikes on electronics such as personal computers.

""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, downplaying the recent market meltdown.

Other technology stocks also looked to build on last week's pain. Oracle and Palantir Technologies declined more than 2% each.

Some semiconductor stocks also struggled as investors fretted over potential demand destruction stemming from the tariffs. Advanced Micro Devices was last down about 4% each, while Intel declined more than 2%.

European Union leaders urged a calm response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs that have battered global markets, days after a more bellicose China pulled the trigger on retaliation.

""The reaction to the tariff war was predictable. The stock market earthquake from Japan through Europe to America must be survived without nervous decisions,"" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Monday in a Google-translated social media update. ""The Polish stock market also got a ricochet, but political and economic stability are our assets in this difficult time. We will calmly persevere!""

Germany's acting Economy Minister Robert Habeck likewise on Monday pleaded for a ""calm and united"" European riposte, noting regional countries cannot solve the matter on their own, according to Reuters. His comments marked a more sedate response from his previous reassurance last week that Trump will ""buckle under pressure"" if Europe joins forces over tariffs.

Their comments arrive as European stocks plunged by another 4.2% at 11:35 a.m. London time, amid heightened danger of lower U.S. demand for European goods and of recessionary risks in the world's foremost economy.

Poland and Germany are among the 27 nations slapped with 20% reciprocal tariffs under Trump's measures targeting the European Union, revealed last week alongside a broader spate of other sweeping global duties.

The two countries face different impacts: export-reliant Germany which places goods worth 157.9 billion euros ($173 billion) transatlantic, is set to bear the brunt of levies in its already languishing auto sector.

Tusk meanwhile previously said the Polish economy could suffer a 0.4% gross direct product (GDP) hit as a result of Washington's latest duties, while the Polish Economic Institute stressed in analysis that U.S. demand contributes just 2.6% of the national GDP, but that tariffs posed a broader indirect risk to the country and could place burden on individual sectors through growing economic uncertainty.

Looking at Central & Eastern European countries, ING analysts assessed that ""the US-EU trade war alone wouldn't bring down the entire CEE economy via the export channel"" but noted lingering danger from imported and perceived inflation.

""And perceived inflation is a silent threat: by reducing consumer confidence, it will increase savings and kill any momentum in consumption growth. With the region just emerging from a cost-of-living problem (or crisis in some cases, like Hungary), the spillover of perceived inflation into weaker consumption via the confidence channel is something we need to monitor,"" they said, also flagging potential negative impact on Western European foreign direct investment.

""This void could quickly be filled by Chinese investors, which could provide some positive stimulus but also create further headaches for the European Commission and expose recipient countries to EU-China trade tensions,"" they said.

The EU's response remains under question, amid recent warnings from Goldman Sachs that the Trump tariffs could deliver a total trade-related hit of 0.7% to the euro zone's GDP this year, and Deutsche Bank analysts saying the White House measures could knock between 0.4-0.7 percentage points off the EU's economic output and warning of impact on labor markets and ""indirect costs from abroad, including a meaningful increase in recession risk in the US.""

So far, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has pledged the bloc's readiness for ""further countermeasures"" in an initial response, should talks fail — with Reuters reporting the union could be preparing an imminent counterstrike. Europe's reticence stands in contrast to the approaches of Canada and China, which have both enforced retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump's protectionist trade policies in recent months.

Amid an intensifying trade war and bloodbath in U.S. and global markets, Trump on Sunday reassured that he doesn't ""want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" after previously standing by the imposition of tariffs to reduce the U.S.' trade deficit with counterparties.

U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and subsequent actions by other nations have cast a shadow over investors' portfolios. Markets largely fell all around the world following the announcements, and the sell-off has extended into Monday. Trump and his administration has been defiant, with the U.S. president saying ""it won't be easy"" and urging Americans to ""hang tough"" in a Truth Social post late Friday. Over the weekend, the European Union was reported to also be readying tariffs, targeting up to $28 billion of U.S. imports, marking the latest escalation in this conflict. China and Canada had also announced retaliatory measures last week. With such market losses, a predicted rise in consumer prices, and an increased risk of a recession from tariffs, it is admittedly hard to see what ""victory"" looks like for Trump who said in 2018 that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win!""

— Lim Hui Jie

Markets set to extend losses U.S. stock futures dropped on Monday morning, portending a third day of losses after a two-day historic stock market rout. Dow Jones Industrial average futures fell 1,033 points, or 2.68%, pointing to another brutal session ahead on Monday. S&P 500 futures shed 3.34%. Nasdaq-100 futures lost 4.26% as investors continued to shed their one-time tech winners to raise cash. Asia-Pacific markets extended their sell-off on Monday as fears over a global trade war fueled a risk-off mood. Hong Kong markets led losses in the region, with the Hang Seng Index declining 10.37%. Mainland China's CSI 300 fell 6.31%.

Japanese yen and Swiss franc top hedges against tariffsU.S. President Donald Trump's fresh of swathe reciprocal tariffs has pushed investors toward safe haven assets. The Japanese yen, Swiss franc, bonds, as well as a few other ""exotic"" assets, have emerged as some of their top hedges.

Crypto joins market routBitcoin fell below the $79,000 level Sunday as investors braced for more financial market volatility. The cryptocurrency is down 15% in 2025 and, absent a crypto-specific catalyst, is expected to continue moving in tandem with equities as global recession fears overshadow any regulatory tailwinds crypto was expected to benefit from this year.

'Tariffs are coming': Commerce Secretary LutnickCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the White House will not postpone the April 9 start date for reciprocal tariffs. Speaking to CBS's ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Lutnick said, ""they are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,"" adding ""the president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit."" 

Bessent dismisses recession fears Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday dismissed concerns Americans might be having about a potential impending recession and the status of their retirement plans, saying that President Donald Trump and his administration are ""building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity."" Speaking to NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Bessent called it a ""false narrative"" that Americans who are close to retiring may be reticent to do so after their retirement savings may have dropped this week due to the stock market downturn. ""In fact, most Americans don't have everything in the market,"" Bessent added.

[PRO]

Berkshire Hathaway weathers market routWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway fared better than the S&P 500 in a brutal week as investors embraced the safety of a cash-rich conglomerate, seeing softer losses compared to the broad market index. Domestically-oriented Berkshire, which also owns large manufacturing, energy and retail businesses, is still up about 8% this year.

China says 'market has spoken' after Trump tariffs spark global stocks rout

China's Foreign Ministry on Saturday said ""the market has spoken"" following the U.S. imposition of sweeping new tariffs and called for the White House to defuse the escalating trade war through ""equal-footed consultation.""This comes as U.S. markets fell sharply for a second consecutive day on Friday, with all three major indexes dropping by more than 5% as part of a global rout.

The market turmoil was exacerbated on Friday when China's Finance Ministry announced it would impose a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S. starting on April 10.

For the first time ever, bitcoin's (BTC) hashrate hit 1 zettahash (1 ZH/s) on Friday, according to data from Glassnode. The previous record was set on Jan. 31, when the network hit 975 exahashes per second (EH/s). 

Bitcoin first reached 1 EH/s in 2016 — a milestone that's now been multiplied 1,000 times.

CoinDesk research published on April 3 noted that the hashrate was climbing to record levels, even as bitcoin's price remained disconnected from this trend. Since then, the price has fallen another 10%, driven in part by President Trump's tariffs, and is now hovering around $77,000.

As the research pointed out, analyzing the hashrate on a 24-hour timeframe can be misleading due to natural block time variability, which is how the record occurred. More accurate insights typically come from using longer-term averages, such as the 7-day moving average, which puts the hashrate at 879 EH/s. Nonetheless, it's important to note that the milestone is historic.

As of Sunday, bitcoin's difficulty adjustment increased by nearly 7%, pushing the difficulty adjustment to an all-time high at 121.5 trillion (T). This marks the largest upward adjustment since July 2024. While the last 17 adjustments, 14 have been positive, according to Glassnode data. This mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be mined approximately every 10 minutes, maintaining network consistency.

Meanwhile, miner revenue per exahash or knows as hashprice—a metric estimating daily income relative to hash power—has fallen to an all-time low of $42.40. This decline is driven by a combination of low transaction fees, rising network difficulty, and a relatively low bitcoin price.

Strategy is not expecting a first-quarter profit, given billions of dollars in unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings, the company said on Monday.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm—formerly known as MicroStrategy—said the value of its Bitcoin holdings fell $5.91 billion on paper in the first quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our digital assets,” the company said, adding that a $1.69 billion tax benefit should partially offset its unrealized losses in the first quarter.

Over the past week, Strategy did not purchase any more Bitcoin, leaving its holdings unchanged at 528,185 Bitcoin, worth around $41.3 billion. In the first quarter, Strategy spent $7.7 billion on Bitcoin, scooping the asset up for an average price of around $95,000 per coin.

As U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have battered risk-on assets, Bitcoin's price has dropped to a five-month low. Around noon Eastern Time, the leading digital asset was changing hands around $78,200, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Since Strategy started buying Bitcoin in 2020, the company has spent $35.6 billion on the asset, acquiring it for an average price of $67,485 per Bitcoin, according to Saylor Tracker. Based on that average Bitcoin price, Strategy is up around 16.5% on its bet.

Strategy has taken on $8.2 billion worth of debt to buy more Bitcoin than it could otherwise, while issuing products like convertible debt and perpetual preferred stock. Between its so-called “Strife” and “Strike” offerings, Strategy is required to pay $146 million in dividends annually.

Before it became a Bitcoin-buying machine, Strategy was known for its enterprise analytics software business, which “has not generated positive cash flow” in recent periods and may not help it satisfy its financial obligations, according to the company.

In order to fulfill its financial obligations, Strategy said it plans to take on more debt, issuing common shares, or conduct more offerings of preferred stock and convertible debt.

Strategy hasn't had a profitable quarter since the company posted an earnings per share of $0.32 on $124 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to Macrotrends.

On Monday, Strategy shares fell 10.6% to $262, according to Yahoo Finance. While notably off from last year's peak of $543, it was still above its Election Day price of $233.

A widely followed analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) could break out of its slump with a massive counter-trend rally.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 890,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical trends, a huge test is coming for the top crypto asset by market cap, one that could see it skyrocket after it dips to its 2024 highs near the $72,000 level.

According to Cowen, BTC has immediate support near the March 2024 highs, but may also tap a previous downward resistance line currently at around $60,000.

“I'm still thinking that there's a good chance that Bitcoin will retest the 2024 high, and if it tests that trend line, sort of the lower high trend line, it would probably be a good short-term trade.

If it were to test that trend line all the way down, [it] would be a really good short-term trade by Bitcoin. You probably get a massive counter-trend rally off of that level, but I wouldn't necessarily be that optimistic for the remainder of the cycle if it were to in fact play out like that.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $75,366, down nearly 8% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum has extended its downtrend, setting fresh lows around $1,400 — a level not seen since early 2023. The continuation of selling pressure has shaken market sentiment, with many investors fearing that the worst is still ahead. Ethereum, down over 65% from its 2024 highs, has failed to find a solid support level amid broad market weakness and growing macroeconomic uncertainty.

Despite the bearish outlook, some analysts believe a turning point may be near. According to top analyst Ted Pillows, Ethereum is now deep in a capitulation phase. He suggests that while there may still be one final 5%–10% dump left in the tank — particularly given the recent weakness in equities — the broader market structure may be setting the stage for a rebound.

Pillows points to a potential Federal Reserve pivot as a key catalyst. With traditional markets under pressure and volatility rising, a shift in monetary policy could bring relief. Historically, changes in the Fed's stance have provided a strong boost to risk assets. If support from policymakers emerges, Ethereum could stabilize and begin recovering from its recent lows — but not before weathering one last wave of fear and uncertainty.

Ethereum Capitulation Deepens, But Fed Pivot Could Spark Rebound

Ethereum is trading at $1,450 after suffering a sharp 20% decline in just hours, marking one of its steepest drops this year. The panic-driven selloff has shaken investor confidence, with fear now dominating the market. Ethereum, once expected to lead the altcoin rally in 2025, has failed to deliver on those expectations. Instead, it continues to disappoint as bearish momentum builds and selling pressure intensifies.

Wider market conditions are adding to the pain. Trade war tensions, policy uncertainty from the US President Donald Trump administration, and mounting fears of a global recession are dragging both equities and crypto lower. With the S&P 500 already down sharply, the fear of a broader financial contagion is rising.

Pillows' analysis supports that Ethereum's current plunge reflects a full-blown capitulation. However, he suggests that the market could be nearing a turning point. “Maybe there's one last dump left, but after that, it'll bounce,” Pillows said. The key reason? A likely pivot from the Federal Reserve.

Pillows points to a potential Federal Reserve pivot as the catalyst. With the S&P 500 down over 10% in just two days and volatility rising, any further drop could force an emergency Fed response. Historically, rate cuts and renewed quantitative easing (QE) have been bullish for risk assets like Ethereum. If a pivot arrives, Ethereum could quickly bounce from current levels — but only after one final shakeout.

Ethereum Slides To $1,410 As Bears Maintain Control

Ethereum has plunged to $1,410 after losing the crucial $1,800 support level, triggering a wave of aggressive selling and panic across the market. With no clear support zone immediately below current levels, bearish momentum appears firmly in control as ETH struggles to find footing. The breakdown below $1,800 marked a major technical failure, erasing confidence among traders and accelerating downside pressure.

For now, the path of least resistance remains to the downside. If sentiment doesn't stabilize soon, Ethereum could continue sliding into lower demand zones, possibly retesting levels not seen since early 2022. The lack of a defined support structure beneath current prices leaves ETH exposed to more volatility in the near term.

However, hope remains for a recovery — but it hinges on a swift reclaim of the $1,800 level. A strong bounce back above this mark could signal that capitulation is complete and invite renewed buying interest from sidelined investors. Until then, Ethereum remains vulnerable, and any upside attempts will likely face resistance unless backed by broader market strength or a decisive macro shift. Bulls have a narrow window to flip the momentum before deeper losses set in.

Written By: 





A whale's Ethereum worth $105 million was liquidated after ETH dropped $1,650, despite the whale adding 2,160 ETH to delay the liquidation.

Ethereum faced intensified selling pressure in the past 24 hours, resulting in a sharp 19% decline that brought its price down to $1,460. Over the past month, ETH has dropped by 30%, driven by broader macroeconomic concerns. 

This steep descent has unsettled the market and triggered significant liquidation events, including the collapse of a massive whale position tied to a $105 million collateralized loan.

In an attempt to rescue his position, a whale holding a 67,500 ETH collateralized loan with a $1,650 liquidation threshold added new collateral early in the morning. 

The wallet added 2,160.52 ETH in three separate transactions: 1000.25 ETH, 1000 ETH, and 160 ETH. This effort slightly improved the collateral ratio from 152.13% to 160.25%. However, the new ratio remained dangerously close to the liquidation threshold of approximately 145%.

The price of ETH continued to slide, falling below the critical $1,650 mark. This drop activated liquidation protocols on the loan. Over the next hour, multiple automated actions occurred, starting with the liquidation of approximately 32,106 ETH to cover 35.3 million DAI.

A second liquidation of roughly 32,076 ETH against the same DAI value followed, and smaller liquidations were recorded again. These events totally liquidated the 67,500 ETH position, fully repaying a 74.4 million DAI loan.

With this wave of decline, the whale position of 67,500 ETH ($105 million) loan position liquidation line at $1,650 was completely liquidated, which also contributed to the further decline of ETH. He also added 2,160 ETH of collateral to lower the liquidation line. @EmberCN…

— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 7, 2025



While one position was fully liquidated, another whale narrowly avoided a similar fate by adjusting their holdings just in time. This second position originally held 57,000 ETH with a liquidation price set at $1,564. The market drop pushed ETH close to that threshold, posing a serious risk of forced liquidation.

Roughly 90 minutes before hitting that margin, the wallet sold 3,920.8 ETH and exchanged it for 5.775 million DAI. This move helped reduce the overall position size and lowered the liquidation price. 

Now holding 53,000 ETH, the adjusted liquidation threshold sits at $1,495, still within a vulnerable range given ongoing market volatility.

Home » News » Crypto News

The Ethereum network has reached a historic milestone with 200,000 addresses holding stablecoins. This record adoption is establishing itself as the backbone of a more mature digital economy, potentially reshuffling the cards for this altcoin whose price struggles to take off.

Ethereum has just crossed a historic threshold: more than 200,000 unique addresses now hold stablecoins. This steady progression since mid-2023, peaking at the end of March 2025, reveals a profound transformation in the use of blockchain.

Unlike previous bullish cycles marked by speculation, the adoption of stablecoins follows a stable and sustainable trajectory. USDT dominates the market, while USDC and DAI are gradually gaining ground.

This figure of 200,000 addresses takes on great importance when considering that it represents a significant share of users who are truly active on Ethereum.

Indeed, the number of truly operational addresses is much lower than the total number of created addresses, and this massive adoption of stablecoins reflects an ecosystem that is maturing and turning towards practical uses.

The accelerated adoption of stablecoins on Ethereum reflects the unique power of this blockchain as a programmable finance platform. Its technical robustness, combined with the most developed DeFi ecosystem, makes it the ideal ground for the rise of stable digital currencies.

In a crypto market known for its volatility, stablecoins offer a haven of stability necessary for daily transactions, capital preservation, and as a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto universe.

This stability has become essential to attract new users who are less inclined to endure the extreme fluctuations of assets like bitcoin or Ethereum itself.

The rise of stablecoins also brings considerable liquidity to decentralized exchange platforms and lending protocols, thereby strengthening the entire ecosystem.

This increased liquidity facilitates more efficient transactions and paves the way for more accessible and less costly cross-border financial services than traditional solutions.

However, this rise is not without challenges. Regulators' attention is intensifying, particularly regarding the transparency of reserves and compliance with anti-money laundering rules.

Moreover, competing blockchains like Solana and Base are gaining ground in the stablecoin ecosystem, offering alternatives with lower fees and faster transactions.

This record adoption of stablecoins comes at a paradoxical time for Ethereum. While the blockchain is going through a tough period with a continuous drop in its price and a decline in activity, the growing interest in stablecoins could serve as a catalyst for recovery.

The upcoming Pectra update, scheduled for May 7, 2025, could also play a crucial role in this dynamic. By improving the capabilities of the blockchain and reducing transaction costs, it could make the use of stablecoins even more attractive on Ethereum.

The bearish sentiments across the markets have been intensified as Bitcoin marks range below $75,000 and Ethereum below $1500

The growing fear among the market participants is increasing the selling pressure that could drag the levels to the bottoms, offering a strong entry point

Meanwhile, altcoins like EOS and FARTCOIN remain within the bullish range and hence are believed to trigger a strong rebound soon

The global markets plummet as the tariff war escalates after Donald Trump's Liberation Day. The stock markets across the globe, including the US, Japan, China, Taiwan, the UK, and many more, have opened on a huge bearish note. While many refer to it as Black Monday, experts believe the bearish influence may settle soon. With this, crypto markets are also expected to recover, and this could be when these altcoins may make a strong move. 

The EOS price has been demonstrating massive strength in the last few days of Q1 2025, but the token faced a 20% pullback after entering the crucial resistance zone between $0.82 and $0.88. Despite the plunge below the multi-month ascending trend line, the price remains within a bullish zone. Hence, it holds the possibility of a strong recovery upright. 

The EOS price has dropped significantly, but a potential ascending trend seems to be imminent. The price is testing the crucial support at the 200-day MA at $0.677, and even if it loses the 50-day MA at $0.588, it may offer a strong base. Therefore, the EOS price is expected to trigger a strong rebound as the volume has surged notably, which reflects the increased trading activity. 

The global market conditions have failed to heavily impact the FARTCOIN price, which is attracting the significant attention of the market participants. The bulls are trying hard to revive a rebound, which could elevate the levels back to $0.6 very soon. However, volume remains low, which could adversely impact the pace of recovery. 

As seen in the above chart, the Bollinger Bands have begun to squeeze, citing the drop in volume and volatility. Moreover, the 50-day MA is offering a strong base, which collides with the lower bands of Bollinger. Therefore, the FARTCOIN price is expected to trigger a rebound or else may drop to test the support levels and later trigger a rebound.

The bulls seem to have entered the markets and are utilizing the ‘buy at dip' opportunity well. However, the Bitcoin price has triggered a decent recovery, and if it rises above $78,000, the path towards a strong recovery may be activated. Otherwise, a plunge below $72,800 could further drag the entire crypto markets lower.

Bitcoin hovered below the $77,000 level in early Monday trading as the broader crypto market downturn deepened. Losses extended across altcoins, with major ones like Ether, XRP, and Solana suffering double-digit losses ahead of the US stock market opening.

Bitcoin fell below $75,000 today, its lowest level since November, as crypto markets tumbled amid growing concerns over President Trump's new global tariff policies impacting Asian markets, CoinGecko data shows.

The crypto market selloff intensified with major altcoins posting severe losses.

Ether dropped 17% to trade under $1,400, levels not seen in March 2023. The sharp price drop forced the liquidation of an Ethereum whale, who suffered losses surpassing $100 million.

XRP declined 16% to $1.7, with its market cap falling to $102 million and losing its position among the top three crypto assets. Solana and Dogecoin each fell 16%, while Cardano dropped 15%.

Binance Coin and TRON showed more resilience, declining 8% and 6% respectively. The total crypto market capitalization decreased by over 10% to $2.5 trillion, representing approximately $100 billion in lost value within 10 hours.

The decline coincided with sharp falls on Asian stock markets. Taiwan's benchmark index plunged nearly 10%, its largest single-day drop since 1990.

Shares of major Taiwanese companies like TSMC and Foxconn tumbled nearly 10%, triggering automatic trading halts. In response, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) introduced temporary short-selling restrictions in an effort to stabilize the market.

The ripple effect was felt across the region. Japan's Nikkei index plunged over 8% on April 7, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index sank roughly 12%. China's CSI 300 Index also dropped sharply, falling 7%.

In South Korea, the Kospi shed more than 5% early in the session, prompting a five-minute circuit breaker. Singapore's Straits Times Index wasn't spared either, slipping nearly 8%.

Markets in Australia and New Zealand followed the downtrend. The ASX 200 in Australia dropped 6.3%, and New Zealand's NZX 50 slid more than 3.5%.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, said Monday he's been actively purchasing Bitcoin while maintaining a cautious stance on altcoins.

“Been nibbling on $BTC all day, and shall continue,” Hayes said, indicating an ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy amid market volatility.

The analyst points to cheaper altcoins but expects Bitcoin's dominance – its share of the total crypto market cap – to increase towards 70%, implying Bitcoin's market-leading gains.

“Shitcoins are getting in our strike zone,” he said, “but I think #bitcoin dominance keeps zooming towards 70%. So we are not gorging at the shitcoin supermarket.”

Hayes reiterated that the catalyst for Bitcoin's growth is the central banks' continued use of monetary stimulus in response to economic slowdowns.

Highlights

Satoshi Street is witnessing a major selloff as the crypto market crash in response to escalating global tensions triggered by Trump's renewed tariff war. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have dropped 6–12% in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations exceeding $900 million. The steep correction has prompted analysts to question Bitcoin's “digital gold” narrative and its reliability as a hedge amid growing volatility.

On Monday morning in Asian trading hours, crypto market crashed as risk-ON assets faced heavy volatility. Top markets like China, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, hit circuit breakers in the early trading hours on Monday, with their indexes crashing 10%, sending the global markets into a situation of absolute turmoil.

Bitcoin price is down 6.9% in the last 24 hours, trading at the crucial support of $77,500, with daily trading volumes up by a staggering 220% to more than $44 billion. As per the Coinglass data, BTC's 24-hour liquidations have surged to $322 million. Based on the Bitcoin technical chart, $77,500 is a crucial support level for BTC. If it fails to hold these levels, further correction could be deeper.

Although Bitcoin price showed resilience to the Dow Jones crash last week, it is down by 7% today. However, it is still performing better as Asian indices are down 9-10% today. On the other hand, precious metals are up, as gold prices shot up $80 earlier today, and silver has an upward trajectory as well. Following today's crypto market crash, Peter Schiff took the opportunity to add:

“After a delayed reaction on Friday, crypto is finally starting to crack. Ether has already fallen to its lowest level since Oct. 2023, down 65% from its peak, and Bitcoin just traded below 81K, taking out last week's low. It could be a long day for those trapped in Bitcoin ETFs”.

As Donald Trump's tariff war increases odds of US recession, debates over Bitcoin's “digital gold” status have picked up once again. Long-term players still continue to remain bullish about BTC despite this volatility. Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise Investments, noted:

“As nations trust each other less. As corporations have more difficulty doing business. A global, digital, apolitical store of value — controlled by no nation — looks increasingly differentiated. Bitcoin's place in the world has never been more valuable”.

The altcoins market correction has extended further with Ethereum (ETH) price crashing 13.5% at press time and plummeting to $1,550. As a result, the world's largest acltoin has extended its 2025 losses to more than 53% while leaving investors in a complete state of shock. Investors believe that ETH price crash today leaves the gates open for the $1,100-$1,300 range. However, on-chain data from Spot On Chain shows that whales are buying the ETH price dips.

Whales are buying $ETH during the dip in the past 12 hours as the market crashed!

1️⃣ The mystery group “7 Siblings” spent $42.66M to buy 25,100 $ETH at ~$1,700, then supplied all tokens to #Aave.

2️⃣ Whale “0x709” borrowed 8.25M $DAI from #Spark to buy 5,227.3 $ETH at ~$1,578.… pic.twitter.com/hQZBpfPT7F

Other altcoins have faced a drop of a similar magnitude. XRP price is down 14.5%, dropping under the crucial $2 support, while analysts predict a further crash to $0.65 ahead. Solana price is also down today by 14% to $102 levels, while Dogecoin price has plummeted 16% to $0.143 levels.

Crypto markets have been flipping the script again. Bitcoin is teasing those all-time highs, and suddenly every altcoin looks like it's waking up from hibernation. Whale activity is back, and major players are throwing serious money at projects with real utility. With the next bull run potentially around the corner, smart community members are scouring the market for the best altcoins to buy for next bull run—and there's no shortage of contenders.

What sets Qubetics ($TICS) apart is how it's fixing one of crypto's biggest headaches—blockchain interoperability. It's not just slapping together buzzwords but offering a real-world solution that's already grabbing attention. Alongside Qubetics, Render and Theta are pushing their own tech limits, giving this list some serious heavy hitters ready to shine when the market explodes. Let's dive into the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Qubetics is making waves by solving one of blockchain's nastiest problems—getting separate networks to talk to each other. Its interoperability framework is built to make data, assets, and applications move seamlessly between blockchains, unlocking a whole new level of utility.

Think about a Toronto-based NFT creator wanting to sell digital art on a Solana marketplace while their assets sit on Ethereum. With Qubetics, they don't need a middleman or deal with double fees. The platform's AI-driven QubeQode IDE handles it, shifting assets across networks without breaking a sweat. Or picture a North Carolina logistics firm wanting to manage shipments on VeChain but needing payments processed on Polygon. Qubetics makes that combo possible—smooth, fast, and secure.



For small businesses, professionals, and regular folks tired of getting stuck in one ecosystem, this is a game-changer. It means no more worrying if a project's on the wrong chain or missing out on opportunities because of network limitations.

Right now, the Qubetics crypto presale is lighting up the scene. It's in stage 29, and over 506 million $TICS tokens are already out there, snapped up by more than 24,300 holders. The presale pulled in a solid $15.8 million. And here's the kicker: $TICS is still sitting at just $0.1573 per token.

Analysts aren't holding back either. If $TICS touches $1 post-presale, backers are looking at a 535% ROI. A $5 jump spikes it to 3,078%. At $6, it's a wild 3,713%. Some see it blasting to $10 or even $15 once the mainnet drops—which would mean 6,256% to 9,434% returns. Try finding another project throwing down numbers like that.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics isn't just a whitepaper fantasy. Its real-world interoperability solution is built for the long haul, making it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Render has been turning heads in the digital art and AI scene. With more demand for graphics rendering than ever—from Hollywood studios to indie game developers—Render's decentralized GPU network steps in where traditional services choke.

Lately, Render's been scoring major partnerships and expanding its use cases. The platform's supporting AI-generated content, AR/VR projects, and even big-time animation studios. With Nvidia GPUs priced like luxury cars, Render gives artists, designers, and creators affordable access to serious horsepower.

The token's performance reflects that buzz. RNDR has been climbing the charts, riding bullish sentiment driven by the explosion of AI and digital content. More creators are locking in Render as their go-to platform, and community members are taking notice.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Render's growing relevance in AI, virtual production, and digital content makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run. This project isn't just following trends—it's leading them.



Theta has always been about flipping the script on video streaming. Instead of relying on centralized servers that cost a fortune and lag under pressure, Theta uses a decentralized model where users share bandwidth and resources—and get paid for it.

Recently, Theta rolled out its EdgeCloud platform, boosting its capabilities way beyond just streaming. It now supports AI computing, edge rendering, and video-based AI agents. In plain English? It's gearing up to dominate the next phase of internet content delivery.

Partnerships with major media outlets and sports organizations keep pouring in, and the community's backing is growing fast. THETA token holders are loving the network's new use cases, and buyers are snapping up tokens expecting a serious surge once the market heats up again.

Why did this coin make it to this list? Theta's taking on a massive industry with a solution that actually works. Its evolution into edge computing and AI-backed content delivery locks it in as one of the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Finding the best altcoins to buy for next bull run isn't about chasing hype—it's about locking in projects solving real problems. Qubetics is breaking blockchain barriers with next-level interoperability. Render's changing how graphics rendering and AI content are created, while Theta is pushing video streaming and edge computing into the future.

With Qubetics' crypto presale heating up and Render and Theta setting up for major growth, these three look like serious contenders. Community members aiming to ride the next bull run won't want to sit this one out.



Qubetics: https://qubetics.com 

Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/

Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics 

Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics 

Qubetics delivers game-changing interoperability while offering huge ROI potential in its ongoing presale.

Render's decentralized GPU network is booming thanks to rising demand in AI, gaming, and digital content creation.

Theta's EdgeCloud now powers AI computing, edge rendering, and advanced content delivery—making it a serious contender.

Analysts predict $10-$15 after mainnet launch, which could mean over 9,434% ROI for early backers.

All three solve major real-world problems with proven use cases, making them the best altcoins to buy for next bull run.

Economic tariffs could be helped with technology.

getty

Blockchain and AI may soon feel the effects of sweeping changes in global trade policies, as tariffs became the talk of the town in April 2025—and not just in trade circles. The U.S. rolled out a sweeping new set of tariffs, creating ripples throughout global supply chains. Almost every imported product now faces at least a baseline 10% duty, but some nations felt the pinch more than others.

China, in particular, saw significant hikes with tariffs reaching up to 54% on critical sectors like electric vehicles, semiconductors, and solar cells. Vietnam didn't escape either, with a hefty 46% tariff impacting its key exports—think textiles and electronics. Vietnam is now looking at discussions and negotiations on the tariffs along with 50 other countries that have reached out to US for negotiations.

Europe, Japan, and India weren't left out of the tariff wave either, facing new duties of 20%, 24%, and 26%, respectively. And if you're shopping for a new ride, take note: a 25% tariff now hits all imported automobiles, affecting nearly half of U.S. auto sales.

The reaction? China responded swiftly, implementing a 34% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. imports starting April 10, 2025. These changes aren't just numbers—they're shaking up trade relationships, causing uncertainty, and forcing businesses everywhere to rethink their global strategies.

For companies shipping electronics from Vietnam to the U.S., these shifting trade policies aren't just headlines—they're operational headaches. Imagine you're running a supply chain for a hardware startup. Your team scrambles to determine whether the latest tariff rates affect your products, and if so, by how much. Meanwhile, your CFO asks whether rerouting production to another country would save millions. This is where emerging tech—AI and blockchain—steps in, not as buzzwords, but as lifelines.

Artificial Intelligence can digest complex tariff codes and regulatory changes in real time, flagging risks before goods even leave the port. Blockchain, on the other hand, acts as a digital notary, locking in proof of where products were made, how they moved, and who handled them. Together, these technologies offer a smarter way to handle global trade friction.

Circle back to that hardware company. With AI models constantly scanning trade databases and tariff announcements, the logistics team can get immediate updates on the best shipping routes and cost projections. Blockchain ensures that customs officers—and auditors—can verify the country of origin without endless paperwork or risk of fraud. The time and cost savings are huge, but the real win is agility.

Tariffs, by nature, are unpredictable. They change with political winds, react to global events, and often lack the clarity needed for confident decision-making. Businesses operating on tight margins can't afford guesswork. In this new era, having a digital infrastructure that supports transparent, automated, and verifiable decisions isn't just smart—it's necessary.

Across the globe, startups and innovators are already working on this. Take OpenSC, an Australia-based platform that tracks products from origin to shelf using blockchain. By scanning a simple QR code, buyers—and regulators—can trace exactly where a good came from. In a tariff-heavy landscape, that level of transparency could mean the difference between paying a 25% duty or none at all.

Similarly, Everledger, a U.K.-based company, is applying blockchain to authenticate the origin of diamonds and other luxury goods. Now imagine applying that same concept to industrial goods—steel, semiconductors, lithium batteries—where origin determines tariff rates. What if every bolt, battery, or board came with a blockchain-verified passport?

AI isn't sitting idle either. Predictive models are already helping companies assess the long-term cost implications of sourcing from one country over another. If tariffs on Vietnamese semiconductors jump next quarter, an AI model could suggest alternatives in real time—backed by real trade data, not assumptions. This allows companies to pivot faster, avoid disruptions, and maintain compliance.

Recent research by the World Trade Organization found that misclassification of goods contributes to billions in lost revenue annually. AI's ability to detect errors or fraud in trade documentation can help minimize those losses dramatically. A 2022 McKinsey report noted that combining AI and blockchain in customs and compliance systems could reduce processing costs by 30% or more, while increasing speed and accuracy.

There are even efforts underway to tackle the misuse of origin labeling, a tactic sometimes employed to dodge tariffs. Blockchain's immutable ledger makes it virtually impossible to forge shipment logs or fake a product's origin. AI can then audit this data for inconsistencies or red flags, alerting compliance teams before issues become legal problems.

While AI can analyze tariffs and blockchain can secure records, there's a critical missing piece: verification. That's where technologies like Truebit come in. Truebit's verification layer adds computational transparency—ensuring AI systems calculating tariffs are themselves accountable. This is vital in scenarios like the Trump administration's complex tariff structure, which included universal rates around 10% and country-specific duties, such as Cambodia's 49%.

Truebit is already deployed in real-world supply chains. It supports Quadrans, the blockchain behind the EU-funded TRICK project, a €8 million initiative tracking cross-border textile and food supply chains. ""While blockchains can immutably record shipping records, and AI can analyze tariff patterns, there's a critical verification gap between them,” said Jason Teutsch, Founder and Chief Scientist at Truebit.

“Companies need proof that the AI's calculations themselves are trustworthy, especially with tariffs now ranging from 10% to nearly 50% depending on the country of origin. Like a notary for computational processes, verification technology can create proof that an AI system correctly applied the correct tariff rates and pulled data from legitimate sources – something customs authorities are increasingly demanding.""

Davide Costa, co-founder of the Quadrans Foundation, reinforced this with his experience: “We discovered that blockchain alone wasn't enough when tracking products across international borders. The moment data moves between systems or undergoes AI analysis, verification becomes critical. Verification technology ensures that customs authorities and trading partners can trust not just the records, but the calculations and transformations applied to that data—essential when regulatory compliance and billions in tariffs are on the line.”

Even new stealth startups like Robotax are being built around this pain point. ""The Trump administration's tariff reciprocity plan has a blind spot: we can't actually prove products are taxed correctly,” said David Deputy, a finance and regulatory tax software professional. “Blockchain can track a product moving from Nigeria to France to the USA, but it can't verify if the correct tariffs and sales or VAT tax were actually applied at each step. This is where computational verification becomes essential.""

So, what does this look like in action? A company exporting textiles from Southeast Asia might deploy a system where every step—from fabric sourcing to final packaging—is logged on-chain. AI monitors the data flow, scanning for anomalies or mismatches against tariff rule sets. If a discrepancy arises, the system flags it before the shipment ever leaves the dock. That's not just smart—it's transformative.

The future of tariffs doesn't have to be murky. Yes, global trade will always be shaped by diplomacy and politics, but how businesses navigate those waters can be upgraded. Blockchain and AI give companies the tools not just to react—but to plan, adapt, and lead.

As countries tighten regulations and implement digital customs systems, the companies that win will be those who lean into innovation. Tariffs may never go away—but the confusion, inefficiency, and risk associated with them? That can.

It's time for businesses to stop fighting yesterday's trade wars with outdated tools. The new era of global trade demands tech that's proactive, predictive, and permanent. Blockchain and AI don't just offer a way through the tariff storm—they offer a way forward.

                        Stablecoins play a key role in mainstream adoption, but the absence of a federal framework for stablecoins makes it difficult for financial services and enterprises to scale adoption.                      

File this under things you couldn't say two years ago: Blockchain technology is maturing, and its potential for compliant, mainstream use is growing.

“Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told Karen Webster.

In particular, Levin said the adoption of stablecoins is one of the most significant shifts in blockchain usage, at least since Chainalysis began in 2014. The shift has been monumental. Now, hundreds of billions of dollars move across blockchains while being stored in traditional financial institutions like banks or United States treasuries.

“When we started the business in 2014, that wasn't yet a concept,” he said. “Cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain, including the U.S. dollar.”

Yet, challenges remain around global policy frameworks and the integration of concurrent advances such as artificial intelligence into on-chain ecosystems.

There is a push for a federal framework around stablecoins, and it's important for industry confidence Levin said.

“Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable in using stablecoins at scale,” he said, adding that as the conversation around crypto regulation evolves, providing clarity, compliance and insight will become more critical.

Chainalysis, a blockchain data company, was founded with a mission to illuminate the traditionally opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. Over a decade later, it boasts a dataset spanning 70 countries, capable of providing deep insights into how crypto is used, abused and regulated.

As it relates to the growth of stablecoins, tracking real dollars rather than merely crypto tokens has broadened the scope of blockchain monitoring. This evolution has transformed blockchain from a niche technology to a mainstream component of financial infrastructure, Levin said.

“What we are starting to see with OCC guidance and SEC guidance … is that this is something that is going to be possible for banks to do,” he said. “We now track not just cryptocurrency tokens, but … real dollars that are being used to settle financial transactions, remittances and payments all across the world on these rails.”

Still, a persistent criticism of cryptocurrency is its alleged use in illicit activities, and scams and fraud remain separate challenges. Estimates from Chainalysis highlight that between $10 billion and $12 billion worth of cryptocurrency transactions annually are linked to scams.

Chainalysis is uniquely positioned to monitor the entire “supply chain of scam activity,” offering insight into how scammers procure tools and sell illicit services, Levin said.

“We've helped the government seize more than $10 billion worth of crypto assets from criminal proceeds,” he said.

There has also been progress made in combatting the use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for money laundering and other financial crimes.

“The cryptocurrency transactions that we've been able to link to those types of activities is actually a smaller percentage of the overall activity,” he said. “It started off much higher, but now it's consistently below 1% of the transactions that we can associate directly to these types of actors.”

This decline is largely thanks to improved regulation and the ability of blockchain monitoring tools to help detect illicit transactions more accurately when compared to many traditional financial systems.

One area of excitement shared by stakeholders within the Web3 ecosystem is the potential for AI to improve crypto literacy and compliance. Despite the inroads blockchain has made to date, widespread misunderstandings about the technology's opacity persist.

“Even the people who are advocating for the technology … don't also advocate for the fact that cryptocurrency has been much more effective as a tool for both enterprises identifying risky activity off-boarding bad clients from their platforms and law enforcement being able to hold scammers to account,” Levin said.

Chainalysis itself continues to invest in educating enterprises about how blockchain works, using AI to simplify complex concepts for regulators and industry participants.

“I'm very optimistic about the potential for AI to actually contextualize some of the transactions and concepts for people,” Levin said.

“We still got work to do,” he added. “But the progress is real. And the potential is enormous.”

South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), which manages 1,224 trillion won ($836 billion) in assets, plans to look at how a blockchain could be used in its fund transaction systems.

The organization is weighing a shift to blockchain technology to boost transparency and security in managing its deposits, withdrawals and investments, according to Seoul Economic Daily, which cited industry sources.

The NPS plans to begin a preliminary disclosure process, inviting blockchain experts and companies to weigh in before formally launching the initiative, the news outlet said.

This feedback phase, standard for major public projects in Korea, will inform a research study into the feasibility of integrating blockchain into the pension fund's accounting system. The NPS is specifically looking at how blockchain's shared ledger can prevent tampering of fund records, a crucial task for the institution to ensure the retirement security of millions of people.

The NPS has previously used a blockchain to track overseas pension recipients. While it isn't considering investing directly in bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies, it has indirect exposure to the sector after investing in both Strategy and Coinbase shares.

The initiative comes shortly after South Korea's 7-Eleven stores started accepting the Bank of Korea's central bank digital currency as part of a major trial.

US

The tool is being touted as a digital safety net for artists in a fast-evolving tech era.

A pair of artists have launched a new app aimed at helping creators secure their work against the growing reach of artificial intelligence, as concerns mount over AI's use of human-generated content.

The app, named ARK, was developed by screenwriter Ed Bennett-Coles and songwriter Jamie Hartman. It uses blockchain technology to log creative ownership from concept to completion, offering a decentralised safeguard for writers, musicians, and other creators.

“AI is coming in and taking jobs,” Hartman told AFP. “This is our work. It's human. And we decide what it's worth.”

The platform allows users to register demos, scripts or any creative file, with additional features like biometric verification, NDAs, and blockchain time stamps designed to help prove ownership. It also enables collaborators to track their contributions in real time.

Bennett-Coles said the idea was born from his “career death moment” after reading about AI's first attempt at screenwriting back in 2008. Now, nearly two decades later, ARK aims to offer a solution by “ring-fencing” the creative process.

The app, set for a full launch in summer 2025, has secured investment from Claritas Capital and partnered with performing rights organisation BMI.

Its creators hope it will stand up in court as legal proof of authorship via blockchain-backed “smart contracts”.

“Copyright is a good principle—if you can prove it,” Hartman said. “Why not update how that's done?”

The initiative reflects growing unease in the creative sector over AI's rapid adoption and its potential to undercut traditional forms of artistic labour.

“Growth for growth's sake is the philosophy of the cancer cell,” Bennett-Coles said, adding that AI often dismisses the value of the creative journey.

The developers argue ARK is not just a tool, but a necessary defence mechanism for creators in the digital age.

        Share    

Kremlin-backed social network VK will close its NFT platform this month, following a year of deepening losses and a planned $1.36 billion share issue to reduce debt.

Russian social media company VK plans to shut down its marketplace for non-fungible tokens, VK NFT Hub, on April 15, the team said, ending a service that was launched in December 2022. In a public announcement, users were told to transfer their tokens to external wallets before the deadline.

After April 15, the special visual markers on VK associated with NFTs — small neon diamonds that appeared on avatars — will be removed, leaving users who purchased NFTs for this feature with nothing. The NFT team added that existing content in the VK NFT community will remain, though it's unclear whether VK plans to return to NFTs or digital assets in the future.

The closure comes as VK faces financial pressure as the company's net loss nearly tripled in 2024 to 94.9 billion roubles (around $1.1 billion), up from 34.3 billion roubles in 2023. Amid declining financial health, the company revealed plans to raise up to 115 billion roubles through a new share issuance to reduce debt.

It's understood that the company will direct the received funds to lowering its debt burden. As crypto.news reported earlier, March marked a turning point, with a series of marketplace shutdowns intensifying the situation. These included South Korean tech giant LG shutting down its LG Art Lab, as well as the closures of X2Y2, and Bybit's NFT marketplace, among others.

Gamers have traditionally invested countless hours honing their skills, acquiring items, and progressing through levels, yet the tangible value of their endeavors has remained locked within the game's ecosystem. The model is a simple one: players get the enjoyment of their experience while studios and publishers capture all of the value that they generate. 

The unfairness of this system has led, inevitably, to the growth of the blockchain-powered gaming industry. The fact that players' achievements, no matter how impressive, could translate to fleeting experiences rather than monetary rewards, fuelled the ambitions of developers and builders who recognized gamers' appetite for incentives. There had to be a better way. 

Web3 gaming presents a radical departure from the old model, introducing new paradigms where player engagement translates into real ownership and economic opportunities, particularly through sophisticated mechanics like play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and play-to-airdrop. Participation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), meanwhile, lets players directly influence game development and governance.

This fundamental shift, which has taken place over the last five years, represents a democratization of gaming value that sees players become stakeholders rather than mere consumers. Although web2 publishers continue to retain strength and influence in the market, the natural question to ask is, for how long?

NFTs were at the center of the first wave of value tokenization in web3 gaming, with blockchain technology conferring in-game assets like characters, weapons, skins, virtual land with both intrinsic value and provable ownership. These digital assets, which could be freely traded freely on open markets, created lucrative opportunities for players beyond the enjoyment they could derive from gameplay.

Maligned by some due to their volatility, NFTs nonetheless had a moment in the sun when enterprising players made plenty of profit in a hot market. When the macro picture soured and NFT valuations fell, some projects were abandoned and many players left disgruntled. 

Ultimately, though, NFTs have remained a cornerstone of blockchain-powered games. Indeed, gaming token launches increased by 200% year-over-year (YoY) in 2024. Funding for web3 gaming titles and infrastructure also grew by 17% in the same period, indicating strong investor confidence in this growing sector.

DAO tokens represent the next evolution in this space, tokenizing something even more fundamental: the collective power of gaming communities. While NFTs capture unique assets, fungible tokens represent abstract value in the form of community coordination and cultural capital.

If social media has given users a voice in the cultural consciousness, DAO tokens have granted holders a share in the collective decision-making power of a gaming community, enabling them to influence development and participate in resource allocation. 

The value of such tokens extends beyond mere governance rights, too, as the assets essentially reflect the cultural and social capital of the gaming ecosystem. Analogous to the way in which tokens locked in a DeFi protocol show its Total Value Locked or TVL.

The Alien Worlds metaverse is a prime example of a multi-layered tokenization approach, featuring as it does both fungible and non-fungible tokens. The world's most actively played on-chain game, it features six DAOs, known as Planetary Syndicates, each of which has evolved into distinct cultural entities with their own character and community dynamics. 

The Planet Kavian DAO, for example, is notable for having organized the sci-fi game's first physical meetup and sent representatives to industry events like 3XP. A campaign conducted by Neri's Syndicate also saw an enormous billboard promoting Alien Worlds appear on the Las Vegas Strip. Among other duties, Syndicates fund mini-games and events linked to their own planets' mythology and land, presiding over their own treasury of Trilium (TLM) tokens.

In 2024, Alien Worlds pioneered the concept of tokenized lore, adding another layer to the growing cultural TVL within its ecosystem. Through its primary contributor Daoco, the game has implemented a system wherein the community actively participates in creating and canonizing the game's backstory through token-based voting mechanisms.

The Alien Worlds Tokenized Lore Book serves as a foundation for this community-driven narrative expansion, empowering players to contribute to the game's unfolding story universe and potentially receive funding through its Galactic Hubs grant program. 

It is an approach that has catalyzed numerous community initiatives that spotlight the synergy between NFTs, DAO tokens, and storytelling. One Galactic Hubs-funded project, an autobattler game called Battlefleet Armageddon, recently introduced five new community-named battleships with accompanying lore.

The Starblind comic project, meanwhile, has laid groundwork for an upcoming first-person shooter game, Siege Worlds, while Meta Battler's GHubs-sponsored tournament saw massive NFT engagement with over 22,000 Alien Worlds NFTs synchronized and 300 pages of a new lore-based comic, Alien Hunter, collected.

All of which is to say that Alien Worlds uses both NFTs and DAO tokens to enhance engagement and grant players more autonomy and influence.

Alien Worlds is not alone in its pursuit of a more democratic gaming landscape. Ethereum-based game The Sandbox, which boasts over 5.7 million users, provides another compelling example of sophisticated tokenization. 

A blockchain-based virtual world, The Sandbox enables its players to build, own, and monetize their experiences across gaming, entertainment, music, and art sectors. In 2024, it introduced its own DAO, with voting power determined by players' holdings of both $SAND (a fungible token) and $LAND tokens (non-fungible). Thus, both active players and virtual landowners will have a say in things like gameplay upgrades, feature roll-outs, tournaments, and rewards programs.

When unveiling the Sandbox DAO, co-founder and COO Sebastien Borget referred to players as “citizens of a digital nation in the making” who merited the power to “decide how the platform should evolve and what initiatives it will support.”

The transformation in how gaming value is created, captured, and distributed is ongoing. With blockchain enabling increasingly complex forms of tokenization, more power and value is being put into the hands of players and developers. 

In the years to come, and particularly with the evolution of AI, expect to see even more innovative approaches to enhancing the gaming experience, ultimately creating more rewarding ecosystems for all participants.

""We're gonna win so much, you may even get tired of wining,"" said Donald Trump at one of his pre-election speeches. A couple of months later, it doesn't really feel like winning. 

After two devastatingly tough days for the U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies, with the S&P 500 dumping more than 10 percent over Thursday and Friday, many market participants were likely hoping for some relief on Monday. However, major indices are down hard once again in premarket trading, with S&P 500 diving below 5000 for the first time since April 2024. 

Big tech stocks are having a particularly bad day so far, with Apple down to $180 per share in premarket trading, Nvidia at $89.4 per share, and Tesla at $222 per share. For Tesla alone, whose stock price reach an all-time-high of $489 per share in December 2024, this is a 55 percent decline. 

Cryptocurencies aren't having a great day, either, with Bitcoin trading at $76,130, and Ethereum trading at $1486 at writing time. It's worth remembering that Bitcoin was trading above $109,000, and Ethereum above $4,100, just four months ago. 

The culprit is obvious: The tariffs that the Trump's administration imposed on nearly ever trading partner (and some penguins) were far more radical than the market expected, with basically the entire world being suddenly thrown into a potentially devastating trade war. In just one example, there are already calculations that Apple might increase iPhone prices by up to 43%, with the cheapest iPhone 16 going from $799 to $1,142. 

Of course, no one knows exactly what will happen due to potential deals being brokered between the U.S. and its trading partners, but therein lies the rub: The markets don't like uncertainty, and the current situation is as uncertain as can be. 

It's not just Wall Street that's unhappy with Trump's idea of fixing America. In a Saturday rally in Washington, DC and other U.S. cities, thousands gathered to protest some of the moves the Trump administration has made so far.

 The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was established in March to oversee the adoption of blockchain technology and digital assets. 

Former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has been appointed as an adviser to Pakistan's Crypto Council, a newly formed regulatory body tasked with overseeing the country's embrace of blockchain technology and digital assets. 

The appointment was confirmed by Pakistan's finance ministry and reported by Bloomberg on April 7. Zhao will advise the regulatory body on cryptocurrency regulation, infrastructure and adoption, Bloomberg reported.

Zhao is one of the most recognizable names in crypto, having served as CEO of Binance between 2017 and 2023. He resigned as CEO of the exchange in November 2023 after pleading guilty to charges related to violating US money laundering laws. He was later sentenced to four months in prison. 

For Pakistan, Zhao is a high-profile appointment that could potentially help the country lure foreign investment in an industry that has taken on new strategic importance.

In March, the CEO of Pakistan's Crypto Council, Bilal bin Saqib, told Bloomberg that the country plans to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital assets.

“Pakistan is done sitting on the sidelines,” Saqib said. “We want to attract international investment because Pakistan is a low-cost high-growth market with [...] a Web3 native workforce ready to build.”

Pakistan has long been considered a potential hub for crypto adoption due to its growing population, large diaspora and thriving black market for foreign exchange trades. 

The value of cash sent to Pakistan through formal remittance channels surged at the end of last year amid a countrywide crackdown on black market dollar trades.

“This increase might be because remittances that had previously been sent using the black market are now being sent via official channels,” John Ashbourne, an economist at Fitch Solutions, told Bloomberg. 

Pakistan ranked highly in Chainalysis' 2024 crypto adoption index, largely due to strong retail adoption and transactions at centralized services.

Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto's most prominent use cases in regions with high demand for US dollars due to currency depreciation.

Although data on stablecoin usage in Pakistan is slim, a 2023 KuCoin survey revealed that 33% of local crypto investors use digital assets to hedge against the rupee's devaluation. 

A more recent survey conducted by Bitget found that 46% of respondents in South Asia — a region that includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and others — use digital assets for speed and accessibility of transactions.

Home » Kyrgyzstan Partners with Binance to Advance Crypto Ecosystem

Kyrgyzstan has taken a significant step towards integrating blockchain technology into its financial and digital infrastructure through a newly signed Memorandum of Cooperation with Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance—the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. This partnership, formalized by the country's National Investment Agency, marks a strategic move to modernize Kyrgyzstan's digital economy by leveraging Binance's expertise across several key areas.

Under the terms of the agreement, Binance is expected to play a central role in the development of blockchain infrastructure in Kyrgyzstan. The initiative also includes plans to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve, signaling the government's growing interest in embracing digital assets at an institutional level. Officials involved in the partnership have emphasized that the collaboration aims to lay the foundation for a regulated, forward-thinking virtual assets market.

The agreement outlines Binance's commitment to supporting Kyrgyzstan not only in terms of technology deployment but also in governance. This includes assisting the government in setting up a comprehensive management system for blockchain technologies and digital assets. By incorporating such frameworks, the partnership intends to strengthen regulatory oversight and ensure a secure environment for crypto-related activity in the country.

Beyond infrastructure, the cooperation focuses heavily on capacity building. Binance is set to contribute to the training of young professionals, civil servants, and specialists in areas such as blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and virtual asset management. This educational effort is being positioned as a way to foster a skilled domestic workforce capable of contributing to the nation's evolving digital economy. By equipping local talent with relevant expertise, the initiative is expected to create new employment opportunities and support the growth of a sustainable fintech sector.

Interest in cryptocurrency is reportedly rising among Kyrgyzstan's population, but the regulatory framework remains underdeveloped. In response, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce recently proposed new legislation aimed at integrating crypto assets into the national financial system. One of the central ideas put forth involves the introduction of licensed crypto banks, which would provide regulated financial services related to digital currencies.

The ministry has highlighted that legalizing cryptocurrency operations could unlock substantial economic benefits. These include increased transaction volumes, higher tax revenues, and job creation within the fintech sector. The proposed changes are part of a broader effort to position Kyrgyzstan as a regional hub for financial technology and innovation.

In a separate regulatory development, Kyrgyzstan's Cabinet of Ministers has dramatically increased the minimum capital requirement for cryptocurrency exchanges. The threshold has been raised from 100 million KGS to 10 billion KGS, reflecting a hundredfold jump. This decision, initiated by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce, is intended to enhance the financial stability of crypto platforms and protect user interests.

According to officials, the policy is also designed to encourage transparency and ensure a secure operational environment for digital asset transactions. Existing crypto exchanges have been given a deadline until January 1, 2026, to comply with the updated capital requirements.

Through its agreement with Binance and a series of sweeping regulatory reforms, Kyrgyzstan appears to be taking deliberate steps toward building a robust and well-regulated digital asset ecosystem. By combining infrastructure development, education, and strict oversight, the country is positioning itself for a stronger role in the global cryptocurrency landscape.

Fear is gripping financial markets, triggered largely by President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, with Hong Kong stocks plunging 14% on Monday, the most since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and Taiwan and Japanese stocks sliding 10%.

European equities didn't fare much better. The FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 are each down more than 5%. 

Nor were crypto markets immune. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 10% over 24 hours, dipping below $75,000, and ether (ETH) plunged 22%. XRP and SOL also nosedived more than 20%, while DOGE is down more than 15%. Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, hitting 63%, a level not seen since early 2021. The CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader market, has lost almost 12% in the past day.

As for U.S. equities, the S&P 500 is set to start the week already in bear market territory — down 20% from its all-time high and 5% lower in pre-market trading — and on course for what could be the worst three-day performance in its history. 

China, whose stocks fell 7%, is reportedly considering front-loading stimulus measures to soften the blow. On Friday, it announced a reciprocal 34% tariff on all U.S. goods.

“We have massive financial deficits with China, the European Union, and many others,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend. ""The only way this problem can be cured is with tariffs, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the U.S. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold… We are going to reverse [the deficit], and reverse it quickly. Someday people will realize that tariffs, for the United States of America, are a very beautiful thing!”

So, where can investors seek refuge? For now, it seems to be U.S. bonds. The 10-year note is up 8% year-to-date, while the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks the long end of the yield curve, is up 6% as investors pile into government debt, pushing yields lower. This drop in yields is a welcome sign for the U.S. administration.

Seasoned investor Bill Ackman noted that Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick doesn't appear concerned about a potential economic crash, hinting that Lutnick and Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm he used to head, are long bonds. Ackman suggested on X that they could be positioned to profit from a downturn.

What's next? Watch for countries scrambling to avoid the tariffs. Some, like Argentina, Taiwan and India, are already showing signs of conceding and removing tariffs on U.S. imports. The uncertainty surrounding these negotiations will likely keep markets volatile as the Volatility S&P 500 Index (VIX) hits 60 in pre-market trading. That's the highest level since August 2024. These are definitely times to stay alert!

Beijing is said to be discussing front-loading monetary stimulus to counter the destabilizing impact President Donald Trump's tariffs on the Chinese economy, according to data source Trade The News.

The reports come a day after Trump said he won't make a trade deal with China unless the trade deficit is solved. Financial markets have crashed with bitcoin falling under $80K since Trump announced gigantic reciprocal tariffs Thursday, boosting trade tensions.

Goldman Sachs now expects a total of 130 basis points in Fed rate cuts for 2025, up from 105 basis points late last week. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to deliver four rate cuts.

CME's bitcoin futures, considered a proxy for institutional activity, gapped lower Monday in a sign of bearish sentiment after President Donald Trump ruled out a trade deal with China.

The futures contract due to expire on the last Friday of April began trading at $79,590, down 5.6% from Friday's close of $84,250 and quickly descended to $76,800, CoinDesk data show.

The losses came as Dow futures fell 900 points, Chinese stocks crashed, and the Japanese equity market slipped into lower circuit breakers as JPMorgan, S&P Global, and Goldman Sachs increased the probability of the U.S. falling into recession this year.

On Sunday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he wanted to solve the trade deficit with China ""and unless we solve that problem, I'm not going to make a deal.""

Trump added that world leaders are dying to make a deal. Last week, the President announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations, boosting the total levy on China to 54%. Since then, financial markets have wilted, which the President thinks is the necessary medicine to solve the problem.

""I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,"" Trump said.

Open interest in the CME futures peaked in December at 281.57 BTC and has since declined to 140.5K, the lowest since August 2024, according to data source Coinglass. 

It's a sign of money leaving the digital assets space, perhaps in anticipation of a deeper price swoon.

Meanwhile, global futures and perpetual futures open interest, excluding CME, has increased from roughly 400K BTC to 520 BTC in the past four weeks.

An increase in open interest alongside a price drop is said to confirm the bearish trend, indicating that traders are building short positions in a falling market.

Tether, issuer of the world's largest stablecoin USDT, may offer a new token specifically for the U.S., according to a Financial Times report on Monday.

Paolo Ardoino said the company had been involved in discussions about the U.S. rules on stablecoins and that it may create a token just for the U.S, depending on how these discussions unfold, the FT reported, citing an interview with the Tether CEO. 

Ardoino said that if new rules are brought in""make [U.S.] stablecoins competitive, there could be an interest from Tether to create a domestic stablecoin,"" which would be ""basically a settlement currency.""

He added that the Trump administration views stableoins as ""an important instrument in the United States.""

Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, most commonly the U.S dollar. 

Regulations being considered by President Donald Trump's administration include plans to force foreign issuers trading crypto to comply with U.S. laws.

 Strategy paused Bitcoin purchases last week as BTC fell below $87,000, disclosing a $5.91 billion unrealized loss in Q1, according to SEC filings. 

Michael Saylor's firm Strategy, the world's largest publicly listed corporate holder of Bitcoin, did not add to its BTC holdings last week as the cryptocurrency's price dropped below $87,000.

In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7, Strategy announced it made no Bitcoin (BTC) purchases during the week of March 31 to April 6.

The decision followed a week of heightened market volatility, with BTC surging to as high as $87,000 on April 2 after starting the week at around $82,000, according to data from CoinGecko.

BTC fell below $80,000 on April 6, a significant discount from the average BTC price of Strategy's previous 22,000 BTC purchase announced on March 31.

In the period from March 31 to April 6, Strategy also did not sell any shares of class A common stock, which it tends to use for financing its Bitcoin buys, the filing stated.

As of April 7, Strategy held an aggregate amount of 528,185 Bitcoin bought at $35.6 billion, or at an average price of 67,458 per BTC, it added.

An excerpt from Strategy's Form 8-K report. Source: SEC

“Our unrealized loss on digital assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, was $5.91 billion, which we expect will result in a net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, partially offset by a related income tax benefit of $1.69 billion,” the filing added.

While Strategy avoided buying Bitcoin last week, its co-founder and former CEO, Saylor, continued posting about the crypto asset's superiority on social media.

“Bitcoin is most volatile because it is most useful,” Saylor wrote in an X post on April 3, soon after BTC tumbled from the intra-week high of $87,100 on April 2 below $82,000, following the tariffs announcement by US President Donald Trump.

“Today's market reaction to tariffs is a reminder: inflation is just the tip of the iceberg,” Saylor wrote in another X post.

“Capital faces dilution from taxes, regulation, competition, obsolescence, and unforeseen events. Bitcoin offers resilience in a world full of hidden risks,” he added.

 The $108,888,888 fund will operate an “open-arms policy,” welcoming real-world asset tokenization and DeFi projects at all developmental stages. 

The Mantra blockchain network has launched a $108,888,888 ecosystem fund aimed at accelerating the growth of startups focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), amid rising demand for stable, asset-backed digital products.

Mantra, a layer-1 (L1) blockchain built for tokenized RWAs, launched the Mantra Ecosystem Fund (MEF) to accelerate the growth and adoption of projects and startups building on its network, according to an April 7 announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

Mantra said it will deploy the capital over the next four years among “high-potential blockchain projects” worldwide, with investment opportunities sourced through Mantra's network of partners. The fund's backers include a wide range of institutional partners including Laser Digital, Shorooq, Brevan Howard Digital, Valor Capital, Three Point Capital and Amber Group.

Mantra CEO John Patrick Mullin said the fund will operate an “open-arms policy, welcoming projects at any developmental stage globally with a particular focus on RWA's and DeFi.” Mullin told Cointelegraph:

The launch of the fund comes a month after Mantra became the first DeFi platform to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license under Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).

The timing of the fund's launch aligns with growing institutional interest in RWAs, which are seen by some as a hedge against crypto market volatility and broader economic uncertainty.

Global fears and uncertainty around US President Donald Trump's tariffs have impacted investor sentiment across markets.

Despite a broader market slump triggered by US tariff-related concerns, the value of tokenized RWAs recently surged to a record high. According to data from RWA.xyz, total RWA market capitalization reached more than $19.6 billion as of early April, up from $17 billion in early February.

Industry watchers previously told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin's lack of upside momentum may drive RWAs to a $50 billion all-time high before the end of 2025.

The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, has also signaled support for the RWA space.

 ETH prices have tanked more than 14%, causing liquidations on decentralized finance lending platforms. 

An Ether investor who had a large position on decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Sky has been liquidated to the tune of more than $100 million as the price of Ether crashed. 

The Ether (ETH) whale lost 67,570 ETH worth around $106 million when the asset crashed by around 14% on April 6, liquidating his collateralized debt position on Sky, according to Maker Vaults explorer DeFi Explore, and as observed by Lookonchain.

The Sky lending protocol, which rebranded from Maker in August, is used by DeFi participants to create collateralized debt positions by providing crypto, ETH in this case, to borrow the platform's stablecoin, DAI (DAI).

The system uses an overcollateralization ratio, typically 150% or higher, meaning that users need to deposit at least $150 worth of ETH to borrow 100 DAI. 

The protocol autonomously monitors the value of ETH collateral relative to the borrowed DAI, and if the ETH value falls and the collateral ratio drops below the minimum requirement, the position becomes eligible for liquidation.

This whale's liquidation occurred when the ratio fell to 144% as the price of ETH plummeted.

Meanwhile, Spot On Chain reported that another whale that supplied 56,995 wrapped ETH, worth around $91 million, to borrow DAI was on the verge of liquidation. 

In a liquidation event, Sky seizes the ETH collateral, which is auctioned off to pay back the borrowed DAI plus fees. Any remaining collateral after the debt is paid is returned to the user. 

ETH prices have crashed a whopping 14.5% over the past 24 hours, falling to $1,547 at the time of writing as the wider crypto market melts down in reaction to US President Donald Trump's tariff-induced market sell-off. 

The last time ETH traded this low was in October 2023, when crypto was still deep in bear market territory, almost a year after the collapse of the FTX exchange. 

ETH remains down 68% from its all-time high in 2021, and further losses are likely to see more DeFi users liquidated unless they can provide more collateral.

 US President Donald Trump told reporters he wasn't intentionally engineering a market sell-off, but “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” 

Cryptocurrency prices tumbled as the US stock futures market opened sharply lower on April 6 as the Trump administration doubled down on its global tariff strategy.

The Trump administration hit all countries with a 10% tariff starting April 5, with some slapped at higher rates, including China at 34%, the European Union at 20%, and Japan at 24%.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped over 6% in the last 24 hours and was trading around $77,883. Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) shed over 12% in the same time frame and was trading at $1,575, according to CoinGecko. The total crypto market cap dropped over 8% to $2.5 trillion. 

Prices have clawed back some losses since. Bitcoin has recovered 1.4% to $78,500. Meanwhile, Ether regained $1,594.

At the same time, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, returned a score of 23 in its latest April 7 update, which is considered extreme fear.

In a statement, Charlie Sherry, head of finance at Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets, said the drop is unsurprising because global markets are generally more illiquid on Sundays. 

“As a result, a few large sell-offs can have a disproportionate impact, pushing prices down quickly,” he said. 

Some traders, however, predict a Bitcoin breakout could be around the corner. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has also speculated that while the tariffs are rattling markets, they could result in a Bitcoin rally. 

The US Stock Futures market has also opened down. 

Futures tied to the S&P 500 dropped nearly 4%, according to Google Finance. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures sank by over 8%. 

Trading resource the Kobeissi Letter said in an April 6 post to X that the drop in US stock market futures puts S&P 500 futures in ”bear market territory,” adding that the US stock market has now erased an average of $400 billion per trading day for the last 32 days.

Tom Dunleavy, a managing partner at venture capital firm MV Global, said it could be the “worst three-day move for US stocks of all time” if “tonight's futures hold.” 

Crypto-friendly billionaire investor Bill Ackman speculates that US President Donald Trump could postpone the tariffs to allow countries to make counteroffers or deals.

In an April 6 statement on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump doubled down on the tariffs, saying the US has massive financial deficits with China, the European Union and many others, which the levies will solve.

“The only way this problem can be cured is with TARIFFS, which are now bringing tens of billions of dollars into the USA. They are already in effect, and a beautiful thing to behold,” he said.

He also told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn't intentionally trying to cause a market sell-off but added that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” 

At the same time, US National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said in an April 6 interview with ABC's This Week program that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to negotiate fresh trade deals.

“They're doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff,” he said. 

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged US trading partners in an April 2 interview with Bloomberg against taking retaliatory steps, arguing “this is the high end of the number” for tariffs if they don't try to add more levies in response.

Letting Kids Fail Is Crucial

Our instinct is to protect our kids from failure. But learning from failure is an important life skill that can't be overlooked

When my older son Jack was in high school, he accepted a summer job selling solar panels door-to-door. My first reaction was to tell him not to do it. I felt protective—afraid of the rejection he would face on doorsteps all summer long. I just couldn't see how my thoughtful son, a good athlete and straight A student, could cope with so much failure.

As a parent, it's natural to want to shield your kids from failure. But we often hover over our kids in what are arguably low-stakes situations, inadvertently robbing them of essential learning experiences and causing anxiety rather than the confidence we had intended to build.

Instead, we can learn to let kids fail well.

To be fair, we are in a bind: if we overprotect, we are ridiculed as helicopter parents, but if we underprotect, we suffer the potentially catastrophic consequences of a child's immature decision-making. Making the job even harder, every few years the parenting pendulum seems to swing: the three-martini playdate replaces the anxious co-piloted playdate and back again. It's easy to see why parents are torn: Should you let children make their own mistakes, or stay close by, removing obstacles, limiting risks and preventing failure? Struggling to manage the bind, parents suffer. And so do their kids.

But there is a path forward that avoids either/or thinking and helps kids build good judgment to accompany a learning-oriented, adventuresome spirit. It supports kids in pursuing the right kind of failures—while helping them avoid danger. Extrapolating from my organizational research and personal experience, I think it's a parent's responsibility to help children develop the failure muscles they need to stretch and learn and to grow into responsible members of society. To do this, we need to examine two dimensions of failure science: assessing the context for risk and understanding that failures are not all alike.

Consider three kinds of failure I've identified in my research: basic, complex and intelligent.

Basic failures have single causes—usually a simple mistake. They are preventable. This is why we childproof our homes when children are small, and ensure that medicine bottles can't be opened without the strength to twist and pinch. Basic failures don't bring new knowledge, and most of us would be better off avoiding them (such as by paying attention when we're following a recipe). But they're part of the experience for any child learning to master a new topic or skill, and it's good to remind children to take the time to learn from mistakes, so they can keep improving.

Complex failures have multiple causes—each innocuous on its own—that come together to produce havoc. You forget to charge your cell phone, get stuck behind an overturned truck on the highway, can't reach your spouse, and miss the day care pick up. Most complex failures can be prevented with vigilance, but we've all had days where everything goes wrong, and these kinds of failures will continue to slip through in our increasingly complex and interconnected world. We should learn from them and move on.

The intelligent failures are the ones that matter here, the ones parents should let happen to help children thrive.

It starts with learning to reframe failure as a source of discovery and personal development. I believe that most of us, to live the fullest lives, should experience more failures, not fewer. Whether it's tennis champion Roger Federer winning only 54 percent of the thousands of points he played in his illustrious career (proving that, as he put it, “even top-ranked tennis players win barely more than half of the points they play”) or top chemistry professor Jennifer Heemstra saying that 90 percent of the experiments in her lab end in failure, the most successful among us have long demonstrated that you have to be willing to fail. So why do so many parents feel a need to protect their children from failure?

Remember Jack and the solar panels? My instinct was to dissuade him. Yes, most people said no, and some were downright rude, but a few said yes, leaving him with a sense of pride that he'd brought renewable energy to some of our area's homes. Meanwhile, he learned to pause after each rejection and tell himself that a no was simply a step toward the next yes. He built some healthy failure muscles that continue to serve him well in his career.

Failures can help kids succeed. To do this, we need to encourage them to take thoughtful risks—to keep stretching outside their comfort zone. Audition for the school play; try out for basketball; ask that classmate out on a date. Yes, rejection is a likely outcome for any of these small life risks. But this is a feature, not a bug. The most successful people are those who've learned how to fail: they've missed more crucial shots on court, been turned down for more auditions, and had more papers rejected from top journals. Their success comes from trying, learning, improving and trying again—not from magically getting things right the first time around.

It can be hard to watch your kids fail. You absorb their disappointment. You want to fix whatever went wrong quickly, so they can feel good again. But part of making this work is learning to live with your discomfort, your anxiety about them missing the short-term gain over the long-term lesson.

Give your kids space to fail in contained, safe ways, and teach them to embrace and learn from the failures they experience. Show them how to face forward and go after the next challenge with renewed insight and energy. Don't dwell on failures but do learn as much as you can from them.

This mindset—what psychologist Carol Dweck calls a growth mindset—is an invaluable resource for children, particularly in a fast-changing world. When my younger son Nick, learning to ski at about age eight, asked me to watch him come down the slope, I dutifully stood at the bottom and waited. After his short run, he looked up and asked, “How did I do?” My response? “You did great!” But instead of the smile I'd expected, Nick looked puzzled, even disappointed, as he replied, “Can't you tell me what I did wrong so I can get better?”

Now I was the one smiling. Somehow, as a parent, I had helped nurture this growth mindset. Intimately familiar with Dweck's research as a social psychologist myself, I should have commented on his process (“You were in control of your speed, and you looked like you were enjoying yourself. If you bend your knees a little more and keep your chest facing downhill, your form will be better”) rather than praising his results (“You did great!”). I had been trying to teach my children not to overvalue successful outcomes, so they could focus instead on building disciplined habits of learning. And Nick showed me that what I was trying to do was working. This doesn't mean we don't ever say, “Good job!” of course, but praising outcomes isn't the only thing that can motivate a child. Worse, when we only praise outcomes, it teaches kids to be risk averse—reluctant to come up short in your and others' eyes. “Good try!” or “Great progress!” are the kinds of process-focused phrases that offer encouragement without creating a dependence on getting things right every time.

What can be remarkable about an intelligent failure is that it shuts down one path and forces us to seek another, as with the time I was rejected from my high school basketball team and discovered debating instead. Other times they take us a notch closer to our goal, in slow but steady progress toward mastery. Although intelligent failures include wildly different phenomena from a missed point on the tennis court to rejection from the college of our choice, they have in common the pursuit of goals we care about. They also require taking the time to think through what is known and not known before acting. Also, the stakes are kept appropriately small, deliberately not incurring undue financial, reputational or safety risks.

In sum, to learn to take the intelligence of intelligence failure to heart, parents must consider both the context and the type of failure that may result from their kids' decisions. With this awareness, we can appreciate the emotional, cognitive and interpersonal skills the kids need to aim high, stretch their potential and become resilient—rather than fearful or ashamed of failing. In this way, parents can help their children build strong failure muscles while saving them from disastrous mistakes.

How do you start? Stop yourself from reactively protecting your child from failure. Notice your instincts, which, while valuable in so many contexts, are not helpful in others. Ask yourself, “What is the risk here? What kind of failure would this be?” to help you override your instinct to shield children from life's most valuable lessons. Encourage them to take smart risks. Create (and help them create) opportunities to stretch. Support their growth as they do so, while helping them think through the possible outcomes of choices they are considering.

Then let them choose.

Obesity-Drug Pioneers and Large Hadron Collider Physicists win $3-Million Breakthrough Prizes



Advances recognized by science's most lucrative awards include high-energy physics experiments and groundbreaking weight-loss treatments

By Zeeya Merali & Nature magazine 

The Breakthrough prize trophy's design is inspired by imagery from science, including black holes, seashells and the structure of DNA.

Breakthrough Prize

Five scientists who contributed to the development of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have picked up one of this year's US$3-million Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science.

Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that controls blood sugar levels and helps to curb appetite. “This class of drugs truly saves lives, changes lives and brings joy back to people's lives,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, a physician-scientist at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who recently led a massive study analysing data from almost two million people to evaluate the effects of such medication.

This life-sciences prize is shared between the four researchers who discovered and characterized GLP-1 – endocrinologist Daniel Drucker at the University of Toronto, Canada; physician-researchers Joel Habener at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts and Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen; and chemist Svetlana Mojsov at The Rockefeller University in New York City — along with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark, who spearheaded the development of drugs based on these discoveries.

In the 1990s, Drucker and his colleagues realized that GLP-1 caused animals to eat less and lose weight. Knudsen stablized the drug by adding fatty-acid chains, enabling it to bind to proteins in the blood, which prevents it from breaking down rapidly once injected. “It's a tremendous honour to receive this prestigious award,” says Drucker. “But the most amazing gratification is when someone comes to my office and says, ‘I lost 40 pounds [18 kg] and I feel healthy'.”

The award is one of six Breakthrough prizes to be awarded this year in life sciences, physics and mathematics.

Unusually for a major award, one of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to a grand total of 13,508 physicists spanning four collaborations at CERN, Europe's particle physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland. Through experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these researchers have taken multiple precision measurements over the past decade to probe, and so far confirm, the standard model of particle physics. “We're honoured the award was made to the entire collaboration because without all those people we could not have made these advances,” says Patricia McBride, a spokesperson for CERN's CMS collaboration. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit CERN, she adds.

The award is well deserved, says Brian Rebel, a particle physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Finding the Higgs [boson] in 2012 was a once-in-lifetime event, but it was only the first step,” Rebel says. Since then, LHC scientists have been pinning down the mass of the Higgs and its interactions, as well as discovering 72 new particles, investigating antimatter and probing the nature of the ‘quark–gluon plasma' that existed soon after the Big Bang. “It takes a small army to create the tools to test and validate these results,” says Rebel.

Another Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to one of the architects of the standard model, theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who also won a share of the 1999 Nobel prize in physics for his work on the weak nuclear force, and contributed to understanding the strong nuclear force. “A beautiful synthesis emerges when one's mathematics is linked to particles actually seen in the world,” says 't Hooft, adding that he is “honoured” to win the prize.

The mathematics prize went to Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, for numerous contributions to the development of the Langlands programme — dubbed the ‘grand unified theory of mathematics' because it brings together the disciplines of number theory, geometry and function fields.

And two other prizes in the life sciences were awarded — one shared between neuroscientist Stephen Hauser at the University of California, San Francisco, and epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio at Harvard University, for research on the drivers of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease caused by damage to myelin, the material that surrounds and insulates nerve fibres.

In the 1990s, Hauser and colleagues demonstrated that antibodies produced by the immune system's B cells were likely to be behind the damage4. This initially invited scepticism because it had been assumed that T cells were the culprits, and Hauser recalls being “devastated” at being refused funding because his ideas were deemed “biologically implausible”. “The Breakthrough Prize is recognition of the importance of ‘stick-to-it-ness',” says Hauser. Independently, in 2022, Ascherio and his colleagues definitively established that infection with the Epstein–Barr virus drastically heightens a person's risk of developing MS.

The final life-sciences prize went to David Liu, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for developing technologies that use CRISPR gene-editing to rewrite segments of DNA. His techniques are being employed in clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell leukaemia, sickle-cell disease, β-thalassemia and high cholesterol.

The Breakthrough prizes were founded in 2012 and are sponsored by Yuri Milner, a Russian–Israeli billionaire, and other Internet entrepreneurs, including Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

And they discovered it completely by accident.

Containing some 3.2 billion base pairs, the human genome is far from a simple set of genetic instructions, but the process of inherited traits from parent to child is often described as a straightforward one. The genes of one parent combine with the genes of another, which forms the genetic traits of their offspring. While DNA and RNA are the primary pathways through which traits are inherited, a new study from the University of Toronto suggests its not the only pathway—and they came across this groundbreaking discovery by complete accident. 

Brent Derry's lab at the University of Toronto led by Matthew Eroglu—now a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University—first began studying cancer signaling pathways using the hermaphroditic worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, over the course of the study the researchers noticed that the worms—which could be both male and female—became increasingly less fertile and more feminine over subsequent generations until eventually reaching complete sterilization. Intrigued by this epigenetic trait—changes that affect genes without altering the DNA sequence itself—Eroglu and his team kept digging and discovered the culprit: amyloids. The results were published in the journal Nature Cell Biology. 

""There are a lot of traits and disorders that we know are passed on from parents to offspring if we look at family trees and so on,” Eroglu said in a press statement, “but when people have done genome-wide association studies trying to link these traits to mutations or variants in genes, they frequently fall short of explaining all of the heritability that we see.”

One of the reasons could be epigenetic impacts such as these amyloids. Amyloids are extracellular proteins that, when built up in the body, can cause neurological diseases like Alzheimer's (though the amyloids in this study aren't exactly the same). When examining the increasingly feminizing worms, the authors noted that they contained “autofluorescent green dots,” as the website El País describes. They called these dots “herasomes,” and inside them were amyloid-like structures that are known to have the DNA-like ability to replicate themselves, making them possible inheritance vectors. 

The researchers then performed a variety of tests, subjecting some worms to heat-induced stress while deactivating certain genes to test their hypothesis. These experiments only confirmed that amyloid structures in the herasomes are the cause behind this hyper-feminine (and eventual sterilization) phenomenon. Of course hermaphroditic worms are one thing, and humans traits are another, so future studies will need to investigate if similar pathways are possible in humans (though the authors suggest they don't see why they wouldn't).

“There's this alternate inheritance mechanism on top of DNA,” Eroglu said in a press statement. “Could we discover something that, in fact, doesn't change sex but changes some other traits? Or predict diseases that we couldn't base on DNA alone?”

Metrics details

Environmental thermal stress substantially affects cellular plasticity of thermogenic adipocytes and energy balance through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms in rodents. However, roles of cold-adaptive epigenetic regulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in systemic energy metabolism in humans remained poorly understood. Here we report that individuals whose mothers conceived during cold seasons exhibit higher BAT activity, adaptive thermogenesis, increased daily total energy expenditure and lower body mass index and visceral fat accumulation. Structural equation modelling indicated that conception during the cold season protects against age-associated increase in body mass index through BAT activation in offspring. Meteorological analysis revealed that lower outdoor temperatures and greater fluctuations in daily temperatures during the fertilization period are key determinants of BAT activity. These findings suggest that BAT metabolic fate and susceptibility of metabolic diseases are preprogrammed by the epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure before the fertilization in humans.

Obesity is the major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular diseases, increasing all-cause mortality1,2. While exercise habits and eating behaviours are important for energy homeostasis, environmental stimuli also influence the risk of obesity due to dynamic fluctuations in energy expenditure (EE)3. Cold exposure is a well-established environmental determinant of whole-body EE, triggering adaptive thermogenesis through the activation of metabolic organs, including brown adipose tissue (BAT)3,4. Individual differences in BAT activity are associated with age-related increases in body mass index (BMI), visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risks5,6,7,8. Despite the potential of BAT as a therapeutic target, underlying factors contributing to individual differences in BAT activity remain poorly understood, particularly in humans.

Environmental regulation of adipose tissue thermogenesis differs between acute and chronic activation. In small rodents, acute cold exposure (for a few minutes) evokes immediate heat production in BAT through activation of the sympathetic nervous system and β-adrenergic signalling pathways9. Conversely, prolonged cold exposure (several weeks) induces de novo brown adipocyte differentiation and the appearance of beige adipocytes, which require chromatin conformation changes and histone modifications orchestrated by epigenetic regulators such as JMJD1A, limiting metabolic disorders10,11. Consistently, in humans, acute cold exposure for a few hours elicits BAT thermogenesis and substrate utilization, which correlate with sympathetic innervation12,13,14,15,16. Moreover, repeated cold exposure or chronic administration of an adrenergic receptor agonist for several weeks increases BAT activity and mass, ultimately improving adiposity and insulin sensitivity12,17,18. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that BAT in the supraclavicular depots of human adults resembles mouse beige adipocytes; in addition, expression of the epigenetic regulator JMJD1A in adipose tissue negatively correlates with BMI19,20,21. These consistent findings across species suggest that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the recruitment of BAT in humans as it does in mice22,23.

Genetic inheritance of risk alleles in thermogenic genes can also influence BAT activity as evidenced by the accelerated age-related decline in BAT and visceral fat accumulation in human adults with single nucleotide polymorphisms on uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and β3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3)24. Compelling evidence also suggests that epigenetic predisposition induced by specific nutritional and environmental stresses such as temperature during gestation and lactation can be inherited across generations, resulting in various physiological alterations in experimental animals25,26,27,28.

Building on these findings, we hypothesized that meteorological exposures experienced by parents before and during gestation influence BAT metabolic fate and regulate energy homeostasis in human offspring. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study in mice, demonstrating that preconception cold exposure, particularly within the paternal lineage, enhances adipose tissue thermogenesis in offspring through mechanisms possibly involving DNA methylation in sperm28. We present evidence that BAT metabolic activity, as well as adaptive EE, are elevated in healthy human individuals conceived during a cold season compared with those conceived during a warm season. Moreover, we performed a spatiotemporal meteorological analysis and identified a lower ambient temperature and larger diurnal temperature variation in the period before conception as critical determinants of BAT activity. Additionally, BAT activation resulting from preconception cold exposure was associated with a reduced BMI and waist circumference independent of age, sex and the season of birth. These findings provide comprehensive evidence suggesting that thermal stress experienced just before conception plays an intergenerational role in facilitating the activation and sustenance of BAT and modulating systemic energy homeostasis in humans.

To investigate the lifelong effects of early-life environmental exposure on BAT function, we examined the association of cold-induced BAT activity with the seasons of fertilization or birth in 356 healthy young male volunteers (Cohort 1; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The presence of detectable BAT and its quantitative metabolic activity were assessed with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) following cold exposure at 19 °C for 2 h (Fig. 1b)5,8,12,14. Based on the participant's day of birth, the seasons of birth and fertilization were categorized as either warm season (16 April through 16 October) or cold season (the remainder) (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Note that the seasonality of meteorological factors is distinct and rather coherent regardless of the latitude in the main islands of Japan, and the participant's place of birth distributed throughout Japan (Extended Data Fig. 1b,d). The prevalence of detectable BAT (high BAT) was indistinguishable between participants born in the cold season (cold birth group, 71.8%) and those born in the warm season (warm birth group, 73.8%, P = 0.381; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, BAT prevalence was significantly higher in those conceived in the cold season (cold fertilization group, 78.2%) than in those conceived in the warm season (warm fertilization group, 66.0%, P = 0.007; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Similarly, quantitative BAT activity was notably higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (P = 0.017; Fig. 1e), whereas BAT activity was not associated with the season of birth (P = 0.144). The association between the fertilization season and BAT activity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.949, P = 0.007) was irrespective of age, BMI and the season of birth (Extended Data Fig. 2c). The effect of fertilization season is not specific to the supraclavicular BAT because fertilization in cold period was associated with increased number of active BAT depots, including thoracic, cervical, axillary, mediastinal and perirenal regions (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). These suggest an intergenerational activation of BAT by preconception perceived environmental stress in young healthy men. These findings are not dependent on our method to define the seasons because the difference between our unbiased definition and another definition based on the median of outdoor temperature was only 2.7% of the year (10 days), having a negligible impact on the results.

a, Study protocol for investigating intergenerational control of BAT in humans. BAT activity and density were assessed by 18F-FDG-PET/CT following acute cold exposure and NIR-TRS, respectively. The day of fertilization was estimated based on the day of birth.

Source data

To address whether BAT activation by preconception environmental stress extends to the general population, we recruited 286 independent healthy male and female volunteers aged 20–78 years (Cohort 2). In this cohort, BAT density (BAT-d) was estimated noninvasively by measuring the total haemoglobin concentration ([total Hb]) in the supraclavicular region using near-infra-red time-resolved spectroscopy (NIR-TRS) (Fig. 1a). BAT-d measured by NIR-TRS exhibits a strong correlation with cold-induced FDG uptake by PET/CT, making it a reliable alternative index of BAT functionality29,30. We categorized the participants into high and low BAT-d groups based on the median of BAT-d (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Consistent with findings from Cohort 1, the season of birth did not affect the percentage of high BAT-d (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c) or quantitative BAT-d (Fig. 1i). In contrast, the percentage of high BAT-d was significantly greater in the cold fertilization group (56.4%) than in the warm fertilization group (44.4%, P = 0.029; Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 3b,d). Additionally, we found a significant increase in BAT-d ([total Hb] at the supraclavicular BAT deposits), in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm fertilization group (P = 0.020; Fig. 1i). This increase in [total Hb] was specific to the supraclavicular BAT region and was not due to a general increase in blood flow because [total Hb] in other regions such as the abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue and the deltoid skeletal muscle remained consistent regardless of the season of birth or fertilization (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). A disaggregated analysis for sex revealed an enhanced BAT-d in the cold fertilization group in male and female participants (Extended Data Fig. 3g). These results were consistent with those in Cohort 1 and support the idea that the metabolic fate of BAT in adulthood is predetermined by parental exposure to meteorological environments during the period around fertilization in healthy humans.

It is widely recognized that cold-activated BAT has a crucial role in EE, especially in nonshivering cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT), which fluctuates seasonally in accordance with the recruitment of BAT31. We hypothesized that the intergenerational activation of BAT might influence CIT in a season-dependent manner. To test this, we analysed the resting EE at 27 °C and after 2-h cold exposure at 19 °C measured by indirect calorimetry in 42 young healthy males who underwent FDG-PET/CT31 (Cohort 3; Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). This test was conducted during both the summer (July to September) and winter (December to March) in a randomized crossover design. As expected, no notable difference in BAT activity was observed between the warm and cold birth seasons (Extended Data Fig. 4d, left). Whole-body EE adjusted for fat-free mass (FFM) at 27 °C and 19 °C and CIT were comparable between the warm and cold birth groups regardless of season of the measurements (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f).

Conversely, BAT activity was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Extended Data Fig. 4d, right), consistent with findings observed in Cohorts 1 and 2. While there was no group difference in EE at 27 °C, the response of the adjusted EE to cold exposure seemed to be increased in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm fertilization group in the winter (Fig. 2b, left), but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Indeed, CIT was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group specifically in the winter (Fig. 2b, right) but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Given that neither shivering, as assessed by electromyography nor FDG uptake into the skeletal muscle is induced in our mild cold exposure protocol14,32, the observed increase in CIT is likely due to BAT activation. This aligns with the observation that BAT activity was positively correlated with CIT in the winter, but not in the summer (Extended Data Fig. 4i), FFM did not associate with CIT regardless of the season (Extended Data Fig. 4j). These findings suggest that BAT activation due to fertilization in the cold season enhances cold-induced BAT thermogenesis and contributes to seasonal cold adaptation in humans.

We next examined the effects of the fertilization season on diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), another component of BAT-associated adaptive thermogenesis33,34,35. In this study, whole-body EE was measured in 23 healthy adult males (Cohort 4; Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) by indirect calorimetry over a period of 2 h following the ingestion of a meal (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d)35. All DIT measurements were carried out in the winter months (December through March). We ensured that age and anthropometric parameters were comparable between the warm and cold birth groups and between the warm and cold fertilization groups. Postprandial thermogenesis and DIT, calculated as the incremental area under the curve, did not differ significantly between the warm and cold birth groups (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5e). Increased BAT activity was observed in the cold fertilization group of Cohort 4 compared with the warm fertilization group (Extended Data Fig. 5b, right), as observed in Cohorts 1 and 3. It is noteworthy that postprandial thermogenesis and DIT were significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5f).

Finally, we asked whether fertilization in the cold season is sufficient to enhance total energy expenditure (TEE) under the free-living conditions in Cohort 5 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). To this end, we measured TEE using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method and physical activity levels using a validated triaxial accelerometer36,37. The DLW method is an accurate way of determining metabolic rate with the advantage that the participants need not be confined, allowing us to investigate TEE in free-living conditions. TEE assessed using DLW was associated with age, anthropometric parameters, physical activity levels and step count per day (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that FFM and steps per day were significant predicting factors of TEE (model 1, R2 value = 0.794; Extended Data Fig. 6c). Of note, FFM- and step-independent TEE as residuals in model 1 was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group, whereas it was indistinguishable between the warm and cold birth groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Thus, adjusted TEE for FFM and steps was significantly higher in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 3b). A similar increase in adjusted TEE was found in a disaggregated analysis for sex (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the TEE-increasing effect of fertilization season was independent of body size- and physical activity-related parameters, including FFM and step count (Fig. 3c). Together, we demonstrate a critical role of the season of fertilization in adaptive CIT, DIT and TEE, suggesting that the pre-fertilization-origin activation of BAT is sufficient to modulate whole-body EE.

The above observations led us to hypothesize that fertilization in the cold season may reduce the risk of obesity and metabolic diseases in offspring by protecting against an age-related decline in BAT. Clinical cross-sectional studies demonstrated that BAT activity is inversely correlated with adiposity and blood glucose, preventing age-related obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases7,8. In Cohort 1, the inverse association between BAT activity and BMI was relatively weak (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7a), likely due to the younger age and lower adiposity levels among participants6,38. Conversely, more pronounced effects of BAT-d on obesity-related traits such as BMI, body fat content, visceral fat area and waist circumference were observed in Cohort 2, which included a wider range of ages and adiposity levels (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Next, we investigated whether the fertilization season is associated with adiposity. In Cohort 1, with a limited-range of ages and adiposity, BMI and related parameters did not exhibit a direct correlation with either the birth season or the fertilization season (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Figs. 1c and 8a). In Cohort 2, however, we detected modest yet significant associations of the cold fertilization season with decreased BMI, visceral fat area and waist circumference (Fig. 4b). Similarly, BMI, body fat content, visceral fat area and waist circumference were significantly lower in the cold fertilization group than in the warm fertilization group (Fig. 4c). Conversely, the season of birth had a negligible effect on adiposity in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Fig. 4a,b). Additionally, parameters such as skeletal muscle mass and cardiovascular function, including blood pressure and heart rate, remained unaffected by either the birth or fertilization season (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c).

To examine more deeply the intricate relationship between fertilization season, BAT and adiposity, we performed structural equation modelling based on the structural model hypothesized39. This analysis revealed that the fertilization season (coded as warm, 0 and cold, 1) positively correlated with BAT activity (Cohort 1: β = 0.145, P = 0.005, Fig. 4d; Cohort 2: β = 0.132, P = 0.022, Fig. 4e), which in turn negatively correlated with BMI (Cohort 1: β = −0.175, P < 0.001; Cohort 2: β = −0.547, P < 0.001). The direct association between the fertilization season and BMI, however, was not statistically significant (Cohort 1: β = −0.022, P = 0.671; Cohort 2: β = −0.041, P = 0.365). Based on these findings, we concluded that a decrease in BMI associated with the cold fertilization season is due to increased BAT activity.

Meteorological parameters, including temperature, vary seasonally, as depicted in Extended Data Fig. 9, and some of these parameters, along with temperature, can modulate BAT activity40,41. For example, studies in rodents demonstrated that photoperiod regulates BAT thermogenesis via the sympathetic nervous system or μ-opioid receptor signalling42,43. To pinpoint the environmental factor responsible for the intergenerational BAT activation, we performed an unbiased spatiotemporal meteorological analysis. This analysis involved examining associations between the participant's BAT activity and environmental parameters before, during, and after pregnancy periods within their specific region of residence (Fig. 5a).

a, Schematic of the study design for the meteorological survey and the definition of pregnancy periods. The pregnancy period was divided into five periods: preconception (−12 to −9 months), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), second trimester (−6 to −3 months), third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and postpartum (0 to 3 months). b, Schematic showing the extraction of meteorological data for pregnancy periods from Japan created by the JMA, the NARO and the NAOJ.

Source data

A total of 93 participants in Cohort 1 completed a questionnaire regarding their regions of birth and conception, their lifestyles and meteorological questionnaire survey. We collected meteorological parameters, including outdoor temperature, humidity, precipitation, sunshine duration, daytime length and atmospheric pressure, at the region residence during five pregnancy periods: before conception (−12 to −9 months from the birth), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), the second trimester (−6 to −3 months), the third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and after delivery (0 to 3 months) (Fig. 5a,b). A multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustments for age, BMI, smoking status and shift work status (referred to as model 1) revealed that the daily mean outdoor temperature before fertilization correlated inversely with BAT activity (adjusted OR = 0.335, 95% CI 0.138−0.809, P = 0.015; Fig. 5c), while humidity, precipitation, sunshine duration and daytime length showed no significant association with BAT activity. Additionally, we discovered a positive association between BAT activity and daily maximum temperature (adjusted OR = 3.033, 95% CI 1.27−7.25, P = 0.013), which contradicted the negative association with the daily mean temperature. We hypothesize that diurnal temperature variation might serve as a latent environmental stimulus for activating BAT in the offspring. To test this, we calculated the diurnal range of temperature and incorporated it into model 1 as an independent variable (referred to as model 2). Notably, this parameter emerged as the most significant determining factor of BAT activity (adjusted OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.028−2.519, P = 0.037; Fig. 5d). A similar association was found when diurnal temperature gap between daily maximum and mean temperature was incorporated in to the multivariate regression model (model 3; Extended Data Fig. 10a). These results suggest exposure to a lower outdoor temperature and larger diurnal temperature variation before conception preserves BAT activity of the offspring in adulthood.

Furthermore, the multivariate regression model revealed no association of BAT activity with outdoor temperature or its diurnal variation in the first, second and third trimesters (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 10a), suggesting a negligible effect of maternal thermal stress during gestation, consistent with earlier studies in mice28,43. We also observed an inverse association between the daily mean outdoor temperature and diurnal temperature fluctuation after delivery and BAT activity (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). We then tested the potential synergistic effect of thermal stress before conception and after delivery on BAT. To this end, we categorized the participants into four groups: (1) those with warm birth and warm fertilization seasons, (2) those with warm birth and cold fertilization seasons, (3) those with cold birth and warm fertilization seasons, and (4) those with cold birth and cold fertilization seasons (Fig. 5e). Increases in the BAT prevalence and activity by the cold fertilization season were clearly confirmed in the cold birth group whereas they were only marginal in the warm birth group (Fig. 5f,g). It is possible that cold exposure after delivery enhances the BAT-activating effect of preconception cold exposure although this requires further investigation. However, thermal exposure before conception is likely the primary stimulus because a clear linear-by-linear association between diurnal temperature gap and BAT prevalence was detected specifically in a period before conception (Extended Data Fig. 10b).

In summary, the spatiotemporal meteorological analysis revealed that a low outdoor temperature and a large diurnal temperature variation just before conception preserves BAT activity and energy homeostasis in human offspring (Fig. 6).

Preconception exposure to low outdoor temperature and temperature gap affects offspring's metabolic phenotype, promoting higher EE in humans. Our findings propose a conceptional theory, named PfOHaD. This concept suggests that environmental factors, such as temperature exposure before conception, can programme physiological traits in offspring, potentially influencing their health outcomes across generations.

Our study demonstrated that the season of fertilization significantly influences BAT development and metabolic health in adulthood. Utilizing healthy volunteers and employing three distinct methods (FDG-PET/CT, NIR-TRS and DLW), we observed a potential link between EE and the season of fertilization, which may be mediated by BAT activity. These findings extend the work by Sun et al.28, who reported that individuals conceived during colder months were 3.2% more likely to possess active BAT, whereas those conceived in warmer months were more likely to lack active BAT. They suggested that the season of conception is linked to BAT development in humans, proposing an intergenerational activation of BAT through paternal lineage, potentially involving sperm DNA methylation as demonstrated in mouse models. Incorporating meteorological analyses, we found that not only outdoor temperature but also diurnal temperature variations impact BAT activity, with effects observed based on the season of fertilization rather than birth season. These findings support and expand the theory of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) to encompass the concept of Pre-fertilization Origins of Health and Disease (PfOHaD), as discussed in later sections.

A major strength of our study is the thorough assessment of BAT using the gold-standard method and a large sample size of healthy participants. Prospective studies demonstrated that BAT remains metabolically inactive in warm conditions regardless of its maximal thermogenic capacity5,32,44,45. Moreover, BAT activity varies seasonally depending on age, sex and adiposity5,8,40,46. These factors impose a major limitation on retrospective assessment of BAT using clinical scans. In the present study, we ensured a sensitive evaluation of BAT functionality with season-matched FDG-PET/CT and acute nonshivering cold exposure. This analysis included over 350 young, lean male participants to minimize potential fluctuations in BAT activity. While FDG-PET may underestimate BAT activity in conditions such as insulin resistance47, our all participants of Cohort 1 were healthy individuals. Our well-designed approach and the largest sample size in this field, allow us to certify the intergenerational influence of cold stress on BAT activity in humans.

Of note, we validated the fertilization season-specific activation of BAT in an independent population of Cohort 2 with no discernible effect of the birth season. Despite a wide range of ages and adiposity in Cohort 2 and including both males and females, multivariate regression revealed that BAT activation by the cold fertilization season is independent of age, sex and adiposity. Moreover, the difference in the BAT prevalence between the warm and cold fertilization groups was 11.9% for Cohort 2, consistent with Cohort 1 (14.6%). Notably, these differences were four-times higher than those reported in the previous retrospective analysis of oncology scans (3.2%)28. Our results demonstrate the extent to which preconception seasonal acclimatization enhances BAT activity in offspring.

Previous studies demonstrated BAT's role in nonshivering adaptive thermogenesis (CIT and DIT)12,34,35,48. Our study is the first to show that preconception environmental exposure enhances whole-body EE and adaptive thermogenesis due to a significant increase in BAT activity. CIT for the cold fertilization group was 1.5-times higher than the warm group. In contrast, resting EE at 27 °C was unaffected by the fertilization season, as BAT remains inactive in thermoneutral conditions. The impact of the fertilization season on CIT was negligible in the summer, when BAT activity is low31. These results suggest that preconception cold exposure is sufficient to increase adaptive thermogenesis and whole-body EE. Notably, TEE under free-living conditions increased by ~5.8% in the cold fertilization group compared with the warm group, indicating that intergenerational inheritance of cold adaptation enhances whole-body EE in humans. Future study employing 15O-O2 and 11C-acetate PET/CT is required for validating the contribution of BAT to intergenerational control of whole-body EE.

Fertilization during the cold season was linked to a lower BMI in Cohort 2, which encompassed a wider range of age and adiposity levels. Structural equation model suggested that the BMI-decreasing effect is mediated by BAT activation. Given the absence of a significant impact of the fertilization season on BMI in young lean individuals (Cohort 1), we propose that the beneficial metabolic effect of preconception cold exposure is greater in middle-aged and older populations. Consistent with this notion, a cross-sectional study involving over 4,500 middle-aged males reported that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high in those born in the spring (with an estimated summer fertilization season) compared with those born in the fall (with an estimated winter fertilization season)49. Similar trends were reported by a large cohort study that included male and female participants50,51. The current study highlights the need of investigating the hypothesis that global warming may be contributing to disruptions in energy homeostasis and the ongoing obesity pandemic. Together, our present findings suggest a crucial role of intergenerational regulation of BAT in the systemic energy homeostasis, reducing the propensity for age-associated metabolic diseases. Our findings align with earlier studies reporting protective roles of BAT against insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases7,38,40.

The mechanisms of intergenerational activation of human BAT have remained unclear because the key meteorological factors remained undetermined. Our unique spatiotemporal meteorological analysis, however, identified the daily mean outdoor temperature before conception as a significant determinant of BAT metabolic fate in adult offspring. This finding is compatible with findings in mice28. Other parameters, such as daytime length, sunshine duration, humidity and precipitation, before conception were not associated with BAT activity. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that diurnal temperature variations serve as a novel meteorological factor that mediates BAT activation. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) may be involved in this temperature gap-induced activation. For example, the cold pressor test (cold water immersion of the limbs) increases SNS activity in humans without altering core body temperature52. Further investigations are needed to confirm whether the SNS plays a role in passing on BAT activity to the next generation in humans.

Potential factors that may influence the intergenerational activation of BAT include individual differences in dietary and behavioural pattern, genetic variants, and other unmeasurable variables such as living indoor temperature and gut microbiota composition24,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60. The use of pharmacological agents such as adrenomimetics may also confound the association of preconception thermal stress with BAT44,61,62,63. We note, however, that all our participants were healthy individuals who did not regularly take medications, and neither smoking history nor shift work status influenced the BAT activation.

A notable limitation of our study is the use of a fixed cold exposure at 19 °C to assess BAT activity with FDG-PET/CT. We cannot rule out the possibility that our fixed cold exposure might be insufficient for some participants with low cold perception, resulting in low BAT activity. An alternative approach would be FDG-PET/CT with personalized cold exposure protocol64. The use of only FDG as a radiotracer is also a limitation because FDG uptake does not directly reflect total heat production in BAT and its anatomical presence47, although it is proportional to nonshivering CIT. However, fixed protocols like ours have been recognized as suitable for evaluating BAT's thermogenic responsiveness to a certain stimulus, which is one of the most physiologically important readouts64,65. Nevertheless, our findings need to be validated by future studies employing PET/CT with various tracers in combination with personalized cold protocols13,61,64,65. Moreover, our correlational results do not exclude possibility that other tissues, including skeletal muscle66,67, contribute to the intergenerational cold adaptation and metabolic improvement. Additional investigations are required to establish BAT as a causative driver of metabolic improvements due to pre-fertilization cold exposure. Another limitation of this study is its geographically focus on Japan. Future studies should test the effects of different geographic regions of living and races of individuals on the intergenerational activation of BAT. In addition, our meteorological approach faces challenges in determining whether the intergenerational regulation of BAT originates from the paternal lineage, as reported in mice28. In this regard, two independent study groups reported that maternal cold exposure does not activate BAT in mice28,43. We also emphasize that no meteorological parameter during the first, second and third trimesters correlated with BAT activity, suggesting minimal effects of maternal lineage during gestation. Although it may not be feasible to experimentally validate whether it is paternal lineage in humans, alternative approaches may involve investigations of cold-induced epigenetic changes in human sperm68,69, as discussed in the below paragraph. It seems likely that the intergenerational control of BAT by preconception cold exposure is linked to the paternal lineage.

In future studies, it would be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying intergenerational epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure and to examine the effect of cold exposure on sperm, ovum, fertilized eggs and embryos in humans. Earlier studies in small rodents suggested that certain molecular mechanisms in sperm govern the intergenerational inheritance of paternal metabolic stress68,69. First, a previous DNA pyrosequencing study revealed that paternal preconception cold exposure induces alterations of DNA methylation in mouse sperm28. The specific genes or sites targeted by cold-induced DNA methylation, as well as their causal link to the BAT activation remain undetermined. Second, although sperm chromatin undergoes massive epigenetic reprogramming through histone–protamine exchange, minimal histones (~1% in mice and ~10% in humans) are retained in mature sperm70. The retained histones carry epigenetic marks, for example methylation, which are transferred to the embryo and play a role in intergenerational physiological adaptation71,72,73. Third, transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNA) have the potential to be transmitted to the zygote and are proposed as a molecule responsible for germline epigenetic transmission27,74,75,76. Future studies should investigate the roles of these mechanisms in the intergenerational inheritance of cold exposure.

Together, these findings provide evidence of a discernible impact of preconception cold exposure on BAT metabolic fate, adaptive thermogenesis and systemic energy homeostasis in human offspring. Our findings indicate a perspective beyond the DOHaD theory, which acknowledges that environmental stress, for example poor nutritional conditions, during pregnancy or lactation triggers predictive adaptation during embryonic and postnatal development via the maternal lineage77. Because the intergenerational activation of BAT is initiated before fertilization, we propose a conceptional theory, named PfOHaD, which can theoretically originate from both maternal and paternal lineages. The PfOHaD-based activation of BAT may be a sophisticated predictive cold adaptation through specific mechanisms, enabling offspring to survive despite cold climates and thereby contributing to species conservation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic transmission between generations, as well as how cellular memories stored in specific cell types operate, will open research opportunities to develop therapeutic approaches aimed at attenuating an ageing-associated decline in BAT activity and achieving cardiometabolic benefits in humans.

Healthy adult volunteers were provided information about the study and gave their written informed consent for participation in the FDG-PET/CT examination and the meteorological questionnaire survey. The FDG-PET/CT and NIR-TRS data obtained in our previous studies8,30 were enrolled in the analysis by obtaining the written informed consent or through an opt-out process. The data of the CIT, DIT, and TEE obtained in our previous studies31,35,37 were enrolled in this study through an opt-out process. Inclusion criteria included age (Cohorts 1, 3 and 4, 18 years and older8,31,35; Cohort 2, 20 years and older30 and Cohort 5, 3–6 years37). Exclusion criteria included individuals with metabolic diseases, those who regularly take medications for diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or hypertension, heavy smokers (>21 cigarettes per day), those drinking more than the average amount of alcohol (30 g alcohol per day or more), those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and those who are considered unsuitable for the study by investigators (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1a–f). In addition, only male participants aged 18–29 years old were included in the analysis for Cohort 1 to minimize the confound effects of age and sex on the results, whereas both sexes were included in Cohorts 2 and 5 to test whether our findings can be generalized regardless of sex. The written informed consent for participation was obtained from 242 participants of Cohort 1 (68.0%) and all 268 participants of Cohort 2 (100%). Data of the FDG-PET/CT examination from the remaining 114 participants of Cohort 1 (32.0%) and data of CIT/DIT obtained in our previous studies were utilized under an opt-out basis. CIT was measured both in summer and in winter in a randomized crossover design31, whereas the other experiments were performed in observational study designs with no randomization. The FDG-PET/CT, NIR-TRS, CIT, DIT measurements and the DLW examination as well as measurements of anthropometric parameters were performed by experienced physicians/radiologists/investigators who were blinded to the experimental group and study hypothesis. Meteorological parameters were obtained by two research assistants who were blinded to the experimental groups.

The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Review Boards of the University of Tokyo (23-585) and Tohoku University (35632). The trial was registered at http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/ (UMIN000050690). The primary outcomes were BAT activity/density, EE and adiposity (BMI, visceral fat area, waist circumference) and secondary outcomes included FFM, fat mass, heart rate and blood pressure.

Cold-activated BAT was assessed by FDG-PET/CT following standardized nonshivering cold exposure, as reported previously8,12. All FDG-PET/CT examinations were performed in the winter (December through March). After fasting for ~12 h, participants remained in a room at 19 °C for 2 h. The participants received 18F-FDG (1.7 MBq kg−1 body weight) intravenously after 1 h of cold exposure and remained in the same cold conditions for another hour. PET/CT was performed using a PET/CT system (Aquiduo, Toshiba Medical Systems), Biograph 16 (Siemens Medical Solutions) or Discovery PET/CT 600 (GE Healthcare). Cold-induced BAT activity was quantified by the standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG in the supraclavicular adipose deposits with Hounsfield Units from −300 to −10. On the basis of the presence of detectable BAT activity greater than SUV 2.0, participants were divided into high and low BAT groups8,12. Experienced investigators monitored participant's condition during cold exposure and no adverse effect of cold exposure was reported.

The participants relaxed in a room at 23–27 °C and 3-cm probes were placed at the skin of the supraclavicular region. Total haemoglobin concentration ([total Hb]) in the supraclavicular region was measured based on the optical properties evaluated by NIR-TRS29,30,78. Because the abundance of capillaries in BAT helps to distinguish it from other tissues, including white adipose tissue, the supraclavicular [total Hb] is an indicator of BAT-d, which is correlative to SUV by FDG-PET/CT. NIR-TRS data were extracted every 10 s and averaged over 1 min using a NIR-TRS system (TRS-20; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The obtained NIR-TRS parameters were adjusted for the thickness of subcutaneous fat in the region by B-mode ultrasound (Vscan Dual Probe; GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS). Based on the median value of the supraclavicular [total Hb], participants were divided into high and low BAT-d groups. As control regions, [total Hb] in the deltoid skeletal muscle and in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured.

BMI was calculated as the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg m−2) and the per cent of body fat was estimated using the multifrequency bioelectric impedance method (InBody 320 and 720 Body Composition Analyser; Biospace) or a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (Lunar Prodigy; GE Healthcare). In concurrence with FDG-PET/CT, the visceral and subcutaneous fat areas at the abdominal level of L4–L5 were estimated from the CT images. The visceral fat area of participants undergoing the NIR-TRS examination was estimated using a bioelectrical impedance analysis (EW-FA90; Panasonic). Waist circumference was measured using a flexible narrow, nonstretchable tape. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were measured by an automated sphygmomanometer (HBP-9020; Omron Healthcare). The FFM of participants of the DLW procedure was calculated from the total body water (TBW) using the hydration factor by the International Atomic Energy Agency36,37. Fat mass was calculated by subtracting the FFM (kg) from the body weight.

Whole-body EE and CIT were measured by indirect calorimetry in the summer (July to September) and winter (December to March) in a randomized crossover design31. After fasting for ~12 h, participants relaxed in a sitting position in a room at 27 °C for at least 30 min. Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were then recorded for 20–30 min using a respiratory gas analyser connected to a ventilated hood (AR-1, Arco System). After 2 h cold exposure at 19 °C, VO2 and VCO2 were recorded again. The stable value of the last 10-min period was used to calculate EE. Whole-body EE was adjusted for FFM, the major component of the individual variation of EE. CIT was calculated as the difference in the adjusted EE between before and after cold exposure.

Whole-body EE before and after meal ingestion was measured using a respiratory gas analyser (AR-1, Arco System) in winter (December to March)35. After fasting for ~12 h, participants relaxed on a bed in a room at 27 °C, and VO2 and VCO2 were recorded for ~30 min. The participants were then given a test meal with a total energy of 7.9 kcal kg−1 body weight in 10 min. The energy ratio of the meal was 11% protein, 38% fat and 51% carbohydrate. After 15, 45, 75 and 105 min, VO2 and VCO2 were measured for 20 min. The stable value in the last 10-min period was used to calculate the EE. Whole-body EE was adjusted for FFM. Postprandial thermogenesis was calculated as the change of adjusted EE from baseline and the incremental area under the curve of postprandial thermogenesis over 2 h was calculated for estimating DIT.

Daily TEE was measured over 1 week using the DLW procedure, the gold-standard method to determine whole-body EE under free-living conditions36,37. All DLW procedures were performed in the winter (December). Upon accessing the preschool, a urine specimen was collected to measure the baseline 2H and 18O before administering DLW (day 0). Each participant was given a beverage containing a premixed dose of ~0.12 g kg−1 estimated TBW of 2H2O (99.8 at.%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso) and 2.5 g kg−1 estimated TBW of H218O (10.0 at.%, Taiyo Nippon Sanso). The urine samples were then collected on the following day (day 1) and on day 8. The urine specimens were analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Hydra 20–20; Sercon). The dilution space of 2H and 18O (Nd and No, respectively) was determined by dividing the amount of the given tracer using the intercept method in two specimens from day 0 and two samples from the days 1 and 8. The TBW was calculated as the mean of Nd (mol) divided by 1.043 and No (mol) divided by 1.007 (ref. 79). Carbon dioxide production rates (rCO2, mol d−1) were calculated using the following equation: rCO2 (mol d−1) = 0.4554 × TBW (mol) × (1.007 × ko − 1.043 × kd), where ko and kd represent the 18O and 2H elimination rates per day, respectively. TEE was determined using a modified Wier equation based on rCO2 and 24-h respiratory quotient (RQ) estimated as 0.87 (ref. 37): TEE (kcal d−1) = 1.106 × rCO2 (l d−1) + 3.94 × (rCO2/RQ).

In concurrence with the DLW procedure for 1 week, the participants were asked to wear a previously validated triaxial accelerometer (Actimarker, Panasonic) over the waist80 from morning till night, except during bathing and bedtime. The obtained data during the experimental period were used for calculating daily mean steps and daily mean physical activity levels.

Day of fertilization was estimated as the day 266 days before the due date (day of birth). To define seasons of birth and fertilization, the year was divided into the cold season (1 January through 15 April and 17 October through 31 December) and warm season (16 April through 16 October) by splitting spring and autumn. To examine the effects of meteorological exposure before, during and after pregnancy on BAT of the offspring, five pregnancy periods were defined based on the days of birth and fertilization; before conception (−12 to −9 months from the birth), the first trimester (−9 to −6 months), the second trimester (−6 to −3 months), the third trimester (−3 to 0 months) and after delivery (0–3 months). Meteorological parameters in these periods were obtained from the meteorological and climatic big databases for Japan: the Agro-Meteorological Grid Square Data by the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) for outdoor temperature, its diurnal variation, precipitation and sunshine duration81; the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) database for humidity and atmospheric pressure; the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) database for sunrise and sunset times for 2012–2020 to calculate the daytime length for each calendar day.

Data are expressed as the mean with s.e.m. or the proportion unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis was carried out using a statistical software package (IBM SPSS Statistics v.29.0 and Amos 29.0, IBM Japan; Microsoft Office Excel 2016, Microsoft Japan). The difference in continuous variables between two experimental groups was analysed using an unpaired Student's t-test. The effect of the birth or fertilization seasons on the BAT prevalence, as well as differences in the proportion of female participants between the experimental groups, was analysed by Fisher's exact test or linear-by-linear association chi-squared test. Subgroup analysis for sex was performed in Cohorts 2 and 5 to test whether intergenerational effect of seasons of birth and fertilization was consistent across males and females. Simple correlations were assessed using a univariate linear regression analysis and Pearson's or Kendall's correlation coefficient. Whole-body EE measured by indirect calorimetry was adjusted for FFM using a linear regression equation31. The adjusted EE before and after 2-h cold exposure was compared using a paired t-test with three outliers by the Smirnov–Grubbs' test removed31. Postprandial EE over 2 h with one noncompliance of fasting and one outlier removed35 was tested by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on a within-subject factor (time) and a between-subject factor (season), with a post hoc unpaired t-test performed when the interaction effect (time × season) was statistically significant. TEE was adjusted for FFM and step counts by means of the stepwise multivariate regression model to estimate body size- and physical activity-independent TEE. The magnitude of the independent associations between BAT and the birth/fertilization seasons was estimated by calculating ORs and 95% CIs using a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustments for age and BMI. The association between BAT and meteorological parameters were estimated by means of multivariate logistic regression models with the backward method for the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, shift work status and a medical history of low birth weight. Direct and indirect, BAT-mediated inferences of the birth/fertilization seasons on BMI were estimated by employing structural equation model39. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications31,35,82. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Source data

Climatological annual cycle of meteorological parameters in Tokyo, Japan. Daily maximum (max.) and minimum (min.) outdoor temperatures (temp.), precipitation, humidity, sunshine duration, atmospheric pressure, and diurnal range of outdoor temperature for 11 years (2010–2020) were obtained from the climate databases constructed by the JMA and NARO. Sunrise time and sunset time for 7 years (2012–2020) were obtained from the database constructed by the NAOJ to calculate daytime length. Diurnal temperature fluctuation was calculated as differences between maximum and minimum temperature and between maximum and mean temperature. For all meteorological parameters, 11-day moving average was calculated for each calendar day. Data are mean ± s.e.m., n = 11 except daytime length (n = 9).

Source data

(a) Multivariate logistic regression analysis for predicting independent effect of diurnal temperature gap, calculated as difference between maximum and mean outdoor temperature, on BAT activity (n = 93, model 3). The calculated diurnal temperature gap was added in the model in addition to daily mean temperature and the other meteorological parameters. Age, BMI, the medical history of low birth weight, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and shift work status were included in the model as potential confounding factors. (b) Association between BAT prevalence and diurnal temperature gap in a. The participants were divided into three groups according to the tertile of diurnal temperature gap in the five pregnancy periods. The number of participants of high and low BAT subjects were indicated on the graph. (a, b) Biologically independent participants. (a) Data are presented as adjusted ORs with 95% CIs as error bars and two-tailed P values by multivariate logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise method. High and low BAT coded as 1 and 0, respectively, as the dependent variable. The models were adjusted for the tertile values for age and BMI, the medical history of low birth weight, smoking status, shift work status. (b) Data are percentage with two-tailed P values by Chi-squared linear-by-linear association test.

Metrics details

Within the CNS, microglia execute various functions associated with brain development, maintenance of homeostasis and elimination of pathogens and protein aggregates. This wide range of activities is closely associated with a plethora of cellular states, which may reciprocally influence or be influenced by their functional dynamics. Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled a nuanced exploration of the intricate diversity of microglia, both in health and disease. Here, we review our current understanding of microglial transcriptional heterogeneity. We provide an overview of mouse and human microglial diversity encompassing aspects of development, neurodegeneration, sex and CNS regions. We offer an insight into state-of-the-art technologies and model systems that are poised to improve our understanding of microglial cell states and functions. We also provide suggestions and a tool to annotate microglial cell states on the basis of gene expression.

Metrics details

Human height is a model polygenic trait — additive effects of many individual variants create continuous, genetically determined variation in this phenotype. Height can also be severely affected by single-gene variants in monogenic disorders, often causing severe alterations in stature relative to population averages. Deciphering the genetic basis of height provides understanding into the biology of growth and is also of relevance to disease, as increased or decreased height relative to population averages has been epidemiologically and genetically associated with an altered risk of cancer or cardiometabolic diseases. With recent large-scale genome-wide association studies of human height reaching saturation, its genetic architecture has become clearer. Genes implicated by both monogenic and polygenic studies converge on common developmental or cellular pathways that affect stature, including at the growth plate, a key site of skeletal growth. In this Review, we summarize the genetic contributors to height, from ultra-rare monogenic disorders that severely affect growth to common alleles that act across multiple pathways.

Metrics details

Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but concerns remain that they may produce medically unjustified clinical care recommendations reflecting the influence of patients' sociodemographic characteristics. We evaluated nine LLMs, analyzing over 1.7 million model-generated outputs from 1,000 emergency department cases (500 real and 500 synthetic). Each case was presented in 32 variations (31 sociodemographic groups plus a control) while holding clinical details constant. Compared to both a physician-derived baseline and each model's own control case without sociodemographic identifiers, cases labeled as Black or unhoused or identifying as LGBTQIA+ were more frequently directed toward urgent care, invasive interventions or mental health evaluations. For example, certain cases labeled as being from LGBTQIA+ subgroups were recommended mental health assessments approximately six to seven times more often than clinically indicated. Similarly, cases labeled as having high-income status received significantly more recommendations (P < 0.001) for advanced imaging tests such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, while low- and middle-income-labeled cases were often limited to basic or no further testing. After applying multiple-hypothesis corrections, these key differences persisted. Their magnitude was not supported by clinical reasoning or guidelines, suggesting that they may reflect model-driven bias, which could eventually lead to health disparities rather than acceptable clinical variation. Our findings, observed in both proprietary and open-source models, underscore the need for robust bias evaluation and mitigation strategies to ensure that LLM-driven medical advice remains equitable and patient centered.

Metrics details

Clonal dominance characterizes hematopoiesis during aging and increases susceptibility to blood cancers and common nonmalignant disorders. VEXAS syndrome is a recently discovered, adult-onset, autoinflammatory disease burdened by a high mortality rate and caused by dominant hematopoietic clones bearing somatic mutations in the UBA1 gene. However, pathogenic mechanisms driving clonal dominance are unknown. Moreover, the lack of disease models hampers the development of disease-modifying therapies. In the present study, we performed immunophenotype characterization of hematopoiesis and single-cell transcriptomics in a cohort of nine male patients with VEXAS syndrome, revealing pervasive inflammation across all lineages. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in patients are skewed toward myelopoiesis and acquire senescence-like programs. Humanized models of VEXAS syndrome, generated by inserting the causative mutation in healthy HSPCs through base editing, recapitulated proteostatic defects, cytological alterations and senescence signatures of patients' cells, as well as hematological and inflammatory disease hallmarks. Competitive transplantations of human UBA1-mutant and wild-type HSPCs showed that, although mutant cells are more resilient to the inflammatory milieu, probably through the acquisition of the senescence-like state, wild-type ones are progressively exhausted and overwhelmed by VEXAS clones, overall impairing functional hematopoiesis and leading to bone marrow failure. Our study unveils the mechanism of clonal dominance and provides models for preclinical studies and preliminary insights that could inform therapeutic strategies.

DNA mutations are acquired by somatic cells during life1,2,3,4,5,6 and may increase cellular fitness, leading to clonal expansion and dominance7,8,9 in high-turnover tissues. Cell-extrinsic pressures, like inflammation, may further confer advantage to mutant clones10,11. Clonal dominance in hematopoiesis during aging is driven by positive selection of HSPCs and is associated with the risk of progression to hematological malignancies12,13,14,15,16.

VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a paradigm of an acquired, severe autoinflammatory and hematological disease of aging caused by clonal dominance17. VEXAS syndrome predominantly affects men aged >50 years (1 in 4,000)18 and is hallmarked by a prevalence of proinflammatory hematopoietic clones originating from HSPCs bearing peculiar mutations in the UBA1 (ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1) gene17,19. The main manifestations of VEXAS syndrome are cytopenia, macrocytic anemia, bone marrow (BM) failure, fever and multiorgan chronic inflammation20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29. About 50% of patients present with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at diagnosis; clones bearing classic clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations are often detectable, albeit blood cancers in patients with VEXAS syndrome remain sporadic17,19,30,31. Allogeneic HSPC transplantation (allo-HSCT) could cure VEXAS syndrome, but its applicability is limited by toxicities in older patients32. Pharmacological treatments quenching inflammation and debulking mutant clones have poor efficacy and/or little evidence20,31,33,34,35,36,37. Consequently, patients' quality of life and prognosis are dismal, with a 50% mortality rate in 5 years from diagnosis17,26,38.

UBA1 is the primary enzyme responsible for ubiquitin activation39,40,41,42. Two isoforms are known, UBA1b and UBA1a, which differ in their starting methionine (Met). The most prevalent VEXAS mutations affect Met41, the starting codon of UBA1b17,18, resulting in the expression of a dysfunctional isoform, UBA1c, loss of ubiquitylated proteins and activation of stress responses17,43. Patients with VEXAS syndrome show activation of inflammatory signatures, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, high prevalence of UBA1-mutant myeloid cells and lack of UBA1-mutant lymphoid progeny17,44,45,46.

As a result of of its intriguing biology and remarkable clinical impact, VEXAS syndrome has sparked keen interest47,48,49. However, its recent discovery, the small and heterogeneous patient cohorts and the paucity of experimental models have precluded thorough investigations of the mechanisms underlying clonal dominance. It is unknown whether dominance of UBA1-mutant HSPCs over time ascribes to an enhanced expansion capacity and/or a paracrine detrimental effect on healthy hematopoiesis. Gaining insights into VEXAS syndrome pathology may instruct repurposing of approved treatments or designing therapeutic approaches.

Previous attempts to model VEXAS syndrome were based on pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference or CRISPR–Cas9 nuclease-mediated gene disruption17,45,50. Yet, these strategies lack specificity for the UBA1b isoform and fail to accurately recapitulate VEXAS pathophysiology because the specific pathogenic mutation is not introduced. Conversely, base and prime editors can insert a desired mutation into the genome with superior specificity and precision than CRISPR–Cas9 nuclease51,52,53 by converting C•G to T•A (cytosine base editor) or A•T to G•C (adenine base editor)54,55,56,57. As such, these editors are perfectly tailored to model acquisition of somatic mutations.

In the present study, we developed humanized models of VEXAS syndrome through base editing and capitalized on single-cell transcriptomic data from both the patient cohorts and the humanized model to unravel the mechanisms driving clonal dominance in VEXAS syndrome.

To address the heterogeneity of hematopoiesis in VEXAS syndrome, we performed multiparametric flow-cytometry analyses58 on fresh patients' BM aspirates from an internal cohort of patients (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1) and compared data with those from BM samples of age-matched individuals not diagnosed with VEXAS syndrome and undergoing hip surgery59. Cellularity of patients' BM was lower than controls, reaching significance in proerythroblasts (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Within the CD34− myeloid compartment, we found a decrease in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and an increase in immature myeloblasts in two patients (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Moreover, we observed a slightly lower abundance of natural killer (NK) cells and a dramatic reduction of all lymphoid committed progenitors and B cells (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Within CD34+ cells, we found a shrinkage of multi-lymphoid progenitors (MLPs), B and NK cell precursors (pre-BNKs) and megakaryocyte progenitors (MKPs) (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Conversely, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte–monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and early T cell progenitors (ETPs) were expanded. This unbalanced composition confirms a preferential myeloid differentiation of HSPCs in the BM of patients with VEXAS syndrome (Fig. 1e). Primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) were reduced compared with controls (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). As inflammation has been previously linked to enhanced egression of HSPCs into the bloodstream60,61,62,63, we analyzed peripheral blood samples with the same flow-cytometry panel. We observed a heightened proportion of circulating CD34+ HSPCs in patients with VEXAS syndrome compared with controls (Fig. 1f), with a composition reflecting the increase in myeloid progenitors and ETPs and the decrease of MLPs and pre-BNKs in the BM (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1e–h). Genotyping analyses showed dominance of the UBA1-mutant (UBA1mut) cells within HSPCs and CD13+ myeloid cells, but not in CD19+ B cells and CD3+ T cells (Fig. 1h). CD56+ NK cells were heterogeneous among patients.

To investigate whether HSPCs from patients retain stem cell properties despite different immunophenotypes, CD34+ cells from patient 1 (PT1) and PT5 were transplanted into immunodeficient mice or seeded in culture for differentiation and clonogenic assays. Notably, patients' HSPCs either failed to engraft (PT1) or showed a remarkably lower chimerism (PT5) and reduced in vitro differentiation potential compared with HSPCs from control individuals (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 1i). Moreover, HSPCs from PT1 generated mostly UBA1-wild-type (UBA1wt) myeloid colonies (Fig. 1k), which were much fewer than routinely obtained from older controls59.

Our data define myeloid bias, increased mobilization to the bloodstream and lower primitiveness of HSPCs as hallmarks of altered hematopoiesis in patients. However, the poor availability of HSPCs, their reduced engraftment capacity and the interpatient heterogeneity limit the use of patient-derived cells to build preclinical models and investigate the mechanisms of VEXAS syndrome.

To overcome these constraints, we designed a base-editing strategy to insert the most common VEXAS mutation (p.Met41Thr) in male HSPCs from adult healthy donors by co-delivering ABE8.20-m56 and a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting Met41 (ref. 53) (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a). We obtained ∼90% UBA1mut HSPCs without differences in growth, cell cycle and viability compared with control edited (UBA1wt) HSPCs (Fig. 2b–e). UBA1mut HSPCs displayed expression of UBA1a, loss of UBA1b and appearance of UBA1c (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2b), resulting in reduced ubiquitylated proteins (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2c). UBA1mut HSPCs exhibited increased expression of BiP, a master regulator of the unfolded protein response64 (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2c). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy showed altered organelle ultrastructure in UBA1mut HSPCs. Vacuoles were larger and less electrodense (Fig. 2i,j) and mitochondria showed aberrant morphology (that is, cristae disruption and higher occupied area) (Fig. 2k,l). This modeling strategy thus recapitulates the cellular hallmarks of VEXAS syndrome described in patients17,44,45.

We performed bulk transcriptomic analysis of UBA1mut and UBA1wt HSPCs65. Although only one gene was differentially expressed 24 h after editing (Extended Data Fig. 2d, left), 264 genes were differentially expressed (differentially expressed genes (DEGs)) at 7 days (Extended Data Fig. 2d, right and Supplementary Table 1). Enrichment analysis showed upregulation of genes related to innate immunity and neutrophil function and downregulation of genes governing platelet activation (Fig. 2m). Metabolic analysis on the same samples showed decreased ATP and upregulation of AMP, and accumulation of the glycolytic intermediate d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 2n). We then compared the proficiency of UBA1mut and UBA1wt HSPCs to sustain multilineage differentiation in vitro66,67. The total cell output was lower for UBA1mut HSPCs (Fig. 2o), with impaired generation of megakaryocytes, erythroid cells and pre-T cells but preserved myeloid and NK cells (Fig. 2p). Concordantly, UBA1mut HSPCs showed an exclusive myeloid colony-forming potential (Fig. 2q). Conversely, UBA1-knockout (UBA1KO) HSPCs, generated by Cas9-mediated disruption, were unable to make colonies, strengthening the value of inserting the VEXAS mutation rather than disrupting the UBA1 gene. When inserting the VEXAS mutation in male T cells from healthy donors, we observed apoptosis-driven loss of viability and counterselection of UBA1mut cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g). These findings indicate that the VEXAS mutation p.Met41Thr constrains in vitro HSPC differentiation and hampers T cell survival, in agreement with anemia, thrombocytopenia and lack of UBA1mut lymphoid cells in patients17,29.

Next, we generated a humanized model of VEXAS syndrome by transplanting UBA1mut (>80%) or control base-edited HSPCs (UBA1wt) into immunodeficient mice (Fig. 3a). HSPCs were injected 1 day after editing, when the transcriptome was not perturbed and cells could home to the BM (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We observed a 10- to-50-fold reduction in human cell content in UBA1mut mice compared with controls (Fig. 3b). This was the result of a dramatic shrinkage of the B cell compartment (Fig. 3c), usually the most abundant in hematochimeric mice, whereas myeloid and NK cell outputs were more preserved (Fig. 3d,e). We also found a tendency toward lower relative abundance of human HSPCs in the BM of UBA1mut mice (Fig. 3f). More than 90% CD34+ HSPCs in the UBA1mut group co-expressed the myeloid marker CD13, supporting the acquisition of a myeloid-committed phenotype (Fig. 3g). Targeted sequencing showed >80% UBA1mut cells in HSPCs and the myeloid compartment, and predominance of UBA1wt cells in the lymphoid one (Fig. 3h, i). Recapitulation of a lineage repopulation pattern characteristic of patients with VEXAS syndrome was observed only when inserting the mutation by base editing. Indeed, transplantation of UBA1KO HSPCs resulted in the counterselection of UBA1KO cells and did not model the functional hematological consequences of VEXAS syndrome (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 3b).

To characterize the VEXAS xenograft model, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on human BM cells from UBA1mut and UBA1wt mice. We annotated 18 clusters, including both progenitor and differentiated cells (Fig. 4a). Pseudotime analyses68 traced eight branches of differentiation. The lymphoid and erythroid trajectories were arrested prematurely in the UBA1mut xenograft compared with controls (Fig. 4b), suggesting impaired differentiation of lymphoid progenitors and ineffective erythropoiesis in the xenograft model of VEXAS syndrome.

Profound alteration of gene expression was found between UBA1mut and UBA1wt mice within the differentiated clusters (Supplementary Table 2). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) within myeloid cells in VEXAS mice showed robust upregulation of genes belonging to inflammatory categories (for example, interferon-α (IFNα)-, IFNγ- and tumor necrosis (TNF)-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling) (Fig. 4c), accompanied by upregulation of apoptotic genes and negative enrichment of cell-cycle-related signatures. Concordantly, UBA1mut cells were more frequently in the G1 phase than UBA1wt across all differentiated clusters (Fig. 4d). Despite UBA1mut cells being counterselected in B cell subpopulations, the differentiated lymphoid compartments showed transcriptomic changes comparable to myeloid cells, although to a milder extent (Fig. 4c).

To deepen our analysis of HSPCs, we performed scRNA-seq on sorted human CD34+ HSPCs from the BM of UBA1mut and UBA1wt mice. We identified 14 HSPC clusters (Fig. 4e), including primitive (HSCs or MPPs) and committed progenitors (Supplementary Table 3). In agreement with patients' data, we found a relative increase of myeloid progenitors, a loss of lymphoid and erythroid progenitors and a reduction of the HSC or MPP cluster by 1.6-fold in UBA1mut HSPCs (Fig. 4f). Pseudotime trajectories within HSPCs confirmed the premature block of lymphoid and erythroid differentiation and the enhancement of the myelo-GMP trajectory (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

GSEA revealed pervasive upregulation of genes belonging to inflammation-related categories and downregulation of cell-cycle-related ones in UBA1mut versus UBA1wt HSPCs, with the more committed subsets showing significant enrichment for proapoptotic pathways (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Table 4). Concordantly, UBA1mut clusters were mostly in the G1 phase (Fig. 4h). Among GMP clusters, GMP-2 was enriched in UBA1mut cells and showed an inflammatory profile and lower expression of cell-cycle genes (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Conversely, GMP-1 was enriched in UBA1wt cells and exhibited a higher abundance of proliferating cells (Fig. 4h). Finally, the transcriptional perturbations in UBA1mut erythroid progenitors mainly involved upregulation of genes related to ineffective erythropoiesis (‘heme metabolism', Fig. 4g).

We projected the scRNA-seq HSPC dataset on to a reference map of human BM69 (Extended Data Fig. 3e), confirming the differences in cell distribution between UBA1mut and UBA1wt xenografts (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 3f). When probing HSC or MPP cells with a monocyte-derived signature69, we observed positive enrichment in UBA1mut (Fig. 4j), suggesting early priming of VEXAS HSCs or MPPs toward myeloid differentiation. Again, genes belonging to inflammatory and apoptotic pathways were more expressed in primitive cells in UBA1mut xenografts, whereas cell-cycle-related genes were downregulated (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). As inflammation has been associated with accelerated HSC aging70, we probed HSCs or MPPs and bulk HSPCs with two signatures from aged human HSCs71,72 and found significant positive enrichment in UBA1mut compared with the control (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 3i). Senescence-associated signatures73,74,75 were also enriched in VEXAS xenografts (Extended Data Fig. 3j).

These data show that the VEXAS mutation rewires the transcriptional programs of hematopoiesis, activating pervasive inflammatory signatures. Primitive UBA1mut HSCs are less prone to engage cell-cycle progression and display signatures of senescence and are primed toward myelopoiesis.

To dissect to what extent the VEXAS xenograft recapitulates the perturbations of hematopoiesis observed in patients, we performed scRNA-seq on BM mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from six patients, pre-enriched in CD34+ HSPCs, and integrated and harmonized data with published datasets from patients (n = 9) and age-matched controls (n = 4)44. We identified 23 subsets corresponding to various stages of hematopoietic differentiation, including one GMP and one NK cell patient-specific cluster (Fig. 5a).

GSEA on patients' CD34− clusters (Extended Data Fig. 4a) highlighted striking similarities to the xenograft model. Inflammatory categories were significantly upregulated across all myeloid subpopulations (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 5). Bulk transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses on circulating monocytes confirmed activation of inflammation-related gene signatures and immunometabolic pathways (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Apoptotic transcriptional signatures were also enriched in the myeloid clusters, paralleled by downregulation of cell proliferation categories (Fig. 5b) and cell-cycle slowdown (Extended Data Fig. 4d). A concordant, albeit milder, pattern was observed even in T cells and B cells despite being predominantly UBA1wt (Fig. 1h), hinting at a paracrine effect of proinflammatory mutant cells on the wild-type counterpart in patients (Fig. 5b). Similarly, endothelial cells, assumed to be UBA1wt and carried on as contaminants during BMMC processing, showed upregulation of genes related to inflammatory categories, suggesting that nonhematopoietic cells might also be affected by a proinflammatory milieu (Fig. 5b). Moreover, we found robust enrichment of the ‘heme metabolism' category in the late stages of erythroid differentiation in patients driven by elevated expression of genes involved in erythroid differentiation and hemoglobin synthesis (for example, HBG1/2, HBB and HBD), iron homeostasis (NCOA4 and SLC25A37) and regulation of stress responses (GLRX5 and EIF2AK1) (Fig. 5b,c). These alterations, reproduced in the xenograft model, further support a putative attempt to compensate ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia caused by the impaired ubiquitin–proteasome system in patients. Transcriptomic changes were consistent between the San Raffaele and Wu et al.44 cohorts, albeit more exacerbated in the latter (Extended Data Fig. 4e), possibly as a result of different treatments and/or disease stage.

To gain insights into genotype–phenotype correlation possibly explaining heterogeneous clinical manifestations, we segregated patient data according to the UBA1-mutation and compared them with controls. The p.Met41Thr and p.Met41Leu mutations contributed the most to the inflammatory signatures, whereas p.Met41Thr and p.Met41Val manifested more robust activation of responses related to altered erythropoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 4f). This evidence suggests that distinct UBA1-mutations may selectively affect the amplitude and the nature of pathogenic manifestations across lineages.

To comprehensively analyze HSPCs in patients, we selected cells from the clusters associated with HSPC signatures from the two VEXAS datasets above, and we included three additional age-matched controls from another dataset72. We annotated 19 populations, 5 of which predominantly, but not exclusively, comprised VEXAS cells (Fig. 5d) and belonged to different stages of erythroid differentiation. GSEA revealed pervasive upregulation of inflammatory responses, negative enrichment of cell-cycle categories in some clusters and upregulation of apoptosis in the more committed subsets (Fig. 5e). It is interesting that NR4A1 and SOCS3, previously described as promoting resilience and driving dominance of asxl1-mutant HSPCs in a zebrafish model of CHIP76, were among the significantly upregulated genes in patients compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 4g). All transcriptomic changes were exacerbated in patients with p.Met41Thr (Fig. 5f). Intriguingly, senescence gene profiles73,74,75, as well as a VEXAS xenograft signature, were enriched in the patients across most clusters (Fig. 5g,h and Extended Data Fig. 4h).

Overall, these results demonstrate that the VEXAS xenograft model phenocopies most transcriptomic perturbations of hematopoiesis found in patients.

We leveraged our model to investigate whether UBA1mut HSPCs expand over time owing to a cell-intrinsic proliferative surplus and/or whether bystander effects triggered by the proinflammatory progeny of UBA1mut HSPCs promote clonal dominance. We performed competitive transplantations of UBA1mut and UBA1wt HSPCs at different ratios, mimicking the stages of disease progression (Fig. 6a). We found that the absolute number of human cells was reduced when transplanting ≥40% UBA1mut HSPCs (Fig. 6b,c). Conversely, the frequencies of human on live (murine and human) cells were reduced only in the 100% UBA1mut group (Fig. 6d,e). These data suggest a detrimental bystander effect of human UBA1mut cells on mouse hematopoiesis (Fig. 6f). The myeloid:lymphoid ratio within human cells progressively increased with the rising percentage of infused UBA1mut HSPCs (Fig. 6g). Although lymphoid subpopulations were reduced in UBA1mut groups, the myeloid subpopulations and CD34+ HSPCs shrank only and progressively in the 40% and 100% UBA1mut groups (Fig. 6h–j). The analysis of the HSPC compartment showed a progressive skewing of its composition toward CMPs, GMPs and ETPs at an increasing input of UBA1mut HSPCs (Fig. 6k). These data suggest a nonlinear, nearly exponential dose–response with mutant clones destabilizing human hematopoiesis when accounting for >25% UBA1mut HSPCs.

In the 25% UBA1mut group, UBA1 genotyping of sorted subpopulations showed a stable proportion of UBA1mut HSPCs, a tendency toward enrichment of UBA1mut myeloid cells and a decrease in lymphoid cells consistent with the loss of lymphoid differentiation potential by the transplanted 25% UBA1mut HSPCs (Fig. 6l–o). Intriguingly, both HSPC and myeloid compartments of the 40% UBA1mut group showed dominance, through remarkable enrichment of UBA1mut cells owing to the loss of the UBA1wt counterpart (Fig. 6l,m,o). The B cell compartment, comprising only UBA1wt cells, was shrunk despite the initial proportion of transplanted UBA1wt HSPCs (Fig. 6n,o). These data suggest that (1) the loss of UBA1wt contributes to graft shrinkage at an increasing proportion of UBA1mut cells and (2) the higher resilience of UBA1mut cells to a ‘poisonous' cell-extrinsic effect, rather than a cell-autonomous proliferative surplus of UBA1mut progenitors, leads to clonal dominance.

To uncover the ‘poisoning' factors, we compared the abundance of proinflammatory cytokines in the BM of 40% UBA1mut and UBA1wt mice 4 weeks after transplantation, when the BM niche is being repopulated (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We found increased levels of human interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18, CXCL10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) in UBA1mut mice (Fig. 6p), which is suggestive of inflammasome activation, as also reported in patients46. Despite the evidence of inflammatory hematopoiesis, histopathological analyses did not show signs of organ inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 2).

To confirm that this milieu can affect human bystander cells in the BM, we profiled the transcriptome of human hematopoiesis in xenotransplanted mice 6 weeks after competitive transplantation (Fig. 6q). Mice were transplanted with female UBA1wt HSPCs in competition with either male UBA1mut or male UBA1wt HSPCs to distinguish mutant and wild-type cells a posteriori by XIST expression. In agreement with the results above, we found robust activation of inflammatory programs and downregulation of cell-cycle-related genes in VEXAS versus wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). It is interesting that female UBA1wt cells engrafted with male UBA1mut cells showed robust activation of inflammatory pathways and downregulation of cell-cycle-related genes (Fig. 6r), proving a paracrine effect of mutant hematopoiesis. The IFN signature was lower in UBA1mut than UBA1wt HSCs, MPPs or GMPs (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e), suggesting that UBA1mut progenitors might be less responsive to inflammatory stimuli. Of note, both UBA1mut and UBA1wt HSPCs harvested from the BM of VEXAS mice 7 weeks after transplantation retained the capacity to engraft into secondary recipients (Extended Data Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that HSPC function was not fully compromised by the inflammatory milieu.

We then assessed the clonogenic capacity of UBA1wt HSPCs on prolonged exposure to the inflammatory milieu. UBA1wt HSPCs labeled with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing lentiviral vector were co-transplanted with either UBA1mut or UBA1wt HSPCs labeled with a blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-expressing lentiviral vector (Extended Data Fig. 5i). After 14 weeks, BM CD34+ GFP+ cells were sorted and assayed for the ability to form colonies in vitro. The clonogenic yield was ∼50% lower for UBA1wt HSPCs from VEXAS versus wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 5j), pointing to partially impaired clonogenicity of UBA1wt HSPCs on exposure to the VEXAS milieu. Notably, the detrimental microenvironment also affected bystander murine HSPCs in VEXAS mice (Extended Data Fig. 5k,l and Supplementary Table 6), leading to upregulation of the inflammatory response and activation of proapoptotic and p53 target genes (Extended Data Fig. 5l). Cell proliferation-related signatures were upregulated in bystander, wild-type murine HSCs or MPPs exposed to human UBA1mut cells.

Finally, transplantation of allogenic UBA1wt GFP+ HSPCs in conditioned VEXAS mice to model HSCT showed efficient engraftment of donor-derived cells and eradication of UBA1mut cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a–d), proving that (1) allo-HSCT can eradicate VEXAS clones and (2) our xenograft model can be leveraged to investigate therapeutic approaches for VEXAS syndrome.

Overall, we uncovered the poisonous paracrine activity of UBA1mut cells against wild-type HSPCs as a major driver of clonal dominance in VEXAS pathogenesis (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Extended Data Table 2).

Our study deciphers the hallmarks and mechanisms of clonal dominance in VEXAS syndrome, showing that the homeostasis of VEXAS hematopoiesis is subverted by inflammation-resilient, UBA1-mutant HSPCs, which bear dysfunctional differentiation properties and, concurrently, undermine contribution and long-term maintenance of wild-type HSPCs through their proinflammatory progeny.

Clonal dominance has often been ascribed to cell-intrinsic expansion capacity caused by proliferative advantage and enhanced self-renewal. Our data challenge this hypothesis by supporting the establishment of a cell-extrinsic inflammatory circuit more harmful to wild-type than to mutant cells in VEXAS syndrome. VEXAS syndrome may thus represent a paradigm of acquired disorders driven by mutant proinflammatory clones attaining the ability to partially protect themselves from the poisoning microenvironment that they have shaped. The mechanism of clonal dominance described for VEXAS syndrome may underly evolution and/or resistance in acquired BM failure syndromes77, CHIP78, MDS79, inflammatory myeloid neoplasms80,81 and other hematological malignancies, and be portable to physiological aging of other tissues. The VEXAS paradigm of clonal dominance shares similarities with a zebrafish model of ASXL1-driven CHIP76, wherein mutant clones displayed more enhanced fitness than wild-type cells and malignant histiocytosis, wherein senescence establishment and non-cell autonomous inflammation poison hematopoiesis81. UBA1-mutant clones may acquire a resilient state by entering dormancy70 or undergoing senescence, which may shield mutant cells from inflammation-induced apoptosis and immune clearance82,83. The reduced propensity of UBA1-mutant progenitors to proliferate may explain the relatively low incidence of hematological cancers in patients with VEXAS syndrome, despite the high prevalence of MDS and co-occurrence of CHIP mutations19,30,31.

Besides driving clonal dominance, the VEXAS inflammatory milieu probably orchestrates early acquisition of the myeloid bias and drives premature aging of hematopoiesis. Exposure to IL-1β or chronic inflammatory stimuli is known to prime primitive HSCs toward myelopoiesis, erode their self-renewing capacity and accelerate aging70,84,85. IL-1β is also a prominent component of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, the factors of which can affect bystander cells82. Notably, our findings are consistent with the accelerated pace of aging found by DNA methylation clock analyses in patients19.

Single-cell transcriptomic and immunophenotypic analyses described progenitor- and lineage-specific perturbations and adaptive responses to the pleiotropic effect of the UBA1-mutation within the VEXAS hematopoietic landscape. Being pathognomonic of ineffective hematopoiesis, investigation in larger patient cohorts of parameters, such as the myeloid:lymphoid ratio, the abundance of primitive cells in the BM and the increased circulating HSPCs, may identify prognostic factors of disease severity and progression. Enhanced egression of HSPCs from the BM may contribute to the progressive BM failure in VEXAS syndrome by shrinking the reservoir of long-term HSCs. Future studies may further investigate the underlying mechanisms and their role in disease progression.

Our study holds translational implications for the treatment of VEXAS syndrome and, possibly, of other conditions associated with acquired BM failure and clonal hematopoiesis. Combined targeted therapies blunting systemic inflammation and erasing the resilient mutant clones might be more effective than single treatments because they would address both pathogenic components of the disease. Coupling early molecular diagnosis and effective therapies before the mutant clones subvert hematopoiesis may slow down disease progression and reduce its clinical burden. Early combined anti-inflammatory and clone-eradicating treatment strategies might reset the inflammatory milieu, deplete the mutant clones and prevent secondary mutations19 and progression to MDS. Future studies elucidating when UBA1-mutations are acquired during life and the pace of hematopoietic erosion will help to tailor the type, timing and strength of therapeutic interventions.

Despite the humanized model of VEXAS syndrome faithfully phenocopying molecular, cellular and hematological hallmarks of the disease, it lacks overt inflammation and tissue damage in nonhematopoietic murine organs. This limitation might be ascribed to poor infiltration of murine organs by human cells, incomplete maturation of human myeloid cells, partial cytokine-receptor crosstalk between human hematopoiesis and murine parenchymal cells and/or limited experiment duration. Prospectively, the use of other mouse strains or HSPC sources, as well as more prolonged exposure to UBA1mut cells, might overcome this limitation. Despite engraftment of HSPCs from patients with MDS having been recently reported86, our strategy overcomes paucity of patient samples and interpatient variability. Moreover, it allows the establishment of diseased hematopoiesis by transplanting HSPCs early after acquisition of the somatic mutation, allowing full deployment of its pathogenic consequences after the cells have homed to the BM. The latter aspect, together with the partial exhaustion or differentiation of residual UBA1wt HSPCs, probably explains why CD34+ HSPCs from patients showed poorer engraftment capacity in mice than VEXAS-like HSPCs generated by editing. At variance with other in vitro modeling strategies45, the development of humanized models offers the opportunity to expand the breadth of studies for VEXAS syndrome and beyond, with the goal of identifying disease-modifying therapies through preclinical testing of small molecules, biologic agents and gene therapies.

Collection of clinical data from patients was approved by the San Raffaele Ethical Committee (PanImmuno protocol). Biological samples from male patients with VEXAS syndrome and male age-matched controls were collected on written informed consent, in compliance with the TIGET09 ethical protocol, approved by San Raffaele Ethical Committee. Sex was determined by physical examination. Gender was not considered because it was not relevant for the purpose of the study. As VEXAS syndrome is a somatic X-linked disease that predominantly, but not exclusively, affects men, male cells were used throughout the study, unless otherwise specified in the text and needed for experimental purposes. Buffy coats were obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, as anonymized residues of blood donations, used on signature of specific institutionally informed consent for blood product donation by healthy blood donors. Purchase and isolation of human HSPCs from healthy donors were done according to the TIGET-HPCT protocol, approved by OSR Ethical Committee. All experiments and procedures involving animals were performed with the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the San Raffaele Hospital (IACUC nos. 1206, 1358, and 1535) and authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health.

The ABE8.20-m plasmid was a gift from N. Gaudelli (Addgene plasmid, cat. no. 136300; http://n2t.net/addgene:136300). The plasmid for mRNA in vitro transcription (IVT) was generated in ref. 53. The AAVS1 and B2M gRNAs used as mock-edited controls were previously reported53. The UBA1 gRNA used to insert the p.Met41Thr mutation and the UBA1 gRNA used for gene knockout are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

The ABE8.20-m plasmid was linearized with SpeI and purified by phenol–chloroform extraction. Different preps of mRNAs were in vitro transcribed using the commercial 5X MEGAscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ABE8.20-m mRNA was capped with 8 mM CleanCapAG (Trilink). The mRNAs were purified using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN), followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; ADS BIOTEC WAVE System) and concentration with Amicon Ultra-15 (30-kDa) tubes (Millipore). To assess quality and integrity, we denatured and resolved the mRNAs by capillary electrophoresis on 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

BMMCs were purified using SepMate PBMC Isolation Tubes (STEMCELL Technologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, density gradient medium (Lymphoprep) was added through the SepMate insert and whole BM blood, diluted at a 1:1 v:v ratio with sterile PBS 1× containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), was laid on it. On centrifugation for 10 min at 2,500 rpm (brake on), BMMCs were transferred into a new tube and washed with PBS 1×. The red blood cells were lysed using ammonium–chloride–potassium lysing buffer and the BMMCs resuspended in specific buffer according to the subsequent experimental procedure.

Human primary T cells were isolated from male healthy donors' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) freshly purified from buffy coats with SepMate PBMC Isolation Tubes, according to the manufacturer's instructions. CD3+ T cells were cultured in X-Vivo 15 (Lonza) supplemented with 0.5% human serum albumin (HSA, Baxalta), 100 IU ml−1 of penicillin, 100 µg ml−1 of streptomycin, 100 IU ml−1 of IL-7 and 200 IU ml−1 of IL-15 (both from Miltenyi Biotec) and stimulated with T Cell TransAct (Miltenyi Biotec) at 2 × 106 cells ml−1.

Granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) + plerixafor mobilized (m)PB CD34+ HSPCs from male, unless otherwise specified, healthy donors were purified in house with the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System (Miltenyi Biotec) from Mobilized Leukopak (AllCells), following the manufacturer's instructions. HSPCs were seeded at the concentration of 5 × 105 cells ml−1 in serum-free StemSpan SFEM supplemented with 100 IU ml−1 of penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin, 2% glutamine, 300 ng ml−1 of human stem cell factor (hSCF), 300 ng ml−1 of human Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (hFLT3L), 100 ng ml−1 of human thyroid peroxidase (hTPO) and 10 μM 16,16-dimethylprostaglandin E2 (added at the beginning of the culture), 1 μM SR1 and 35 nM UM171.

BM HSPCs from male healthy donors (Lonza) and patients with VEXAS syndrome were not cultured before infusion in immunodeficient mice.

All cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C.

A colony-forming cell assay was performed 24 h after the editing procedure by plating 400–800 cells in methylcellulose-based medium (MethoCult H4434, STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 100 IU ml−1 of penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 of streptomycin. Three technical replicates were performed for each condition. Two weeks after plating, colonies were counted.

NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) and NOD.Cg-KitW-41J Tyr+ Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/ThomJ (NBSGW) 7- to 10-week-old female mice (Jackson Laboratory) were held in specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12 h:12 h dark:light cycle and standardized temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity (55 ± 5%). Only female mice were used because they allow better human cell engraftment.

Approximately 1.0 × 106 human T cells, were washed with 10 volumes of Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and electroporated using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (Lonza) and program DS-130. Cells were electroporated with 75 pM UBA1 or B2M gRNA (Synthego) and 1.5 μg of mRNAs unless otherwise specified. Cells were cultured for approximately 2 weeks. Cell pellets were harvested and the gDNA extracted for molecular analysis.

From 2.0 × 105 to 7.5 × 105 mPB HSPCs were washed with 10 volumes of DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and electroporated using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit and program EO-100 after 3 days of culture. HSPCs were electroporated with 75 pmol of gRNA and 3.5 μg of ABE8.20-m or Cas9 mRNAs. Then, 7 days after electroporation, HSPCs were collected for flow-cytometry analyses and to extract genomic gDNA for molecular analysis.

HSPCs and T cells were cultured as described above for 7 days and 4 days, respectively before being lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 1% sodium dodecylsulfate). Proteins (25 μg) were separated on poly(acrylamide) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (iblotTM Transfer Stack, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for western blotting. UBA1a, UBA1b, UBA1c, ubiquitin, BiP and cleaved caspase-3 were detected by western blotting with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-UBE1a/b (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 4891), mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 14049 (P4D1)), rabbit monoclonal anti-Bip/GRP78 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 3177 (C50B12)) and rabbit monoclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 9664 (5A1E)). Western blotting with β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. T4026) or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. A2228 (AC-74)) antibodies was used to verify equal protein loading. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico PLUS substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

UBA1wt and UBA1mut HSPCs were centrifuged on glass slides and stained with the differential quick stain kit (modified Giemsa) following the manufacturer's instructions (‘Diff-Quick' kit; Polysciences). Stained UBA1wt and UBA1mut HSPCs were examined by optical microscopy. Images were taken with a ×100 objective on a Zeiss AxioImagerM2m (AxioCam MRc5).

Cells for TEM analysis were fixed using a solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at pH 7.3 for 1 h, washed, post-fixed with 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 h and stained overnight with 0.5% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate. Dehydration was then performed using increasing concentrations of ethanol, followed by infiltration and embedding in Epon. Polymerization was carried out at 60 °C for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were obtained using a Leica EM FC7 ultramicrotome. After staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, the sections were analyzed using a TALOS L120C transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and images were acquired with a CETA 4 × 4k CMOS camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Microscopy Image Browser (MIB) was used for analyzing mitochondria.

Approximately 1 × 106 cells were pelleted and extracted in 1,000 µl of ice-cold extraction solution (methanol:acetonitrile:water, 5:3:2 v:v:v)88. Suspensions were vortexed continuously for 30:min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000g for 10 min at 4 °C and supernatants were isolated for metabolomics analysis by UHPLC–mass spectrometry (MS)

Analyses were performed using a Vanquish UHPLC coupled online to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sample extracts, 10 μl, were loaded on to a Kinetex XB-C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm2, inner diameter 1.7 µm; Phenomenex). Samples were analyzed using a 5-min method as described88,89. Metabolite assignments were performed using MAVEN90. Graphs and statistical analyses (principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) or metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA)) were prepared with GraphPad Prism 10.0 (GraphPad Software), GENE-E (Broad Institute) and MetaboAnalyst 6.0 (ref. 91).

In vitro differentiation assay was performed in a nontissue culture-treated, 96-well, flat-bottomed plate (Falcon). Then, 2 h before cell seeding, plates were coated with StemSpan Differentiation Coating Material (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer's specifications. CD34+ cells, 500, were seeded in SFEM II medium (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with hSCF (100 ng ml−1), hFLT3 (10 ng ml−1), human (h)IL-7 (100 ng ml−1), hTPO (75 ng ml−1), hIL-6 (40 ng ml−1), hIL-3 (10 ng ml−1), hIL-11 (50 ng ml−1), human erythropoietin (hEPO); 0.1 U ml−1 (Peprotech), hIL-2 (10 ng ml−1; Novartis), hIL-4 (10 ng ml−1; Miltenyi Biotec) and human low-density lipoprotein (4 μg ml−1; STEMCELL Technologies). Three technical replicates were performed for each condition and medium change was performed every 3–4 days. After 1, 2 and 3 weeks of culture, cells were collected and labeled with anti-CD235a, anti-CD1a, anti-CD5, anti-CD19, anti-CD42b, CD33, anti-CD7, anti-CD71 and anti-CD11c (BD Bioscience) and anti-CD41, anti-CD10, anti-CD15, anti-CD3, anti-CD56 and anti-CD34 (BioLegend) anti-human antibodies. The stained samples were acquired through a BD FACS Symphony A5 (BD Biosciences) cytofluorimeter after Rainbow bead (Spherotech) calibration. Raw FACS data were collected through DIVA software (BD Biosciences) and subsequently analyzed with FlowJo software v.10.5.3. Technically validated results were always included in the analyses and we did not apply any exclusion criteria for outliers.

For gene-editing experiments, the outgrowths of 1.0 × 106 mPB HSPCs at the start of the culture (t0 equivalent) were injected intravenously 24 h after editing into sublethally irradiated NSG mice (180–200 cGy) or nonconditioned NBSGW mice. The number of culture-initiating cells were matched among groups for each experiment. Mice were randomly distributed to each experimental group. Human CD45+ cell engraftment was monitored by serial collection of blood (approximately every 2–3 weeks) from the retro-orbital plexus and at the end of the experiment (14 weeks after transplantation, unless otherwise specified). BM and spleen were collected for endpoint analyses, including FACS of hematopoietic lineages and cell types.

For untreated BM HSPCs from healthy donors or patients with VEXAS syndrome, 1.0 × 105 CD34+ HSPCs were injected intravenously immediately after isolation or cell thawing into nonconditioned NBSGW mice. Mice were monitored as per above.

BM and peripheral blood samples and xenotransplanted mice from the competitive experiment were analyzed using the whole blood dissection (WBD) protocol58, labeling samples with fluorescent antibodies against CD3, CD56, CD14, CD41 or -61, CXCR4, CD34 and CD45RA (BioLegend) and CD33, CD66b, CD38, CD45, CD90, CD10, CD11c, CD19, CD7 and CD71 (BD Biosciences). Samples from xenotransplants were preincubated with a mouse FcR-blocking reagent (BD, dilution 1:100). Absolute cell quantification was performed by adding precision count beads (BioLegend) to samples before the WBD procedure. All stained samples were acquired through BD Symphony A5 cytofluorimeter after Rainbow bead calibration. Raw data were collected through DIVA software.

The cell-cycle analysis was performed using a Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor Pacific Blue Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific) staining. Then, 3–5 × 104 cells were treated with 2 µM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 4 h in culture. Cells were washed with 2% FBS in DPBS, stained for surface markers and fixed with 100 µl of Click-iT fixative for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed again and permeabilized with 100 µl of 1× Click-iT saponin-based permeabilization for 15 min at room temperature. EdU was marked by incubating cells with 500 μl of Click-iT Plus reaction cocktail for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed and stained with DNA with 2 µM Hoechst overnight at 4 °C. After the incubation, sample acquisition was performed with a FAC Symphony A5 cytofluorimeter.

Other flow-cytometry analyses were performed using Canto II (BD Pharmingen). Cells were stained with antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 8 in a final volume of 100–200 μl and then washed with DPBS + 2% heat-inactivated FBS. The Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD; Sigma-Aldrich) were included during sample preparation according to the manufacturer's instructions to identify dead cells. Analysis of apoptosis was performed using Pacific Blue-conjugated Annexin V (BioLegend) and an apoptosis detection kit with 7AAD (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Percentages of live (7AAD−Annexin V−), early apoptotic (7AAD−Annexin V+), late apoptotic (7AAD+Annexin V+) and necrotic (7AAD+Annexin V−) cells were reported. Compensation beads (BD Biosciences) were used as single-color controls.

Gating strategies are provided in Supplementary Fig. 3. Technically validated results were always included in the analyses; we did not apply any exclusion criteria for outliers. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software v.10.5.3 (BD Biosciences) or FCS Express 7 Flow.

Cell sorting was performed on a BD FACS Aria Fusion (BD Biosciences) instrument using BD FACS Diva software and equipped with four lasers: blue (488 nm), yellow/green (561 nm), red (640 nm) and violet (405 nm). Cells were sorted with an 85-µm nozzle. Sheath fluid pressure was set at 310.3 kPa. A highly pure sorting modality (four-way purity sorting) was chosen. Cell sorting was performed on a MoFlo Astrios EQ (Beckman Coulter) using Summit software and equipped with four lasers: blue (488 nm), yellow/green (561 nm), red (640 nm) and violet (405 nm). Cells were sorted with a 100-µm nozzle. Sheath fluid pressure was set at 172.4 kPa. A highly pure sorting modality (purify-1 sorting) was chosen. Sorted cells were collected in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 500 μl of DPBS.

Cell sorting before scRNA-seq in Fig. 4 was performed on a MACSQuant Tyto Cell Sorter (Miltenyi Biotec) using the MACSQuantify Tyto Software and equipped with blue (488 nm), red (640 nm) and violet (405 nm) lasers. Sheath fluid pressure was set at 117–124 kPa.

For molecular analyses, gDNA was isolated with QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Base editing and Cas9 efficiencies, as well as the abundance of UBA1mut and UBAwt cells in edited samples and in patients, were measured by PCR amplification at the target locus, followed by amplicon Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Scientific), the results of which were then analyzed using EditR software (http://baseeditr.com)92 with default parameters or TIDE software (https://tide.nki.nl/)93.

Mice were terminated by cervical dislocation and organs were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. After trimming, samples were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin following OECD Good Laboratory Practices principles, principles of data integrity and applicable GLP SR-TIGET standard operating procedures. Histopathological changes were evaluated by an experienced pathologist and graded on a scale of 1–5 as minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), marked (4) or severe (5), minimal referring to the least extent discernible and severe to the greatest extent possible. The slides were independently reviewed by another experienced pathologist and a consensus reached on the findings and scores. Slides were digitalized using the scanner Pannoramic MIDI (3DHISTECH) at ×20 magnification.

Whole transcriptomic analyses were performed on edited HSPCs from a pool of male healthy donors (24 h or 7 days after editing) and on monocytes from patients with VEXAS syndrome. All conditions were performed in technical triplicate. Total RNA was purified using an RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). DNase treatment was performed using RNase-free DNAse Set (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and its quality assessed by a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). Minimum quality was defined as the RNA integrity number >8. Total RNA, 300 ng, was used for library preparation with TruSeq Stranded mRNA (Illumina) and sequenced at Genewiz (Azenta Life Sciences). The samples were sequenced using a 2× 150 paired-end configuration. Approximately 30 million 150-nt-long reads per sample were generated. After quality checking with FastQC, a preprocessing step, including trimming and adapter removal, was performed using TrimGalore (v.0.5.0). The trimmed reads were mapped to the GRCh38 reference genome assembly provided by the 10× reference data repository (refdata-cellranger-GRCh38-3.0.0) using STAR (v.2.7.0d), with the parameter outFilterMultimapNmax set to 1 to consider only uniquely mapped reads. Reads were assigned to genes using featureCounts (v.1.6.3), with the parameter minOverlap set to 10 and discarding chimeric reads.

Data preprocessing, exploration and differential gene expression analyses were conducted using the DESeq2 (v.1.26.0) R package, normalizing for library size using the DESeq2 median of ratios. Exploratory data analysis involved PCA on regularized log(transformed) data. Genes with a corrected P value (Benjamini–Hochberg correction) <0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Differential gene expression results were examined through over-representation analysis (ORA) and GSEA, querying multiple databases including gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Both analyses were carried out using the ClusterProfiler (v.4.2.2) package94. GSEA was performed on pre-ranked gene lists (ordered by log2(fold-change (FC)) values) using the MSigDB Hallmark database, with results filtered by a false recovery rate (FDR) <0.05.

Cell suspensions were diluted in PBS with 0.04% bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells ml−1. Vitality was assessed for each individual sample. Approximately 20,000 cells were loaded on to a single-cell chip for gel bead-in-emulsion generation using the 10x Genomics Chromium Controller (10x Genomics). The 3′-mRNA-seq gene expression libraries were constructed using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v.2 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. All reactions were performed in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (BioRad Laboratories). Twelve cycles were used for complementary DNA amplification, whereas the number of total cycles for the sample index PCR was calculated based on the cDNA concentration. Amplified cDNA and final libraries were evaluated using a TapeStation 4200 with a high sensitivity chip. ScRNA-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 with the standard sequencing protocol of R1 28-, I1 10-, I2 10- and R2 90-nt read length.

Sequenced scRNA-seq libraries were demultiplexed and processed using the CellRanger Single-Cell Software Suite (v.3.1.0, 10x Genomics), using either the GRCh38 (hg38) human reference genome or the GRCm38 (mm10) mouse reference genome depending on the experiment. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were quantified to generate a cell-by-gene count matrix for each sample. These matrices were then imported into the R environment (v.4.1.3) and analyzed using Seurat v.4.3.0 (ref. 95). Specifically, cells expressing <200 genes or >8,000 genes were excluded, because a low gene count suggests false positives or low viability, whereas a high count indicates potential doublets. In addition, cells with >20% of transcripts originating from mitochondrial (mt) genes were removed, because they probably represent stressed or dying cells. UMI counts were log(normalized) and scaled by a factor of 10,000. The top 20% most variable genes were selected for further analysis. Cell-cycle scores were assigned using the Cell-CycleScoring function with reference gene lists. Data were scaled and sources of variability were regressed out by including the UMI count, mitochondrial gene percentage and cell-cycle difference as variables in the vars.to.regress argument. Cell-cycle difference was defined as the difference between the S phase and G2/M phase module scores. Downstream analysis was conducted on the top 20 PCs from a total of 50 components computed using the PCA. To mitigate sample-related variability and 10× chemistry version bias, data integration was performed using the Harmony package (v.1.0)96. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction and the cells neighbor graph were computed with default parameters using the first 30 of 50 Harmony PCs97. Clusters were identified with the original Louvain algorithm through the FindClusters function at various resolutions and cluster markers were determined using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat. Each cluster was compared with all other cells using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test for significance. Genes expressed in >0% of cells in either group, with an adjusted P < 10−6 and a log2(FC) > 0.25, were considered to be markers. The Seurat function AddModuleScore was used to calculate the average expression of gene signatures in different cell sets.

Cell-type annotation was determined using the SingleR package (v.1.8.1)98, leveraging multiple independent reference annotation datasets from both human and mouse sources. For each dataset, we performed dual annotations using both main labels and refined labels. These cell labels were then incorporated into the Seurat object.

Pseudotime trajectory inference was carried out using Slingshot (v.2.2.1)68 with default parameters, using clusters as label inputs and UMAP embeddings as the reduced dimension input, to construct cell lineages and determine pseudotime starting from the most primitive cluster (HSCs or MPPs).

Cluster marker genes were examined using ORA with the ClusterProfiler R package (v.4.2.2)94, focusing on the Hallmark gene set v.7.0 (from MSigDB) and gene ontology (GO) gene sets. Briefly, we utilized the ego function, setting the cluster's markers as the query genes and the genes expressed in the dataset under analysis as the gene universe. GO terms with an adjusted P value (Benjamini–Hochberg correction) <0.05 were considered significantly enriched. Query and universe gene sets were converted from gene symbols to ENTREZID using the bitr function in the DOSE package (v.3.20.1)99. Customized dotplots were generated using the ggplot2 R package (v.3.4.4).

Downstream analyses were performed on the complete list of marker genes, ranked by decreasing log(FC). GSEA was performed using the GSEA function from the ClusterProfiler R package94 (v.4.2.2), focusing on the Hallmark gene set v.7.0 (from MSigDB) and GO gene sets. GSEA results from all comparisons were consolidated into a single matrix of normalized enrichment scores (NESs). The GSEA test was executed for each set of markers identified by the findmarkers function to retrieve all genes included in the test.

Customized heatmaps were generated using the ggplot2 R package (v.3.4.4).

BMMCs, enriched in the CD34+ HSPCs fraction belonging to the San Raffaele cohort, were integrated with the published dataset from Wu et al.44 (Genome Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession GSE190652) comprising nine patients with VEXAS syndrome and four age-matched controls. Low-quality cells characterized by <500 expressed genes or >20% mtDNA transcripts were removed from all downstream analyses. Data integration was performed using the Harmony package, accounting for both dataset and donor batch effects. UMAP dimensionality reduction and the cells neighbor graph were computed with default parameters using the first 15 of 50 Harmony PCs. Clusters were identified using the Louvain algorithm through the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions in Seurat, and then they were annotated, leveraging multiple independent reference annotation datasets. Within clusters, analyses were performed to identify DEGs between controls and patients with VEXAS syndrome, as well as controls and each subgroup of patients annotated with a different VEXAS mutation using the FindMarkers Seurat. Genes expressed in >10% of cells in either group, with an adjusted P < 10−6 and a log2(FC) > 0.25, were considered to be markers. These analyses were complemented with GSEA as described above. For both differential expression and GSEA the nominal P values were corrected by the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to account for multiple hypotheses testing issue. AUCell scores based on the signature of the top-50 markers in the ‘monocyte' cluster of the xenograft model were calculated. The resulting scores for control and VEXAS samples across and within each of the predicted cell types were compared through a Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, correcting the nominal P values for the multiple hypotheses testing issue with Holm's procedure.

The scRNA-seq San Raffaele dataset was subset to retrieve CD34+ HSPCs, which were combined with HSPCs from Ainciburu et al.72 (GEO accession GSE180298, restricting the analysis to ‘elderly' samples) and Wu et al.44 (GEO accession GSE190652, CD34+ sorted samples). Low-quality cells characterized by <200 expressed genes or >25% mtDNA transcripts were removed from all downstream analyses. Data integration was performed using the Harmony package, accounting for both dataset and donor batch effects, and every cell was projected on to UMAP lower dimensional space using the top 33 harmonized PCs. Clusters were identified using the Louvain algorithm through the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions in Seurat, and then they were annotated leveraging multiple independent reference annotation datasets. Within clusters, analyses were performed to identify DEGs between controls and patients with VEXAS syndrome, as well as controls and each subgroup of patients annotated with a different VEXAS mutation using the FindMarkers Seurat. This was achieved through the FindMarkers Seurat function that performs Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests for each gene expressed by at least 10% of the cells in either group being compared. These analyses were coupled by GSEA, as described above. For both differential expression and GSEA the nominal P values were corrected by the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to account for multiple hypotheses testing issue. UCell scores based on the signature of the top-50 markers in the ‘Monocyte' cluster of the xenograft model were calculated. Scores resulting from control and VEXAS samples across and within each of the predicted cell types were compared through a Wilcoxon's rank-sum test, correcting the nominal P values for the multiple hypotheses testing issue with Holm's procedure.

HSC-enriched analysis was conducted on a subset of cells annotated as HSCs, MLPs, MPP-MkEry, MPP-MyLy, LMPPs, MEPs or early GMPs. These annotations were obtained by projecting our VEXAS dataset on the BM reference map (https://github.com/andygxzeng/BoneMarrowMap). Cells with <0.5 annotation accuracy were discarded from further analysis. BM projection figures were obtained accordingly (https://github.com/andygxzeng/BoneMarrowMap). AUCell scores for each signature were calculated.

The GFP and BFP reporter lentiviral vectors were produced as previously described100. One day after thawing, HSPCs were transduced at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per ml using a multiplicity of infection of 40 transducing units per ml. Ciclosporin H was added at a concentration of 8 μM immediately before transduction. HSPCs were washed with ten volumes of DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ 48 h later, when base editing was performed.

The number of biologically independent samples, animals or experiments is indicated by ‘n'. For some experiments, different HSPC donors were pooled to account for donor-related variability and to reach the number of cells needed for the analyses. Data were summarized as the median with the IQR (or range) or the mean ± s.e.m. depending on data distribution. Inferential techniques were applied in the presence of adequate sample sizes (n ≥ 5), otherwise only descriptive statistics were reported. Two-tailed Student's t-tests were performed throughout the study. The Mann–Whitney U-test was performed to compare two independent groups, whereas, in the presence of more than two independent groups, the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by post-hoc analysis using Dunn's test was used. Moreover, correction methods were used to address the problem of multiplicity arising from testing simultaneously several hypotheses and to adjust P values. For all analyses the significance threshold was set at 0.05: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. The exact P values are provided in Supplementary Table 9. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v.9.4.0.

Metrics details

Microbial genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous host genetic variants associated with gut microbiota. However, links between host genetics, the gut microbiome and specific cellular contexts remain unclear. Here we use a computational framework, scBPS (single-cell Bacteria Polygenic Score), to integrate existing microbial GWAS and single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles of 24 human organs, including the liver, pancreas, lung and intestine, to identify host tissues and cell types relevant to gut microbes. Analysing 207 microbial taxa and 254 host cell types, scBPS-inferred cellular enrichments confirmed known biology such as dominant communications between gut microbes and the digestive tissue module and liver epithelial cell compartment. scBPS also identified a robust association between Collinsella and the central-veinal hepatocyte subpopulation. We experimentally validated the causal effects of Collinsella on cholesterol metabolism in mice through single-nuclei RNA sequencing on liver tissue to identify relevant cell subpopulations. Mechanistically, oral gavage of Collinsella modulated cholesterol pathway gene expression in central-veinal hepatocytes. We further validated our approach using independent microbial GWAS data, alongside single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses, demonstrating its robustness and reproducibility. Together, scBPS enables a systematic mapping of the host–microbe crosstalk by linking cell populations to their interacting gut microbes.

In the run-up to the Switch 2 launch, part of Nintendo's focus has been on ensuring it can meet the demands of an audience hungry for a new console. And that new system comes with a hefty price—$450—which could go up even more due to President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced last week.

But in an interview a day after Trump's announcement, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser told WIRED the tariffs “weren't factored into the pricing” of the console.

The company is “actively assessing” the situation and its impact, he adds. “It creates a challenge,” Bowser says. “It's something we're going to have to address.”

Trump's tariffs sent the stock market into free fall; prices on many products are about to go up, and companies in the tech sector will be turned on their heads. On Friday, Nintendo made the unprecedented move of delaying preorders in the US for the hotly anticipated console “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”

Part of the company's business strategy, to this point, had been “to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories,” Bowser says. The company has already shifted much of its production to Vietnam and Cambodia and away from China.

According to Bowser, that diversification allowed Nintendo to move production around as needed during the Covid-19 pandemic. “That also applied to the early stages of tariffs,” he says. “The situation [on April 2] changed that.” Among Trump's new tariffs: 46 percent on Vietnam, 49 percent on Cambodia, and 54 percent on China.

An additional price hike on the console would be problematic for Nintendo. The current top Switch model, the OLED, is $350, while a standard edition comes in at $300. The price was oddly missing from the console's big announcement on Wednesday, a fact that hasn't been lost on would-be customers already clamoring for Nintendo to “drop the price.” At the New York event, journalists were discouraged from asking hardware developers about the console's cost.

Games have not been spared from high price tags either; Mario Kart World will cost $80. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a tech demo masquerading as a game that explains the ins and outs of the Switch 2, will be an experience people have to pay for. (Notably, this got a huge laugh from the crowd present.)

Two former Nintendo public relations managers, Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis, have broken down the criticism around the pricing on their YouTube channel, as well as criticized how news about the price was presented to fans.

“Obviously it was intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places,” Yang said, lambasting the decision to leave consumers to get answers themselves. “It's a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer.”

In the past, Nintendo products, including the original Switch, have been hard to find due to problems like chip shortages or global pandemics, but the company has taken efforts to “make sure that consumers can find a console when they're ready to buy the console,"" Bowser says.

Part of that includes a new loyalty program that aims to stop scalpers by requiring those who want to purchase the console to have an active Nintendo account. They'll also need to get a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a year and to have clocked at least 50 hours of gameplay. Console sales will be limited to one per person.

“We wanted to make sure that we were rewarding loyal players,” Bowser says. “Those that have been playing on [the Switch] for quite some time that we knew would be those upgraders—those that were eager to dive into play. That's why some of the gates, if you will, have been a part of the preorder process.” Other retailers, Bowser says, have their own systems to thwart scalpers.

The Switch 2 will soon move into global events, including those that are open to the public, ahead of its June launch. Bowser says that the company hopes to show its audience that “this is the next generation of platform” from Nintendo. The Switch 2 “obviously takes what you know and love so much from the Switch and then adds a lot of powerful features,” he says.

If tariffs force Nintendo's hand, the company may find it harder to win over players than ever before. However, it's unlikely Nintendo will face that dilemma alone. In an interview with IGN last Friday, ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn said that if people believe only the Switch 2 will be affected, “then we aren't taking it seriously. This is going to have an impact.”

The Switch 2 may yet be a bellwether for what's to come.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The AI Race Has Gotten Crowded—and China Is Closing In on the US","https://www.wired.com/story/stanford-study-global-artificial-intelligence-index/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The year that ChatGPT went viral, only two US companies—OpenAI and Google—could boast truly cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Three years on, AI is no longer a two-horse race, nor is it purely an American one. A new report published today by Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) highlights just how crowded the field has become.

The institute's 2025 AI index, which collates data and trends on the state of the AI industry, paints a picture of an increasingly competitive, global, and unrestrained race toward artificial general intelligence—AI that surpasses human abilities.

OpenAI and Google are still neck and neck in the race to build bleeding-edge AI, the report shows. But several other companies are closing in. In the US, the fiercest competition comes from Meta's open-weight Llama models; Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI employees; and Elon Musk's xAI.

Most strikingly, according to a widely used benchmark called LMSYS, the latest model from China's DeepSeek, R1, ranks closest to the top-performing models built by the two leading American AI companies.

“It creates an exciting space. It's good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley,” says Vanessa Parli, director of research at HAI.

“Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models,” Parli adds, “but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.”

The arrival of DeepSeek-R1 in January sent shock waves through the US tech industry and stock market. The company claimed to have built its model using a fraction of the compute used by US rivals. DeepSeek's debut was also a surprise because the US government has repeatedly sought to limit China's access to the computer chips needed to build the most advanced AI.

Stanford's report shows Chinese AI is on the rise overall, with models from Chinese companies scoring similar to their US counterparts on the LMSYS benchmark. It notes that China publishes more AI papers and files more AI-related patents than the US, although it does not assess the quality of either. The US, in contrast, produces more notable AI models: 40 compared to the 15 frontier models produced in China and the three produced in Europe. The report also notes that powerful models have recently emerged in the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia as the technology becomes more global.

The research shows that several of the best AI models are now “open weight,” meaning they can be downloaded and modified for free. Meta has been at the center of the trend with its Llama model, first released in February 2023. The company released its latest version, Llama 4, over the weekend. Both DeepSeek and Mistral, a French company, now offer advanced open weight models, too. In March, OpenAI announced that it also plans to release an open source model—its first since GPT-2—this summer. In 2024, the gap between open and closed models narrowed from eight percent to 1.7 percent, the study shows. That said, the majority of advanced models—60.7 percent—are still closed.

Stanford's report notes the AI industry has seen a steady improvement in efficiency, with hardware becoming 40 percent more efficient in the past year. This has brought the cost of querying AI models down and also made it possible to run relatively capable models on personal devices.

Rising efficiency has prompted speculation that the largest AI models could require fewer GPUs for training, although most AI builders say they need more computing power, not less. The study shows that the latest AI models are built using tens of trillions of tokens—components representing parts of data such as words in a sentence—and tens of billions of petaflops of computation. However, it cites research suggesting that the supply of internet training data will be exhausted by between 2026 and 2032, hastening the adoption of so-called synthetic, or AI-generated, data.

The report offers a sweeping picture of AI's broader impact. It shows that demand for workers with machine learning skills has spiked, and cites surveys showing that a growing proportion of workers expect the technology to change their jobs. Private investment reached a record $150.8 billion in 2024, the report shows. Governments around the world also committed billions to AI that same year. Since 2022, AI-related legislation has doubled in the US.

Parli notes that although companies have become more secretive about how they develop frontier AI models, academic research is flourishing—and improving in quality.

The report also points to problems arising from widespread AI adoption. It notes that incidents involving AI models misbehaving or being misused have increased in the past year, as has research aimed at making these models safer and more reliable.

As for reaching the much ballyhooed goal of AGI, the report highlights how some AI models already surpass human abilities on benchmarks that test specific skills, including image classification, language comprehension, and mathematical reasoning. This is partly because models are designed and optimized to excel at these barometers, but it shines a spotlight on how swiftly the technology has advanced in recent years.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","An IVF Alternative Could Make Having Babies Less Onerous","https://www.wired.com/story/this-alternative-ivf-method-matures-eggs-outside-the-body-gameto/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 12:16:23 GMT","

More and more people are turning to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to have babies. The process can be arduous, requiring injections of costly hormones twice a day for two weeks to mature eggs so that they can be retrieved from the body.

New York startup Gameto is aiming to ease this burden for patients by maturing eggs outside the body instead. The company's method replaces 80 percent of the hormone injections needed for traditional IVF, shortening the length of a treatment cycle to a few days. It's showing promise at generating healthy embryos and pregnancies, according to new data released by the company.

Maturing eggs in a lab instead of in the ovaries isn't a new idea. In vitro maturation, or IVM, emerged in the 1990s, but the technique isn't widely used because it has lower success rates than IVF. During IVM, eggs are extracted and grown in a special concoction of nutrients and growth factors. With Gameto's approach, eggs are ripened with ovarian “support” cells derived from stem cells.

In a preprint posted online, Gameto showed that its product, dubbed Fertilo, led to higher pregnancy rates than conventional IVM. In the first part of the study, an initial 20 patients received Fertilo to evaluate the safety of the technique. In the second part, 20 more patients were randomized to receive either Fertilio or IVM. Eggs matured with Fertilo were more likely to develop normally, with a 70 percent maturation rate compared to 52 percent using standard IVM.

When these eggs were then fertilized with sperm, Fertilo resulted in more viable embryos and a higher pregnancy rate—44 percent of patients in the Fertilo group got pregnant after one treatment cycle, while 20 percent who underwent IVM did. To date, the study has led to 15 ongoing pregnancies, 13 from Fertilo treatment and two from IVM. One patient in the Fertilo group became pregnant naturally after egg retrieval and was not included in the final analysis. The study, which was carried out in Mexico and Peru, has not yet been peer-reviewed.

“The idea of Fertilo is to bring a patient-centric solution, one that is truly empowering and makes it a lot easier for people to build a family,” says Dina Radenkovic, Gameto's CEO and founder. Radenkovic actually tested Gameto's technology on her own eggs—not to get pregnant, but to see how well Fertilo did at maturing them.

The ovaries naturally produce one mature egg a month until menopause. In an IVF cycle, patients self-inject high doses of hormones for 10 to 14 days to spur their ovaries into producing many of them. The shots cause mood swings, headaches, bloating, and, in rare cases, a painful and potentially serious condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. In the US, stimulation meds range between $4,000 and $7,000 per treatment cycle, which can amount to a third of the total cost of IVF. And many patients need a few cycles to get pregnant.

With Gameto's method, patients take an initial two to three days of hormones, then undergo egg retrieval. The eggs are incubated with ovarian support cells for about 30 hours. Gameto has developed a way to engineer these specialized reproductive cells from stem cells. “We're able to utilize these cells to recreate the ovary outside the body,” says Christian Kramme, Gameto's chief scientific officer.

By reducing the amount of drugs and time to egg retrieval, Gameto is aiming to make it easier for patients to freeze their eggs and have babies. The approach has led to one live birth in Peru, announced in December. A second woman in Peru who received Fertilo is expected to give birth in late April or early May.

What patients might really want to know, though, is how Fertilo stacks up against standard IVF. That question wasn't addressed in Gameto's study, and it's hard to make a head-to-head comparison. IVF success rates vary widely depending on the patient's age and their ovarian reserve, meaning the number and quality of eggs remaining in the ovaries. Live birth rates can be as high as 50 percent for patients under 35 years old, but that number declines with age. Gameto's study included patients under the age of 37 with a high ovarian reserve, which may in part explain the success rate.

David Sable, a life sciences investor and former reproductive endocrinologist, says Gameto's technique looks promising, but it's hard to draw any definitive conclusions with such a small sample size. “The question is, are they developing a better version of an inferior process, or are they developing something that really can compete with what we're doing now with IVF?” he says.

Gameto will try to answer that question in a large Phase 3 trial it just launched in the US. In that trial, the company will study Fertilo's efficacy in several hundred patients.

It's unlikely that Fertilo would be better than standard IVF—which uses the body's own ovaries as the ultimate incubator—but it might not have to be for some patients to see it as a viable alternative. Radenkovic says Gameto's approach might be especially attractive for younger patients looking to freeze their eggs. Patients hoping to have a baby immediately are more willing to deal with drug side effects and multiple doctor's appointments, she reasons. But those banking their eggs as an insurance policy for the future may be less willing to undergo a disruptive procedure with a lengthy hormone regimen.

Patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, might also benefit from a less invasive version of IVF. People with PCOS tend to be more sensitive to IVF hormones and are at higher risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which causes the ovaries to swell and become painful.

Daniel Williams, medical director of the Reproductive Fertility Center in the Los Angeles area, says reducing the medications involved in IVF could bring costs down for patients. “The reason you need alternatives is because cost is still a major barrier for fertility treatment,” he says. “If you can find ways to decrease the cost, you open access to patients that may not be able to do it.” The Reproductive Fertility Center is one of Gameto's US trial sites.

Fertilo has been approved for use in Australia, Japan, Argentina, Paraguay, Mexico, and Peru. Radenkovic says the company hasn't yet settled on pricing in those places, and ultimately, the final cost of the procedure will be set by fertility clinics.

Gameto is expecting 20 more births this year from across Latin America and Australia as a result of Fertilo. If it's successful enough, the tech could eventually be more widely adopted. “This could be the new and more modern way of doing fertility care,” Radenkovic says.

In 2021, James Kenney and his husband were at a big box store buying a piece of furniture when the sales associate asked if they'd like to add fabric protectant. Kenney, the cabinet secretary of New Mexico's Environment Department, asked to see the product data sheet. Both he and his husband, a chemical engineer, were shocked to see forever chemicals listed as ingredients in the protectant.

“I think about your normal, everyday New Mexican who is trying to get by, make their furniture last a little longer, and they think, ‘Oh, it's safe, great!' It's not safe,” he says. “It just so happens that they tried to sell it to the environment secretary.”

Last week, the New Mexico legislature passed a pair of bills that Kenney hopes will help protect consumers in his state. If signed by the governor, the legislation would eventually ban consumer products that have added PFAS—per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, known colloquially as “forever chemicals” because of their persistence in the environment—from being sold in New Mexico.

As health and environmental concerns about forever chemicals mount nationally, New Mexico joins a small but growing number of states that are moving to limit—and, in some cases, ban—PFAS in consumer products. New Mexico is now the third state to pass a PFAS ban through the legislature. Ten other states have bans or limits on added PFAS in certain consumer products, including cookware, carpet, apparel, and cosmetics. This year, at least 29 states—a record number—have PFAS-related bills before state legislatures, according to an analysis of bills by Safer States, a network of state-based advocacy organizations working on issues around potentially unsafe chemicals.

The chemical and consumer products industries have taken notice of this new wave of regulations and are mounting a counterattack, lobbying state legislatures to advocate for the safety of their products—and, in one case, suing to prevent the laws from taking effect. Some of the key exemptions made in New Mexico highlight some of the big fights that industries are hoping they'll win in statehouses across the country: fights they are already taking to a newly industry-friendly US Environmental Protection Agency.

PFAS is not just one chemical but a class of thousands. The first PFAS were developed in the 1930s; thanks to their nonstick properties and unique durability, their popularity grew in industrial and consumer uses in the postwar era. The chemicals were soon omnipresent in American lives, coating cookware, preventing furniture and carpets from staining, and acting as a surfactant in firefighting foam.

In 1999, a man in West Virginia filed a lawsuit against US chemical giant DuPont alleging that pollution from its factory was killing his cattle. The lawsuit revealed that DuPont had concealed evidence of PFAS's negative health effects on workers from the government for decades. In the years since, the chemical industry has paid out billions in settlement fees around PFAS lawsuits: in 2024, the American multinational 3M agreed to pay between $10 billion and $12.5 billion to US public water systems that had detected PFAS in their water supplies to pay for remediation and future testing, though the company did not admit liability. (DuPont and its separate chemical company Chemours continue to deny any wrongdoing in lawsuits involving them, including the original West Virginia suit.)

As the moniker “forever chemicals” suggests, mounting research has shown that PFAS accumulate in the environment and in our bodies and can be responsible for a number of health problems, from high cholesterol to reproductive issues and cancer. EPA figures released earlier this year show that almost half of the US population is currently exposed to PFAS in their drinking water. Nearly all Americans, meanwhile, have at least one type of PFAS in their blood.

For a class of chemicals with such terrifying properties, there's been surprisingly little regulation of PFAS at the federal level. One of the most-studied PFAS chemicals, PFOA, began to be phased out in the US in the early 2000s, with major companies eliminating the chemical and related compounds under EPA guidance by 2015. The chemical industry and manufacturers say that the replacements they have found for the most dangerous chemicals are safe. But the federal government, as a whole, has lagged behind the science when it comes to regulations: The EPA only set official drinking water limits for six types of PFAS in 2024.

In lieu of federal guidance, states have started taking action. In 2021, Maine, which identified an epidemic of PFAS pollution on its farms in 2016, passed the first-ever law banning the sale of consumer products with PFAS. Minnesota followed suit in 2023.

“The cookware industry has historically not really engaged in advocacy, whether it's advocacy or regulatory,” says Steve Burns, a lobbyist who represents the industry. But laws against PFAS in consumer products—particularly a bill in California, which required cookware manufacturers to disclose to consumers if they use any PFAS chemicals in their products—were a “wakeup call” for the industry.

Burns is president of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, a 501c6 formed in 2024 by two major companies in the cookware industry. He and his colleagues have had a busy year, testifying in 10 statehouses across the country against PFAS restrictions or bans (and, in some cases, in favor of new laws that would exempt their products from existing bans). In February, the CSA was one of more than 40 industry groups and manufacturers to sign a letter to New Mexico lawmakers opposing its PFAS ban when it was first introduced. The CSA also filed a suit against the state of Minnesota in January, alleging that its PFAS ban is unconstitutional.

Its work has paid off. Unlike the Maine or Minnesota laws, the New Mexico bill specifically exempts fluoropolymers, a key ingredient in nonstick cookware and a type of PFAS chemical, from the coming bans. The industry has also seen success overseas: France excluded kitchenware from its recent PFAS ban following a lobbying push by Cookware Sustainability Alliance member Groupe SEB. (The CSA operates only in the US and was not involved in that effort.)

“As an industry, we do believe that if we're able to make our case, we're able to have a conversation, present the science and all the independent studies we have, most times people will say well, you make a good point,” Burns says. “This is a different chemistry.”

It's not just the cookware industry making this argument. Erich Shea, the director of product communications at the American Chemistry Council, told WIRED in an email that the group supports New Mexico's fluoropolymer exclusion and that it will “allow New Mexico to avoid the headaches experienced by decisionmakers in other states.”

The FDA has authorized nonstick cookware for human use since the 1960s. Some research—including one peer-reviewed study conducted by the American Chemistry Council's Performance Fluoropolymer Partnership, whose members include 3M and Chemours, has found that fluoropolymers are safe to consume and less harmful than other types of PFAS. Separate research has called their safety into question.

However, the production of fluoropolymers for use in nonstick cookware and other products has historically released harmful PFAS into the environment. And while major US manufacturers have phased out PFOA in their production chain, other factories overseas still use the chemical in making fluoropolymers.

The debate over fluoropolymers' inclusion in state bans is part of a larger argument made by industry and business groups: that states are defining PFAS chemicals too broadly, opening the door to overregulation of safe products. A position paper from the Cookware Sustainability Alliance provided to WIRED lambasts the “indiscriminate definition of PFAS” in many states with recent bans or restrictions.

“Our argument is that fluoropolymers are very different from PFAS chemicals of concern,” Burns says.

Some advocates disagree. The exemption of fluoropolymers from New Mexico's ban, along with a host of other industry-specific exemptions in the bill, means that the legislation “is not going to meet the stated intentions of what the bill's sponsors want it to do,” says Gretchen Salter, the policy director at Safer States.

Advocates like Salter have concerns around the use of forever chemicals in the production of fluoropolymers as well as their durability throughout their life cycles. “Fluoropolymers are PFAS. PFAS plastics are PFAS. They are dangerous at every stage of their life, from production to use to disposal,” she claims.

Kenney acknowledges that the fluoropolymer exemption has garnered a “little bit of criticism.” But he says that this bill is meant to be a starting point.

“We're not trying to demonize PFAS—it's in a lot of things that we rightfully still use—but we are trying to gauge the risk,” he says. “We don't expect this to be a one and done. We expect science to grow and the exemptions to change.”

With a newly industry-friendly set of regulators in DC, industry groups are looking for wins at the federal level too. In February, an organization of chemical manufacturers and business groups, including the American Chemistry Council and the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, sent a letter to the EPA outlining suggested “principles and policy recommendations” around PFAS. The group emphasized the need to “recognize that PFAS are a broad class of chemistries with very diverse and necessary properties” and recommended the agency adopt a government-wide definition of PFAS based on West Virginia and Delaware's definitions. Both of those states have a much more conservative definition of what defines PFAS than dozens of other states, including Maine, New Mexico, and Minnesota.

A federal definition like this could “have a chilling effect on state legislation going forward,” said Melanie Benesh, the vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, an environmental activist organization. “There would be this federal position that the chemical industry could point to, which might be convincing to some state legislators to say, well, this is what the federal government has said is a definition of PFAS. As you start excluding PFAS from the class, you really limit what PFAS are covered by consumer product bans.”

Shea, of the American Chemistry Council, told WIRED that the group believes “that the federal regulatory approach is preferable to a patchwork of different and potentially conflicting state approaches.”

States with bans face a monumental task in truly getting PFAS out of consumers' lives. Vendors in Minnesota have been left with expensive inventory that they can no longer sell; Maine's law, one of the most aggressive, makes exemptions for “currently unavoidable use” of PFAS, including in semiconductors, lab equipment, and medical devices. PFAS are used in so many of the products in our lives that it's almost unfathomable to think of phasing them out altogether, as soon as possible.

For advocates like Salter, it's a change worth making.

“There might be essential uses for PFAS right now,” she says. “But we want to spur the search for safer alternatives, because we don't want to give a pass to chemicals that are harming human health. By exempting them altogether, you are completely removing that incentive.”

One of the most exciting features of the Switch 2 is its GameChat, a new social feature that lets up to 12 people share screens, game together, or just talk directly via the console. It puts social features found on platforms like Discord directly onto the console in a way Nintendo's platforms have yet to do.

Gaming is more social than most people give it credit for. Pre-internet, gaming with friends was the sort of thing you'd do together on the couch. After moving online, people were finally able to broaden their social circles to anyone who enjoyed their hobby, and not just whoever lived nearby; apps like Twitch and Discord have made this even easier.

While typically, gamers chatting are playing together, GameChat does not require you to play the same games or even play a game at all in order to chat. In some ways, the feature almost acts as an advertisement. People can watch their friends play games they themselves don't own, and then, if they're in a Family Group, borrow them via the system's newly announced virtual game cards.

“There's layers to GameChat that I think are really exciting,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser tells WIRED.

The feature will reach its full potential in the hands of players, he added. “One of the things that for us is really important is that we watch and see how people engage in GameChat.”

Doug Bowser, president of Nintendo of America, with the Nintendo Switch 2.

But online communities in gaming can be notoriously noxious. Any lobby or platform with open communication will, inevitably, become a vector for harassment and inappropriate imagery. Online games and platforms like Roblox, which are popular with young users, have massive problems with predators and pedophiles on the platform.

GameChat activates voice chat with the system's C button and allows for video use with a USB-C camera—features that could enable a great deal of abuse if left unchecked. During a roundtable discussion with Nintendo's hardware team in New York City last week, Switch 2's director Takuhiro Dohta and producer Kouichi Kawamoto talked about how they designed the system with safety considerations in mind. The feature is limited to a player's friend list, and parents maintain a lot of control.

“Parental controls for the minor who's gonna be using the chat can be set and controlled through the app,” Dohta tells WIRED. That means that only friends a parent has approved will be able to chat with players who are minors. Roblox has installed similar safety features as part of overhauled parental controls.

Adult players, however, or players who do not have parental controls turned on, will need to be more proactive. “When it's just two adults, they also need to be friends with each other to be able to do a chat,” Dohta says, pointing to the console's friend list systems. “You won't find yourself in a situation where you'll be placed in a chat with strangers.” Players will be able to import their friend lists from the Switch, though it may take some “fine tuning” to figure out who's up for chatting, he said. “There's bound to be people who like chats, and there's people who don't prefer to chat.”

“Ultimately, if something does happen or if someone is chatting with someone you don't want to chat with, there is also a report feature,” Kawamoto added.

GameChat will launch with the Switch 2 on June 5 and will be included with Nintendo Switch Online membership.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","'Wi-Fi Keeps Going Down': Donald Trump's Return-to-Office Mandate Is Going Terribly","https://www.wired.com/story/federal-workers-rto-chaos/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 15:13:05 GMT","

Since President Donald Trump mandated that remote and partially remote federal workers all must return to their offices, thousands of employees across the country have been figuring out how to navigate new commutes, seating arrangements, and a lack of supplies as basic as toilet paper and legal pads while still getting their work done.

One effect of all this, many federal employees tell WIRED, is that they are traveling long distances to spend all of their time in virtual meetings.

“I don't directly work with anyone in the office that I am going into,” one employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development tells WIRED. “So I show up and sit on [Microsoft] Teams calls.”

A Treasury employee says they spend most of their time at the office on video calls as well, “because of people working at other sites … and that's hard when working from a cubicle. I definitely get less done because of the distractions.”

At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one employee says that the focus on the return-to-office mandate has meant a lot of chaos for people who actually need to do their jobs in person. “Some teams and groups aren't even on the same campuses because space was so limited. So they're coming to work just to sit on the same virtual meetings as always,” they say. “And all the chaos has made it more difficult for the lab people, who actually need to be on campus. I'd say with everything they get two-to-three hours less of meaningful work out of me each day.”

Over the past few months, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has upended the government. In addition to firing tens of thousands of federal employees, before being forced by judges to rehire some of them, return-to-office mandates have resulted in chaos. Outlets like CNN and Reuters reported on the initial confusion and disarray caused by forcing tens of thousands of employees back to the office all at once, but weeks later, employees say the situation is getting worse.

Though Trump and Musk have claimed the mandate would result in huge productivity increases and financial savings, more than 30 federal employees at 17 federal agencies tell WIRED the return-to-office order has resulted in widespread chaos, plummeting productivity, and significantly reduced services to the public. It isn't just traveling to work to sit on Zoom calls—it's that there may be no place to take the call or no working internet to connect to it. WIRED granted employees anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, which some say are affecting their physical and mental health—and nearly all say are resulting in a lower quality of work and worse public services.

""The workplace environment is unpleasant, loud, people talk about whatever they want, and the workload is insane with the mass layoffs and hiring freeze,"" an employee at the Department of Defense (DOD) tells WIRED. ""This is a terrible place to work."" The employee says they cry almost every day after leaving the office.

Multiple government employees claim that there isn't enough space in federal offices, or necessary equipment, to make their return worthwhile.

At a DOD building, one employee says, the influx of people now working from the office has made simply accessing the facility a daily struggle for them.

“We are on a secure military facility with only a few access points,” the employee tells WIRED. “There are not enough gate guards to open multiple access points so the traffic backs up onto the highway.”

At one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office, during the first week of the return-to-office mandate in March, around 40 people were forced to work out of a single room. “I have lots of meetings every day, so I would have to go elsewhere to find some privacy, along with everyone else,” a DHS employee tells WIRED. Now, employees are not assigned office spaces until they arrive at work each day. “Every day, we have to go to one room to get an office assignment,” says the employee. “You don't know the assignment until the day of. If you are not assigned an office, you sit in a training room until that happens. My productivity has drastically decreased.” The offices are also so “gross,” the employee says, that they bring their own cleaning products to work.

Weeks after returning to the office, a Social Security Agency (SSA) employee claims there isn't enough furniture for everyone. “If you're stuck on a floor without enough chairs, you're stuck standing for eight hours,” they say. “I'm unfocused, exhausted, and in pain. I'm certainly not at 100 percent.”

An employee at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says he was ordered to return to his office on March 10, despite being hired for a fully remote position in 2022. There isn't enough space for private meetings, so if he wants to talk to one of the employees he supervises, he says, he has no options. “For private staff calls I have to go out to my truck and use my personal phone,” he tells WIRED. “I have requested a government cell, but they tell me I won't get it since I'm back in an office.”

Tech issues have plagued the return of many federal employees.

The USDA employee claims that the internet connection at his new office is “far worse than it is at home. So much so that I have had trouble using Teams with my staff in recent calls.”

“We are getting hammered with RTO tickets,” says another source at the USDA, describing the number of employees making requests for equipment to do their jobs in-office. “We do not have the IT infrastructure to support this massive RTO mandate.”

The DOGE-enforced $1 spending limit on federal credit cards, enforced in February, has exacerbated the problem, leading to shortages of basic supplies.

“All the money we saved on decommissioning equipment, saving on having contractors run cabling, enterprise hardware savings, will all be gone,” the USDA source says. “This RTO will not only bring work completion down for people now having to commute and people are going to work exactly their eight hours and not any time over. The stoppage of IT issues will bring down a lot of this as well.”

At the Internal Revenue Service, which ordered its workers back to the office four weeks ago, the $1 limit caused significant problems for those back in the office. “They have no soap, toilet paper, or paper towels anywhere in the building. Their water machine is broken. Many cannot get on LAN, and the Wi-Fi keeps going down,” one IRS employee tells WIRED. Another SSA employee says that they were told to “ration paper.”

“Supplies are limited because no one has purchasing authority,” the Treasury employee tells WIRED. “It's a running joke that we bring our own pens and paper. We have a bit of a stock of pens in my department but can't order more. We are out of notebooks, though there are some partially used legal pads from meetings available.”

Employees say the return-to-office mandate has also negatively impacted their productivity. “My whole team had been, probably to a fault, working long hours on quick turnaround projects,” a source at the Army Futures Command, which operates under the DOD, tells WIRED. “We were able to do a lot of this at home after dinner in the evening, because we've all got kids and family obligations. [Return to office] has ended all of that.”

Some federal employees say the return-to-office mandates are having a negative impact on their health.

One employee at the SSA, who identifies as queer and uses they/he pronouns, is also disabled and suffers from chronic pain and mobility issues. Still, they were left with no option but to make the long journey from their home to the office once the return-to-office mandate was enforced.

“With no car, I am walking a mile to the train, and from the station to the office on concrete and metal, limping along, using elevators when I can,” they say, adding, “While I can ask for Reasonable Accommodations, our DEI offices were gutted, so despite being directed to apply through the proper channels, there's no one there to process them.” In the weeks since they've returned to the office, nothing has improved.

“I'm not sleeping well, I can't have access to chairs and desks and monitors at proper heights to make me more comfortable,” they say. “I've had to start revisiting my orthopedic doctor to pursue treatments and start physical therapy again.”

A USDA employee says that returning to an office has aggravated their long-dormant carpel tunnel symptoms.

“I got an old wooden desk that is not intended to be a workplace,” the employee tells WIRED. “As a result of the table being too high for the chair they gave me, my carpel tunnel has been aggravated with numbness and piercing pain in the hand. My carpel tunnel has not been an issue for about 25 years now.”

A Treasury employee says that people on her team have had to quit due to stress stemming from the return-to-office mandate and the uncertainty of what's next. “People here love their jobs. We love what we do,” they say. “Getting fired would mean so much more than just losing a paycheck.”

Some employees say these fears, combined with the poor working conditions, are impacting their mental health as well.

“I'm just going through a depressive episode in part because of the nonstop uncertainty and stress,” says an employee at the DOD. “Even the hardcore military bros in my agency are feeling grim about everything that's happening.” A USDA employee told WIRED that they are now dealing with severe depression due to these mandates and general fear.

The threat of a reduction in force, or RIF, remains a constant concern for employees as they return to federal offices.

“There is just a lot of very dark humor at the office,” the Treasury employee says. “I think all of us are expecting to get RIFd or fired or something, but we are just waiting. Business as usual while everything is on fire.”

Google is bringing multimodal search to AI Mode, its Google Search experiment that lets users ask complex, multi-part questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic. Users who have access to AI Mode can now tap the feature to ask questions about photos they've uploaded or taken with their camera.

The new image-analyzing functionality in AI Mode is powered by Google Lens' multimodal capabilities, Google said in a blog post on Monday.

AI Mode can understand the entire scene in an image, including how objects relate to each other, as well as their materials, colors, shapes, and arrangement, according to Google. Using a technique called “query fan-out,” AI Mode asks multiple questions about both the image and the objects shown in it, providing more detailed information than a traditional Google search.

For example, you could snap a photo of your bookshelf and enter the query: “If I enjoyed these, what are some similar books that are highly rated?” AI Mode will identify each book and then provide a list of recommended books with links to learn more about and/or purchase them.

AI Mode also lets you ask follow-up questions to narrow down your search, such as “I'm looking for a quick read, which one of these recommendations is the shortest?”

As part of Monday's announcement, Google said it's making AI Mode available to millions more users who are enrolled in Labs, Google's home for experimental features and products. Prior to this, AI Mode was only available to Google One AI Premium subscribers.

Launched last month, AI Mode looks to take on popular services like Perplexity and OpenAI's ChatGPT Search. Google has said that it plans to continue to refine the user experience and expand functionality in the feature.

In a recent memo to employees, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke made a bold policy change: teams must demonstrate why AI can't perform a job before they're permitted to ask for more headcount and resources.

“Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI,” Lütke wrote in the memo, which he shared publicly on social media Monday. “What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team? This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.” 

Advancing the notion that AI and so-called agents may help Shopify maintain a smaller workforce is sure to attract controversy, given widespread concerns about AI's impact on jobs. A new report from the United Nations' Trade and Development organization estimates that AI could disrupt over 40% of roles globally.  

However, Lütke isn't the only CEO looking to AI for efficiency gains. Other leaders in the tech space have expressed similar sentiments.

Sebastian Siemiatkowski, the chief executive of Klarna, has boasted about how Klarna's AI chatbot does the work of 700 customer service agents. He has also said that, thanks to AI, Klarna's workforce could eventually be reduced to just 2,000 people. Klarna currently employs around 4,000.

As of 2024, Shopify had around 8,100 employees. The year prior, the company laid off 20% of its staff. In January, Shopify reportedly quietly laid off employees in its customer service division, according to Business Insider.

IBM on Monday said it has acquired Hakkoda, a data and AI consultancy based in New York.

The acquisition would “further expand” IBM's ability to bring consultants and AI to clients, particularly customers in industries like financial services, public sector, and healthcare and life sciences, said Mohamad Ali, SVP and head of IBM's consulting business, in a statement. 

“With Hakkoda's data expertise, deep technology partnerships, and asset-centric delivery model, IBM will be even better-positioned to deliver value faster to clients as they transform with AI,” Ali said.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal comes as IBM continues to ramp up its investments in AI and automation technologies. In February, the company acquired DataStax, a platform for building AI apps, and it recently finalized its purchase of infrastructure and security automation firm HashiCorp.

The strategy has borne fruit for IBM. In Q4 2024, the company, which makes the bulk of its AI income from consulting, recorded its biggest revenue jump in five years — sending its stock soaring 10%. IBM said at the time that AI bookings and sales stood at over $5 billion inception-to-date.

Co-founded in 2021 by ex-Deloitte GM Erik Duffield, Hakkoda helps customers move data to the cloud — in particular, the Snowflake data cloud. The startup offers a range of tools to help firms migrate and transform data, as well as products to “modernize” data from older systems.

The startup had managed to raise a total of $5.6 million in venture capital, according to Crunchbase. Its backers include Tercera, Lead Edge Capital, and Casimir Holdings.

Duffield said Hakkoda's hundreds of consultants across the U.S., Latin America, India, Europe, and the U.K. will join IBM's consulting division as part of the deal.

“From the beginning, Hakkoda has committed to being ‘in the arena,' not observing the greatest transformation in history but shaping it,” Duffield said in a statement. “IBM's heritage of innovation, their commitment to discovery, and deep partnerships with clients on their most technical challenges [are] a perfect pairing to take Hakkoda's industry-focused modern data consulting to the global marketplace.”

A leak site used by the Everest ransomware gang was hacked and defaced this weekend, TechCrunch has learned. 

The leak site, which the ransomware gang uses to publish stolen files to extort its victims into paying a ransom demand, was replaced with a brief text note: “Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague.”

The site was still defaced at the time of writing. It's not clear if the gang also experienced a data breach as a result of the hack.

Everest is a prolific Russia-linked ransomware gang that has claimed credit for multiple hacks and data breaches since its inception in 2020, including the theft of more than 420,000 customers' data from cannabis retail chain Stiiizy. The U.S. government has also attributed several hacks to Everest, including breaches at the U.S. space agency NASA and the Brazilian government.

Ransomware (and extortion) attacks are on the rise, but recent data shows that the number of victim payments to hackers dropped overall during 2024 as more businesses refused to pay hefty ransoms.

While law enforcement operations have targeted and disrupted some ransomware gangs in recent years, including the LockBit and Radar hacking groups, several ransomware gangs have also experienced damaging leaks and sabotage from within.

Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said that the company did not factor in possible tariffs from the U.S. when deciding on the pricing for its Nintendo Switch 2 console, according to Wired.

Nintendo unveiled its highly anticipated Switch 2 last week and announced that the console would be released on June 5, priced at $450. But later that day, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would impose sweeping tariffs on goods imported into the country, sending the global economy into disarray.

U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were supposed to begin on April 9, but U.S. consumers won't be able to preorder the console until Nintendo figures out how to address the tariffs. Many of the Switch 2's parts are assembled and manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia; under Trump's new plan, China is subject to 54% tariffs, while Cambodia and Vietnam are subject to 49% and 46% tariffs, respectively.

According to Bowser, Nintendo had already begun trying to diversify where it makes products, moving most production from China to other countries.

OpenAI is said to have discussed acquiring the AI hardware startup that former Apple design lead Jony Ive is building with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. According to The Information, OpenAI could pay around $500 million for the fledgling company, called io Products.

Ive, who left Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm called LoveFrom, confirmed that he was working with Altman on the AI hardware startup last year in an interview with The New York Times. io Products has raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective and others, according to The Information.

The Information's report notes that OpenAI may end up partnering with instead of acquiring io Products, which currently has a small team that includes former Apple designers Tang Tan and Evans Hankey. io Products has reportedly been working on different concepts of AI-enabled devices, including smart home gadgets. Last year, The New York Times said that the startup's goal was to build products that are “less socially disruptive than the iPhone.”

Cryptography is such an esoteric and deep field that it's easy for a fairly smart but inexperience engineer to misjudge the security of a particular implementation or usage of a cryptographic primitive.


reply



Indeed!  As I just wrote in another comment on this page, Microsoft Outlook 2003 used CRC32 to ""hash"" the personal folder (.PST) passwords.  Since CRC32 isn't a cryptographic hash, it was trivial to generate a collision and access someone else's Outlook personal folder.  This flaw persisted until at least 2006!

Our daughter is not so much into the pure math side but loves to do amigurumi, which is really applied 3D modelling. A craft show she wants to do later in the year doesn't allow the use of other people's models, so she is having to design her own. It's so very impressive, and she gets so much joy from seeing kids really, really want her work, as they do. It's math, modelling, color matching design, and understanding the kinds of threads all rolled up into one, so to speak :-)

Always amazed at how mathematics' various specialties relate to everyday activities in sometimes very subtle ways.As a tangent -- In studying numerical analysis, I was tested with a question of a logistic model applied to rabbit populations (of all things). You know, the one that generates bifurcation diagrams and is closely associated with chaos theory. Anyway, it was just a reminder in the moment about how such seemingly familiar phenomena can be explained by these seemingly obscure mathematical models (such as numerical differentiation.)

A conversation with Kathleen Hicks, the former deputy secretary of defense.

It's been just over two months since Kathleen Hicks stepped down as US deputy secretary of defense. As the highest-ranking woman in Pentagon history, Hicks shaped US military posture through an era defined by renewed competition between powerful countries and a scramble to modernize defense technology.  

She's currently taking a break before jumping into her (still unannounced) next act. “It's been refreshing,” she says—but disconnecting isn't easy. She continues to monitor defense developments closely and expresses concern over potential setbacks: “New administrations have new priorities, and that's completely expected, but I do worry about just stalling out on progress that we've built over a number of administrations.”

Over the past three decades, Hicks has watched the Pentagon transform—politically, strategically, and technologically. She entered government in the 1990s at the tail end of the Cold War, when optimism and a belief in global cooperation still dominated US foreign policy. But that optimism dimmed. After 9/11, the focus shifted to counterterrorism and nonstate actors. Then came Russia's resurgence and China's growing assertiveness. Hicks took two previous breaks from government work—the first to complete a PhD at MIT and the second to join the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), where she focused on defense strategy. “By the time I returned in 2021,” she says, “there was one actor—the PRC (People's Republic of China)—that had the capability and the will to really contest the international system as it's set up.”

In this conversation with MIT Technology Review, Hicks reflects on how the Pentagon is adapting—or failing to adapt—to a new era of geopolitical competition. She discusses China's technological rise, the future of AI in warfare, and her signature initiative, Replicator, a Pentagon initiative to rapidly field thousands of low-cost autonomous systems such as drones.

You've described China as a “talented fast follower.” Do you still believe that, especially given recent developments in AI and other technologies?

Yes, I do. China is the biggest pacing challenge we face, which means it sets the pace for most capability areas for what we need to be able to defeat to deter them. For example, surface maritime capability, missile capability, stealth fighter capability. They set their minds to achieving a certain capability, they tend to get there, and they tend to get there even faster.

That said, they have a substantial amount of corruption, and they haven't been engaged in a real conflict or combat operation in the way that Western militaries have trained for or been involved in, and that is a huge X factor in how effective they would be.

China has made major technological strides, and the old narrative of its being a follower is breaking down—not just in commercial tech, but more broadly. Do you think the US still holds a strategic advantage?

I would never want to underestimate their ability—or any nation's ability—to innovate organically when they put their minds to it. But I still think it's a helpful comparison to look at the US model. Because we're a system of free minds, free people, and free markets, we have the potential to generate much more innovation culturally and organically than a statist model does. That's our advantage—if we can realize it.

China is ahead in manufacturing, especially when it comes to drones and other unmanned systems. How big a problem is that for US defense, and can the US catch up?

I do think it's a massive problem. When we were conceiving Replicator, one of the big concerns was that DJI had just jumped way out ahead on the manufacturing side, and the US had been left behind. A lot of manufacturers here believe they can catch up if given the right contracts—and I agree with that.

DJI's commercial-use drones are affordable and powerful, but their applications in a war zone have raised concerns in the US and beyond.

We also spent time identifying broader supply-chain vulnerabilities. Microelectronics was a big one. Critical minerals. Batteries. People sometimes think batteries are just about electrification, but they're fundamental across our systems—even on ships in the Navy.

When it comes to drones specifically, I actually think it's a solvable problem. The issue isn't complexity. It's just about getting enough mass of contracts to scale up manufacturing. If we do that, I believe the US can absolutely compete.

The Replicator drone program was one of your key initiatives. It promised a very fast timeline—especially compared with the typical defense acquisition cycle. Was that achievable? How is that progressing?

When I left in January, we had still lined up for proving out this summer, and I still believe we should see some completion this year. I hope Congress will stay very engaged in trying to ensure that the capability, in fact, comes to fruition. Even just this week with Secretary [Pete] Hegseth out in the Indo-Pacific, he made some passing reference to the [US Indo-Pacific Command] commander, Admiral [Samuel] Paparo, having the flexibility to create the capability needed, and that gives me a lot of confidence of consistency.

Can you talk about how Replicator fits into broader efforts to speed up defense innovation? What's actually changing inside the system?

Traditionally, defense acquisition is slow and serial—one step after another, which works for massive, long-term systems like submarines. But for things like drones, that just doesn't cut it. With Replicator, we aimed to shift to a parallel model: integrating hardware, software, policy, and testing all at once. That's how you get speed—by breaking down silos and running things simultaneously.

It's not about “Move fast and break things.” You still have to test and evaluate responsibly. But this approach shows we can move faster without sacrificing accountability—and that's a big cultural shift.

 How important is AI to the future of national defense?

It's central. The future of warfare will be about speed and precision—decision advantage. AI helps enable that. It's about integrating capabilities to create faster, more accurate decision-making: for achieving military objectives, for reducing civilian casualties, and for being able to deter effectively. But we've also emphasized responsible AI. If it's not safe, it's not going to be effective. That's been a key focus across administrations.

What about generative AI specifically? Does it have real strategic significance yet, or is it still in the experimental phase?

As DOGE throws out the rule book for government tech, it's time we plan for the worst—and look to each other for courage and support.

It does have significance, especially for decision-making and efficiency. We had an effort called Project Lima where we looked at use cases for generative AI—where it might be most useful, and what the rules for responsible use should look like. Some of the biggest use may come first in the back office—human resources, auditing, logistics. But the ability to use generative AI to create a network of capability around unmanned systems or information exchange, either in Replicator or JADC2? That's where it becomes a real advantage. But those back-office areas are where I would anticipate to see big gains first.

[Editor's note: JADC2 is Joint All-Domain Command and Control, a DOD initiative to connect sensors from all branches of the armed forces into a unified network powered by artificial intelligence.]

In recent years, we've seen more tech industry figures stepping into national defense conversations—sometimes pushing strong political views or advocating for deregulation. How do you see Silicon Valley's growing influence on US defense strategy?

There's a long history of innovation in this country coming from outside the government—people who look at big national problems and want to help solve them. That kind of engagement is good, especially when their technical expertise lines up with real national security needs.

But that's not just one stakeholder group. A healthy democracy includes others, too—workers, environmental voices, allies. We need to reconcile all of that through a functioning democratic process. That's the only way this works.

How do you view the involvement of prominent tech entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk, in shaping national defense policies?

I believe it's not healthy for any democracy when a single individual wields more power than their technical expertise or official role justifies. We need strong institutions, not just strong personalities.

The US has long attracted top STEM talent from around the world, including many researchers from China. But in recent years, immigration hurdles and heightened scrutiny have made it harder for foreign-born scientists to stay. Do you see this as a threat to US innovation?

I think you have to be confident that you have a secure research community to do secure work. But much of the work that underpins national defense that's STEM-related research doesn't need to be tightly secured in that way, and it really is dependent on a diverse ecosystem of talent. Cutting off talent pipelines is like eating our seed corn. Programs like H-1B visas are really important.

And it's not just about international talent—we need to make sure people from underrepresented communities here in the US see national security as a space where they can contribute. If they don't feel valued or trusted, they're less likely to come in and stay.

What do you see as the biggest challenge the Department of Defense faces today?

I do think the  trust—or the lack of it—is a big challenge. Whether it's trust in government broadly or specific concerns like military spending, audits, or politicization of the uniformed military, that issue manifests in everything DOD is trying to get done. It affects our ability to work with Congress, with allies, with industry, and with the American people. If people don't believe you're working in their interest, it's hard to get anything done. 

Federal scientists warn that Americans could feel the effects of the new administration's devastating cuts for decades to come.

President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on goods imported from China in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday. The total tariff on China would rise to 104% if the country doesn't back off and drop the 34% retaliatory tariff it announced in response to Trump's own 34% hike on goods coming from the U.S. last week. And Trump's new threat isn't exactly calming anyone's nerves.

“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote.

Trump introduced a new 34% tariff on Chinese goods on April 2 during his bizarre “Liberation Day” announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House. But that tariff was already on top of an existing 20% tariff on imports from the country. If Trump does go through with his threat, it would seem the total tariff would amount to 104%, though it's not entirely clear yet if that's indeed the ceiling.

As always, Trump's threats on Monday provided little clarity on how everything may actually work. When the president made his tariffs announcement last week, complete with a now-infamous chart, market analysts and journalists were left confused about what the numbers he was displaying actually meant. It turned out that Trump was creating fake numbers that purported to show existing tariffs on U.S. goods. In reality, the White House was using an equation that made absolutely no sense.

To arrive at its numbers, the White House took the trade deficit with each country divided by the total imports from that country to the U.S. and then divided that number by half to find the tariff. If the U.S. had a trade surplus with a country, it still got slapped with a baseline tariff of 10%. Australia, for example, imports more from the U.S. than it exports but still got hit with a 10% tariff on all goods it exports to Americans.

Trump did give some breadcrumbs of hope that his tariffs on other nations outside China were up for negotiation, according to his latest Truth Social post.

“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump concluded in his Truth Social post.

The markets have been swinging wildly on Monday, first plunging at the open but then recovering briefly after a tweet from someone named Walter Bloomberg on X. Bloomberg has no affiliation with Bloomberg News but many people follow the account because it often tweets breaking news from the wire services. Erik Wasson, a reporter for Bloomberg News, even tweeted Monday that people shouldn't rely on that Walter Bloomberg account, writing “He doesn't work for us and is not authorized by Bloomberg.” Walter Bloomberg tweeted that the White House was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs, apparently because Trump advisor Kevin Hassett had given a Fox News interview two hours earlier where he'd been asked about the possibility of just such a reprieve.

KILMEADE: Would Trump consider a 90 days pause in tariffs?

HASSETT: I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide … even if you think there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP

Hassett responded “I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,” which is essentially saying that he doesn't know. But the stupid game of Telephone that is our modern internet took that as gospel that Trump would be pausing the tariffs, sending the markets soaring into positive territory before crashing back down when the White House called it “fake news.”

Congress has the power to impose tariffs under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution but Trump is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which allows the president to impose tariffs in the name of a national emergency. Trump is imposing these global tariffs because he says trade deficits are an “emergency.” Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, introduced a bill last week to claw back some of that power. And as of Monday, the bill has seven Republican sponsors, according to NBC News. But even if the bill passes the Senate, it seems unlikely to come to a vote in the House, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, has shown no signs that he will betray Trump by taking back any of the powers originally given to Congress.

Nobody knows what the rest of the week holds for the global economy, but it seems like it can only get stupider from here. And it's almost entirely the fault of one guy if you don't count the Republicans who have enabled this stupidity. Trump is playing chicken with the global economy. And picking a fight with the entire world hasn't worked out well historically for the aggressor country.

Steven Soderbergh has ideas for a Contagion sequel that he's not ready to torture the world with yet. Peacemaker season 2 sets its summer return. Plus, what's coming on the Yellowjackets finale. Spoilers now!



During a recent double feature screening of the first two Happy Death Day movies, star Jessica Rothe and director Christopher Landon confirmed Universal is finally moving forward with another sequel.

[Bloody-Disgusting]

In conversation with Extra, Channing Tatum cast doubt on if he's really playing Gambit in Avengers: Doomsday.

Personally, all I was guaranteed was a chair. They said that I have a chair, and I can at least watch the movie from the chair. You know, and it was just my name, it wasn't exactly Gambit. So, I work in the world of just like, of binary yes or no's, and I've only been guaranteed so far a chair to watch the movie in, so that's where I'm at.

Meanwhile, Alan Cumming discussed his return as Nightcrawler on a recent episode of Today With Jenna and Friends.

Isn't that nuts? It's 23 years since I was a superhero…I've had some make-up tests already.  Actually, what's great about it was that it was about four-and-a-half to five hours before [to apply], but now it's only 90 minutes. Before, all of the tattoos were done by hand because they hadn't decided on them before we started filming, and now they're on this little thing–they stick on. It's a game-changer. So, I'm going back to being a 60-year-old superhero.

Speaking with Empire Magazine, VFX supervisor Richard Baneham revealed Payakan the space whale plays a significantly larger role in Avatar: Fire and Ash.

He's turned out to be one of the most popular characters. The reaction emboldened us to go forward and play Payakan at the very highest level.

During his recent appearance on the One Decision podcast, Steven Soderbergh revealed he and Scott Z. Burns “have come up with some terrifying ideas” for a sequel to Contagion, but fears they'd be socially “irresponsible” to “put out there.”

[We've] come up with some terrifying ideas. There would have to be, I think, a plot that doesn't feel predictable. And that's the trick – when you're working on any story, the ending needs to be both surprising and inevitable. The fun of it is figuring out how to do those two things…

…I don't want to torture people. There are scenarios that you could come up with that I would categorize as irresponsible; you know, that I would go, ‘That's a big idea, but I'm not sure I want to put that idea out there, frankly.' I do think about that.

Bloody-Disgusting also reports the horror film based on Oswald the Lucky Rabbit has been “delayed indefinitely” due to an unsatisfactory script. However, writer-director Lilton Stewart III “is using the delay to focus on tightening the script.”

I recently got inspired by an idea that will definitely make the story tighter and flesh out some of the unanswered questions I was leaving for the sequel. Audiences will still have questions leading into the next chapter of the story, but will feel more satisfied at the conclusion of the first film.

Max has released a trailer for its 2025 programming roster including new footage from the upcoming It TV series, The Last of Us and Peacemaker season two. Additionally, James Gunn confirmed Peacemaker‘s August 21 debut on Twitter.

 

Finally, Showtime has released a trailer for “Full Circle,” the third season finale of Yellowjackets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Avatar: Fire and Ash Is Giving Pakayan the Whale a Girlfriend","https://gizmodo.com/avatar-fire-and-ash-is-giving-pakayan-the-whale-a-girlfriend-2000585686","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:00:31 GMT","

The upcoming Avatar: Fire & Ash aims to introduce a ton of new stuff while also doubling down on the things people liked about its predecessors. Part of that doubling down will apply to Pakayan, the tulkun (space whale) introduced in Way of Water as an outcast among his people because he killed the humans who killed his mother. Over the course of the film, he became a friend to Jake Sully's teen son Lo'ak and helped save the day in act three by going on a rampage that saved his fellow Tulkun from evil whalers.

Avatar is a franchise that loves animals, so naturally, he's getting a meatier role in the threequel. Speaking to Empire Magazine, VFX supervisor Richard Baneham said the positive response to Pakayan—which has recently involved folks on Twitter gassing him up as a great guy in Hollywood—spurred the team to “go forward and play him at the highest level.” Over the course of the film, he'll cross paths with Ta'nok, a fellow outcast who'll become his love interest. Baneham teased the pair have a “really great dynamic” together, and with how much these movies love their love stories, is there going to be a scene where they go on a date? Because that seems where things are headed.

Ta'nok isn't the only Tulkun coming along for the ride. Fire & Ash is introducing more of Tulkun society, up to and including a Patriarch and Matriarch who govern over their clan. According to Baneham, the Matriarch in particular will be in “full regalia,” with rings and tattoos “that suggest history beyond what we're seeing.” So if you couldn't get enough of Water's undersea world, Pakayan's here to give you more of it when Avatar: Fire & Ash releases on December 19.

In 2013, dozens of dolphins living in Florida's Indian River Lagoon mysteriously began to die. Their remains washed up, showing the animals had been emaciated. Now, over a decade later, ecologists believe they've figured out the cause of the bizarre die-off.

While the deaths have long been linked to gigantic algae blooms in the water, it took until now to determine exactly how the two events were connected, and it turns out, it's mostly humanity's fault. This might be hard to believe, but apparently dumping massive amounts of human waste and fertilizer into waterways can be bad.

As the ecologists note in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, the long-lasting phytoplankton blooms began in 2011. The spread of the tiny plant-like organisms led to a widespread change in the Indian River Lagoon's ecology. Their presence caused the amount of seagrass in the water to decrease by over 50%, and a 75% loss of macroalgae (better known as seaweed).

Florida Manatees Are Starving En Masse. Conservation Groups Want Them Back on Endangered List

That alone wouldn't have killed off the dolphins, but when the ecologists examined isotopic ratios in teeth samples taken from the carcasses, and compared them to teeth taken from 44 dolphins that hadn't been part of the die-off, they realized their diets had been drastically altered. The dolphins had eaten 14% to 20% fewer ladyfish, a key dolphin prey animal, but had eaten up to 25% more sea bream, a less nutritious fish. In essence, the presence of such large amounts of phytoplankton had reduced the amount of food available for the dolphins' usual prey. As the prey numbers dwindled, the dolphins had to catch more prey to consume the same amount of energy. The effects weren't felt just by those dolphins that died, but by the area's dolphin population as a whole. At the time, 64% of observed dolphins were underweight, while 5% were classified as emaciated.

“In combination, the shift in diets and the widespread presence of malnourishment suggest that dolphins were struggling to catch enough prey of any type,” said Wendy Noke Durden, a research scientist at the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, who worked on the research, in a statement. “The loss of key structural habitats may have reduced overall foraging success by causing changes in the abundance and distribution of prey.”

The historic record bears this out. According to records kept of the recorded causes of death for stranded dolphins, starvation was the cause of death in 17% of recorded dolphin deaths in the area between 2000 and 2020. That number spiked to 61% in 2013.

“Blooms of phytoplankton are part of productive ecological systems,” said Charles Jacoby, strategic program director at the University of South Florida, who also worked on the study. “Detrimental effects arise when the quantities of nutrients entering a system fuel unusually intense, widespread, or long-lasting blooms. In most cases, people's activities drive these excess loads. Managing our activities to keep nutrients at a safe level is key to preventing blooms that disrupt ecological systems.”

The Floodwaters in Florida Are Toxic and Dangerous, Officials Warn

There is a small silver lining to this grisly finding. As the researchers noted, waste and other crap dumped into Indian River Lagoon is being gradually reduced and is expected to hit safe levels in 2035.

Still, it's no surprise that human activity can be harmful to ecosystems—from chopping down shocking amounts of rainforest, to the melting of polar ice, to the inadvertent introduction of thousands of invasive species to new territories. This latest example shows that beyond the obvious primary effects, our habit of dumping God-knows-what into natural environments can have all sorts of trickle-down results—including killing some of our most beloved wildlife.

Scandium and Dysprosium are just the latest materials added to the list.

China has introduced new export restrictions on materials containing key materials for RF and storage applications — scandium and dysprosium — which may hurt key players in these industries, including Broadcom, GF, Qualcomm, TSMC, Samsung, Seagate, and Western Digital. China's new restrictions follow two prior rounds of rare earth export rules that are slowly tightening the supply of these critical minerals, especially those used in several chipmaking applications.

Scandium is widely used for RF front-end modules found in smartphones, Wi-Fi modules, and base stations, whereas dysprosium is used for HDD heads and electric vehicles.

This is not the first time China's Ministry of Economy has restricted exports of rare-earth materials. The restriction on rare earth materials export has been made in response to the 54% tariffs imposed on goods produced in China by the Trump administration, complemented by a 34% import duty on all products made in the U.S.

Effective immediately, exporters of products containing Scandium, Dysprosium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Lutetium, Samarium, and Yttrium must apply for an export license from the China Ministry of Economy. The application requires customers to detail the final use of the material.

The new rules cover various products containing the previously listed rare earth metals, including raw ore, metal, compounds, and finished goods. While not an outright ban, this is the third round of China's export restrictions that raises supply concerns among manufacturers worldwide and deepens tensions between the U.S. and China.

These export restrictions reflect a calculated escalation strategy that targets the entire supply chain of high-tech manufacturing, from foundational wafer-level materials to fabrication-critical metals, in addition to rare earth materials used in other use-cases.

But is the third round of export restrictions from China more impactful on the industry than the first two?

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



As the image above illustrates, two of the key materials restricted in this round are Scandium and Dysprosium, both of which hold significant importance for the telecom and storage industries, which are difficult to overstate.



Scandium is primarily used in RF applications through its role in Scandium Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN). This material is used for high-performance wave filters like BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) and SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave).

By introducing (doping) Scandium to Aluminum Nitride at levels of around 10% to 40%, ScAlN achieves higher piezoelectric response and electromechanical coupling (compared to AlN alone), which is critical for improving signal strength, bandwidth, and power efficiency in high-frequency telecom applications.

These filters are essential components in the front-end modules of 5G smartphones and base stations and Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7 modules. While scandium is ubiquitous, one 200-mm or 300-mm wafer with chips featuring ScAlN only needs a few grams of Scandium.

Dysprosium is an even more widely used material as it is used for storage, electric vehicles, and even radiation-hardened applications. In HDDs, dysprosium is added to permanent neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets used in voice coil motors, which control the read/write head as it improves the magnet's coercivity under high temperatures. NdFeB magnets are also used for motors in electric vehicles, so dysprosium is used for the same purpose.

In MRAM (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory), Dysprosium is used in the free or pinned magnetic layers of GMR (Giant Magnetoresistance) or TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) stacks to maintain stability of magnetic orientation. In addition, radiation-shielding components, such as those used in nuclear reactors, spacecraft, and satellites, also use Dysprosium.

Other materials in the list, namely Gadolinium, Terbium, Yttrium, Lutetium, and Aamarium, are also widely used and cannot be substituted without tradeoffs and at enhanced costs (including those associated with changes of production flows), characteristics, and risks.

But there is good news, too. While rare earth metals are called 'rare' and China supplies the lion's share of the world's rare earth materials, these elements are actually not rare. In fact, these metals are pretty widespread well beyond China.

They are hard to get; as in many cases, rare earth metals are obtained by mining other materials and subsequent separation of rare earths. The key reason why China is the dominant supplier of these materials and products on their base is because Chinese companies have managed to build an efficient ecosystem to mine, extract, and refine rare earth elements.

Some say China subsidizes its rare earth industry to control the supply of critical materials by making it unprofitable to produce them in other parts of the world. However, once China began to 'weaponize' its rare earth prowess, companies in other countries rejoiced, as their potential to supply rare earth materials in volume just became a real business opportunity. Few companies would try to save on strategically important items, such as rare earth materials, so companies would likely be willing to switch suppliers following the restrictions.

As noted above, this isn't the first round of China's restrictions of rare earth supplies. Moreover, this is not the most 'impressive' one, either. China's rare earth export curbs escalate from foundational materials (Antimony, Gallium, and Germanium) to fabrication-critical metals, then to rare earths used in RF, storage, and precision components.



In the initial round, China restricted Antimony, Gallium, and Germanium. Germanium is crucial for producing wafers featuring strained silicon and the most high-performance chips made by Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. These companies have used strained silicon for a couple of decades. Meanwhile, a 300-mm wafer uses around a gram of Germanium.

Antimony is used as a dopant to make n-type regions in transistors, so again, requirements per wafer are limited. As for Gallium, it is a key element to power semiconductors, RF electronics, infrared sensing, and compound semiconductors (such as ScAlN/AlGaN/GaN). However, when it comes to usage in applications like radars and telecommunications, Gallium and Germanium are inseparable.

Without any doubt, these materials support industries ranging from telecommunications to defense and data centers. That makes the restrictions highly disruptive at the early stage of the semiconductor value and manufacturing chain.

The second round expanded pressure to include Tungsten, Indium, Molybdenum, Bismuth, and Tellurium, materials tied directly to semiconductor fabrication. Tungsten and Molybdenum are used in transistor contacts, gates, and interconnects in advanced nodes where extreme thermal and electrical reliability are necessary. Indium is crucial for 5G mmWave front-end modules, satellite communications, and photonic chips.

Restricting these materials strikes at the core of modern semiconductor production, though we have yet to see any actual disruption of chip supply due to China's export curbs.

With its export restrictions, China leverages its dominance not only in resource extraction, but also in processing and material science. Thus, creating widespread uncertainty across the global semiconductor ecosystem, which now spans from smartphones, to PCs, self-driving vehicles, and sophisticated defense systems.



On one hand, this means that China's approach to export curbs indicates a deliberate, phased control strategy, targeting the entire vertical stack of semiconductor and high-tech production, including niche but irreplaceable elements. On the other hand, it means that the impact of China's curbs could decrease over time as the industry adapts its supply chains to the new reality.

Will there be further rounds? Without a doubt. We can only wonder what materials they will target, but keep in mind that China does not want to ruin the whole semiconductor or high-tech supply chain and instead wants to thrive on it. Stay tuned, as it's unlikely that this will be the last time we'll hear from the country about rare earth export restrictions.

Close enough, welcome back, Vega 56.

Within just a month, the PC enthusiast community has already flashed the base RX 9070 with the XT's vBIOS, as reported by PCGH. In this instance, the increased TGP and clock speeds net a solid 15-20% uplift over the base configuration, and with some tuning, the RX 9070 can approach or even surpass its XT equivalent. While this is a fun experiment with tangible benefits, remember that modding your GPU's vBIOS will likely void any warranty and carries a number of risks, like bricking your GPU.

As shown in the benchmarks below, the base RX 9070 is quite power-starved, limited to a 220W TGP compared to the 304W TGP design on its XT brethren. The clock speeds also take a significant hit, dropping from 2.97 GHz (reference) to 2.52 GHz (reference). A member of the PCGH community successfully flashed his Asus Prime RX 9070 with the vBIOS of the Asus Prime RX 9070 XT, clearing the power and frequency blockade. This effectively bumped the power draw to 317W, with the boost clocks up in the 3.1 GHz range.

Across the 3DMark suite, the modded RX 9070 coupled with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consistently achieves 15-20% higher performance than similar non-modded configurations. In addition, with some overclocking and tuning, it is reported that the user managed to beat a stock RX 9070 XT. As might be expected, some minor instabilities were observed. AMD's ULPS (Ultra Low Power State) not working was one such issue.

Both Nvidia and AMD have tightened restrictions on vBIOS modifications in recent years. Such modding is especially tricky with Nvidia's hardware, owing to a vBIOS signature check that started with the Maxwell generation, primarily to prevent fraud and scams.

With previous AMD GPU generations like Vega and RDNA 1, the firm used the same underlying chip for its top two GPUs, differentiating them mainly through disabled hardware shaders and software-locked clock speeds. Much of the same saga repeats with RDNA 4, and the mere $50 price difference makes the RX 9070 seem like an obvious upselling tactic for the RX 9070 XT.

The software aspect of earlier gen limitations could be overcome by flashing the vBIOS, allowing many Vega 56 cards to perform like Vega 64s, while bringing RX 5700 performance up to RX 5700 XT levels. However, since the missing shaders are likely fused off on the hardware level, they cannot be re-enabled through software.

If you decide to take your GPU for a spin, be aware of the obvious dangers of vBIOS modding. Likewise, keep an eye on your core, memory, and VRM temperatures as you'd be pushing over 300W across a board that's likely not designed with that figure in mind.

Patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) experienced longer diagnostic delays than matched patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with polyarticular PsA received less intensive disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy than their matched RA comparators.

""These findings highlight the need for education both of patients and the clinical team, to support earlier diagnosis and treatment, thus improving longer-term outcomes,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Rachel Charlton, University of Bath, Bath, United Kingdom. It was published online on March 29, 2025, in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

The disease activity scoring used in the study, may underestimate articular disease in psoriatic arthritis. The national audit does not include measures for other PsA domains, such as psoriasis and enthesitis, limiting the quantification of the disease burden. Wider phenotypes of PsA were excluded in the audit. 

The study was supported by unrestricted grants from Jansen. The National Early Inflammatory Arthritis Audit was supported by National Health Service (NHS) England, NHS Improvement and the Welsh government. Some authors reported receiving research grants, consulting fees, speaker fees from various pharmaceutical companies.

A new analysis found that the incidence of interval breast cancers diagnosed in screened patients has increased over an almost 30-year period, but the proportion of interval cancers vs screen-detected cancers has remained steady at about 30%. Factors associated with an increased risk for interval cancer included a family history of breast cancer, dense breasts, and use of hormone replacement therapy.

“The proportion of [interval cancer] was not reduced during the past three decades in Sweden,” the authors wrote. Women with a family history of breast cancer “may be at higher risk of developing [interval cancer], often due to the rapid growth of tumors between screening intervals rather than missed detections.”

“Identifying patients at high risk of poor breast cancer outcomes despite routine mammography screening is a critical goal for the breast cancer screening community. More efforts are needed to advance the field of risk prediction by leveraging information beyond traditional risk factors, applying cutting-edge AI [artificial intelligence] technology, and targeting end points correlated with breast cancer prognosis to achieve greater reductions in breast cancer mortality,” the authors of an invited commentary wrote.

This study, led by Yuqi Zhang, PhD, Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, was published online in JAMA Oncology, alongside an invited commentary.

The findings were based on the screening setting in Sweden, where screening intervals and practices are standardized, potentially limiting the findings' generalizability to other settings with different protocols. Information on hormone replacement therapy was only available from 2005, which might have resulted in lower estimates than the numbers in earlier periods when its use was more prevalent.

This study received support through grants from the Swedish Research Council; Swedish Cancer Society; Stockholm County Council; and Cancerföreningen, Stockholm. The authors reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

To slow the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza — such as the prevalent H5N1 strain — real-time reporting of current genome data is crucial. Yet “extensive delays” of 7.5 months or more between sample collection and submission to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) repository have occurred, according to a commentary by Canadian experts.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, a study highlighted lengthy delays in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequence submission to GISAID, averaging about 48 days between sample collection and submission. After the analysis was published, numerous countries improved their pipelines for data submission, bringing the timeline down to 30 days by 2024.

Improving the collection-to-submission times worldwide helped with SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring and public health recommendations in recent years, the authors wrote. The same efforts are needed to track and mitigate H5N1.

“We initially went to look at how H5N1 was evolving within Canada and were surprised to find that we couldn't tell because so few of the sequences were recent,” lead author Sarah Otto, PhD, professor of zoology at the University of British Columbia's Biodiversity Research Centre in Vancouver, told Medscape Medical News.

“There is very little targeted funding devoted to monitoring H5N1 in wildlife in North America, but evidence suggests that wildlife, particularly migrating birds, is the source of infections getting into poultry and cattle and from farm animals into humans,” she said. “We need more targeted and rapid sequencing of wildlife to detect early signs of infections in a region and proactively protect local farms and farmworkers.”

The commentary was published online on March 25 in Nature Biotechnology.

Otto and co-author Sean Edgerton, a PhD student focused on genomics and infectious diseases at the University of British Columbia, accessed GISAID data on January 10 and February 26. Their analyses included sequences for H5N1, H1N1, and SARS-CoV-2.

For H5N1, the researchers analyzed metadata for clade 2.3.4.4b sequences submitted from January 2021 through December 2024, removing data collected more than 1 year before this period. This analysis resulted in 18,817 samples from 84 countries.

Overall, the median collection-to-submission time delay was 228 days for H5N1 data, ranging from 14 to 932 days. Among countries submitting at least 50 sequences, median delays ranged from 25 in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands to 618 days in Canada. Half of the countries had median delays longer than 6 months.

In general, influenza metadata on GISAID appeared to be vague or missing in most cases, Otto and Edgerton wrote. About two thirds of submissions lacked sufficient detail about the host species to determine the genus of the host, and 90% lacked information about whether the animal was domestic or wild. In addition, 87% lacked animal health status information.

Certain data sources, particularly the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), provided incomplete information when first submitting sequences and added details later, the authors wrote. When accessing GISAID in January and February, the authors saw the backfilling of metadata, where the USDA later added more information about sample collection day or state for about half of 1763 sequences.

Current data delays were similar to those during the H1N1 pandemic a decade ago, the authors wrote. For the 21,387 samples from 150 countries submitted from 2010 through 2013, the median collection-to-submission time delay was 289 days, ranging from 32 to 1115 days.

Otto and Edgerton considered several factors that might account for delays, such as gross domestic product (GDP). However, several high-GDP countries had long delays, including 413 days in Norway, 467 days in France, and 618 days in Canada, while several lower-GDP countries submitted data two or three times faster.

One factor — the host species — appeared to be associated with a longer delay, the authors wrote. For instance, with H5N1, the collection-to-submission time was only 15 days for the first 65 samples sequenced from humans compared with 230 days for 18,592 samples from mammals or birds. Wildlife samples took even longer.

Similar delays occurred with H1N1 samples, the authors found. The median collection-to-submission time was 244 days for 17,600 human samples compared with 422 days for 3782 animal samples. Even in 2024, H1N1 data had a median of 60 days for 35,681 human samples compared with 127 days for 922 animal samples.

Animal samples also had longer delays for SARS-CoV-2 data. In 2024, the median delay was 30 days for 693,824 human samples compared with 787 days for 654 animal samples.

The differences could be attributed to data collection and the agencies that handle animal sequencing, the authors wrote. The USDA or Canadian Food Inspection Agency, for instance, may have certain policies for sample processing and data sharing for animal sequences, especially when multiple groups and agencies may be involved in data collection.

Although submission delays have improved during the past decade, shifting from a median of 14 months for H1N1 data to about 7.5 months for H5N1 data, the ongoing slowdown in submissions can prevent real-time analysis of “what is happening on the ground,” the authors wrote.

“Viruses, particularly this virus [H5N1], do not know boundaries, either between countries or species,” Otto said. “While we've been lucky so far that the virus hasn't yet evolved or spread readily among humans, rapid monitoring of wildlife is needed to know when the virus is getting close so that we can work together to contain the virus.”

Canadian virologists and wildlife experts have been keeping a careful eye on H5N1 developments in recent years, looking for mutations and the potential for human-to-human transmission.

“The scientific community has been watching the H5N1 viruses mutate and evolve in avian populations around the world for several decades. In the past few years, these viruses have shown increasing flexibility in infecting diverse mammalian populations, which raises their pandemic potential significantly,” said Brian Ward, MD, professor of medicine at McGill University and associate director of McGill's J.D. MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases in Montreal.

“Timely monitoring of H5N1 mutations — particularly those that increase the risk of mammal-to-mammal transmission — is important to give us as much forewarning as possible of an impending pandemic,” he said. “Even a few months could make a large difference in how effectively governments, industry, and populations can respond. International cooperation in keeping the GISAID database current is a critical tool in this effort.”

Worldwide surveillance remains key — and is growing more important — Canadian experts told Medscape Medical News, both with official sample sequencing and informal monitoring. Healthcare providers can remain alert to patients who present with unexplained severe respiratory symptoms, they said.

“Ultimately, from a human health standpoint, I'm not directly concerned about the circulating H5N1 strains. I'm worried about what they might become,” said Scott Weese, DVM, professor of pathobiology at the Ontario Veterinary College and director of the University of Guelph's Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses in Guelph, Ontario.

“H5N1 is currently not well adapted to infect and transmit between people and most domestic animals. Severe disease has been rare in people,” he said. “However, the concern is what this virus could become as it continues to evolve, and the more it infects mammals, the greater chance for relevant evolution or recombination with other flu viruses.”

That's why making surveillance-to-action plans is key for H5N1 and other emerging diseases, Weese said. Real-time data help public health workers, government leaders, and healthcare providers know what to do. With months-long delays, however, taking certain preventive actions would likely be too late, he noted.

“Cats should show us why we need to be diligent. This virus effectively infects and often kills cats. If it did to us what it does to cats, the world would be very different,” Weese said. “It's not currently milder in people than cats because of anything we did or any predictable process. It's luck. This virus is a great match for cats — and readily infects their brains. We don't want a version that can do the same to people.”

The analysis was conducted without outside funding. Otto, Edgerton, Ward, and Weese reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 April 07, 2025  

Adding combination treatment with simvastatin and rifaximin to standard therapy did not prevent severe complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, a European randomized trial found.

Published in JAMA, the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 LIVERHOPE trial was conducted in 14 European hospitals from January 2019 to December 2022, the last date of follow-up.

Investigators led by Elisa Pose, MD, PhD, a research fellow in the Liver Unit at the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona in Barcelona, Spain, randomly assigned 237 patients with advanced, mostly alcohol-related liver disease to receive either simvastatin 20 mg/d plus rifaximin 1200 mg/d (n = 117) or an identical-appearing placebo (n = 120) for 12 months. Patients also received standard therapy, stratified according to Child-Pugh class B or C.

A previous simvastatin trial demonstrated a benefit in cirrhosis death. And with rifaximin, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) “showed positive results for prevention of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis,” Pose told Medscape Medical News. “Rifaximin targets bacterial translocation from the gut in patients with cirrhosis. Simvastatin lowers portal pressure, the main pathogenetic cause of decompensation in cirrhosis, and may reduce systemic inflammation.”

“Randomized clinical trials showed that not only did 40 mg of simvastatin daily significantly reduce portal hypertension but it also improved survival in patients with cirrhosis who recovered from variceal bleeding compared with placebo,” added study co-author Ruben Hernaez, MD, MPH, PhD, an associate professor of medicine – gastroenterology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “With rifaximin, one could expect not only improvement in hepatic encephalopathy but also a decreased infection rate, the most common trigger of acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF].”

In addition to lowering serum cholesterol, statins have pleiotropic effects via their anti-inflammatory properties, which make them an attractive option for decompensated cirrhosis, the authors explained, and their effect on portal hypertension may diminish complications and increase survival.

“The hypothesis is that simvastatin could improve intrahepatic circulation through an increase in nitric oxide synthesis or due to anti-inflammatory effects,” said Hernaez. “Cirrhosis, similar to any other chronic condition, suffers from an enhanced systemic inflammation, which increases as the disease progresses.”

Cirrhosis is also associated with increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation, which can foster hepatic encephalopathy, bacterial infection, and ACLF. Rifaximin has been shown to reduce the risk for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and modulate the gut microbiome.

Commenting on the study but not involved in it, Meena B. Bansal, MD, a professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and system chief of the Division of Liver Diseases at Mount Sinai Health System, both in New York City, cautioned that previous studies were limited by confounding by indication because those with poor liver function already have low cholesterol and thus may not have been prescribed statins. In the current study, the authors prospectively used a statin independent of cholesterol levels and combined it with an antibiotic, which may help decrease microbial translocation and ACLF.

“There is a great need to prevent ACLF/decompensating events, and thus, the negative results of this study are disappointing,” Bansal said.

The trial's primary endpoint was the incidence of severe complications of liver cirrhosis associated with organ failure meeting criteria for ACLF. Secondary outcomes included transplant or death and a composite endpoint of cirrhotic complications, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, acute kidney injury, and infection.

The 237 participants had Child-Pugh class B (n = 194) or class C (n = 43), 72% were men, more than 90% were White, and 79.8% had alcohol-related cirrhosis.

The study found no significant differences between the treatment and placebo arms in the following outcomes:

Also, the benefits were not observed in any patient subgroup, although this type of analysis was not part of the endpoints. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both arms at 426 vs 419 (P =.59), but three patients in the treatment group (2.6%) developed rhabdomyolysis.

The results suggest, however, that this statin/antibiotic combination is at least not harmful in this patient population, Hernaez said.

The lack of benefit observed likely related to the advanced state of liver disease in the cohort. “When you look at the MELD [Model for End-Stage Liver Disease] score, the most-used measure to assess liver function and prognosis, it is higher in this cohort than in patients from the previous trial showing positive results in survival,” Pose said. “The rest of the studies showing positive results were mostly retrospective cohort studies or small RCTs showing effects on portal pressure. We think it is likely that studies at earlier stages — maybe patients with compensated liver disease — may have more positive results.”

Pose added that statins will not be prescribed at her center beyond the lipid-lowering indication. And in her view, the question of add-on therapy is closed for patients with advanced disease “but may be open for earlier stages of cirrhosis.”

Unanswered questions remain, however, Hernaez said. “For example, patients with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease may have a different intensity of the inflammatory milieu compared to the majority of patients in our study [whose disease] was alcohol-related.” Furthermore, is a simvastatin dose of 20 mg enough, and what would be the effect if patients had less advanced disease or compensated cirrhosis? “Hence, while we proved with a well-conducted negative randomized clinical trial the combination is not affecting this outcome and population, the question is still unanswered for other types of patient populations and/or dose.” Hernaez said.

Bansal, too, pointed to the need for further studies in more diverse populations with varying etiologies of liver disease. “About 80% of this European population had alcohol-associated liver disease,” she said, agreeing that the study population likely had too-advanced disease. “The beneficial effects of these drugs may only be seen in those with less advanced cirrhosis, which warrants further study.” Based on these findings, Bansal added, statins should not be prescribed to prevent ACLF but reserved for patients with eligible cardiovascular risk factors, and rifaximin for those who meet criteria for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.

This work was supported by a grant from the Horizon 20/20 program.

Pose, Hernaez, and Bansal had no relevant competing interests to disclose. Multiple coauthors, including co–senior author Pere Ginès, reported having financial ties such as receiving research funding from; receiving advisory, consulting, or speaker's fees from; and holding stocks and patents in multiple private-sector companies.

 April 07, 2025  

BOSTON — In the staging of liver fibrosis in the post-liver transplant setting, readings from noninvasive tests commonly have major discrepancies when compared with liver biopsy results, particularly in cases of severe steatosis, according to the results of a new study.

Our findings support liver biopsy as “the gold standard for confirmation of allograft fibrosis that is predicted by transient elastography and assessment of its underlying cause,” said first study author Nazire Albayrak, MD, of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.

Liver fibrosis is known to be the main driver of chronic liver disease as well as a key factor influencing post-liver transplant morbidity and mortality.

While a liver biopsy is indeed considered the gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis, such biopsies have important drawbacks, including the involvement of invasive surgery, discomfort, the potential for complications, and the consumption of time.

To help assist in the assessment of fibrosis, noninvasive tests, including serum biomarker indices and hepatic imaging techniques, have gained interest and have been validated in the detection and monitoring of chronic liver disease.

Although these tests have been adopted for clinical use post-liver transplant, research is lacking on their reliability in this setting, the study authors noted here at the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology 2025 Annual Meeting. 

To compare the results of such tests with confirmed assessments on liver biopsy, Albayrak and colleagues evaluated results on the two most widely used noninvasive tests: FibroScan, which uses ultrasound to assess liver stiffness, and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), an index that calculates liver fibrosis with a score based on age, platelet count, and levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.

They identified 108 liver transplant recipients who had received a liver biopsy between 2015 and 2024 and who had testing with FibroScan within 6 months of transplant and lab values within 1 month.

Liver biopsies with < 7 portal tracts and/or < 1 cm in total core length were excluded.

The median age of the study participants was 63 years, 54% were male, and the median graft age was 5.4 years. More than half had type 2 diabetes (60.1%) and/or obesity (58%).

The most common post-transplant major liver biopsy diagnoses included recurrent and new steatotic liver disease (45.4% and 26.8%, respectively), recurrent hepatitis C (8.3%), and organ rejection (7.4%).

All of the patients with recurrent steatotic liver disease had diabetes, while 82.7% of patients with new steatotic liver disease had diabetes and/or obesity.

The patients had a median fibrosis stage of 1, as determined by trichrome stain. A median stiffness of 8.2 kPa and a FIB-4 of 2.032 were both predictors of stage 2 fibrosis.

Importantly, for patients with no fibrosis, FibroScan and FIB-4 each overestimated the degree of fibrosis (P < .0001); FIB-4 also predicted more fibrosis than liver biopsy in stage 1 of disease (P < .0001).

Overall, major discrepancies occurred in 25% of cases, and most were associated with severe stenosis, observed on 62.5% of biopsies and imaging.

Specific over-assessments included 24% (21/88) of stage F0-2 cases that were wrongfully described as stage F3-4 on FibroScan.

Conversely, 30% (6/20) of stage F3-4 cases on liver biopsy were undercalled as stage F0-2 on FibroScan.

On FIB-4 scoring, 29.6% (26/88) that were stage F0-2 were called stage F3-4, while 45% (9/20) of patients that were stage F3-4 were undercalled as stage F0-2.

Specific examples of cases involving discrepancies included:

The high rate of discrepancies observed in the study could have been related to the fact that a higher proportion of patients had obesity, and as many as 40% had moderate to severe steatosis, Albayrak cautioned.

“Also, one of the overcalls was due to amyloid infiltration,” she said.

The bottom-line result remains, however, that “major discrepancies in fibrosis assessment occurred in more than 50% of cases,” in the study, she concluded.

Further commenting on the issue, Nigar Anjuman Khurram, MD, of the UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, added that various other factors are known to elevate estimations of fibrosis potentially falsely on FibroScan.

“Physiological factors such as hepatic inflammation, cholestasis, and vascular congestion may [also] alter liver stiffness readings, compromising accuracy,” she told Medscape Medical News.

“Additionally, technical considerations, including probe positioning, patient cooperation, and operator proficiency, can introduce measurement variability,” she said.

Khurram presented separate research at the meeting showing that yet another factor — ferritin — may also not be as reliably predictive of liver fibrosis as expected.

“Ferritin estimation alone, in the absence of liver biopsy, remains a key parameter in guiding hemochromatosis management,” she said. However, “in our study, we observed that despite normal serum ferritin levels, some patients exhibited fibrosis progression to advanced stages, as confirmed by histological examination.”

These findings indicate that ferritin levels, “while useful clinically to guide therapy, cannot be used to replace liver biopsy as a gold standard,” said Khurram.

Albayrak and Khurram had no disclosures to report.

Elevated diabetes distress (DD) correlated with autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation symptoms in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D), with supradiaphragmatic and subdiaphragmatic symptoms being more pronounced in those experiencing high to moderate DD than in those with mild or no distress.

“This study adds evidence for the presence of physiologic symptoms of emotional regulation in DD,” the authors wrote.

“The observed findings suggest the PVT appears to be a promising neurophysiologic paradigm to understand the phenomenon of DD in adults with T1D and T2D,” they added.

This study was led by Mary de Groot of the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was published online in Diabetes Care.

The generalizability of this study was limited by the utilization of convenience samples from individuals with relatively high socioeconomic status, access to computer-based surveys, and limited ethnic diversity. Self-reported data may have introduced reporting bias. Additionally, data collection at only one timepoint limited the assessment of longitudinal associations. 

Funding for participant incentives was provided by Division of Endocrinology Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine. One author reported being a faculty consultant to Mediflix, Inc.

The overall incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United Kingdom plateaued at 67.4 per 100,000 person-years from 2000 to 2021, with slight improvements observed in overall survival, particularly in those aged 60-69 years; however, the incidence of early-onset CRC showed an increasing trend during the same period.

""In conclusion, our study shows a reduction in CRC incidence over the years, mostly driven by those aged 60-79 years, in whom consistent small survival improvements are observed, possibly associated with screening. The rising EOCRC [early-onset CRC] incidence raises the question of whether lowering the screening age could improve outcomes and highlights the need to better understand its biology and risk factors for more targeted screening,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Patricia Pedregal-Pascual and Carlos Guarner-Argente, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online in The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Researchers acknowledged several key limitations, including the lack of linkage to cancer registry data, which may have resulted in misclassification or delayed diagnoses. The use of primary care records prevented stratification on the basis of tumour histology, genetic mutations, staging, or cancer therapies, limiting the ability to account for differences in prognosis across subgroups. Additionally, factors such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity that may affect incidence, prevalence, and survival were not analysed.

This study received funding through a grant from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. Additionally, this study received partial support from the National Institute for Health and Care Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.

A noninvasive clinicopathologic and gene expression profiling (CP-GEP)–based tool, the Merlin assay, shows promise for identifying recurrence risks in patients with early-stage melanoma who do not undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB).

This was the conclusion of a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of patients with stage I/II disease, reported by Teresa Amaral, MD, PhD, at the 11th World Congress of Melanoma and 21st European Association of Dermato-Oncology Congress 2025.

Of 930 patients included in the study, the assay identified 879 as having a low risk for recurrence and 51 as having high risk for recurrence. The overall 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) rates were 90.9%, 96.9%, and 97.5%, respectively.

The corresponding rates among those stratified by the assay as having low vs high recurrence risk, respectively, were 94.6% and 26.6% for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 25.08), 98.6% vs 62.1% for DMFS (HR, 35.39), and 99.4% vs 61.7% for MSS (HR, 71.05), said Amaral, during her presentation at the meeting.

Of 16 melanoma-specific deaths, 12 were stratified as high risk for recurrence by the CP-GEP assay, said Amaral, head of the Skin Cancer Clinical Trials Center at the University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany, and first author of the study.

Study participants had stages IA-IIC melanoma, 41% were women, and median age was 64 years. Median melanoma thickness was 0.5 mm, and 94% were not ulcerated. 

No systemic treatment options currently exist for patients with this early-stage disease, the author said.

The CP-GEP model, initially developed by the Mayo Clinic and SkylineDx BV to predict the positivity of SNLB, has been validated in multiple studies.

Amaral and her colleagues previously demonstrated the ability of the CP-GEP model to stratify patients with stages I-II disease as having low or high risk for recurrence — including in a small number of patients without SNLB. Those findings are confirmed in this larger population of patients who did not undergo SNLB, she said.

SkylineDx announced the findings in a press release stating the results validate the prognostic power of the Merlin assay for “identifying tumors at high risk for relapse that would otherwise be missed by traditional clinical and pathological evaluation.”

SNLB is the gold standard for nodal assessment for staging cutaneous melanoma. More than 80% of patients who undergo SNLB are negative for nodal metastases, but most patients who relapse or die from their melanoma are initially stratified by SNLB as having low-risk early-stage disease, Amaral explained. This suggests “SNLB is not enough,” she noted.

The findings suggest that CP-GEP has the potential to risk stratify patients with early-stage melanoma that did not undergo SLNB and help select those who can forgo SLNB, she said.

Without another means of assessing risk, patients considered low risk based on SNLB are closely followed, the author explained.

“If we could identify the very low-risk patient and then allocate the resources to the very high-risk patients who really need a more detailed and more tailored approach…we would be doing a favor to our patients,” the author concluded.

Amaral disclosed personal financial relationships with Delcath, Philogen, Bristol Myers Squibb, NeraCare, Novartis, Pierre Fabre, CeCaVa, and MedTrix.

Around 38 million people in the United States — or slightly over 11% of the population — have diabetes, according to the National Diabetes Statistics Report. Experts only expect that number to increase, and research suggests that the burden will be especially significant in low to low-middle socioeconomic areas.

Consider the Mississippi Delta, a swath of fertile land in the floodplain of the Mississippi River. It has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, with a minority-majority population, along with significant economic challenges and a persistently high poverty rate. The region also has one of the highest diabetes rates in the country, which has put the healthcare community on alert.

“We are more intensely screening almost everybody,” said Brent Smith, MD, a family physician in Greenville, Mississippi, and a member of the board of directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

But diabetes knows no state or county boundary lines. Asha Shajahan, MD, a family medicine physician with Corewell Health in Roseville, Michigan, estimates that at least half of her patients have diabetes. “For the most part, most are overweight,” she added.

Internist Mohan Moreshwar Nadkarni, MD, has been in practice for more than 30 years. He is keenly aware of the increase in patients with diabetes and prediabetes over the years. Today, he sees patients at University of Virginia Health's largest primary care clinic in Charlottesville, Virginia. He estimates that about 30% of the clinic's 13,000 patients have diabetes — along with various other chronic health conditions. 

“The increase in diabetes can be directly linked to the increase in obesity and the decrease in exercise,” said Nadkarni, who is also University of Virginia Health's chief of general internal medicine.

Driven by sedentary lifestyles, high-calorie diets, and in some cases, genetics, the obesity epidemic has been a key factor in the rise of type 2 diabetes cases.

“Typically, at least a third of my patients have type 2 diabetes,” said Deborah Lauridsen, MD, a family medicine physician with Orlando Health Physician Associates in Orlando, Florida. “This has steadily increased throughout my years of practice, as the obesity epidemic has become more prevalent.”

A September 2024 report on obesity from Trust for America's Health noted that the first year in which any state had an adult obesity rate higher than 35% was 2013. Ten years later, 23 states had adult obesity rates at or above 35%. A 2024 data brief from the CDC reported that from August 2021 to August 2023, the prevalence of obesity in adults was 40.3%, with individuals ages 40-59 years reflecting a large majority of that percentage.

However, it is not as simple as just asking patients to eat healthier and exercise more. For example, many low-income areas are food deserts, with a dearth of affordable, healthy food. According to Smith, many people in the Mississippi Delta put in long hard hours in the agriculture and manufacturing industries, but it may not be the kind of activity they need to keep their weight — and their blood sugar levels — down.

Smith hears the frustration in his patients' voices when they say things like, “I walk all day. That should count.” 

“But it doesn't, not in this situation,” said Smith, who serves as program director of the Mississippi Delta Family Medicine Residency Program in addition to seeing his own patients.

Patients with diabetes or prediabetes need regular aerobic exercise to improve their cardiovascular function, lipid levels, and sensitivity to insulin, as well as resistance training to help with glycemic control and insulin resistance, according to the American Diabetes Association.

Substantive changes, such as addressing the socioeconomic factors that often contribute to diabetes, could help drive the numbers down, but “it's simple in explanation and daunting in execution,” Smith said.

Some suggest that the advent of more effective medications may eventually turn the tide. 

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, have helped a growing number of people with type 2 diabetes shed pounds and get their blood glucose levels under control. However, for now, not everyone has access to these medications, which can be expensive even with insurance coverage.

While patients with diabetes make up a sizeable proportion of patient panels in many primary care practices, there could be even more undiscovered cases. For instance, more than 38 million people have diabetes, but fewer than 30 million of them know it. Nearly nine million adults with diabetes are undiagnosed, according to the National Diabetes Statistics Report.

Diabetes is often called a “silent killer” because it can cause damage long before any outward signs appear. Without a diagnosis, those nine million people do not get the care they need to prevent damage to their blood vessels and nerves that could lead to serious complications, like heart and kidney damage and diabetic retinopathy.

“So, there are still leaps and bounds to be made in terms of getting everyone who has diabetes diagnosed with it,” said Nadkarni.

Smith is an advocate for intensive screening for diabetes in the primary care setting — that is, making sure that anyone who meets the criteria of being at risk gets screened. 

Intensive screening also allows providers to detect prediabetes in their patients. According to the National Diabetes Statistic Report, there are 97.6 million people age > 18 years who have prediabetes. That is 38% of the adult US population. 

The American Diabetes Association and US Preventive Services Task Force recently expanded their criteria for who should be screened, with the goal of identifying more patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. For example, in addition to screening patients with risk factors such as obesity, a family history of diabetes, a sedentary lifestyle, and a history of gestational diabetes, guidelines now recommend that screening for type 2 diabetes and diabetes begin at age 35 years, regardless of whether a patient has any other risk factors.

“We're putting more and more emphasis on catching it at the cusp and catching it so we can prevent it,” said Smith.

Early detection and early treatment also bring along some professional satisfaction, Smith noted. It can be frustrating to figure out how to make major headway for a patient with a more complicated case or end-stage complications, but a committed effort to prevention can reduce the need for that kind of care.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I want to briefly discuss a somewhat straightforward but very provocative report, which leads to the potential for greater discussion at another time. The paper is “Patient Enrollment to Industry-Sponsored Versus Federally-Sponsored Cancer Clinical Trials,” reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. 

These investigators looked at a total of 26,000 cancer-related studies conducted from 2008 to 2022. They specifically look at the earlier period, 2008-2012, vs the latest period, 2018-2022, to observe the ratio of industry-sponsored to federally funded or sponsored studies.

What they found was striking. The ratio of industry-sponsored to federally sponsored patient accruals in the earlier period was 4.8, so 4.8 times higher in industry compared to federal. By 2018-2022, that ratio had increased to 9.6, so almost 10 times the number of patients in industry vs federally funded trials. That was for adults.

For children, that ratio went from 0.7, meaning the majority were on federally funded studies in the early period, to 2.3, meaning now there were twice as many patients on industry-sponsored studies compared to federally funded studies. 

Although that's the ratio, if you actually look at the numbers in federally sponsored studies — even though much of our research is being done, there's much more understanding of cancer, and cancer incidence has gone up — federal funding accrual was absolutely flat during this period of time.

Obviously, this is something to discuss in terms of implications. One can suggest, and this is a positive, that the industry is very interested in coming up with new strategies, whether it's drugs or devices, and putting their money on this to do these trials. That is good and that's certainly good for society. 

I would also suggest that, although that's true, industry is doing studies for a particular reason, and appropriately so, which is to potentially come up with a new product on the market or a new indication. Industry is less focused on — because that's not what they're in business to do — asking some pragmatic questions that have no products associated with them but may be very meaningful for cancer prevention, screening, comparing one strategy to another, or cost-effectiveness. 

That's not the focus of industry, but it could very well be the focus of federally funded studies. The fact that accrual hasn't increased in the time period, where more money, more time, and more effort is being put into federal studies — one must ask, are we missing something? 

I think most people would say yes, we're missing something. We need to do more of the kinds of studies that are not specifically focused on industry interests, as important as industry-focused studies are. 

This is an interesting study and an interesting analysis. There is much more to discuss about it. Thank you for your attention.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

 April 07, 2025  

On March 24, the Trump Administration closed the long-COVID office within the US Department of Health and Human Services as part of what it claimed to be the department's reorganization. A few days later, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) went even further, terminating up to 45 grants that the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative had awarded in recent years, but after pushback and protest, NIH reinstated the grants just a few days later.

The cuts, closures, and chaos have left researchers and patient advocates uncertain and fearful about what lies ahead for the federal initiative set forth to treat a chronic condition that affects as many as 7% of US adults.

“Millions of Americans are suffering, and they are depending on us for new treatments and care,” said Grace McComsey, MD, who leads one of the 15 nationwide long-COVID centers funded by the federal RECOVER Initiative in Cleveland.

Public health specialists and doctors who treat patients with the condition say many steps need to be taken in the year ahead to steer RECOVER back on course. These include upping clinical trials and increasing transparency — in order to make greater gains for patients, some of whom have been suffering from long COVID since 2020.

Researchers and public health experts say the program has made some significant gains in the past year, delivering on several key goals of the effort. But many other aims — notably the lack of standard diagnostic tests and treatments for long COVID — have remained elusive.

But the proposed Trump Administration cuts to the program and the closure of the NIH office could imperil those efforts and halt the RECOVER initiative in its tracks.

Here's a look at some of the progress the program has made in the past year and the key challenges ahead.

Last year, NIH reorganized the RECOVER program into RECOVER-TLC, led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, with the goal of looking into new therapeutics, medications, and overall ideas for the treatment of the condition.

In September, RECOVER-TLC hosted a kickoff meeting at NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, inviting researchers, stakeholders, and patient advocates from around the country. Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, senior clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, who addressed the attendees, left the summit feeling positive for the future.

“RECOVER-TLC assuaged some of my concerns, and I left the meeting feeling like leadership really wanted to move toward trials, which are crucial to helping our patients,” said Al-Aly.

But with the election in November, things feel like they're frozen in time, he said. The next meeting, which was set for February, was cancelled, and researchers were left wondering what will happen next.

Improved coordination among long-COVID researchers and clinicians through RECOVER has helped both patients and physicians to embrace a newfound understanding of the condition.

Today, more physicians are aware of long COVID and are interested in learning about effective treatments to help their patients compared with past years, said Nisha Viswanathan, MD, director of the UCLA Health Long COVID Program. It's much less likely that patients won't be believed they have long COVID because many more physicians are on board with the seriousness of this condition.

“I remember when I would speak at long-COVID meetings a few years ago and only a few physicians would show up,” said Viswanathan. “This week I'll be speaking about long COVID in front of 800 people.”

Viswanathan adds that it used to be that patients would ask to be referred to their long-COVID clinic, and now it's the other way around.

“Doctors are more often doing the referring,” she said. Physicians now know more about treatments and treatment facilities.

RECOVER has also made progress in funding research to help uncover the causes of long COVID, particularly with an improved understanding of viral reservoirs, fragments of the virus that remain in the blood, tissue, and organs of the body, causing a heightened immune response.

This proves to be a promising finding that could lead to better treatments for the condition, experts said.

“NIH is finally recognizing that viral reservoirs are real and cause symptoms,” said David Putrino, PhD, the Nash Family Director of the Cohen Center for Recovery from Complex Chronic Illness at Mount Sinai in New York City and a renowned expert in long COVID.

Data from RECOVER found that people with long COVID were more than twice as likely to have viral remnants in their blood, said McComsey.

This improved understanding of viral reservoirs points to a reason why treatments like antivirals or monoclonal antibodies, both of which target the remaining virus, are effective for relieving long-COVID symptoms. The hope is that physicians will be able to pinpoint where viral reservoirs exist in the body so they can isolate and treat them.

Researchers also want to know the impacts of targeting viral reservoirs because once they're treated, it isn't clear if this will actually improve symptoms.

“If the viral remnants are gone, do symptoms vanish? We just don't know yet,” said McComsey.

But most importantly, progress is being made to move beyond symptom management to finding a treatment for at least some portion of long-COVID patients. This is a win for patients because one of the goals put forth last year for the improvement of RECOVER was treating the condition and moving away from managing individual symptoms, experts said.

While RECOVER-TLC brought long-COVID stakeholders together, which was a vast improvement in the past year, there are some other places where coordination is still an issue if researchers want to rapidly move toward effective treatments.

“Transparency is still a problem, especially when it comes to accessing data that's already been collected,” said Putrino.

Researchers need to be able to access the databases of long-COVID findings while working on their own research, whether that data have been published. While there's a concern around researchers getting credit for the work they've done, for those on the front lines of studying treatments, time is the top priority, not recognition.

Putrino adds that to really solve the problem, an “all-hands-on-deck” approach is necessary, with researchers working together to find effective therapies and medications.

Another area where NIH needs to focus its energy: More effective clinical trials of new treatments. This was a criticism of the program last year, and the hope is that with RECOVER-TLC, more clinical trials will make progress on new treatments. There's currently not an approved medication for long COVID, and most treatments revolve around symptom management.

Researchers have so many ideas about what might be effective, but they need the clinical trials to show what does work and for which patients, said Charlie McCone, 35, a long-COVID advocate from San Francisco who's pushing for more clinical trials. McCone is a former marketing executive who lost his job due to long COVID in 2022.

“We have so many leads, and we need to be chasing them down,” said McCone. He added that we need to be looking into some of the potential treatments that have shown promise in case studies and smaller trials like monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, naltrexone, and many others.

Smaller studies have shown remission of long-COVID symptoms in patients who took monoclonal antibodies. Mixed results have been found for antivirals like Paxlovid, which researchers found ineffective for shorter periods of use but effective when it was used for longer periods in some patients. One study also suggested that naltrexone, which is used to treat patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, could be adapted to treat those with long COVID.

In the end, while progress is certainly being made, researchers are hoping for more clinical trials and more transparency.

Still, it's difficult to know what will happen next because there's currently not a confirmed NIH director and no signal from the Trump Administration about what will happen next, experts say.

“There was a promise that we would focus on chronic diseases, and long COVID is a chronic disease with more than a million people disabled as a result of it,” said McComsey.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were associated with substantially higher risk for earlier menarche and pubertal onset in girls while showing no significant effects on boys' pubertal timing. Sexual abuse, caregiver incarceration, and emotional neglect emerged as the individual ACEs most strongly linked to early menarche.

“From an evolutionary perspective, threats to mortality, such as adversity, may accelerate puberty in girls to enhance reproductive chances, whereas earlier puberty in boys may reduce reproductive success due to smaller stature,” wrote the authors of the study. They added, “Some clinicians are already using ACE screenings to identify children at risk for mental health conditions and other health issues. While early puberty may not be the primary focus of interventions, awareness of its potential associations with adversity could help clinicians take a more holistic approach in supporting affected youth.”

The study was led by Ai Kubo, PhD, MPH, Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente – Northern California. It was published online in Journal of Adolescent Health.

According to the authors, the study was limited by data collected for nonresearch purposes and the lack of information regarding the timing and frequency of ACEs.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development RO1HD098220. The authors reported no conflicts of interest.

For decades, the placebo effect — the phenomenon where a patient's condition improves after receiving an inert treatment, often a sugar pill, because they believe it to be real medication — has fascinated and sometimes confounded the medical community. But what happens when you remove the deception and tell patients outright that they are receiving a placebo?

A lot, it turns out.

For a long time, scientists assumed telling patients they were getting a placebo would reduce the effect because the patients wouldn't think they could be getting the actual treatment in a randomized trial. Surprisingly, a growing body of research suggests that these “open-label placebos” can still lead to positive health outcomes, and many past studies of open-label placebos give patients an explanation of why they might work.

A new study, published in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, showed that this explanation is important — and even beneficial.

The study tested open-label placebos for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) — the physical and emotional symptoms that many people with a menstrual cycle experience in the days or weeks leading up to their period, which can include moodiness, fatigue, and irritability.

The study enrolled 150 participants and assigned them to one of three groups: A no-treatment control, a placebo group receiving no explanation, and a placebo group where participants were informed about the demonstrated effectiveness of placebos for PMS in prior research. (Participants in all groups could continue their usual medications, with the exception of those taking psychopharmacological drugs, who were excluded.)

The research found a significant improvement in PMS symptoms in the placebo group that received an explanation about placebo effects.

The explanation took about 15 minutes, said Antje Frey Nascimento, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Basel in Basel, Switzerland, who led the study. It included that “placebos are powerful, that placebo effects are prevalent in PMS, that placebo effects work somehow automatically.”

She added that they told participants about the conditioning process by which placebos might work — since childhood you connect taking a pill with some alleviation of symptoms, so when you take a placebo for PMS, it might also improve symptoms.

All participants tracked their PMS symptoms across three menstrual cycles. During that time, those randomly assigned to the placebo groups received pills to take twice daily for 6 weeks.

Getting a placebo accompanied by a clear explanation led to a 79.3% reduction in symptom intensity and an 82.5% decrease in how much those symptoms interfered with their lives. Those who received a placebo without explanation reported a 50.4% decrease in symptom intensity and a 50.3% drop in life interference. Those with no additional treatment had a 33% reduction in symptom intensity and a 45.7% decrease in life interference.

The sizable reduction even in the no-treatment group could be a result of keeping a symptom diary, Nascimento explained, or the Hawthorne effect, a psychological phenomenon in which individuals alter their behavior due to their awareness of being observed. However, the placebo with explanation led to significantly better PMS symptom management than no treatment or placebo without explanation.

“We picked PMS because it's really prevalent and it's really understudied,” said Nascimento. She also said placebos have a significant effect in PMS intervention trials, accounting for 40% of the observed benefits. Furthermore, she pointed out common treatments — SSRIs [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors] (antidepressants) and hormonal birth control pills — have side effects. Placebos have none.

A large body of evidence shows placebos can lead to measurable changes in the brain, particularly MRI studies showing placebos lead to widespread reductions in pain-related brain activity. PET imaging has also shown that placebos can increase dopamine and opioids in the brain, brain chemicals linked to positive experiences and reduced discomfort.

Placebos have long been a “nuisance” for pharmaceutical companies, said Luana Colloca, MD, PhD, a professor of pain and translational symptoms at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. She explained that every time a clinical trial tries to evaluate a treatment, especially in pain medicine, the placebo has a sizable effect. But those effects generally come in “deceptive” placebo trials, in which participants don't know they're getting a placebo.

The idea of testing placebos when people are fully aware they're receiving them is a relatively new frontier in research.

Open-label placebos were first studied in 1965, but that study was criticized because it involved people who had mental disorders and might not have understood what they were consenting to, explained Colloca.

The idea of openly administered placebos remained largely unexamined until a pivotal 2008 study indicated they could decrease attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication reliance in children. Then a 2010 study revealed significant effects of open-label placebos for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

The researchers in the IBS study provided a specific explanation to patients receiving placebos, telling them that: “Placebo pills, something like sugar pills, have been shown in rigorous clinical testing to produce significant mind-body self-healing processes.” The potential importance of this explanation, however, had not been a primary focus of research prior to this.

“In reality, we still don't know why the act of taking a pill, even if you don't believe in the medication's therapeutic effect, can trigger a benefit. So I love this study because they try to understand the mechanisms,” said Colloca, who was not involved in the study. She noted that “the rationale can help to somehow maintain an expectation of relief.”

Since 2008, open-label placebos have shown at least some modest benefit for various types of pain, cancer-related fatigue, allergic rhinitis, major depression, and menopausal hot flashes, among others.

But even though placebos can be beneficial, “we are still far away from having a mechanism to introduce this in clinical practice,” Colloca said, at least in the United States. As far as she is aware, she said Germany is the only country with a mechanism for providers to give placebos.

In Germany, near where she lives, Nascimento said it's possible to get placebos at a pharmacy, and they come in many colors and shapes.

Colloca said that the United States should be working on ways to make giving placebos a possibility — “it is a little bit outside the box, and so it's a matter of engaging regulatory entities like the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration].”

And for PMS, Colloca wonders, “if women improve with placebo, why do we need to expose them to medications that can somehow have side effects?”

A long-term follow-up study among patients with chronic Chagas disease showed that the time to positive molecular detection of the disease was significantly shorter with posaconazole than with benznidazole. Almost two thirds of patients treated initially with posaconazole were re-treated with benznidazole.

""Lifelong follow-up should be offered to individuals living with CD [Chagas disease], as both parasitological failure and clinical progression can occur many years after diagnosis and treatment,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Joan Roig-Sanchis, International Health Unit Vall d'Hebron-Drassanes, Infectious Diseases Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, PROSICS Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online on March 27, 2025, in Clinical Microbiology and Infection.

The absence of regular echocardiographic evaluations during the follow-up period may have led to an underestimation of cardiac changes in both progression and regression. The study faced significant challenges with participant retention, and many individuals were lost to follow-up. Additionally, the asymptomatic nature of the disease often created a false sense of well-being among participants, complicating long-term monitoring.

No funding was received for this study. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 April 07, 2025  

Whatever's ailing you, a vacation might just be the cure. Yes, getting away can improve your health, according to research published in in 2023. It might help combat symptoms of aging, suggested a 2024 study in Journal of Travel Research. But it could also have even more powerful psychological and physical benefits, transforming your life before you pack a bag and long after you return home.

Medscape Medical News spoke with two healthcare professionals who believe in the healing power of travel. They shared which personal “diagnoses” they have successfully treated with faraway places and how this therapy might work for you.

Stacey Funt, MD, NBC-HWC, a radiologist at Northwell Health in Long Island, New York, started the boutique wellness adventure travel company, LH Adventure Travel, in 2023. Funt curates and leads small groups to destinations like Peru, Guatemala, Morocco, and Italy. Each tour incorporates tenets of lifestyle medicine, including healthy eating, movement, stress management, and community building.

Kiya Thompson, RN, a surgical trauma nurse for 20 years, was similarly inspired to share her passion for travel. She is now a certified family travel coach who helps parents plan meaningful trips through her company, LuckyBucky, LLC.

Dx: Self-esteem Deficiency

Rx: Vivaldi in Venice

In June 2015, Thompson found herself at an all-time low. As a nurse, she felt confident that she was “built for the adrenaline rush and could take on anything.” But outside the trauma center, Thompson felt inadequate, her self-esteem eroded by years of abusive relationships. “The daily hardships of my personal life, combined with the mental fortitude it took to endure the demands of caring for the sickest of the sick, were incredibly weighty,” she recalled. 

To escape, Thompson booked her first solo trip: 3 weeks in Italy. But days after she arrived, she felt the need to “escape her escape.” On a bus in Naples, she was pick-pocketed. The man she had been dating before her trip stopped responding to her messages. In her hotel room in Venice, she felt “lost, alone, and helpless.”

One evening, Thompson attended a small orchestral performance of Vivaldi's “The Four Seasons” in a centuries-old church. The music triggered memories of her Italian grandparents at whose home she'd listened to the same piece.

“A switch flipped, and I changed my whole outlook,” she remembers.

During the concert, she reflected on strangers who had shown her kindness and care. A Canadian man who gave her €50 after her wallet was stolen. A friend-of-a-friend who showed her around Rome. The clerk at her Venice hotel who had offered her a hug.

“In the wake of experiencing the worst of people, I'd experienced so much more of the best of people; strangers who were willing to go above and beyond to help me,” Thompson said.

When Thompson returned home, she brought her new mindset along. “ My ability to problem-solve my way through a solo trip that presented unexpected hardships empowered me,” she explained. “I learned I was much more capable than I'd thought.”

Dx: Wilderness Phobia

Rx: A Safari in Tanzania

On an evening in the mid-1990s, Funt was alone in a tent on a budget camping safari in Tanzania. Animals roared threateningly outside the thin walls. Earlier that day, a vulture had ripped a sandwich out of her hands. Funt was frightened to the core. Worrying that she'd be the next meal for the local wildlife, she started to sob. “This was as raw as I had ever gotten at that point in my life,” she said.

Suddenly, Funt said her brain shifted into problem-solving mode. She made one small decision: To switch to a different Jeep for the next day's excursion. Having made a seemingly insignificant choice, she felt calmer and no longer like a victim. It brought control. Instead of worrying, she began looking forward to the wildlife she would see.

In the morning, in the new Jeep, she befriended a nurse from Canada. Together, they visited the Maasai Mara tribe and nearby pubs, meeting members of the community.

“It was the most exciting experience of my life,” Funt said. “And it had started with me crying.”

Dx: Parenting-itis

Rx: A Mountain Getaway 

As Thompson pointed out, sometimes the destination is secondary to the intension behind a trip. And the quality of the time away matters more than how long you can stay. After becoming parents 4 years ago, Thompson and her husband hadn't traveled alone together. Like many parents of young children, they were short on time to relax and reconnect as a couple.

So Thompson planned a weekend trip to an isolated cabin in the Massanutten Mountain Range within the George Washington National Forest, about a 2-hour drive from their Washington, DC, area home.

“We put our devices away and focused on being completely present with one another,” said Thompson. The couple took a walk in the woods, where “all we could hear were drops of water from the snowmelt, the crunch of the snow beneath our feet, and the occasional bird looking for food,” she recalled. “There were no cars, no other people. It was quiet, calm, and incredibly peaceful.”

Whether sitting by the fire, soaking in the outdoor hot tub, or playing card games, “our conversation didn't surround what we'd have for dinner or who would do baths and bedtime with whom,” Thompson said. “We didn't talk about work, upcoming commitments, or items on our to-do lists.” The getaway was so refreshing, the couple intend to repeat the trip each year.

Nearly 3 years ago, Funt experienced a 2-month period where both of her kids left for college and both her father and father-in-law passed away. Besieged by grief, she found herself questioning whether her best years were behind her. She was also grappling with her mortality, because she was then approaching 59, the age at which her own mother had died. So Funt decided to go trekking in Nepal. “I am a traveler — it's what I do,” she said.

Having the trip to prepare for changed Funt's whole outlook, she remembers. Throwing herself into the planning helped her transcend her grief. But being in Nepal was even more impactful. She and her husband spent hours trekking through majestic mountain ranges, which “touched their souls.” At a crematorium, they learned about Hindu beliefs on death, which helped them with the grieving process.

The trip “lifted me so high up on so many levels and brought me back to my authentic self,” Funt said. On her flight home from Kathmandu, she decided to start her travel business.

“I needed something else [in addition to radiology] to put my passion, heart, and creativity into, and it would be another way of doing service,” she explained.

Dx: Couch Potato Syndrome

Rx: Planning an Adventure 

Like all of us, Funt knows exercise is important for health. But that knowledge alone doesn't motivate her to move, she admitted. What does get her off the couch is scheduling an active trip — and then training for it. “When I have a goal tied to my values of adventure, connection, and community, fear will set in if I don't start to move,” she said. It was after booking her Nepal trip (which included an 8-mile, 3000-foot trek) that Funt started getting in shape.

Travel has motivated Funt's clients in similar ways. Last year, 8 months before one of her Morocco trips, Funt spoke over Zoom with a woman who'd just enrolled. This woman told her she'd signed up in order to commit to her health.

By the time Funt saw her again, on day 1 of the trip, the woman had lost 50 pounds. “It was the greatest transformation,” Funt recalled. “On the trip, she was the first one up the mountain and beamed the whole time. It was beautiful to watch her reclaim her power, body, and life.”

Since Thompson's trip to Italy, she has traveled extensively, visiting nearly 25 countries. “Traveling inspired me to continue exploring the world and myself,” she said.

Since leading her first trip to Morocco in 2023, Funt said she's received more letters of appreciation from her clients than her patients. The results from this type of travel therapy can be dramatic.

After a trip with Funt, one burned-out physician decided that she needed to find a job with a better work-life balance. An empty nester realized the “feeling of belonging and community” on the trip was what had been missing in her “regular” life. After returning home, she began rekindling relationships with old friends.

To many, a vacation is a treat. But, as Funt and Thompson have learned firsthand, it can also be a prescription — for ennui, sadness, loneliness, and all the physical issues that come with them. Sometimes, going far away helps you come home to yourself.

 April 07, 2025  

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) linked to COVID-19 is associated with reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), leading to an altered immune response, according to a study published in Nature.

COVID-19 primarily affects older adults, but SARS-CoV-2 can also pose a significant risk to children. Since the pandemic began, MIS-C cases have been reported in pediatric patients presenting with symptoms resembling toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease.

Although rare, MIS-C had an estimated incidence of 0.07% among patients with COVID-19 younger than 18 years during the 2020-2021 wave in Southern Italy. It is a severe condition that often requires intensive care and affects multiple organs, including the heart, with myocarditis and pericarditis observed in approximately 34% of cases.

An international research team analyzed cytokines and chemokines in the blood of 124 patients with MIS-C (mean age, 8.7 years) and compared them with 36 healthy children, 57 children with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, 39 with moderate infection, and two with severe infection.

Patients with MIS-C exhibited significantly elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)–beta levels (398 pg/mL), which were approximately three times higher than those in uninfected children and 2.6 times higher than those in children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune cells in patients with MIS-C also showed activation of TGF-beta–induced genes. 

This surge in TGF-beta creates an immune environment conducive to the reactivation of viruses such as EBV.

“TGF-beta can do two things: First, it suppresses the cytotoxicity of T-cells, which normally target EBV-infected B cells. Therefore, although T cells recognize EBV-infected B cells, they fail to eliminate them efficiently. Second, TGF-beta promotes the lytic cycle of EBV,” Mir-Farzin Mashreghi, PhD, deputy scientific director of the German Rheumatology Research Center in Berlin, Germany, and the lead researcher of the study, explained to Univadis Italy, a Medscape Network platform.

Two key findings support the role of EBV reactivation. Researchers observed a significantly higher prevalence of EBV seropositivity in patients with MIS-C (80.7%) than in healthy children (56.0%), similar to the rates in patients with multiple sclerosis, in whom EBV is a known primary risk factor.

Additionally, RNA analysis of B cells from patients with MIS-C consistently detected active EBV, but this finding was absent in healthy children or those with mild COVID-19. Active EBV was observed in only one child with severe COVID-19 who did not have MIS-C.

“Elevated TGF-beta levels observed only in patients with MIS-C impair interactions between immune cells, reducing the cytotoxic capacity of T lymphocytes, and consequently, surveillance over EBV-infected B lymphocytes. This mechanism (elevated TGF-beta levels, altered lymphocyte function, and EBV reactivation) amplifies the inflammatory response, contributing to the hyperinflammatory state observed in MIS-C,” noted Martina Votto, MD, PhD, from the Department of Clinical-Surgical, Diagnostic, and Pediatric Sciences at the University of Pavia in Pavia, Italy, in an interview with Univadis Italy. Votto was not involved in the study.

Researchers have also identified an expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, similar to EBV-reactive lymphocyte clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. “This study adds an important piece to understanding the complex immunological mechanisms of MIS-C, opening new perspectives on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition,” Votto added.

The exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers TGF-beta activation remains unclear. “In 2021, we published studies showing that in severely ill patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, TGF-beta levels are extremely high, comparable to those observed in these children,” said Mashreghi.

He continued, “Previous studies by other groups have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can activate TGF-beta in at least two ways to evade the immune response: Through the virus's nucleoprotein and through the interaction of the spike protein with integrins. Therefore, there are several clues that SARS-CoV-2 infection may directly cause the elevated TGF-beta levels we measured. For now, however, these are just hypotheses.”

Regarding EBV reactivation and why this mechanism occurs in only a small percentage of patients, Mashreghi noted, “There's some hypothesis that persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce the hyperinflammatory syndrome, for instance, if a hidden viral reservoir persists somewhere, inducing TGF-beta. However, we were unable to identify such reservoirs in our patient cohort.

MIS-C did not disappear entirely after the acute phase of the pandemic. “The highest rate we observed during the pandemic was 1 child in 800 developing this disease; then, the rate dropped to 1 in 4000 during Omicron. We believe that this decrease is due to the population now having greater immunity against the virus. Vaccination campaigns for children have reduced the incidence of MIS-C. However, we believe that this could still be a problem because children are born, contract EBV infections, and may experience their first COVID-19 infection at the same time. Therefore, we expect that this condition could increase. Additionally, I want to emphasize that one of our co-authors, Alexandre Belot, published an article in The New England Journal of Medicine describing prepandemic MIS-C cases. This suggests that other coronaviruses could also induce MIS-C. This fact was simply overlooked in the past because this condition was very rare,” Mashreghi cautioned.

The study's findings open the door to targeted diagnostic and therapeutic options, Votto explained: “Identifying TGF-beta as a key mediator of MIS-C pathogenesis could lead to the development of targeted therapies to modulate its activity. Additionally, the discovery of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3 could pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on cell-mediated immunity. Finally, TGF-beta levels and markers of EBV reactivation could be used to identify and stratify children at higher risk of developing MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 infection.”

The involvement of EBV in MIS-C further highlights the role of viral infections in increasing the risk for various diseases long after the acute infection. EBV, in particular, is involved in multiple sclerosis and may also be a risk factor for other autoimmune diseases. Moreover, several viruses, including some considered “benign,” such as herpes, increase the risk for neurodegenerative diseases even years after infection. “I think we should really stop thinking of viruses such as EBV as harmless just because 95% of the adult population is positive. In situations where the immune system is weakened, individuals are vulnerable to reactivation episodes that can cause secondary pathologies, including autoimmune diseases,” concluded Mashreghi.

A new genetic study reveals that some gut bacteria and blood chemicals aren't just linked to short stature—they may be causing it, opening doors to microbiota-based interventions for childhood growth issues.

Study: Causal relationship between gut microbiota, metabolites, and short stature: a Mendelian randomization study. Image Credit: Tomsickova Tatyana / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Pediatric Research, researchers investigated the causal relationship between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and the risk of short stature (SS).

SS is a common endocrine and metabolic disease in children, defined as a height below the third percentile or two standard deviations below the mean height of children of the same age, sex, and race under comparable growth conditions. In 2019, there were around 144 million children with stunted height globally. Various epigenetic, environmental, and genetic factors regulate SS. Around 60% of children with SS have unknown pathogenesis and unidentifiable etiology, viz., idiopathic SS (ISS).

One study suggested that the gut microbiota and metabolites contribute to human bone health. Further, another study reported shorter femur lengths in germ-free mice, and colonization by normal gut flora increased bone formation rate and femur length. This suggests that gut microbiota play a vital role in longitudinal bone growth. While studies have assessed associations between SS and gut microbiota, they are observational; thus, causal relationships cannot be inferred.

This is the first study to use Mendelian randomization to investigate causality between gut microbiota, blood metabolites, and SS.

Children with higher Prevotella9 levels showed reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) activity, a key hormone for bone development, suggesting a direct microbiome-growth axis.

In the present study, researchers investigated the causal relationship between SS, blood metabolites, and gut microbiota, as well as how blood metabolites influence this relationship. They performed a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data. GWAS summary data on SS, gut microbiota, and metabolomics were acquired from separate studies.

The GWAS data for short stature were obtained from the FinnGen R9 dataset, comprising 611 cases and 361,988 controls, with a mean age of approximately 8 years. Notably, the GWAS data were derived primarily from European populations, which may limit generalizability to other ethnic groups.

Instrumental variables were selected if the single-nucleotide polymorphism loci showed significant associations with the exposure. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was the primary MR method, while simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median, and MR Egger regression were complementary methods. MR-Egger intercept was used to assess horizontal pleiotropy. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic. The causal relationship was deemed stable if the effect directions of the complementary methods were consistent with the findings of the IVW analysis.

Additionally, a two-step mediation analysis was conducted to investigate the mediation of blood metabolites in the association between SS and the gut microbiota.

The gut genus Roseburia produces butyrate, a fatty acid previously linked to bone density in mice, but its role in human height remained unexplored until this study.

The IVW analysis suggested seven causal relationships between gut microbiota and SS. After validation with complementary methods, six effect directions were in line with IVW results. Three genera (Alloprevotella, Prevotella9, and FamilyXIIIAD3011) were positively associated with the risk of SS, and three others (Parasutterella, Roseburia, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1) were negatively associated. The protective role of Parasutterella may relate to its involvement in testosterone and bile acid metabolism, as suggested in prior research.

In addition, the team performed a reverse MR analysis to examine whether SS has a causal effect on identified genera. This revealed no reverse causality between SS and these gut microbes. Furthermore, IVW results revealed six causal relationships between blood metabolites and SS, and after validation with complementary methods, five of the effect directions were concordant with the IVW results.

Three metabolites (caffeine, 4-hydroxyhippurate, and laurate) were negatively associated with SS risk, and two (cyclo (leu-pro) and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate) were positively associated. The odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0.08 to 16.12, demonstrating substantial variation in effect size.

While caffeine showed a protective effect here, the authors caution that animal studies have reported caffeine may inhibit bone growth, suggesting this finding warrants further investigation. There was no heterogeneity or pleiotropy. Furthermore, the mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 on SS through 4-hydroxyhippurate, with a mediation effect proportion of 43.03%. This metabolite is linked to flavonoid metabolism, which depends on gut microbiota for processing.

The five metabolites identified span four major metabolic pathways: lipid, amino acid, peptide, and xenobiotic (compounds not naturally produced by the body, such as dietary or environmental chemicals).

No association was found between vitamin D metabolites and short stature, contradicting hypotheses that micronutrient deficiencies dominate growth disorder risks.

The study examined causal relationships between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and SS risk. The team identified Alloprevotella, FamilyXIIIAD3011, and Prevotella9 as risk factors for SS. Indeed, a previous study reported a higher abundance of Prevotella in children with ISS compared to healthy children, and this level returned to normal upon treatment with recombinant human growth hormone.

In contrast, Roseburia, Parasutterella, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 were protective factors for SS. Five blood metabolites were causally related to SS. Specifically, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate and cyclo(Leu-Pro) were associated with a higher risk of SS. In contrast, caffeine, laurate, and 4-hydroxyhippurate were associated with a lower SS risk. The mediation analysis revealed a novel mediating role of 4-hydroxyhippurate in the relationship between SS and Clostridium sensu stricto 1.

Taken together, the findings illustrate causal relationships between blood metabolites, gut microbiota, and SS and that 4-hydroxyhippurate mediates the effect of Clostridium sensu stricto 1 on SS. The effect directions of different methods were consistent, and there was no heterogeneity or reverse causality. However, the study's reliance on genus-level microbiota data limits resolution, and species- or strain-specific effects remain unexplored. The lack of demographic subgroup analysis also limits insight into how these associations may differ across age, sex, or ancestry groups. Overall, future clinical diagnosis and treatment of SS should consider the regulation of gut microbiota.

New study reveals how dairy products like non-fermented milk and cheese may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, while fermented options provide a surprising protective effect. Find out which dairy could be a game-changer for your health!

A new study involving Swedish adults finds that high intake of non-fermented milk and cheese can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. The study findings are published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Diabetes, a chronic metabolic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels, is becoming a major public health concern worldwide, with a projected increase in its prevalence from 537 million in 2021 to 783 million by 2045. Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of all diabetic cases.

Diet is one of the major modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Dairy products are vital components of any diet, and the dietary components present in these products are considered essential for growth and immune function.

A dairy-linked xenobiotic—likely from pesticides or veterinary drugs in cattle feed—was strongly tied to non-fermented milk intake. Its role in human metabolism remains unknown, but it could signal industrial farming's indirect health impacts.

Regarding the associations between dairy product intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes, studies have produced mixed results, with some reporting inverse associations and others suggesting neutral associations.

Existing evidence also suggests a link between higher intake of dairy products and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, studies investigating diabetes risk with very high intakes are lacking due to a lack of data among populations with high dairy consumption.

Sweden is among the countries with the highest intake of dairy products worldwide. Various dairy products are consumed in regular diets in this country. These factors present a suitable opportunity for researchers to investigate the association between various types of dairy products and the risk of type 2 diabetes, with a particular focus on the level of consumption.

In this study, researchers utilized high-quality dietary data from a group of Swedish adults to investigate the impact of high intakes of different dairy products on the risk of type 2 diabetes. They also explored plasma metabolites associated with dairy intake.

The study analyzed dairy intake data from 26,461 Swedish individuals who participated in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) between 1991 and 1996 and were followed up until December 31, 2020.

Dairy products analyzed in the study included non-fermented milk, fermented milk (yogurt and sour milk), cheese, cream, and butter.

To identify plasma metabolites associated with dairy intake, a subgroup of 893 participants with data on metabolomics and dairy intake was analyzed separately in this study. Metabolites are end products of metabolic reactions that serve as crucial biomarkers of dietary intake. Assessment of plasma metabolite levels can provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between dairy products and type 2 diabetes.

Fermented milk's arabonate/xylonate isn't just a biomarker: It may reflect gut microbes breaking down plant fibers more efficiently, linking yogurt consumption to improved glucose processing.

About 17% of study participants (4,552 out of 26,461 participants) developed type 2 diabetes during the average follow-up period of 24 years.

The analysis, adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, dietary intake, and body mass index (BMI), revealed that high consumption of non-fermented milk and cheese can significantly increase the risk of developing diabetes; however, these associations were attenuated after accounting for BMI (e.g., non-fermented milk hazard ratio [HR] dropped from 1.40 to 1.15), suggesting body weight may partially mediate the observed effects. In contrast, high consumption of fermented milk, cream, and butter was associated with significantly reduced risk of diabetes.

Specifically, the study found that a 100-gram increase in daily intake of non-fermented milk and fermented milk is associated with a 4% increased risk and a 3% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, respectively.

Notably, the study found that the association between dairy product intake and diabetes risk is independent of participants' socioeconomic status. Similarly, no significant impact of participants' gender was observed on the association between intakes of non-fermented milk, fermented milk, cream, and butter and the risk of diabetes. However, the negative impact of cheese intake on diabetes risk was observed more strongly in male participants, a notable sex-specific finding, but not in female participants.

By analyzing metabolomic data, the study identified 45, 48, 12, 27, and 46 metabolites that were distinctly associated with the intakes of non-fermented milk, fermented milk, cheese, cream, and butter, respectively.

Plasma metabolite profiles of fermented milk exhibited positive associations with intakes of vegetables, fruits, and dietary fibers, and inverse associations with meat intake. In contrast, the metabolite profile of butter exhibited inverse associations with dietary fiber intake.

Butter's unexpected benefit (lower diabetes risk) correlated with metabolites also found in nuts and seeds, hinting that butter might share bioactive compounds with plant fats when consumed minimally.

The study reveals that high intake of non-fermented milk can significantly increase type 2 diabetes risk among Swedish men and women. A similar positive association between very high cheese intake and diabetes risk has also been observed in the study. However, this association is restricted only to male participants.

In contrast to the modest health impact of these dairy products, the study finds that higher intakes of fermented milk, cream, and butter have modest protective effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes among both Swedish men and women. These protective associations were weaker after adjusting for BMI (e.g., butter HR increased from 0.82 to 0.86), implying that body weight may play a mediating role.

Notably, the study identifies sphingomyelins as robust plasma biomarkers of dairy intake. Furthermore, a strong association was observed between a xenobiotic metabolite and non-fermented milk intake in the study. This metabolite, which belongs to the class of organic compounds known as salicylic acids, can serve as a novel biomarker for dairy intake.

For fermented milk, the strongest association has been observed with arabonate/xylonate, a metabolite associated with pentose metabolism. Probiotics in fermented milk may be involved in this process. For cheese, the study identifies three novel plasma biomarkers that need further investigation for a more conclusive interpretation.

The study measured dairy intake only at baseline. This could be a potential limitation, as any changes in dairy intake during the 24-year follow-up period may influence the observed associations with diabetes risk.

Moreover, the study was conducted with Swedish middle-aged participants, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to populations of different ethnicities and age groups.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New guidelines aim to improve diagnosis and treatment of mycoplasma pneumoniae in children","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250407/New-guidelines-aim-to-improve-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-mycoplasma-pneumoniae-in-children.aspx","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:18:00 GMT","

The Chinese Medical Association has released new guidelines for diagnosing and treating Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children. Addressing challenges like variable symptoms and rising antibiotic resistance (81% for macrolides in China), experts recommend PCR testing for accurate diagnosis, macrolides for mild cases, and tetracyclines for severe infections in older children. Corticosteroids are also advised for severe cases, and judicious antibiotic use is stressed to combat resistance and improve treatment outcomes.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is a bacterial pathogen that causes pneumonia in school-aged children and adolescents. It spreads through respiratory droplets, leading to prolonged cough, fever, and breathing difficulties. While most cases resolve without complications, some become severe and require advanced medical care. Due to variations in disease presentation and rising antibiotic resistance, standardized diagnostic and treatment approaches are essential.

To address these challenges, the Chinese Medical Association has released new guidelines in Pediatric Investigation, led by Professor Baoping Xu, from the Department of Respiratory at Beijing Children's Hospital, on 11 March 2025. These guidelines provide clear recommendations on diagnosis, treatment, and managing complications, ensuring healthcare professionals have access to standardized, evidence-based strategies. Given the overlap of clinical symptoms with other respiratory infections, the guidelines emphasize a multi-faceted diagnostic approach that integrates clinical observations, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

""Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial in preventing unnecessary antibiotic use and ensuring appropriate treatment,"" said Prof. Xu. ""By combining Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, antibody detection, and imaging, we can improve diagnostic precision and reduce misdiagnosis.""

PCR, particularly fluorescence quantitative PCR targeting MP-DNA, is highlighted as the gold standard for confirming MPP due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Antibody tests like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination may help identify infections but have limitations, including false positives or negatives depending on infection timing and immune responses. Chest imaging, primarily X-rays, assesses lung involvement and distinguishes MPP from other pneumonias. In severe cases, computed tomography (CT) scans may provide additional insights into lung inflammation and complications.

Treatment strategies depend on infection severity. For mild MPP, macrolide antibiotics like azithromycin remain the first-line therapy due to their effectiveness against M. pneumoniae. However, increasing macrolide resistance, particularly in China, necessitates alternative antibiotics for severe or refractory cases.

For children aged 8 and older, tetracyclines such as minocycline or doxycycline are preferred due to their effectiveness against resistant strains. However, these are generally avoided in younger children due to potential effects on developing teeth. In such cases, macrolides are still used despite resistance concerns. Quinolones, including levofloxacin, are an alternative but require careful monitoring due to potential adverse effects, particularly in younger patients. Physicians must weigh risks against benefits and obtain informed consent before prescribing quinolones.

Severe MPP often involves significant lung inflammation, requiring additional treatments. Corticosteroids, particularly methylprednisolone, are recommended to reduce inflammation and improve respiratory function. However, they should always be used alongside antibiotics, as they do not directly target the infection. The routine use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not supported due to insufficient evidence of its effectiveness for MPP.

Refractory MPP, which does not respond to initial antibiotics, is managed similarly to severe MPP, with alternative antibiotics and corticosteroids when necessary. The guidelines acknowledge the lack of consensus on the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy, highlighting the need for further clinical research.

Beyond medications, the guidelines address managing complications in severe cases. Some children with MPP develop increased D-dimer levels, indicating a higher risk of blood clot formation. To mitigate this, low molecular weight heparin is recommended. In cases of mucus accumulation causing airway blockage, bronchoscopic lavage therapy may be necessary. This procedure, which removes mucus and debris from the airway, is most effective when performed 7 to 14 days after symptom onset, though its use should be based on individual patient needs.

""Antibiotic overuse and misuse are driving resistance, making infections harder to treat. These guidelines emphasize responsible antibiotic use—choosing the right drug, dose, and duration for each case,"" emphasizes Prof. Xu.

The authors acknowledge that some recommendations rely on expert opinion due to limited high-quality clinical trials. Additionally, while the guidelines primarily focus on diagnosis and treatment, they provide limited information on complications and long-term effects of MPP. Future updates will incorporate new research findings to address these gaps, ensuring healthcare professionals have the most up-to-date strategies for diagnosing and treating MPP, ultimately improving outcomes for affected children.

Real-world applications in neuroimaging
Leading companies and research driving innovation
Challenges and considerations in implementing deep learning

​​​​​​​Deep learning (DL) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that utilizes artificial neural networks (ANNs) to process data through two or more layers, each of which can recognize complex features of the data.

All deep learning models are built on fundamental computational units that take in inputs, process them, and produce outputs—either forwarding them to the next layer or using them as the final result.1 

Recent advancements in the technological capabilities of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and learning algorithms, combined with the availability of big data, have allowed DL to become one of the most powerful AI technologies.

As a result, DL has been incorporated into various applications, some of which include computer vision, natural language processing, and speech improvement.

DL has also been widely used to support the analysis of medical images, which can include the classification, detection/localization, registration, and segmentation of medical images.2

To date, several studies have reported the use of DL for analyzing brain, chest, eye, breast, cardiac, abdomen, and musculoskeletal imaging.

Deep learning (DL) has been extensively studied for its potential to enhance the sensitivity of medical imaging in detecting various neurological disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, brain tumors, and multiple sclerosis (MS).

Beyond diagnosis, AI and DL also offer valuable insights into how patients are responding to treatment—information that can help clarify prognoses and guide the personalization of future care strategies.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a key subclass of DL models, are particularly well-suited for medical imaging tasks. CNNs leverage spatial information from neighboring pixels (in 2D) or voxels (in 3D), which are processed through a series of convolutional layers to generate multiple feature maps.

For Alzheimer's disease, both 2D and 3D CNN-based approaches have been trained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for image segmentation and classification. CNNs stand out for their ability to automatically learn and refine features from raw imaging data, making them a strong fit for diagnostic analysis.

In addition to CNNs, other DL architectures such as autoencoders (AEs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been explored—particularly in the context of ASD diagnosis.

AE-based methods use variations or stacked architectures to extract discriminative representations from imaging data. Meanwhile, RNN-based approaches have been evaluated for their capacity to process resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from ASD patients, leveraging their strength in handling temporal patterns in brain activity.

Traditional medical imaging can be time-consuming, which poses a challenge during medical emergencies such as stroke or other neurological trauma. In these situations, clinicians may opt for lower-resolution scans to speed up image acquisition. However, the trade-off is image quality—these lower-resolution images may lack the detail needed for accurate diagnosis. Deep learning (DL) methods offer a promising solution by reconstructing raw, low-quality data into high-resolution images, helping to preserve diagnostic accuracy even under time constraints.

DL can also help address the high costs associated with MRI and other diagnostic imaging techniques. By accelerating image acquisition without introducing additional artifacts, DL has the potential to make advanced imaging more efficient and accessible, without compromising quality.3

Can AI Outperform Doctors in Diagnosing Infectious Diseases?

The Center for Clinical Data Science at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Brigham and Women's Hospital have released DeepNeuro as an open-source tool for public use. DeepNeuro, which has been trained on a large dataset of neuroimaging studies, is a Python-based deep learning (DL) framework designed to streamline the training and evaluation of DL models on new medical imaging data.

Users can directly load their datasets and take advantage of pre-built training scripts, making it a valuable resource for both research and educational purposes.

Beyond ease of use, DeepNeuro offers several practical advantages. It can be integrated with other machine learning (ML) software to support method ensembling, and it can be incorporated into diagnostic systems to enhance usability and performance in clinical workflows.4-5

Another notable tool in this space is NeuroQuant, an FDA-approved ML software designed to analyze MRI brain scans. NeuroQuant provides precise, quantitative measurements of brain structure volumes—data that can help detect and track pathological changes associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), and other serious neurological disorders. By offering clear, standardized metrics, NeuroQuant enables radiologists to deliver more consistent and objective assessments of brain tissue.5

Ethical Considerations in AI-Driven Healthcare

Despite the many advantages of deep learning (DL) in neuroimaging analysis, its clinical adoption is still in the early stages. One major limitation is overfitting, which can occur when complex models are trained on small datasets, leading to poor generalizability. To address this, the use of large, labeled, and publicly available medical imaging datasets is essential for improving the reliability and robustness of DL applications.

In addition to data-related challenges, ethical and legal concerns—along with the difficulty of interpreting DL results in psychological or mechanistic terms—can make some clinicians and stakeholders hesitant. The ""black box"" nature of many DL models adds to the uncertainty, especially in high-stakes medical decision-making.

DL algorithms also require substantial amounts of high-quality data for training, which presents a hurdle when studying rare neurological disorders where data are limited. To mitigate this, researchers have developed data augmentation techniques to synthetically increase the number of training samples and improve model performance.

While AI and DL can be valuable tools in supporting clinical diagnoses, they are not a replacement for clinical judgment. Treatment decisions must continue to center around the physician's expertise, guided by a comprehensive understanding of the patient's unique needs.

Even backers say it's not enough.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250407/Blockbuster-deal-will-wipe-out-2430-billion-in-medical-debt-Even-backers-say-ite28099s-not-enough.aspx","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:54:00 GMT","

Underscoring the massive scale of America's medical debt problem, a New York-based nonprofit has struck a deal to pay off old medical bills for an estimated 20 million people.

Undue Medical Debt, which buys patient debt, is retiring $30 billion worth of unpaid bills in a single transaction with Pendrick Capital Partners, a Virginia-based debt trading company. The average patient debt being retired is $1,100, according to the nonprofit, with some reaching the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The deal will prevent the debt being sold and protect millions of people from being targeted by collectors. But even proponents of retiring patient debt acknowledge that these deals cannot solve a crisis that now touches around 100 million people in the U.S.

""We don't think that the way we finance health care is sustainable,"" Undue Medical Debt chief executive Allison Sesso said in an interview with KFF Health News. ""Medical debt has unreasonable expectations,"" she said. ""The people who owe the debts can't pay.""

In the past year alone, Americans borrowed an estimated $74 billion to pay for health care, a nationwide West Health-Gallup survey found. And even those who benefit from Undue's debt relief may have other medical debt that won't be relieved.

This large purchase also highlights the challenges that debt collectors, hospitals, and other health care providers face as patients rack up big bills that aren't covered by their health insurance.

Pendrick's chief executive, Chris Eastman, declined several requests to be interviewed about the debt sale, which has not been previously reported. But Eastman acknowledged in a 2024 podcast episode that collecting medical debts has grown more challenging as regulators have restricted how collectors can pursue patients.

Pendrick has now shuttered, which Sesso said provided strong motivation for this deal. ""This was a really great opportunity to get a debt buyer out of the market,"" she said.

Undue Medical Debt pioneered its debt relief strategy a decade ago, leveraging charitable donations to buy medical debt from debt trading companies at steeply discounted prices and then freeing patients from the obligation to pay.

The nonprofit now buys debts directly from hospitals, as well. And it is working with about two dozen state and local governments to leverage public money to relieve medical debt in communities from Los Angeles County to Cleveland to the state of Connecticut.

The approach has been controversial. And Undue Medical Debt's record-setting purchase — financed by a mix of philanthropy and taxpayer dollars — is likely to stoke more debate over the value of paying collectors for medical debts.

""The approach is just treating the symptoms and not the disease,"" said Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president at the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that has led efforts to restrict aggressive hospital collections. Benjamin and other advocates say systemic changes such as ensuring hospitals offer sufficient financial aid to patients and reining in high medical prices would be more valuable in preventing people from sinking into debt.

But many government officials see retiring people's unpaid medical bills as part of a larger strategy to make it easier for patients to avoid debt in the first place.

""Turning off the tap is what's really important in the long run,"" said Naman Shah, a physician who directs medical affairs at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The county is working to improve local hospital financial aid programs for patients. But Shah said debt relief is key, as well.

""It's easy to criticize band-aids when you're not the one who's cut,"" he said. ""As a physician, I take care of people who have cuts, and I know the importance of stitching them back up.""

Undue Medical Debt's latest deal, which it is spending $36 million to close, will help patients nationwide, according to the nonprofit. But about half the estimated 20 million people whose debts Pendrick owned live in just two states: Texas or Florida.

Neither has expanded Medicaid coverage through the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a key tool that researchers have found bolsters patients' financial security by protecting them from big medical bills and debt.

The patients eligible for debt relief have incomes at or below four times the federal poverty level, about $63,000 for a single person, or debts that exceed 5% of their incomes.

About half the debts are also more than seven years old. These have been donated to Undue Medical Debt by Pendrick, the group reported.

The nonprofit plans to pay for the rest of the debts over the next year and a half, though all collections have stopped against patients. It also plans to spend an additional $40 million — or $2 a person — to process the debts, find patients, and inform them that their debts have been relieved.

Sesso, Undue's chief executive, said she hopes the debt purchase will keep policymakers focused on enacting longer-term solutions to the nation's medical debt crisis.

She applauded state leaders for taking steps to bar medical debts from their residents' credit scores. But she said action is also needed in Washington, D.C. However, the Trump administration has suspended regulations enacted under former President Joe Biden that would have barred credit reporting of medical debt nationally, and congressional Republicans are now moving to revoke the new rules.

""There is a limit to what state and local governments can do to solve this problem,"" Sesso said. ""It's really a national problem that has to be solved at the national level.""

New evidence reveals that treating SIBO with antibiotics, diet, and supplements dramatically boosts quality of life—even when test results don't show full recovery.

Study: Should We Treat SIBO Patients? Impact on Quality of Life and Response to Comprehensive Treatment: A Real-World Clinical Practice Study. Image Credit: Pepermpron / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers in Spain assessed the effectiveness of an integrated treatment approach in enhancing the quality of life for patients with Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO).

Did you know that over half of the people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) might actually have SIBO? SIBO occurs when bacteria excessively grow in the small intestine, causing bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Despite affecting millions globally, healthcare providers frequently underestimate or misdiagnose this condition, limiting proper treatment. Patients experience reduced productivity, compromised mental health, and disrupted social lives, significantly impacting their quality of life. In addition to this underrecognition, diagnostic methods such as breath testing have come under scrutiny, with recent clinical guidelines suggesting that their reliability may be limited. Given the lack of clarity on the most effective management strategies and limited data on long-term outcomes, more targeted research is essential to optimize treatments and improve patient well-being.

Blood tests revealed reduced inflammation markers (C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin) in 68% of participants, linking symptom improvement to measurable biological changes.

The present study involved 179 adult patients diagnosed with either hydrogen-predominant (H2-SIBO) or methane-predominant (CH4-SIBO) small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients were recruited between November 2021 and March 2023 from Sagunto Hospital and Casa de Salud Hospital in Valencia, Spain. Diagnosis relied on breath tests measuring hydrogen and methane gas after ingestion of lactulose or lactitol, where gas increases above certain thresholds indicated SIBO.

Participants underwent comprehensive treatment, guided by gastroenterologists and nutritionists, tailored according to gas phenotype (H₂ or CH₄) as per real-world clinical protocols. All patients initially received antibiotic therapy: rifaximin alone for H2-SIBO and a combination of rifaximin and neomycin for CH4-SIBO, supplemented with herbal treatments included in the Valencian Digestive Institute (IVADI) protocol, such as oregano oil, peppermint, and berberine. This pharmacological approach was supported by dietary intervention using the low-Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAP) diet, carefully personalized by dietitians to maximize adherence.

Additionally, gut health supplements, including probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum) and L-glutamine, were administered. The quality of life improvements were evaluated using validated questionnaires at baseline, one month, and three months post-baseline. These questionnaires assessed overall health (EuroQOL-5D), IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL), gastrointestinal symptom severity (GSRS), and stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale). Follow-ups included repeated breath tests and blood and stool analyses to monitor treatment response and health status.

Herbal antimicrobials (oregano oil, berberine) were standardized as part of the Valencian Digestive Institute's clinical protocol, reflecting regional trends in integrating phytotherapy with conventional medicine.

After the 90-day comprehensive treatment regimen, substantial improvements were observed across various health indicators. Although breath test normalization (gas excretion returning to healthy levels) occurred in only 41.3% of participants, a significant majority (72.6%) reported meaningful clinical improvement, demonstrating a discrepancy between objective test results and subjective symptom relief.

The quality of life, as assessed by the EuroQOL-5D, showed substantial improvements for all patients, indicating an enhanced overall health perception. All participants reported improved self-perceived health status, even those who did not achieve gas normalization, further underscoring the subjective benefit of treatment. Patients who experienced symptom improvement reported notably higher scores, highlighting the importance of subjective health perception in managing SIBO. Specifically, those who achieved clinical relief had significantly better scores across the categories of mental health, emotional well-being, physical energy, and social interaction.

Using the GSRS, patients exhibited a significant reduction in symptom severity, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation, with scores decreasing substantially from baseline to the end of the study period. However, there were no statistically significant differences in GSRS score improvements between patients who normalized gas levels and those who did not. Interestingly, symptom improvement occurred independently of gas normalization, suggesting that treatment effectiveness in symptom relief might depend more on overall microbiome health and dietary factors than solely bacterial reduction.

Stool consistency, assessed by the Bristol Stool Scale, demonstrated marked normalization. Initially, most patients experienced abnormal stool types associated with either constipation or diarrhea. Post-treatment, a significant shift towards normal stool consistency was observed, directly correlating with better patient comfort and daily function.

Anxiety/depression scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) dropped by 40% in patients achieving stool consistency normalization, tying physical symptom relief directly to mental health gains.

The IBS Quality of Life questionnaire revealed substantial improvements across all sub-domains, including emotional and psychological health, physical activity, dietary adaptations, and social engagement. Although direct psychological outcomes such as anxiety or depression were not measured in the study, improvements in these domains are consistent with findings from related literature. These psychological benefits are likely due to the reduction of physical symptoms and improved dietary habits, which in turn lead to greater confidence in social settings and daily activities.

Regression analysis underscored the importance of initial self-perceived well-being in predicting successful symptom resolution. Patients who began the treatment with a higher subjective perception of health exhibited a greater likelihood of clinical improvement, highlighting the psychological component as an integral part of treatment outcomes.

To summarize, this study demonstrates that a holistic therapeutic approach significantly improves the quality of life and clinical outcomes for SIBO patients, emphasizing the necessity for individualized treatments that address diet, microbiota balance, and symptom relief. Despite moderate normalization of diagnostic test results, substantial clinical improvement highlights the importance of patient-reported outcomes. This is one of the first large-scale studies to specifically evaluate quality-of-life outcomes in SIBO patients using validated tools, making it a unique contribution to the field. These findings underscore the critical need for increased awareness and acceptance among healthcare providers of comprehensive SIBO management strategies. However, the authors also acknowledge key limitations, including the lack of a placebo or control group and the difficulty in isolating the effects of individual treatment components.

Future research should investigate psychological interventions, long-term sustainability, and personalized diets to better address the profound impact of SIBO on patients' daily lives, ultimately improving care standards and patient well-being globally.

Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.

FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.

At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.

Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have ""an enormous effect on patient safety"" and are ""antithetical"" to Kennedy's promise to bring ""radical transparency"" to federal health agencies.

""It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,"" Lurie said. ""Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.""

HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department's plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.

Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.

""What we need to be doing is the opposite of what's happening now: hiring more staff,"" she said.

Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.

Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what's available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.

All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.

""I think one thing we've learned is that if there's less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,"" Morisy said. ""I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.""

Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.

During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS' most recent annual FOIA report.

Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.

Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That's why it's important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.

""We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,"" Morisy said. ""And I just don't see how these things continue to function.""

David Rousseau, the publisher of KFF Health News, serves on the board of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy. Please message KFF Health News on Signal at (415) 519-8778 or get in touch here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Transforming material analysis: the impact of Bruker's Handheld Raman Spectrometer BRAVO","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250407/Transforming-material-analysis-the-impact-of-Brukers-Handheld-Raman-Spectrometer-BRAVO.aspx","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 13:51:00 GMT","

Most handheld Raman spectrometers are built for quick, on-the-spot material analysis, making them particularly valuable for security applications such as identifying illicit drugs. Beyond that, the BRAVO spectrometer is specifically designed with industrial quality control (QC) in mind, streamlining raw material release processes in a way that saves both time and costs. This is especially critical in the pharmaceutical industry, where 100 % material verification is often required.

The BRAVO often provides analytical results for materials at which competitive devices have their challenge. This comes by significant investments in R&D, leading to exceptional performance across Bruker's entire product range. With the BRAVO, the goal was to deliver benchtop-level performance in a handheld device while addressing a key challenge in Raman spectroscopy—the trade-off between fluorescence suppression and sensitivity based on excitation wavelength. This is where SSETM (Sequentially Shifted Excitation) technology comes in, offering the best of both worlds.

For example, this level of performance is well recognized in the scientific community, with the BRAVO widely used for R&D applications, including the analysis of valuable historic paintings.

With its Class 1 laser certification, the BRAVO eliminates the need for additional laser safety measures such as personal protective equipment, designated safety officers, training programs, or access restrictions. Today, the health and safety of employees are more important than ever, and as well an aspiration in product development is to establish designs that are as safe as possible.

In the pharmaceutical industry, providing robust hardware and reliable services is crucial – but equally important is the software. As digitalization continues to shape pharmaceutical QC, seamless system integration and compliance-driven yet efficient software solutions are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of analytical devices in modern QC environments.

A few years ago, Bruker introduced TOUCH software for its OPUS vibrational spectroscopy suite, designed specifically for routine tasks. The BRAVO follows the same intuitive GUI concept, allowing even inexperienced users to quickly learn and operate the device within minutes.

From a data integrity standpoint, BRAVO features a dedicated validation mode that ensures electronic records remain secure, regardless of user role. Data cannot be deleted or modified without authorization, maintaining compliance with the ALCOA+ principles emphasized by the FDA.

First, the BRAVO features a true high-performance spectrograph, expanding its applications beyond traditional quality control. With OPUS, Bruker offers the industry-leading vibrational spectroscopy software suite, also enabling full remote control of the handheld spectrometer—making it a viable option for R&D tasks that don't require a large benchtop system.

Combined with its onboard software and advanced fluorescence mitigation for challenging materials, BRAVO has matured into a highly specialized solution for the pharmaceutical industry - one that is widely recognized and valued by our global customers.

Compared to other analytical techniques, Raman spectroscopy is still relatively young, particularly in industrial applications, making its market and technological evolution highly dynamic. High Throughput Virtual Slit (HTVS™) technology for process Raman applications significantly enhances sensitivity—by more than an order of magnitude – impressing even experts in the field.

Additionally, advancements in Raman imaging eliminate the need for time-consuming point-by-point mappings, making Raman microscopy most accessible to routine applications. These innovations are truly exciting for today's scientists, opening up new possibilities in research and industry.



Dr. Felix Fromm holds a PhD in solid-state physics with a specialization in Raman spectroscopy. Having joined Bruker in 2015 as an application manager for handheld Raman spectroscopy, he has accumulated over 15 years of experience in this field. With his extensive expertise in Raman spectroscopy, combined with his role as a pharmaceutical expert, he plays a key role in Bruker's Validation team.

Bruker Optics, part of the Bruker Corporation is one of the world's leading manufacturer and worldwide supplier of Fourier Transform Infrared, Near Infrared and Raman spectrometers.

Bruker entered the field of FTIR spectroscopy in 1974. The early instruments set new standards in research FTIR with evacuable optics, high resolution and automatic range change. Since then, the product line has been continuously expanding with instruments suitable for both analytical and research applications with exceptional performance characteristics.

Today, Bruker Optics offers complete technical solutions for various markets which cover a broad range of applications in all fields of research and development as well as industrial production processes for the purpose of ensuring quality and process reliability.

This comes as part of a move to integrate the Kynisca Innovation Hub into the Soccer Forward Foundation vehicle.

Michele Kang, owner of the National Women's Soccer League's (NWSL) Washington Spirit, is investing $25 million into the overall research and development of the women's game in the US.

Kang is also the owner of Kynisca, a women's soccer-dedicated research body launched last July, and announced the funding – to be carried out through Kynisca – at the SheBelieves Summit in Los Angeles alongside JT Batson, chief executive of US Soccer.

The funding comes as part of a wider move to integrate the Kynisca Innovation Hub into the Soccer Forward Foundation vehicle run by US Soccer.

It also comes following Kang having already pledged $30 million to US Soccer last November, to be used by the body over the next five years.

The Washington Spirit owner said: “This integration represents a major step forward in advancing research and setting new standards for women's sports. By working together, we ensure that players at all levels benefit from innovative insights and best practices. Women's soccer is experiencing historic growth, but there's still work to be done to break down systemic barriers and secure the investment needed for female athletes.”

Kang has owned the Spirit since February 2022, and has subsequently added the London City Lionesses (England) and Olympique Lyonnais Feminin (France) teams to her portfolio. This, at the time the Lyon deal went through, created the first multi-club ownership group in women's soccer (now joined by Monarch Collective, which has controlling stakes in three NWSL teams).

Cindy Parlow Cone, president of US Soccer, added that through “integrating Kynisca Innovation Hub talent into Soccer Forward, we can drive real change through research-backed standards that support players at every level.”

A US Soccer release has claimed that the new funding will be challenged through research around how to produce better health outcomes in women's soccer, and also on how to implement best practice standards in the women's game.

This specific investment represents the largest investment in Soccer Forward since that body was launched in mid-2024.

The national body has said that the investment ""will contribute to US Soccer's goal as it plans to co-host the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2031.”

Late last week, the US bid to host that women's soccer tournament was unveiled as the only hosting submission by global soccer's governing body FIFA.

The US Soccer and Mexican Soccer Federations announced that they would be lodging a joint bid for the 2031 tournament last April, abandoning potential plans to bid for 2027 hosting rights in the process (that tournament was then allocated to Brazil).

A formal vote on the hosts of both the 2031 and 2035 Women's World Cups will take place at a FIFA Congress in 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Leading by example: How Emily Sonnett has established herself as USWNT's secret weapon","https://www.olympics.com/en/news/leading-by-example-how-emily-sonnett-has-established-herself-as-uswnt-secret-weapon-football","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:34:00 GMT","

The 31-year-old never considered herself a guaranteed starter, but she is making the most of every opportunity under Emma Hayes.

On the current United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) roster, only three players have tallied over 100 appearances for their nation.

Emily Sonnett is one of them.

It may have seemed an unlikely achievement for the 31-year-old, who has never considered herself a bona fide starter when it comes to playing for her nation.

“I think one thing I think about for my personal journey [is that] it didn't come quickly,” she told The Guardian.

“I wasn't seeing starts or a lot of game time… I actually never thought I'd reach 100 caps for [because] I've never been a true starter for this team.”

Even with the arrival of a new manager mid-2024, there was a general feeling that her role under Emma Hayes would be a supporting one from the bench.

The reality, however, has been quite the contrary.

In the face of injury woes across central defenders, Hayes has called on the centurion to fill in at the back. Before that, Sonnett had been deployed in midfield when in rotation.

She is quickly but surely becoming a key player in this new U.S. era, with her versatility proving to be a secret and reliable weapon for the current coaching staff.

Emily Sonnett honoured for 100 appearances in a USWNT shirt.

Full-back, defensive midfielder, and now centre-back.

These are all positions occupied by Sonnett for the national team in the space of a year.

Her versatility stems from her drive to represent the U.S. on the biggest stages – instilling the kind of work ethic that pushes her to succeed wherever she is called on.

“I think I'm versatile because every roster I really had to fight to be on, and that sometimes meant moving positions to make it and get to a tournament,” the NJ/NY Gotham star said in an interview with Just Women's Sports.

“This team is so competitive in every position, especially [squads like] the Olympics that [only have] 18 spaces.

“You have to stay coachable, you have to learn… if that's what is going to get me on rosters, then that is what I have to do.”

That kind of approach wasn't born overnight. It has been tireless years of work and going the extra mile.

Determined to become a consistent performer in any of the roles she was required to play, Sonnett went as far as working with an analyst to identify any areas of weakness.

‘It probably took me four years to really get that [consistency across the pitch] down,” she admitted to the Women's Game podcast.

“I worked with an analyst so I [could] understand exactly where I'm falling short and where I'm not, so I can have these consistent years back-to-back.

“I would look into defensive duels, aerial duels, progressive passes, where I'm passing the ball and [assessed] if I was hitting certain numbers compared to some of the best centre-backs in the world.”

Such willingness to improve her game and apply it at each opportunity has made her a go-to option in the face of a minor injury crisis in the backline.

Emily Sonnett helps the USWNT keep a clean sheet against Brazil in April 2025.

At Paris 2024, it became clear that Sonnett – much to her surprise – would be a crucial part of Hayes's plans going forward.

Her experience and expertise across multiple positions made her an invaluable asset in the English coach's first tournament in charge.

More importantly, it outlined what her plans for the player were and that included seeing her as more of a central defender as opposed to a fullback, which had previously been her core role with the national team.

In the six games it took for the U.S. to be crowned Olympic champions, Sonnett featured in each of them.

Subbed on four times and a starter for two, including the 1-0 quarter-final victory over Japan.

Then came the SheBelieves Cup and, without first-choice centre-back Naomi Girma, the Georgia-native stepped in comfortably.

She is once again the go-to replacement at the back for the USWNT's latest friendlies against Brazil, amid more injury woes following Tierna Davidson's withdrawal from camp.

“I'm someone who leads a lot by example and being coachable… [I want to be] a constant reminder for everyone that we have to be working hard, but also applying what we're learning,” she told ESPN.

“What I really appreciate about Emma and her staff is that they're always forward-thinking, always layering in.

“I think the Olympics are the tip of the iceberg for how much they can teach in a short amount of time.”","{'href': 'https://www.olympics.com', 'title': 'Olympics.com'}","soccer"

NWSL

This is Alyssa Thompson's moment.

That much was palpable when she received the ball left of the center circle from defender Crystal Dunn during the U.S. women's national team's 2-0 win over Brazil on Saturday in front of 32,303 people in her home city of Los Angeles.

For anyone who has watched the 20-year-old attacking player during her three seasons across town with Angel City FC in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), her path might as well have been cut into the field at SoFi Stadium with a lawn mower: straight to goal.

One feint sent a Brazilian defender sliding out of the play and Thompson exploited the space left behind. By the time she reached the top of the 18-yard box, the moment had begun to feel like what could one day be considered vintage Thompson, much like the goal she scored for Angel City before the international break. But rather than aim for the goal, Thompson delivered an assist that split two more defenders to reach an oncoming Trinity Rodman, who knocked the ball past Brazilian and Kansas City Current goalkeeper Lorena in the sixth minute.

“That was the perfect ball to a perfect finish. I think we read each other's minds in that moment,” Rodman said after the match.

Her direct attacking style aside, Thompson's short journey from being voted Gatorade Player of the Year at high school level in 2021 to this moment has been anything but linear.

She was the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft and the youngest player on the USWNT's World Cup roster in a matter of months. Her standout rookie season rolled into her first senior call-up, however, and things quickly changed.

Thompson made just two appearances off the bench in the defending champion United States' ill-fated run to the round of 16 at that World Cup, playing just 17 minutes in a tournament that saw very little squad rotation by coach Vlatko Andonovski. The World Cup crash led to Andonovski resigning and the youngest member of the squad getting left out of the roster to regain form, with mixed results, for her club.



After new coach Emma Hayes took the reins midway through 2024, Thompson watched the USWNT's Olympic gold medal run from home. Instead of a summer in France, she worked to hone her skills, and after five goals and two assists in seven NWSL games, Thompson got the call from Hayes in October. And she didn't waste her shot.

The then-19-year-old scored her first senior international goal 39 minutes into a friendly against Iceland in Austin. The joy was apparent on her face as she leaped into the arms of substitute Sophia Wilson on the sideline.

“I feel like last year, and the last couple of years, I put a lot of pressure on myself,” Thompson told reporters last week. “I think just coming in this year, I just wanted to be confident in my abilities and know what I bring as a player, and not compare myself to other people. I think that has helped me a lot, just knowing that if I'm playing like Alyssa Thompson then I'll be able to put a good foot forward for my team.”

Each month since, Thompson has been finding and learning ways to sharpen her craft. And, with the marquee front three of Wilson, Rodman and Mallory Swanson, who headlined that Olympic triumph, down to just Rodman for now, Thompson found another moment to make her case on Saturday.

Hayes acknowledged Thompson's journey ahead of the match as a cautionary tale of how a mistimed moment can obscure a player's potential, especially from an outsider's perspective.

“I hope that we can look at someone like Alyssa Thompson's situation, i.e. a 17-year-old coming into the program probably underprepared for that because the level is so much higher, to then have a journey which is pretty normal for a young player. But I think she's in the best place she has been in terms of her start to the season,” Hayes said.

But the former Chelsea manager also expressed her intention to continue elevating the characteristics that make Thompson an attacking threat as she progresses through national team camps and racks up minutes on the field.

“Since October we've been working so hard positionally with her to get her to have a better understanding of what to do and when, and saying, ‘Listen, at the top level, you're a great one-v-one specialist, but when you're playing the top players in the world, they know how to drop off of you in a certain way where they don't give you a one-v-one opportunity, so how do you link with others?',” Hayes said.

There were glimpses of those areas of growth in Saturday's match, particularly in some of Thompson's unsuccessful attempts to take on the well-read Brazilian and Olympique Lyonnais central defender Tarciane. Still, she created dangerous scoring opportunities that contributed to the team's 2.72 expected goals (xG) figure.

Hayes has seen the gap close between where Thompson was six months ago and where she is now, and part of that comes through in her instinctive thinking.

“When you play for me, I will overload you to take a player to another level tactically, but that means for a period of time, there's a lot of thinking going on, a lot of processing,” Hayes said. “There's a lot of conscious thinking, whereas I feel like with Alyssa now, she understands that, so she's able to do it more naturally.”

Thompson is still at the beginning of her professional career and it's important to consider: managing internal pressure, brewing confidence and resisting the urge to compare herself to others. These are all tall orders for most teens (and adults) even when they haven't faced the challenges she has. But they, too, have led to the moment Thompson is now enjoying, and she credits her teammates with supporting her through it.

“They believe in me so much and I attribute a lot of my success to them because their help and reassurance has really helped me become the player that I am right now,” Thompson said.

Angel City captain and defender Ali Riley has viewed Thompson's journey from a unique vantage point.

The 37-year-old Los Angeles native attended Harvard-Westlake, the same high school Thompson and her younger sister and Angel City teammate Gisele did, and experienced that same World Cup in 2023, though Riley played for co-host New Zealand (she was born in LA but her father is from New Zealand). Riley was quick to refuse credit for any guidance she's given the elder Thompson and made clear her progress is just as promising as her ceiling — as a player and as a face of the sport.

“Even when we look at how much she's grown, her performances on the field, what's so special about her is that this is the beginning,” Riley told The Athletic. “I think she has the personality and the eloquence to be someone who can speak about being a woman in sport, being a woman of color in sport. She's so good about speaking about her experience growing up, the value of representation.”

Riley, who hasn't played since last season because of nerve damage in her left leg, added that Thompson was voted into the team's leadership group this year.

When Thompson went through a bit of a scoring drought during that 2024 season, Riley said she faced criticism from “keyboard warriors” on social media who picked through her stats and body language with a fine-tooth comb. Now, Riley said, “when she scores, she doesn't seem relieved, she's genuinely happy.”

So far, that happiness has shown up as cheeky TikTok goal celebrations with her sister Gisele and fellow Angel City striker Casey Phair on the sidelines. Other times, it's a full-throated rebel yell.

For Thompson to enjoy another stellar performance in her hometown on Saturday only sweetened the moment — topped off with one of those yells after assisting fellow Southern California native Rodman.

“I love playing in LA,” Thompson said in the mixed zone following the match. “Being here is amazing for the club, and I've never played in LA with the national team, so being able to feel that comfort from my city and my family and friends, I just felt like I could be more like me, and I knew what I could do.”

Emma Hayes earned her 16th win as the USWNT head coach as the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) celebrate victory over Brazil.



The U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) showcased a blend of youthful energy and strategic prowess in a commanding 2-0 victory over Brazil at SoFi Stadium. This match marked the first encounter between the two teams since the 2024 Olympic gold medal game, reaffirming the USWNT's dominance on the international stage.​

From the outset, the USWNT displayed aggressive intent. In the 5th minute, forward Trinity Rodman, returning from an eight-month injury hiatus, capitalized on a precise assist from Alyssa Thompson to net her 11th international goal. Rodman's swift finish into the lower right corner set the tone for the match.​

The team's momentum continued into the second half. In the 66th minute, 17-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes, who had been on the field for just five minutes, drew a foul in the penalty area. Captain Lindsey Heaps confidently converted the ensuing penalty kick, marking her 37th international goal and solidifying the team's lead.​

Defensively, the USWNT was bolstered by the debut of goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. The 28-year-old Manchester United player delivered a stellar performance, recording six saves and securing a clean sheet. Her composure under pressure underscores the depth of talent within the squad.​

Head Coach Emma Hayes' influence was evident throughout the match. Since her appointment, Hayes has prioritized integrating young talent with seasoned veterans, fostering a cohesive and dynamic team dynamic. Her strategic vision and emphasis on player development have been instrumental in the team's recent successes.​

The match drew a crowd of 32,303 fans, marking the first-ever women's professional sporting event at SoFi Stadium and the second-largest USWNT attendance in the Los Angeles area, excluding the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.​

Hello there! The Champions League returns for some quarterfinal action this week, while the U.S. women's national team wrap up a two-game series against Brazil on Tuesday. I'm Pardeep Cattry with an update ahead of a busy week.

All times U.S./Eastern

Monday, April 7🇮🇹 Serie A: Bologna vs. Napoli, 2:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 EPL: Leicester City vs. Newcastle United, 3 p.m. ➡️ USA Network

The headlining act of this week's Champions League action will be Real Madrid's trip to Arsenal, which comes with fairly big stakes for two teams at very different stages in their season.

For the hosts, the baggage of seasons past defines the importance of this  month's two-legged tie. This was poised to be a season in which Mikel Arteta's Arsenal would act upon the promise they demonstrated in years past and finally win a major title, but the nonexistent Premier League race means they are down to just one potential trophy lift – the Champions League. The Gunners' European campaign has been as straightforward as it gets but a clash against Real Madrid offers their first serious test of the season, and at a crucial juncture of the competition. Arsenal have not booked a spot in the Champions League semifinals in nearly 20 years, so the importance of the quarterfinal tie is not lost upon Arteta, who described these matches as the most significant of his managerial career.

In order to live up to the momentous occasion, though, they will have to get through Real Madrid first. It may not be as daunting a task as it sounds considering how the season has gone for Los Blancos – they registered some notable losses during the league phase, but managed to oust Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the knockouts and are making a case that they are peaking at the right time. Recent results might raise some questions about that claim, though, with a 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad in the Copa del Rey and a 2-1 loss to Valencia in La Liga play showcasing the imbalance that Carlo Ancelotti's side have long had.

The possibility of a trophyless season does not define Real Madrid's Champions League campaign as much as it does Arsenal's at this point, but there's just as much pressure for them to deliver their uncanny ability to cross the finish line even in imperfect circumstances. Real Madrid have been resigned to taking the hard road to repeat as champions and have done well in those circumstances, but will once again have to prove their worth to ensure they have a spot in the semifinals.

The U.S. women's national team kicked off their two-game series against Brazil with a 2-0 win on Saturday that showcased head coach Emma Hayes' mix and match approach as she continues a period of player pool expansion.

Six members of the USWNT's Olympics squad started in the rematch of last summer's gold medal game, most notable among them Trinity Rodman, who scored just eight minutes into her first game since Paris. Rodman's star quality was on full display for her 61 minute shift, but she was not the only attacking talent who made the most of her moment – Alyssa Thompson, who already has two goals in three NWSL games this season, notched the assist to Rodman's goal and enjoyed yet another strong showing in the U.S.' post-Olympics era of experimentation.

Hayes mixed some of the USWNT's mainstays with a batch of less-experienced talent, including goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. She, as well as defender Avery Patterson, earned her first cap on Saturday and made six saves as the battle to succeed Alyssa Naeher continues. Though the head coach admitted there are still areas of improvement, including ball retention and decision-making, but she believes the ""less-experienced team are growing up"" and pointed towards the attacking effort as an example.

Hayes and company wrap up the two-game swing against Brazil on Tuesday, where a different group of players could receive the opportunity to impress as the USWNT's long road to the 2027 Women's World Cup continues.

🇪🇸 La Liga title race: Both Barcelona and Real Madrid dropped points in La Liga play over the weekend, but the former's four point lead means the title race tilted further in the favor.

💤 Goalless in Manchester: The Manchester derby ended 0-0 on Sunday as the struggles both Manchester City and Manchester United have faced all season long were on full display at Old Trafford.

🔴 Liverpool lose: Liverpool's 3-2 loss to Fulham may not cause many issues in their quest to win the Premier League title, but offers a signal that things may not be so straightforward next season.

🌴 Messi scores again: Lionel Messi scored a crucial – and impressive – equalizer for Inter Miami against Toronto FC on Sunday, but their 1-1 draw means they are winless in two ahead of their Concacaf Champions Cup quarterfinal against LAFC on Wednesday.

MLS

Patrick Agyemang has no problem elaborating on his answers to questions about his rapid rise. He's generous when it comes to sharing detail and perspective. Only one of over a dozen queries warrants a one-word answer of “no” – albeit with a bit of a chuckle to provide plenty of subtext.

The question: Did he hear from U.S. Soccer or sense he was being considered for inclusion prior to Mauricio Pochettino's tenure?

It's defensible to an extent. Striker has quickly become one of the deepest position groups in the USMNT pool, with multiple players scoring regularly in Europe – Josh Sargent and Haji Wright were at it again this past weekend – and a steady stable of dependable forwards playing regularly in MLS. Injuries, however, remain a regular concern.

Folarin Balogun has struggled since joining Monaco in the summer of 2023 and hasn't played since October after suffering a shoulder injury. Ricardo Pepi's season ended in late January after suffering a knee injury. Sargent missed all of November and December with a groin injury, and Wright missed nearly four months with an ankle complaint.

Even so, to those who hadn't been watching Agyemang's 2024 season, the 24-year-old's inclusion on Pochettino's January camp squad may have seemed like little more than a flier on a young player.

“It's so easy to go into these camps and think you're not good enough to be here, or just feel like this isn't your level, it's too high for you or something,” Agyemang told The Athletic. “For me, I go into these camps and I'm just like, ‘I need to do my role. I need to work hard. If I get on the field, I need to show that I belong here and I want to be back, to be in this picture.'”

Agyemang was arguably the standout player of his first USMNT camp, scoring in each of his first two international caps in wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica. The strong impression kept him in frame for the Nations League finals, where he came off the bench in the semifinal vs. Panama and then started the third-place match against Canada. His 35th-minute goal in the latter fixture helped the U.S. pull level before halftime.

While the end result — a fourth-place showing in a four-team bracket — hardly inspired, Agyemang's conversations with Pochettino made him feel as though he had impressed again.

“I've been really trying to make a presence for myself on the field,” Agyemang said. “In the first game against Panama, if I could go back, I would change the decisions that I made in a split moment, because essentially, I could have scored two goals, but the fact I was able to create space for myself in those opportunities, (Pochettino) was happy with it. He's realizing I can come in showing a different profile and spark to the game. As long as I continue doing that, he was happy with it.

“There's things I need to still improve on, but in the overall bulk of it, it was a positive outlook on what I did (from him).”

It was hard to find reasons for optimism surrounding the USMNT after those consecutive defeats.

The two games provided a worrying 180 minutes for Pochettino to assess, with defensive miscues and clumsy attempts at upfield progression leaving time for concerningly few glimpses of promise. After each game, pundits and fans alike grasped for answers as to how the U.S., once lauded for grit and determination, could look so flat.

Throughout the discourse, two players' names emerged as bright spots amid the carnage, the same two who combined for the team's only goal of the window: Diego Luna and Agyemang. While Luna's stock began rising during a breakout 2023, Agyemang's has escalated more rapidly, having only just become Charlotte FC's starting striker in 2024.

He has now been thrust into contention for the 2026 World Cup, and even the loudest detractors of the U.S.'s present form can notice what he brings to the fold.

“Yeah, it has been a lot, just how quickly everything has been moving,” Agyemang said. “I've always prayed for this. I've always had the faith that at some point, hopefully I'll be able to be on a stage where I can really show what I can do and just give my all for it, just to see that this is the start of something that potentially could just keep going higher. It's a blessing.”

At a time when former U.S. stars are questioning the motivation and commitment of the current group of players, Agyemang's performances have merited increased attention. While many other U.S. forwards have played abroad, Agyemang's development has fully come stateside, first in the college ranks and then with Charlotte.

A striker can often force his way onto a tournament squad on the back of strong scoring form, and Agyemang is no exception. The fact that making the World Cup squad seems like a genuine possibility is an impressive development from a player whose professional career is still getting started.

“To hear stuff like that, it's a nice feeling,” Agyemang said of his increasing support, “but that just makes me want to do it more.”

Agyemang's ascent is even more impressive when considering that he didn't begin playing striker regularly until he was 21.

Given his pace and dribbling ability, coaches asked Agyemang to play on the wing, most often on the left to cut inwards onto his preferred right foot. It's the spot where Agyemang began his college career with his hometown Eastern Connecticut State Warriors. He was prolific during his two years in Division III, bagging 30 goals and 10 assists in 39 appearances and garnering D-1 interest from the University of Rhode Island. Once he arrived, his new coach saw a different way to maximize his skillset.

“When I got to Rhode Island, that's when the coaches said, ‘I want you to be my No. 9,'” Agyemang said. “I was like, ‘OK, cool. I could do pretty well (in) this position for myself.' I thought if I continue just learning more about the nine position, I could be a really good nine.”

Agyemang took to his new position and level of competition quickly, landing on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference first team in both his junior and senior seasons. He scored 19 times while adding 12 assists in 37 games, and that caused his stock to soar ahead of the 2023 MLS SuperDraft, where Charlotte traded up to select him 12th overall.

While he earned 423 minutes across the regular season and Leagues Cup, scoring twice, most of his rookie development came in MLS Next Pro with Crown Legacy FC. Throughout 2023, however, he found himself being asked to play striker in a less agile manner, a potential byproduct of his 6-foot-4 stature as well as a coach (Christian Lattanzio) whose positional play model had granularly defined job descriptions for each role.

“It's hard,” Agyemang said of being assessed on his stature. “I remember when I first got here, a lot of times, it was just like: hold the ball, set and go. Obviously, that's a lot of principles that as a striker you want, because at the end, you want to score your goals in the box and stuff like that. I think I had to build into it, because I was letting people know, like, I could do more than that.

“I know my game, and I know when I'm at my best. I know what I'm good at. When the ball is on my feet, I'm never scared to, like, take somebody on in a 1-v-1. I look for those opportunities, and I always want to go.”

Ahead of 2024, Charlotte appointed Dean Smith as its new head coach, bringing the former Aston Villa and Norwich City boss over for his first job outside England. Early in preseason, Agyemang worked with his new coaching staff to try incorporating more of his natural skillset into his game.

Agyemang feels as though Smith — like Pochettino with the national team — took the time to size up how he could thrive most.

“There's a difference,” Agyemang said of coaches who tailor game plans to their personnel instead of forcing players into strict systems. “You definitely feel that. Initially, when I first was here at Charlotte, it felt like I was just a role, like they weren't really looking into who I was as a player.

“I think a lot of times, coaches try to give you too much information rather than letting you just play. So I think now, especially with the coaches I've been working with now, it's been a big change. I feel like now, I'm just gonna continue to elevate my game.”

Agyemang and Charlotte leveled up during a transformative 2024. Across 2,014 minutes in the regular season and playoffs, Agyemang led the club with 10 goals and tied for the team lead with six assists. He bagged three crucial game-winners as Charlotte found its rhythm in the spring and summer, showing Smith he could swing results with his approach to leading the line.

“His ceiling is as much as he wants it to be, to be honest,” Smith told the Total Soccer Show podcast in March. While he has just one goal to date in the 2025 MLS season, the underlying numbers show that he has the requisite instinct to find dangerous areas that typifies an elite center forward.

Since the start of 2024, 30 strikers have played at least 1,500 minutes in MLS. It's a sample that includes luminaries like Luis Suárez, Christian Benteke and Cucho Hernández as well as prolific MLS forwards like Jordan Morris and Cristian Arango. While Agyemang's numbers are competitive among them in most categories, he tops the charts in two crucial rate stats for a forward with his profile.

Nobody has a higher progressive carry rate — that is, how often his carries advance the ball at least five yards closer to goal — of 32% (second-best is 22.1%), while no striker has logged a greater share of his touches in the opponent's box than Agyemang's rate of 25.4%.

When presented with the data, Agyemang can't help but take a little pride in how his work is paying off. Still, he sees it as evidence that he needs to keep refining the rest of his game.

“It's cool to hear those stats, but I just know how I like to play the game now,” Agyemang said. “I'm comfortable being on the ball and on the run with the ball. With my frame, you look at me, and you're like, ‘A 6'4” winger, it just doesn't make sense.'

“I like to add those things I've learned on the wing, and bring it into my game, because I want to make my game unique to myself. There's a lot of players in the world that play the nine in a way, but I want to make it my unique way. That's why I think like that progressive ball carrying is a way that I like to do. Maybe nines, you know, they don't want the ball (that far from goal), but I love carrying the ball.”

UNSTOPPABLE from Patrick Agyemang to double the lead!#USMNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/BxMB1B16Lx

— U.S. Soccer Men's National Team (@USMNT) January 18, 2025



Another area that Agyemang continues to refine is his off-ball movement, a facet that changes considerably when shifting from the wing to center forward.

He admits to being “very critical” of himself, watching each of his performances back to revisit in-moment thoughts that crop up in games. He looks for “patterns” that come up in game scenarios, trying to identify pockets of space that opponents are presenting his team so he can exploit them to create room for himself or his teammates as a clever decoy.

“I've just been really working on that, because before I really didn't do as much movement,” Agyemang said, “But the best way as a striker is like, you want to feel as if the defenders don't know where to go at times. If I'm always in front of them and stuff like that, it's a field day for them. You kind of mix it up and find ways to open space.”

That effort is possibly more crucial now as Smith calibrates his system to include Wilfried Zaha, who joined the club this winter on an initial loan. The former Crystal Palace great is among the modern era's most prolific dribblers, and his presence will inevitably take some carrying responsibility off of Agyemang's shoulders. While the striker acknowledged that they're “still learning and understanding each other's games,” the initial collaboration has been positive and he's already seen glimpses of the pair “getting that rhythm down.”

Charlotte fans are watching that partnership blossom with great hope, as the team — which also includes U.S. international defender Tim Ream and former Villa and Burnley midfielder Ashley Westwood — projects to remain in contention in the Eastern Conference. It'll also be closely assessed by Pochettino and his staff as they continue to size up the U.S.'s player pool ahead of next summer.

Agyemang's work rate in the Nations League finals stood out in contrast to some of his teammates. His goal against Canada was a just return for his first-half shift, where his movement had unsettled the defense and opened spaces for Luna, Tim Weah and Christian Pulisic.

To him, that inner drive was refined during his time in the NCAA.

“I think there's things that I still need to work on, but I think it's just like the grit and the grind part — like the determination,” Agyemang said of his college tenure. “No matter what happens, I'm gonna keep going. I think that's the part I really like grabbed and has stuck with me since college.”

He, like his peers, will also want to play in the 2026 World Cup. The fierce competition in his position will keep a fire under Agyemang to turn in good performances, refine that interplay with Zaha and keep himself on the radar regardless of what his compatriots are doing.

Agyemang isn't fixating too much on what could happen when the tournament kicks off in over 15 months — after all, he wasn't even a projected starter for his club 15 months ago.

“For me, I try not to look too far, because it brings a lot of extra pressure,” he said. “But at the end of the day, it's home. If you're a part of that, you're involved in something that's so special, just to be able to play in a World Cup on your home soil. That's such a special feeling. I think a lot of Americans will want to be a part of that. It's cool to just be in the conversation for it. At the end of the day, who knows?”

And so, the hard work continues in Charlotte and off the training ground. Agyemang emphasized that he wants to improve his consistency in 2025, and not just in front of goal. He's studying the tape to see how he can improve his defensive pressing, how to be even better at retaining the ball and making better decisions when it's at his feet. In total, it's about “polishing the cleanness of (his) game” now that he's getting consistent reps.

At a time when greats like Landon Donovan question if the current group wants to represent the U.S., it's an honor that's only fueling Agyemang to push on. Although it comes with increased expectations and scrutiny, it's a blessing he's worked hard to invite – and an area where he's more than happy to elaborate.

“Now that I've quickly gotten into this national team, they're expecting more from me,” Agyemang said. “For me, it's cool. It's a fun dynamic to work with. At the end of the day, if you want to be a great player, you need to know what's to come with it.

“I'm blessed to be in this position, but I won't puff my chest because of what's come, if that makes sense. I'm always this type of guy to keep my head down and want to do more, and get better each and every day. I don't want it to just be, like, that was my first and my last camp. I want it to be the beginning of something to come.”

Phil Foden's form has 'fallen off a cliff' and he needs to be left out of Manchester City's squad for this summer's Club World Cup, Ian Ladyman has told Chris Sutton on the latest 'It's All Kicking Off!' podcast.

Foden, 24, was subbed off before the hour mark during Sunday's turgid Manchester derby which finished goalless.

The winger still made headlines after the match as he was the target of abusive chants about his mother from rival fans.

Looking ahead to this summer's Club World Cup, The Mail's Football Editor Ian Ladyman told co-host Chris Sutton that Foden's 'exhausted' performances show that the player needs a sustained break from the game to recover his form.

'Foden looks ruined, he looks exhausted, he looks like he needs a long rest', Ladyman said.

'I think at times with footballers, you get to a point where you've got to ask yourself: do we need that player for this tournament? What is best for him? Do we have a duty of care towards him?'

'It doesn't happen very often, but I think we're getting to that point with Phil Foden – that guy needs to be left at home in June and July, so he can take a breath and get ready for next season.

'With Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, and De Bruyne, you can put down their form to age, playing at the highest level for a decade. You can't say that with Phil, he's a young player – there's got to be another reason for what we're seeing.

'This isn't a dip – he looks on the floor.'

Last season, Foden recorded 19 goals and eight assists across all competitions: his tally this season stands at seven goals and two assists in 10 fewer matches.

He was named PFA Players' Player of the Year and Premier League Player of the Season but struggled to make an impact for England at the Euros.

Former professional player and pundit Chris Sutton defended Foden, accusing Ladyman of unfairly 'singling him out' from an underperforming City side.

'All players go through this; I went through it. He was the best player in the country last year and he's now having a dip.

'You're singling Foden out because of his age. I don't see age the way you're seeing it. Foden is one of many Manchester City players whose form has fallen off a cliff.

'Pep Guardiola is smart enough to realise if there's an issue beyond football, whether or not he needs a mental break from the game. But I think you can say that about any Manchester City player right now.'

Sutton added however that he believes no Manchester City players should be going to the Club World Cup this summer based on their tired performances this season.

'We know what that tournament's all about: it's about money, it's about finance, it's about greed.

'None of the Manchester City players, based on this season's form, should be going. But they are going to go – I don't see Foden as different from any of them.'

Perhaps the biggest draw of this summer's FIFA Club World Cup is the sight of Europe's most successful club heading Stateside for the tournament. 

Not only are the Spanish giants 15-time Champions League winners and La Liga champions on a record 36 occasions, but Real have also won the Club World Cup more times than any other side. 

They have lifted the trophy five times, with the last coming in 2022 as they beat Al Hilal in Rabat thanks to braces from Federico Valverde and Vinicius Jr. 

DAZN  is the only place to watch every match of the Club World Cup live and for free - download the free app now for smart TV's, smartphones, streaming devices and games consoles to start watching.

DAZN News   has everything you need to know about Real Madrid. 

Real are Madrid's crown jewel, alongside the other capital clubs Atletico Madrid and Rayo Vallecano.

The famous Bernabeu Stadium has the second-largest seating capacity in Spain and has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947.

Football was introduced to Spain by English workers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Madrid was officially founded in 1902 by Juan Padros.

In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.



Real Madrid are the most dominant team in Spanish football history, having lifted La Liga 36 times. Their battle at the top of La Liga with Barcelona is the stuff of legend, and their 'El Clasico' battle is arguably the most popular football rivalry in the game. 

They also hold the record for most Champions League wins with 15, making them the most successful side in European football. 













Real Madrid are one of twelve European teams competing in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and qualify as one of the last three winners of the UEFA Champions League.

Real Madrid have been drawn into Group H, alongside Al Hilal, Pachuca and Red Bull Salzburg.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","BBC and ITV ‘won't bid' for UK Fifa Club World Cup TV rights","https://www.sportspro.com/news/bbc-itv-uk-fifa-club-world-cup-dazn-april-2025/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:56:46 GMT","

Both the BBC and ITV have reportedly opted not to bid for the UK free-to-air (FTA) broadcast rights to the revamped Fifa Club World Cup in the USA this summer.

Sports streaming service DAZN won the global rights to air Fifa's expanded club tournament as part of a US$1 billion deal that allows it to sublicence some games to FTA broadcasters in individual markets.

While DAZN has struck deals in several territories, including with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and TelevisaUnivision's linear networks in the US, the tournament's host country, there has been no appetite from UK broadcasters so far.

The BBC and ITV share the rights to major international soccer competitions, including the men's and women's Fifa World Cups and Uefa European Championships, however neither is said to be interested in airing Fifa's expanded club tournament.

The Guardian says the public service BBC declined to enter negotiations, believing the proposal to promote DAZN's service was incompatible with its public service obligations, while its commercial rival has only held exploratory conversations with the streamer. Indeed, it was reported that ITV had made an offer to Fifa to show the event for free, promising to elevate the profile and appeal of the competition, before the deal with DAZN was struck.

DAZN is believed to be confident of finding an FTA partner before the tournament, with Channel 4 and Channel 5 potential candidates. Both broadcasters have aired the previous iteration of the Fifa Club World Cup, while Channel 4 has struck deals with Sky Sports and Amazon Prime to air their coverage of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup final and 2021 women's US Open tennis final respectively.

The winners of the Fifa Club World Cup will take home up to US$125 million with participants sharing a total prize pot of US$525 million. Fifa has released a study claiming the event will generate up to US$21.1 billion in global gross domestic product (GDP), including US$9.6 billion in the US, through economic activity, job creation and international visitors.

Speaking at the SportsPro New York event last month, DAZN expressed its hope that the wide variety of participants, a condensed tournament schedule, and lack of competition from other major events would help drive viewership and advertiser interest in the host nation, likening the appeal of the competition to the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) March Madness basketball tournament.  



The lack of interest in the UK rights to the Club World Cup illustrates the challenges Fifa has faced in promoting its new competition and achieving a hugely ambitious revenue target given unproven demand from broadcasters, fans, players and even teams. This is despite the involvement of major clubs and players and the promise of bumper prize money for participants.

DAZN's US$1 billion deal, which followed a US$1 billion investment from the Saudi-backed SURJ, might only represent a fraction of Fifa's US$4 billion target but is still seen as a bold move by the streamer.

DAZN will air the tournament for free, hoping the presence of some of the world's biggest teams and most famous players will attract more registrations to its platform, potentially converting them into full subscribers or drive revenues from betting, merchandise and other services.

The ability to sublicence games to FTA broadcasters will help DAZN recoup some of its costs and drive awareness of its platform, which has a limited footprint in the UK. However, FTA coverage is crucial in driving the legitimacy and prestige of the competition, which Fifa hopes will eventually become a lucrative long-term source of revenue.

This is especially true in the UK, which is a highly developed broadcast market and will be sending two of the Premier League's biggest clubs – Manchester City and Chelsea.

Although it is probable that a UK partner will be secured, coverage on the BBC and ITV, the UK's two most-watched channels, would have been hugely beneficial. Indeed, the BBC's ability to cross-promote across television, radio and digital channels would have been especially valuable.

The new expanded Fifa Club World Cup will take place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July 2025.

Previously an annual tournament contested by the top seven teams, the Club World Cup will now feature 32 teams and occur once every four years.

The tournament once branded a ""mistake"" by ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter is undergoing a revamp as significant as it is controversial.

Club World Cup draw pairs Man City with Juventus; Chelsea face Flamengo

Teams from each of the six international football confederations will be at the Club World Cup: Asia (AFC), Africa (Caf), North and Central America (Concacaf), South America (Conmebol), Oceania (OFC) and Europe (Uefa).

There are 12 places available for European clubs - the highest quota of the confederations. These places are decided by clubs' Champions League performances over the past four seasons.

That means recent winners Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid have all qualified.

Other European teams have qualified through a Uefa ranking system determined by clubs' performances over the four seasons. Only two clubs per country can qualify, so England's 2022 Champions League finalists Liverpool are not included.

Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg - who will be known as FC Salzburg because of Fifa sponsorship regulations - will be there.

There are four club places each for Asia and Africa, as well as the North and Central America federation.

Six places are awarded to South American clubs, and one to Oceania.

Clubs have accrued points over the most recent four seasons, based on their performances in their continental club competitions.

Group A: Palmeiras, FC Porto, Al Ahly, Inter Miami

Group B: Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Botafogo, Seattle Sounders

Group C: Bayern Munich, Auckland City, Boca Juniors, Benfica

Group D: Flamengo, Esperance Sportive de Tunisie, Chelsea, Club Leon

Group E: River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds, Monterrey, Inter Milan

Group F: Fluminense, Borussia Dortmund, Ulsan, Mamelodi Sundowns

Group G: Manchester City, Wydad, Al Ain, Juventus

Group H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal, Pachuca, Salzburg

One spot in the tournament is reserved for a team from the host nation.

Fifa opted to award that place to Inter Miami for winning the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield, the trophy given out to the team which has the best regular-season record. The Floridians then lost in the MLS play-offs, meaning they are not this season's champions.

The decision to invite Inter Miami to the Club World Cup before the MLS campaign was concluded has been interpreted by some as an attempt on Fifa's part to ensure Lionel Messi, who joined the team in 2023, will play in a tournament that has attracted little public enthusiasm so far.

The revamped Club World Cup will run in a similar way to the international men's and women's World Cup competitions.

The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four, who will play each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams from each group will then go through to the knockout stages.

Unlike the international World Cups, the Club World Cup will have no third-place play-off.

The final will take place on 13 July 2025.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

Clubs will take home a set figure for each round:

Group Stages: £1.5m for a win / £800k for a draw

Round of 16: £5.8m

Quarter-Final: £10.1m

Semi-Final: £16.2m

Finalist: £23.2m

Winner: £30.0m

Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria.

European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents. The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

All matches will be held in the United States, a year before the country co-hosts the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

Fixtures are set to be played in 12 different stadiums.

Atlanta, Mercedes-Benz Stadium

Charlotte, TQL Stadium

Cincinnati, Bank of America Stadium

Los Angeles, Rose Bowl Stadium

Miami, Hard Rock Stadium

Nashville, GEODIS Park

New Jersey, MetLife Stadium

Orlando, Camping World Stadium

Orlando, Inter&Co Stadium

Philadelphia, Lincoln Financial Field

Seattle, Lumen Field

Washington DC, Audi Field

The opening match will be held in Miami, and the final is scheduled for New Jersey.

Streaming platform DAZN has secured exclusive rights and will show all 63 matches free to view on on its platforms, and there is also potential for it to sublicense rights to local free-to-air broadcasters.

Fifa is currently facing legal action from player unions and leagues about the scheduling of the tournament.

Global players' union Fifpro and the top European Leagues say the international football calendar is ""oversaturated"" and ""risks player safety and wellbeing"".

Several players - including Liverpool's Alisson Becker and Manchester City's Rodri - have raised concerns about player wellbeing amid an increasingly jam-packed football calendar.

There are just five weeks between the Club World Cup final and the first Premier League match of the 2025-2026 season, which is scheduled for 16 August.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has already requested a late start to the Premier League season for his team, while City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne told reporters: ""The issue is that Uefa and Fifa keep adding extra matches, and we can raise concerns but no solutions have been found. It seems that money speaks louder than the players' voices.""

A Fifa spokesperson BBC Sport: ""The Fifa Club World Cup is not responsible for calendar congestion. It is a competitive tournament that takes place once every four years and, as independent studies have verified, Fifa is only responsible for a small percentage of matches per season.

""Fifa cares about the welfare of the players. Following a decision taken earlier this year, Fifa is formalising the Task Force on Player Welfare, headed by Arsene Wenger, to promote further global dialogue on player welfare issues with key stakeholders across football.""

The Club World Cup will partially overlap with Women's Euro 2025, which runs from 2-27 July.

BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify this scheduling clash and whether there were concerns about the Women's Euro competing with the Club World Cup for attention.

A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: ""The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa.

""While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.

""It is also important to note that given the time difference between Switzerland [host of Uefa Women's Euro 2025] and the United States [where the Fifa Club World Cup will take place], the number of matches where a potential clash could take place will be fewer.""

Home > Headlines > Bounou Confident as Al Hilal Prepare to Face Real Madrid in Club World Cup

Yassine Bounou

Rabat – Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou has said that Al Hilal are ready to take on the world's best teams, including Real Madrid, at the upcoming Club World Cup 2025.

Speaking in an interview with FIFA, Bounou shared his excitement about playing in the tournament and expressed confidence in his team's ability to make a strong impact.

Al Hilal, champions of Asia, will face a tough challenge in Group H, where they are drawn against Real Madrid, FC Salzburg, and CF Pachuca. 

But Bounou, who has faced Real Madrid many times before while playing for Spanish clubs Girona and Sevilla, said his past experience gives him confidence. “I've played against Real a lot; I have many friends in the team, and I've always met their fans on the streets of Spain. I've always had mutual respect for the club and its supporters,” he said.

“I've faced a lot of great teams throughout my career, and I'm privileged that Real Madrid is one of them, and it's a great honour to do it again wearing the Al Hilal shirt,” the player added.

The 2023 African Goalkeeper of the Year added that the Saudi Arabian team is motivated to go far in the competition. “We at Al Hilal are honored to participate in the first edition of the Club World Cup (in its new format). We look forward to delivering a performance worthy of Al Hilal,” he stated.

The upcoming Club World Cup will be the first to feature an expanded format featuring 32 of the world's top clubs. 

Bounou also spoke about the difficulty of the group stage and said he hopes to reach “a level I have never reached before” as a Moroccan player in this global competition.

The player also reflected on his experience at the World Cup 2022 in Qatar, where he helped Morocco reach the semi-finals for the first time in history. “The experience I have gained from it will be an additional factor that the team can capitalise on,” he said.

When asked whether he would like to face one of his old clubs, Wydad or Atlético, in the later rounds, Bounou laughed and said, “Honestly, I'd rather not face them, but I hope they reach the highest levels.”

April 7 – The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has a busy month unravelling the qualification mess that FIFA's Club World Cup has become following the late barring of Club León from the competition over multi-club ownership rules.

On Friday CAS confirmed it has registered individual appeals by both Club León and Club de Fútbol Pachuca (Pachuca) against FIFA over the decision in March to remove Club León saying that Pachuca and Club León breached the Regulations for the FIFA World Cup Club 2025 (Art. 10.1) concerning multiple club ownership.

Mexican clubs Pachuca and Club León both qualified by right but are both owned by the Groupo Pachuca. The ownership conflict was known at FIFA, but with an absence of guidance Grupo Pachuca took steps to put in provisions similar to those in place for UEFA competitions that allow two clubs under the same ownership to play in the competition.

“The Parties are currently exchanging written submissions for these appeals in accordance with the arbitration rules governing CAS procedures. The appeals will be expedited and heard during the week of 5 May 2025,” said CAS. The Club World Cup kicks off June 14 in Miami.

If CAS rules that ultimately FIFA were correct to remove Club León, who fills their slot.

A separate appeal filed at CAS by Costa Rica's Alajuelense in February, claims that they should be given the slot ‘immediately'. Their case is based on an unofficial ranking and that Mexico and the US already have two teams from their nations qualified (a separate rule for the competition qualification).

However, even if Alajuelense were, the next highest ranked team, they would likely not automatically qualify as they have not won that right through the qualifying competitions.

FIFA's competition rules do not provide for the next highest ranked team to qualify in this instance, rather the issue is a matter of ‘exceptional circumstance' which ultimately means that FIFA has the final decision over who will participate if Club León lose their CAS appeal and remain barred from the competition.

In short it looks like Alajuelense's appeal has the look of the old two hopes adage – Bob and No. The club probably knew this when they made their appeal.

So ultimately it looks like FIFA – under the principle of ‘exceptional circumstance' – will have free reign to decide who enters their competition, and like the decision to award the discretionary slot to Inter Miami, it will likely be made on commercial pulling power.

That would include the power to add a third team from either the USA or Mexico. A single winner-take-all play-off between Major League Soccer's (MLS) LAFC and Ligue MX giant Club América, has been mooted.

“FIFA can confirm it is considering a one play-off match between LAFC and Club América for the right to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025,” a FIFA statement read.

Unless, of course, CAS rules that Club León can stay.

This summer, Manchester City and Chelsea will both head to the USA to compete in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

Unlike previous variations of the tournament, the competition has been revamped to include 32 teams from around the world in a format akin to a major international tournament. 

Both Premier League teams will be among the favourites to take home the brand-new trophy, but which English clubs have previously been crowned world champions?

DAZN News runs down the honour list. 

Almost a decade after they turned their back on the FA Cup to compete in the first-ever Club World Cup, Manchester United became the first English winner of the competition by lifting the trophy in Yokohama. 

After earning their spot with 2008's Champions League win over Chelsea, United saw off Gamba Osaka in the semi-final with a comfortable 5-3 win and went on to face Ecuadorian side LDU Quito in the final. 

It was then Wayne Rooney who etched his name into the competition's folklore by netting the only goal of the game to add another trophy to the Sir Alex Ferguson dynasty. 

Cup final winning team: Van der Sar, Rafael (Neville), Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Carrick, Anderson (Fletcher), Ronaldo, Park, Tevez (Evans), Rooney 

Held in the winter and seen as a test event for the upcoming 2022 World Cup, Qatar was the setting for Liverpool's only FIFA World Club Cup win in 2019. 

Their 2019 Champions League win saw them earn their spot in the competition and would defeat Monterrey in the semi-final thanks to a Roberto Firmino winner, which set them up for a final meeting with Flamengo. 

In the showpiece, it was once again Firmino who was the difference, scoring an extra-time winner for Jurgen Klopp's men. 

Cup final winning team: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Djik, Roberton, Keita (Milner), Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain (Lallana), Salah (Shaqiri), Firmino (Origi), Mane

Thomas Tuchel's short reign as Chelsea boss saw two major continental wins - including this FIFA World Club Cup triumph in Abu Dhabi. 

The Blues edged past Saudi champions Al Hial in the semi-final thanks to a Romelu Lukaku goal and it set up a second England vs Brazil finale in three years. 

This time, it was Palmerias, but it was Lukaku again who made his presence known, opening the scoring before Chelsea's Champions League-winning hero Kai Havertz repeated the trick by tucking home a penalty in extra time to seal the victory. 

Cup final winning team: Mendy, Christensen (Ziyech), Silva, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Kovacic (Sarr), Hudson-Odoi (Werner), Mount (Pulisic), Lukaku (Saul), Havertz

Fresh off a season where Manchester City nabbed a historic treble, the silverware continued to reign as they added the FIFA Club World Cup to their list of accolades. 

City made light work of it too, first defeating Urawa Red Diamonds 3-0 in the semi-final before a thumping victory over Brazilian side Fluminense saw them take home the trophy. 

Julian Alvarez scored a brace either side of a Nino own goal and Phil Foden's strike to see Pep Guardiola win the competition for a third time with a third different club.

Benjamin Pavard could play at wingback in tomorrow's Champions League showdown between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.

This according to today's print edition of Rome-based newspaper Corriere dello Sport, via FCInterNews. They report that the Frenchman could fill in if Matteo Darmian doesn't see out the ninety minutes.

Inter Milan will be without wingback Denzel Dumfries against Bayern Munich tomorrow.

And that creates quite a headache for Nerazzurri coach Simone Inzaghi.

Matteo Darmian is available. The veteran former Manchester United and Torino has played all of Inter's last three matches.

However, that has naturally taken quite a toll on Darmian.

The wingback role is a physically demanding one. Therefore, it may be difficult for the 35-year-old to see out yet another ninety minutes after going the distance against Parma over the weekend.

And Matteo Darmian is really the only natural right-wingback in the Inter squad besides Dumfries.

Nicola Zalewski has played there a couple times off the bench.

However, Zalewski has not looked comfortable playing on the right flank.

Therefore, Inter coach Simone Inzaghi had even tested Carlos Augusto in the position in training recently.

However, Augusto could have a different task at left-centre-back or left-wingback tomorrow.

That leaves Inzaghi somewhat short of options, if Darmian reaches his limit.

One would be to move Benjamin Pavard into the attacking wingback role on the 3-5-2 shape.

That is not the Frenchman's natural position. He prefers to play in the back three.

However, Pavard could be the most effective option in the position at a certain stage of tomorrow's match.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — KC2026 revealed the official FIFA World Cup 26 Kansas City host city poster design at Children's Mercy Park Saturday before the Sporting Kansas City vs. St. Louis City SC game.

Designer Jadie Arnett of Kansas City, Missouri, created the winning poster, “Woven Together.” The poster created by Arnett will become a symbol of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Each of the 16 FIFA World Cup 26 host cities will have an official poster showcasing a common love of the game and capturing the unique culture and spirit of the local community.

This is the first time FIFA has introduced a host city-led poster design process. After the final city reveal, FIFA will sell the official host city posters on FIFAWorldCup.com on April 19.   

“What better canvas than the soccer scarves that fans wear to support their teams?” said Arnett. “Missouri and Kansas are woven together in Kansas City just like the knitting of a scarf. As a region, we are one team.” 

The poster design features a soccer scarf that represents both states and tells the FIFA World Cup 26 story in three scenes.

Inspired by the scenes found on ancient Greek ceramic pottery, Arnett saw a link between the spirit of competition at the FIFA World Cup 26 and the athletes portrayed in sports.

The KC2026 poster contest received interest from the arts community throughout Kansas and Missouri, with more than 100 entries. A task force committee of Kansas and Missouri arts, culture and heritage representatives chose five finalists, who were each paired with a mentor from the panel. 

Finalists received $1,000 each and created a poster design that best represented our region and community. KC2026 then submitted the top designs to FIFA for review. 

As the winning designer, Arrnet will receive an additional $10,000 grand prize.

“Arnett's design is a testament to the creativity and talent of our local arts community,” said KC2026 Board of Directors Vice President Neal Sharma. 

“Her artwork captures the spirit of unity and excitement that will permeate our city during the tournament. We are grateful for her contribution and inspired by her vision.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","BBC and ITV ‘won't bid' for UK Fifa Club World Cup TV rights","https://www.sportspro.com/news/bbc-itv-uk-fifa-club-world-cup-dazn-april-2025/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 10:56:46 GMT","

Both the BBC and ITV have reportedly opted not to bid for the UK free-to-air (FTA) broadcast rights to the revamped Fifa Club World Cup in the USA this summer.

Sports streaming service DAZN won the global rights to air Fifa's expanded club tournament as part of a US$1 billion deal that allows it to sublicence some games to FTA broadcasters in individual markets.

While DAZN has struck deals in several territories, including with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and TelevisaUnivision's linear networks in the US, the tournament's host country, there has been no appetite from UK broadcasters so far.

The BBC and ITV share the rights to major international soccer competitions, including the men's and women's Fifa World Cups and Uefa European Championships, however neither is said to be interested in airing Fifa's expanded club tournament.

The Guardian says the public service BBC declined to enter negotiations, believing the proposal to promote DAZN's service was incompatible with its public service obligations, while its commercial rival has only held exploratory conversations with the streamer. Indeed, it was reported that ITV had made an offer to Fifa to show the event for free, promising to elevate the profile and appeal of the competition, before the deal with DAZN was struck.

DAZN is believed to be confident of finding an FTA partner before the tournament, with Channel 4 and Channel 5 potential candidates. Both broadcasters have aired the previous iteration of the Fifa Club World Cup, while Channel 4 has struck deals with Sky Sports and Amazon Prime to air their coverage of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup final and 2021 women's US Open tennis final respectively.

The winners of the Fifa Club World Cup will take home up to US$125 million with participants sharing a total prize pot of US$525 million. Fifa has released a study claiming the event will generate up to US$21.1 billion in global gross domestic product (GDP), including US$9.6 billion in the US, through economic activity, job creation and international visitors.

Speaking at the SportsPro New York event last month, DAZN expressed its hope that the wide variety of participants, a condensed tournament schedule, and lack of competition from other major events would help drive viewership and advertiser interest in the host nation, likening the appeal of the competition to the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) March Madness basketball tournament.  



The lack of interest in the UK rights to the Club World Cup illustrates the challenges Fifa has faced in promoting its new competition and achieving a hugely ambitious revenue target given unproven demand from broadcasters, fans, players and even teams. This is despite the involvement of major clubs and players and the promise of bumper prize money for participants.

DAZN's US$1 billion deal, which followed a US$1 billion investment from the Saudi-backed SURJ, might only represent a fraction of Fifa's US$4 billion target but is still seen as a bold move by the streamer.

DAZN will air the tournament for free, hoping the presence of some of the world's biggest teams and most famous players will attract more registrations to its platform, potentially converting them into full subscribers or drive revenues from betting, merchandise and other services.

The ability to sublicence games to FTA broadcasters will help DAZN recoup some of its costs and drive awareness of its platform, which has a limited footprint in the UK. However, FTA coverage is crucial in driving the legitimacy and prestige of the competition, which Fifa hopes will eventually become a lucrative long-term source of revenue.

This is especially true in the UK, which is a highly developed broadcast market and will be sending two of the Premier League's biggest clubs – Manchester City and Chelsea.

Although it is probable that a UK partner will be secured, coverage on the BBC and ITV, the UK's two most-watched channels, would have been hugely beneficial. Indeed, the BBC's ability to cross-promote across television, radio and digital channels would have been especially valuable.

The new expanded Fifa Club World Cup will take place in the United States from 15 June to 13 July 2025.

Previously an annual tournament contested by the top seven teams, the Club World Cup will now feature 32 teams and occur once every four years.

The tournament once branded a ""mistake"" by ex-Fifa president Sepp Blatter is undergoing a revamp as significant as it is controversial.

Club World Cup draw pairs Man City with Juventus; Chelsea face Flamengo

Teams from each of the six international football confederations will be at the Club World Cup: Asia (AFC), Africa (Caf), North and Central America (Concacaf), South America (Conmebol), Oceania (OFC) and Europe (Uefa).

There are 12 places available for European clubs - the highest quota of the confederations. These places are decided by clubs' Champions League performances over the past four seasons.

That means recent winners Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid have all qualified.

Other European teams have qualified through a Uefa ranking system determined by clubs' performances over the four seasons. Only two clubs per country can qualify, so England's 2022 Champions League finalists Liverpool are not included.

Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg - who will be known as FC Salzburg because of Fifa sponsorship regulations - will be there.

There are four club places each for Asia and Africa, as well as the North and Central America federation.

Six places are awarded to South American clubs, and one to Oceania.

Clubs have accrued points over the most recent four seasons, based on their performances in their continental club competitions.

Group A: Palmeiras, FC Porto, Al Ahly, Inter Miami

Group B: Paris St-Germain, Atletico Madrid, Botafogo, Seattle Sounders

Group C: Bayern Munich, Auckland City, Boca Juniors, Benfica

Group D: Flamengo, Esperance Sportive de Tunisie, Chelsea, Club Leon

Group E: River Plate, Urawa Red Diamonds, Monterrey, Inter Milan

Group F: Fluminense, Borussia Dortmund, Ulsan, Mamelodi Sundowns

Group G: Manchester City, Wydad, Al Ain, Juventus

Group H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal, Pachuca, Salzburg

One spot in the tournament is reserved for a team from the host nation.

Fifa opted to award that place to Inter Miami for winning the 2024 MLS Supporters' Shield, the trophy given out to the team which has the best regular-season record. The Floridians then lost in the MLS play-offs, meaning they are not this season's champions.

The decision to invite Inter Miami to the Club World Cup before the MLS campaign was concluded has been interpreted by some as an attempt on Fifa's part to ensure Lionel Messi, who joined the team in 2023, will play in a tournament that has attracted little public enthusiasm so far.

The revamped Club World Cup will run in a similar way to the international men's and women's World Cup competitions.

The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four, who will play each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams from each group will then go through to the knockout stages.

Unlike the international World Cups, the Club World Cup will have no third-place play-off.

The final will take place on 13 July 2025.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

Clubs will take home a set figure for each round:

Group Stages: £1.5m for a win / £800k for a draw

Round of 16: £5.8m

Quarter-Final: £10.1m

Semi-Final: £16.2m

Finalist: £23.2m

Winner: £30.0m

Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria.

European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents. The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

All matches will be held in the United States, a year before the country co-hosts the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico.

Fixtures are set to be played in 12 different stadiums.

Atlanta, Mercedes-Benz Stadium

Charlotte, TQL Stadium

Cincinnati, Bank of America Stadium

Los Angeles, Rose Bowl Stadium

Miami, Hard Rock Stadium

Nashville, GEODIS Park

New Jersey, MetLife Stadium

Orlando, Camping World Stadium

Orlando, Inter&Co Stadium

Philadelphia, Lincoln Financial Field

Seattle, Lumen Field

Washington DC, Audi Field

The opening match will be held in Miami, and the final is scheduled for New Jersey.

Streaming platform DAZN has secured exclusive rights and will show all 63 matches free to view on on its platforms, and there is also potential for it to sublicense rights to local free-to-air broadcasters.

Fifa is currently facing legal action from player unions and leagues about the scheduling of the tournament.

Global players' union Fifpro and the top European Leagues say the international football calendar is ""oversaturated"" and ""risks player safety and wellbeing"".

Several players - including Liverpool's Alisson Becker and Manchester City's Rodri - have raised concerns about player wellbeing amid an increasingly jam-packed football calendar.

There are just five weeks between the Club World Cup final and the first Premier League match of the 2025-2026 season, which is scheduled for 16 August.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has already requested a late start to the Premier League season for his team, while City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne told reporters: ""The issue is that Uefa and Fifa keep adding extra matches, and we can raise concerns but no solutions have been found. It seems that money speaks louder than the players' voices.""

A Fifa spokesperson BBC Sport: ""The Fifa Club World Cup is not responsible for calendar congestion. It is a competitive tournament that takes place once every four years and, as independent studies have verified, Fifa is only responsible for a small percentage of matches per season.

""Fifa cares about the welfare of the players. Following a decision taken earlier this year, Fifa is formalising the Task Force on Player Welfare, headed by Arsene Wenger, to promote further global dialogue on player welfare issues with key stakeholders across football.""

The Club World Cup will partially overlap with Women's Euro 2025, which runs from 2-27 July.

BBC Sport asked Fifa to justify this scheduling clash and whether there were concerns about the Women's Euro competing with the Club World Cup for attention.

A Fifa spokesperson told BBC Sport: ""The international match calendar for 2025-2030 was approved by the Fifa Council in 2023, which is made up of members from each of the six confederations, including Uefa.

""While Fifa accepts that both the men's and women's international match calendars are constrained by obvious limitations, this was deemed to be the most balanced solution.

""It is also important to note that given the time difference between Switzerland [host of Uefa Women's Euro 2025] and the United States [where the Fifa Club World Cup will take place], the number of matches where a potential clash could take place will be fewer.""

≡ THE 5-RING CIRCUS ≡

● Olympic Games 2028: Los Angeles ● Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt has asked the City Council to approve a $34.6 million guarantee to the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games organizing committee in order to host the slalom canoeing and softball events.

The motion is scheduled for Tuesday, with the cost calculated by a projection of the amount it would take to relocate the events to the Los Angeles area in case of an Oklahoma City default.

Holt told The Oklahoman, “It's not a check we expect to write out.

“From their perspective, we've committed to do this. They committed to the [International Olympic Committee] these events will happen. They are relying on us to keep the commitment they made.”

¶

Los Angeles City 15th District Council member Tim McOsker continued his rage against the LA28 organizers, trying to get the sailing competition moved from Long Beach to San Pedro, filing two more motions on Friday to compel reports from LA28 on commitments made in the November 2021 Games Agreement with the City.

One asks for a report in seven days by City staff on the current status of the “LA28 Community Business and Procurement Program and the Local Hire Program” and the other for a City staff report – in seven days – on the LA28 “Impact and Sustainability Plan.”

Both motions were referred to the City's Ad Hoc Committee on the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games; the first motion was also referred to the Economic Development and Jobs Committee.

● Football ● On Thursday, FIFA announced a special ticket offer, tying purchases – and attendance – at FIFA Club World Cup matches this summer for tickets at the FIFA World Cup in 2026:

“This package involves one ticket per match to two FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches, with the option to add one ticket to a third match at an additional cost. The purchaser of a Ticket Pack who uses all tickets to attend all matches included in their Ticket Pack will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final).”

This is available for 25 days (from 3 April), or until the allocation runs out. There is also a “Super Ticket Pack:”

“A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enjoy the groundbreaking FIFA Club World Cup 2025, this package features one ticket per match to 20 FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches, which must include a semi-final and either the opening match or the final. The purchaser of a Super Ticket Pack who uses all tickets to attend all matches included in their Super Ticket Pack will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket for the eagerly anticipated FIFA World Cup 26 final.”

The Club World Cup kicks off on 14 June in Miami, Florida, with the final on 13 July in New Jersey.

● Gymnastics ● A total of 14 Russian artistic gymnasts received neutral status from the Federation Internationale de Gymnastique to compete in FIG World Cup events, but decided not compete. According to the Russian Gymnastics Federation:

“All Russian athletes representing artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, who have received neutral status, have decided to refrain from participating in the upcoming competitions under the auspices of the International Gymnastics Federation. The reason for this decision is the numerous unfounded and biased refusals by the FIG special committee to allow our gymnasts to compete.”

According to the Russian news agency TASS:

“[T]he FIG refused to grant neutral status to some athletes from Russia due to the posting of a congratulatory message on social networks for Victory Day, the athletes' participation in a gala concert for Defender of the Fatherland Day, during which the St. George ribbon was used and photographs were taken with children in military uniform.

“Another reason for the refusal was the athlete's subscription to a group on a social network where an announcement of the V All-Russian Anti-Doping Dictation, dedicated to the Physical Culture Day, was posted. The experts of the special FIG committee took the number V for one of the symbols of the SVO [Ukrainian invasion].”

● Skateboarding ● The Italian news agency ANSA reported that World Skate will impose a minimum age limit on athletes at the 2028 Olympic Games of 14, to be achieved by the end of the year (meaning 13-year-olds could compete in Los Angeles).

Athletes as young as 11 – China's Haohao Zhang – competed in Paris in 2024; an age limit of 12 will be installed for the Youth Olympic Games.

≡ RESULTS ≡

● Athletics ● At the USATF National 10-mile Championships in Washington, D.C., held in conjunction with the annual Cherry Blossom 10, with former Oklahoma State All-American Taylor Roe backing up her win in the USATF Half Marathon champs in March with two American Records.

She surged away from the field after a couple of miles and won going away in a U.S. record of 49:53, destroying Molly Huddle's 2018 mark of 50:52. Emma Grace Hurley was a distance second in 51:04 and Fiona O'Keeffe was third in 51:49.

Along the way, Roe passed 10 km in 30:56, four seconds off Shalane Flanagan's 2016 best, but got a U.S. women's-only record, ahead of Weini Kelati's 31:18 in 2021. Roe also grabbed the American Record for 15 km at 46:24, slashing Kelati's 46:32 from earlier in 2025.

The men's race was won by U.S.-British dual citizen Charles Hicks in 45:14, with a final sprint to beat USATF Half Marathon champ Alex Maier (45:15) and Biya Simbassa (45:23). Maier claimed the American Record, one second better than Conner Mantz's en route time during the Houston Half Marathon earlier this year.

● Curling ● Olympic silver medalist Bruce Mouat's Scottish rink claimed their second World Curling Men's World Championships in the last three editions in Moose Jaw (CAN) on Sunday.

Canadian star Brad Jacobs, the 2014 Olympic winner, had his rink at the top of the round-robin after an 11-1 record, ahead of the Swiss (9-3) and then China, Sweden and Scotland at 8-4.

In the playoffs, Mouat's Scots dispensed with Canada's Jacobs in the semis, 7-4, and Swiss Yannick Schwaller's rink dumped China, 7-3. That set up the final, with the Swiss leading, 1-0, through four ends, but Mouat coming up with two in the fifth, only to see Schwaller match in the sixth. The Scots scored twice more in the seventh, but the Swiss tied it at 4-4 in the eighth.

Finally, a score in the 10th gave Mouat and Scotland a 5-4 win and the title, their seventh in history and the second for Mouat, who won with the same team as in 2023: Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie, Hammy McMillan Jr. and Kyle Waddell.

Canada and Jacobs won the third-place game, 11-2, over China (Xiaoming Xu). The U.S., with Korey Dropkin as skip, finished 4-8, in 11th.

● Cycling ● The great Tadej Pogacar (SLO) did it again, riding away with another major race win, this time at the 109th Ronde van Vlaanderen – the Tour of Flanders – attacking with 18 km to go and winning over the 268.9 km course in 5:58:41.

That was 1:01 better than Mads Pedersen (DEN) and Mathieu van der Poel (NED), who ended up 2-3, with Wout van Aert (BEL) in fourth, with the same time. It's Pogacar's second win in this race, also in 2023.

The women's race was won by home favorite Lotte Kopecky, winning a final sprint of four riders at the end of the 168.9 km track, in 4:24:34. She was just better than Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (FRA) and Liane Lippert (GER), both with the same time, and a second up on Kasia Niewiadoma (POL). It was the third win in this race for Kopecky, who took it in 2022 and 2023.

● Football ● The USA women met Brazil in a friendly at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California on Saturday, in a re-match of last summer's Olympic final won by the U.S., but with a more emphatic outcome.

The Americans were on offense from the start, with immediate pressure. Midfielder Alyssa Thompson quickly found space, dribbling into the middle of the field and sent a lead pass to a cutting forward Trinity Rodman in front of the goal and she sent a right-footed toe-tap into the right side of the Brazilian goal at the five-minute mark. It was Rodman's first game since the Olympic final against Brazil in Paris last year, thanks to a back injury.

Thompson almost got a goal herself in the 17th, as her shot from the top of the box toward the far right side of the Brazilian goal was saved by keeper Lorena. The U.S. had more chances, from forward Ally Sentnor (18th) and Rodman (22nd), but Lorena was equal to those challenges.

Brazil had chances too, with striker Amanda Gutierres challenging U.S. keeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the 30th, but Tullis-Joyce handled it; she stayed busy throughout the half. Possession was 50-50 in the half, but Brazil ended with a 9-6 edge on shots.

The U.S. came out with more control in mind in the second half, but Brazilian midfielder Ludmila hit the U.S. goal post with a shot in the first minute. Brazil got off three more shots on Tullis-Joyce by the 62nd minute before the U.S. offense got going, and in the 66th, Ludmila tackled Lily Yohannes in the box for a penalty.

Midfield star Lindsey Heaps calmly shutter-stepped, then a right-footed smash (barely) into the left side of the Brazilian net for the decisive 2-0 lead. From that point, the U.S. maintained most of the control and the game finished at 2-0.

With better possession on the ball in the second half, the Americans finished with 55% of the ball and had 16 shots to 15 for the visitors. They will meet again on Tuesday in San Jose, California.

● Gymnastics ● At the FIG Rhythmic World Cup in Sofia (BUL), Ukraine's Paris Olympic ninth-placer Taisila Onofriichuk took the All-Around, scoring 114.450 across two rounds, ahead of Bulgaria's six-time Worlds medal winner Stiliana Nikolova (110.65) and Uzbek Takhmina Ikromova (109.850). Rin Keys and Megan Chu were the American entries, in sixth (107.000) and eighth (106.500).

In the apparatus finals, Nikolova won on Ball (28.950) and Hoop (29.500) and Onofriichuk took the wins in Clubs (28.900) and Ribbon (27.450).

● Rugby Sevens ● At the Rugby Sevens Series in Singapore, a surprise in the men's final and more of the same for the women.

The men's pool winners were Argentina, Kenya, Spain and Fiji, and Fiji and Kenya romped into the final, with Fiji winning its second tournament of the season, 21-12 in the final. Argentina defeated Spain, 33-14, for third. That leaves Argentina still on top of the standings, heading to the Grand Final in Carson, California, with 114 points to 96 for Fiji and 88 for Spain. The U.S. finished 12th and did not advance to the Grand Final.

In women's play, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and France all went 2-0 to win their pools. Then the Black Ferns stormed through the playoffs, winning their games by 40-14 over France and then 31-7 against Australia to win their third tournament in a row. Canada beat France, 21-5, for third.

Jenson Brooksby captured his maiden ATP title at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Sunday with a stunning win over 2023 champion Frances Tiafoe to cap off a superb tournament that he began as a wild card in the qualifying rounds.

Victory was all the more sweet for the 24-year-old American, who had lost a big chunk of his career because of a suspension for missing drug tests and two wrist surgeries in 2023.

""It means the world,"" Brooksby said after his 6-4, 6-2 win over second-seeded Tiafoe.

""It was one of my biggest goals ever since I have been a professional tennis player. It means a lot to have my first one. It's probably the best week of my life.""

Having come into the tournament at No. 507 following the major disruptions to his career, Brooksby also became the third-lowest-ranked champion in the tour's history since 1990.

He was hit with an 18-month suspension in October 2023 for three ""whereabouts failures"" in a 12-month span but had the suspension reduced to 13 months on appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport after disputing the second missed test.

Hampered by injuries during and after the suspension, he finally made his return to tennis at the Australian Open earlier this year and lost to compatriot Taylor Fritz in the first round.

Brooksby persevered and saved multiple match points in three of his matches to prevail in Houston.

""I've had a lot of different life adversity, whether it's on the court or off the court,"" Brooksby said.

""So I think it makes these situations ... like, I still get nervous about them and somewhat tense for sure, but it gives you a different perspective once you've had to face other difficult things in life.

""I'm just someone who hates to lose and loves to win in general -- obviously tennis being most important, but even in other games, and that's just how I'm wired as a person.

""I just really love winning, so that transfers over into when I'm in tough positions and maybe you should lose in those situations, that I'm able to at least find a way out of it.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

As the ATP Tour embarked on the clay season, the Italian players certainly didn't waste any time proving their skills on the surface as Fabio Cobolli and Luciano Darderi claimed all the honors in tournaments in Bucharest and Marrakech respectively.

Flavio Cobolli completed a remarkable turnaround week in an otherwise very difficult 2025 season to claim his first ATP Tour title on Sunday at the Tiriac Open in the Romanian capital. Cobolli got the better of Sebastian Baez, winning 6-4, 6-4 to complete a dream title run at the clay-court ATP 250 tournament.

Cobolli's triumph in Bucharest marked a stunning turnaround of the season for the Italian, who otherwise arrived in Bucharest on the back of an eight-match tour-level losing streak.

Despite losing the final, Baez could take heart from another deep run on clay in 2025. Baez has won more tour-level matches (79) on the surface since the start of the 2022 season than any other player.

Another Italian who arrived with a poor record before a tournament was Luciano Darderi who came to Marrakech with a 2-8 tour-level record for the season. But Darderi dropped just one set throughout the tournament and claimed his second ATP Tour crown by defeating top seed Tallon Griekspoor 7-6(3), 7-6(4) in the championship final.

On the women's WTA Tour, Jessica Pegula is enjoying a superb season, and it got even better on Sunday when she won the first clay tournament of her career by beating fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-3, 7-5 to capture the Credit One Charleston Open title. Pegula has now won 17 of her last 19 matches, and recorded her 25th win of the season against Kenin. She will overtake Coco Gauff as the top-ranked U.S. player, and rise to a career-high World No. 3.

A big question on the Women's WTA Tour is if we will ever see Greek contender Maria Sakkari back to her best. The former World No 3 had a dreadful past season struggling with mental fatigue and endured a frustrating year, with early Grand Slam exits and extended losing streaks before a shoulder injury ended her season prematurely when she was forced to retire in the first round of the US Open against Wang Yafan.

""The pressure, it was a lot, being constantly chased and having to prove something to everyone,"" Sakkari told WTA Insider. She has already suffered comprehensive defeats this year against Coco Gauff and Iga Swiatek.

At Charleston, where she reached the semi-final last year, it did not mark a turnaround for Sakkari, who crashed out of the tournament already in the second round where she lost to the Olympic champion, Qinwen Zheng, 6-4, 6-1.

On the Men's circuit, Kazakhstan's 24-year-old Alexander Shevchenko, who made his ATP debut at the 2022 Generali Open in Kitzbühel, is struggling to find the form which in February last year catapulted him into No 45 in the world rankings, his best ranking ever.

Shevchenko struggled for form over the back half of 2024 and was unable to defend the points he had earned in Basel (did not play) and Metz (first-round loss), thus finishing as World No. 78. His record in 2025 is 4-7 and he also looked out of sorts in Marrakech where he lost in two sets to the Austrian Filip Misolic in the second round. He has now dropped to 106 in the rankings. 

It's unusual you bring a dog to a winning ceremony. Nevertheless, that was the case when Jessica Pegula celebrated her first title in the clay-tournament in Charleston by holding on to her dog Maddie, a miniature Australian shepherd, when she presented the trophy. 

Pegula and her husband, Taylor Gahagen, actually brought all of their three dogs to the tournament, and she apparently tries to bring her dogs to all of her tournaments when it is possible. 

In fact, Pegula's devotion is so profound that it's permanently inked on her skin. Among her collection of tattoos, one stands out—a delicate paw print. This isn't just any tattoo; it's a tribute to her furry companions. 

Pegula's passion for dogs extends beyond her personal life into her philanthropic efforts. She and her husband, Taylor Gahagen, who share a deep love for dogs, run a charity called *A Lending Paw*. The foundation's mission is to train rescue dogs to become service animals, thus supporting both dogs and people in need. 

Jenson Brooksby captured his maiden ATP title at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship on Sunday with a stunning win over 2023 champion Frances Tiafoe to cap off a superb tournament that he began as a wild card in the qualifying rounds. The American also came out on top in a breathtaking rally against Tiafoe, when he under intense pressure fired a double-handed backhand winner down the line. 

Veteran Richard Gasquet beat Matteo Arnaldi 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 on Sunday to reach the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters, but the Italian had the better of Gasquet in this duel, when he, seemingly having lost the point, scraped an incredible forehand winner past the discouraged Gasquet. 

The Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006, is the first of three ATP Masters 1000 tournaments played on clay.

The tournament has always been a favorite for players and fans due to its magnificent location at the Monte-Carlo Country Club. 

Spain's Rafael Nadal is the ultimate king of the tournament, having won 11 titles at the event, including an Open-Era record eight successive titles between 2005-2012.

Women's tennis will, for the upcoming week, be dominated by the Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers, which takes players across six countries, three continents and three different surfaces.

Carlos Alcaraz is now in the zone for the clay court season, with the Monte-Carlo Masters up first for the Spaniard.

Alcaraz can impress on clay this season, in what is the first such season since 2002 without his compatriot and legendary figure Rafael Nadal.

The former has been handed a bye in the first round of the Monte-Carlo Masters, with Fabio Fognini or Francisco Cerundolo up in round two.

WTA star Paula Badosa loves watching Alcaraz, but the ATP number three fell to David Goffin in his first match at the Miami Open.

Elsewhere in the Sunshine Double, Alcaraz lost in the Indian Wells semi-finals to eventual champion Jack Draper.

He has now shared a verdict on his season so far, which includes one title at the Rotterdam Open, with Alcaraz saying: “I am really happy with the way I am playing.

“Since I started the year I have been playing great tennis. Tennis is not just about hitting the ball. It is about more than that. It is about mentality, physical side.

“With my game I am really happy about it. If I don't win it doesn't matter if I play well or not. People are not thinking about the opponent, they are just thinking about me.

“If I lose something is going on people say. I don't think that is fair. I am just happy and ready to play well on clay.

“A lot of people might have said we should have played better tennis or won more tournaments but I don't think that is fair.

“I think the draw in every tournament is very open and a lot of players are playing good tennis and they deserve to be there.

“There are so many players who play well on clay and on all surfaces. In the clay season I think it is going to be interesting. I see a lot of players who are capable of doing great things on clay.

“I am really happy to be here. It is a tournament I have only played [once]. I want to come here and play great. I am really excited about practising here and getting ready for my first match.”

It is not Alcaraz but Nadal that has dominated the Monte-Carlo Masters over the years, with his 11 titles more than any other player.

Alcaraz meanwhile boasts 17 ATP titles throughout his stunning career so far, eight of those have arrived on clay.

In the summer of 2004, Anastasia Myskina lifted the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen and made history. By winning Roland Garros, she became the first Russian woman to claim a Grand Slam singles title. This milestone would open the floodgates for a new generation of talent from her country, including players like Maria Sharapova. But while others went on to global stardom, Myskina's time at the top was surprisingly brief.

Known for her quick footwork, aggressive baseline play, and feisty demeanor on court, Myskina started her pro career in 1999. By 2003, she cracked the top 10 and was seen as one of the leaders of a growing Russian movement in women's tennis.

However, when she arrived in Paris for the French Open in 2004, she was far from being considered the favorite to win the title. In her previous 16 Grand Slam appearances, she hadn't reached the last eight. However, in a formidable run, she defeated her compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in a tough match in the semifinals, before facing another Russian, Elena Dementieva, in the big final.

“I can't believe it!” she expressed after the final, after she made history. That year, she helped Russia secure its first Fed Cup title and reached the semifinals in the Olympic games. That season, she reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2. It was a successful season all around, and she was named, alongside Roger Federer, singles World champion by the ITF.

What followed her breakout year was a puzzling decline. In 2005, she suffered from a shoulder injury in Charleston, as well as off-court pressures, such as her mother being diagnosed with cancer, according to ESPN.

When it came to defending her French Open title, she became the first champion to lose in the opening round, after being defeated by Spain's Maria Sanchez Lorenzo 6-4, 4-6, 6-0. It was just one of many disappointing results, and she ended the season outside of the Top 10 for the first time in three years.

She later acknowledged how deeply this affected her ability and motivation to compete at the highest level. “I just have no confidence. I hit the ball and it just goes off the court… I have no explanation, really… no. Right now when the ball comes to me I just don't know what to do,” she told the press after being eliminated from the French Open, crying (via CNN).

The following year, she was attempting a comeback. “I give one more chance to myself this year to do well, and I have a goal,” she told the press in 2006, cited by ESPN. However, she suffered from a foot injury and couldn't make an impact.

By 2007, at just 25 years old, Myskina played her last match but never announced an official retirement. There was no farewell tour, no major announcement. One of the sport's most significant champions simply faded from view. In total, she won 10 WTA titles and $5.6 million in prize money. 

Since retiring, Myskina has kept a low profile. She has worked occasionally in tennis commentary for Russian television and has been involved in some coaching, as well as Fed Cup captain, and ambassadorial roles. But mostly, she has focused on her personal life, including raising her three sons.

“It's a very tough job, but you learn how to understand the needs and wants of a child. You know how to help them,” she said about motherhood to Indian Express in 2018. “You become patient and that always helps you deal with the problems a player goes through. The only thing is that you can help them only when they are off court.”

Still, her legacy remains. Myskina's win at Roland Garros signaled the arrival of Russian women's tennis on the global stage. Within a few years, Maria Sharapova, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Dinara Safina would all reach Grand Slam finals — with several winning titles of their own.

“Sometimes I think seven years was not enough, but they were a good seven years,” Myskina told Indian Express. However, she also acknowledged that she wasn't considering any comebacks.

In many ways, Anastasia Myskina's story runs counter to what we expect from champions. She didn't chase every record or extend her career for longevity's sake. She won big, then walked away. But for those who remember 2004 and her place in Russia's tennis tradition, Myskina's place in history is secure.

In the storied history of the French Open, several legends have left their mark at Roland Garros. Max Decugis dominated the pre-Open Era, winning eight French Championships, a tournament that was then exclusive to French club members. Then we have Suzanne Lenglen, who also excelled in that period, claiming six titles. Just when you think it couldn't be topped, in the Open Era, Chris Evert emerged as the most successful woman. She secured seven French Open singles titles that stood the test of time until Rafael Nadal broke the record in 2013. Nadal eventually retired with an astonishing 14 French Open titles, and while many would think that record is safe forever, Jessica Pegula disagrees.

On Saturday, Pegula clinched her second title of the 2025 season at the Charleston Open. In an exciting all-American match against the 2020 Australian Open champion, Sofia Kenin, the 31-year-old triumphed with a 6-3, 7-5 victory. This win bumped her up to the No.3 position in WTA rankings, a feat she last achieved in October 2022. But this time, she's surpassed Coco Gauff as the new American No.1.

Following the match, Pegula sat down with Tennis Channel and spoke about her Charleston Open run. However, they took a detour from tennis to discuss a recent feat made by NHL's Alex Ovechkin, who surpassed Wayne Gretzky to become the NHL's all-time leader in goals by scoring his 895th in a 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Sunday! This prompted the interviewer to wonder: Does Jessica think someone could “break Rafa's record one day” of 14 French Open titles?

Well, Jess definitely holds out hope for it! She said, “Hey, you never know. Honestly, we always say ‘never say never.' I mean, we always think records aren't supposed to be broken, but they're meant to be broken. So, it's really cool.” And it's a possibility! We have seen records that seemed impossible to break being broken before.

For instance, Novak Djokovic's impressive 428 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 overthrew Roger's 310 weeks, demonstrating his enduring excellence alongside his 24 Grand Slam singles titles, matching Margaret Court's record. While no one has come close to Rafael Nadal's record at Roland Garros yet, a few have made big strides in this Grand Slam.

Iga Swiatek has been proving her dominance on the clay court. She is the first Pole to win a major singles title and has won four titles at the Roland Garros (2024, 2023, 2022, 2020). Alongside her 2022 US Open win, she doesn't need to prove further that she's certainly in the running to break a few records.

Coming back to Jessica, the Charleston final was her fourth appearance in the finals this season. It also marked the first all-American final in Charleston in 35 years – a feat Pegula recognized as the rise of American tennis.

Is the American tennis scene poised for a new era of dominance with Pegula at the helm?

Debate

On Saturday in the Round of 4 at the Charleston Open, Jessica Pegula beat Ekaterina Alexandrova in a thrilling match that saw her come back from a second-set loss to win 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. This victory marked her second consecutive final, after Miami, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka.

As Pegula advanced to the final in Charleston, she couldn't help but feel thrilled about facing fellow American Sofia Kenin. This all-American showdown marked the first in a Charleston final since 1990, when Martina Navratilova (who became a US citizen in 1981 took down Jennifer Capriati.

Speaking to Tennis Channel post her semifinal match, Pegula exclaimed, “That's awesome. It just shows the depth that the Americans have right now, especially on the women's side. There are so many of us, it's annoying almost!”

She's right; the American women's tennis scene is buzzing with talent. Madison Keys, for instance, won her first Grand Slam title this year, marking a significant milestone in her career. Before that, Coco Gauff made history by winning the 2023 U.S. Open at just 19 years old. Pegula is proud to be part of this dynamic group, noting, “There's just every week there's someone to root for because there's usually somebody doing good, and I'm just happy I get to be part of it.”

American tennis once dominated the sport. Navratilova's nine Wimbledon crowns stand as a testament to her grass-court supremacy, while Bill Tilden's seven US Championships titles remain unmatched by any American man. Then, there's Pete Sampras, with 14 Grand Slams under his belt, while Chris Evert's seven French Open titles remain a benchmark for American women. Not to forget, Serena Williams, with 23 Grand Slams, is the epitome of success.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","French Opens seedings","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/french-open-seedings-novak-djokovic-rankings-breakthrough-carlos-alcaraz","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 14:41:57 GMT","

The clay court season has moved into top gear with the start of the Monte-Carlos Masters, but who will be the kings of clay for 2025?

This compelling phase of the tennis year will conclude with the French Open in Paris at the start of June, but so many stories will be written between now and then.

The ATP 1000 events in Madrid and Rome will dominate the build-up to the second Grand Slam of 2025, with the seedings for that major in Paris potentially playing a big role in the final outcome.

Here is our prediction for the top eight seeds at the French Open:

1. Jannik Sinner

Currently serving a three-month suspension for a doping violation, Sinner is set to return in front of his Italian fans at the Rome Masters next month.

His lead at the top of the ATP Rankings has not been impacted by his absence from the game, with nearest rivals Alexander Zverev and Carls Alcaraz failing to eat into his rankings lead over the last few weeks.

2. Carlos Alcaraz

The Spanish star admitted he was struggling with his focus as he crashed out of the Miami Open in his opening match against David Goffin, but he has a huge chance to climb back up to No 2 in the ATP Rankings ahead of the French Open.

Alcaraz is defending French Open champion and at home on clay courts, so he will fancy his chances of making progress in Monte-Carlo, Madrid and Rome and he has limited ranking points to defend after injury worries at this time last year.

3. Alexander Zverev

The German big-hitter has 2,550 ranking points to defend in this clay court season from 2024, with most of them coming from his win at the Rome Masters and a run to the French Open final last year.

Zverev has to be worried about his form heading into this clay court season as he struggled on the surface in tournaments in South America and was then below his best at the Indian Wells and Miami tournaments. He needs to find his form quickly to avoid losing the No 2 ranking he currently holds.

4. Novak Djokovic

With Djokovic playing more tournaments in 2025, he has a great chance to get back into the top four of the rankings in time for the French Open and Wimbledon.

That could be crucial to his ambitions of winning a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title, as it could ensure he would avoid a meeting with Sinner or Alcaraz until the semi-finals.

5. Jack Draper

Indian Wells champion Draper is up to No 6 in the ATP Rankings this week, which is a new career high.

He has limited points to defend on clay over the next few weeks and while it may be his least favourite surface, Draper is a big presence in the top 10 of the men's game and he has a chance to get into the top 5 in time for the French Open.

6. Taylor Fritz

The current world No 4 has a solid 2024 season on clay, reaching the final in an ATP 500 event in Munich and the semi-final of the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Madrid.

He also reached the last eight in Rome and that means he has to match those efforts on his least favourite surface to stay in the top four. Given his recent form, that looks unlikely.

7. Caper Ruud

Last year's Barcelona Open champion has plenty of points to defend from the 2024 clay court swing, but he is a class act on this surface.

His ability to get the ball back into court on the red clay makes him a tough opponent to beat and he could be in the top eight by the time we get to Roland Garros.

8. Alex de Minaur

The Australian may not be at home on clay, but Stefanos Tsitsipas and Andrey Rublev will be dropping plenty of ranking points off their records after ATP 1000 wins on clay last year and that should open a door for De Minaur to step into the top eight for the French Open.

He is a stronger player than he was a year ago and should be able to adapt to clay.

Jessica Pegula's Meteoric Rise and the American Tennis Revolution

In the realm of tennis history, where legends like Max Decugis, Suzanne Lenglen, and Chris Evert once reigned supreme, a new star is on the horizon – Jessica Pegula. Fresh off her victory at the Charleston Open, where she outshined the competition and secured her second title of the 2025 season, Pegula is making waves in the tennis world.

Defeating top players like Sofia Kenin, Pegula has now climbed to the No.3 ranking, surpassing fellow American Coco Gauff as the new American No.1. With her sights set on even greater achievements, Pegula is not just aiming for the stars; she's reaching for the heavens.

In a recent interview, Pegula reflected on the possibility of breaking records, particularly Rafael Nadal's astounding 14 French Open titles. With a glint of determination in her eyes, she remarked, “Hey, you never know. Honestly, we always say ‘never say never.' I mean, we always think records aren't supposed to be broken, but they're meant to be broken. So, it's really cool.”

While Nadal's legacy at Roland Garros may seem insurmountable, history has shown that records are made to be shattered. Just look at Novak Djokovic's 428 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 or Iga Swiatek's dominance on the clay court with four French Open titles under her belt.

But Pegula's success is not just about her individual achievements; it's also a testament to the resurgence of American tennis. With players like Madison Keys and Coco Gauff making their mark on the international stage, the American tennis scene is ablaze with talent and potential.

As Pegula gears up for more challenges on the court, the question lingers – will she be the one to break barriers and set new records in the world of tennis? The stage is set, the competition is fierce, and Jessica Pegula is ready to carve her name into the annals of tennis history.

Comedian Andy Hamilton was one of the key figures taking part in Save Wimbledon Park's held their sixth public meeting in opposition to the mammoth proposed development of the former Wimbledon Park golf club.

The All England Tennis Club (AELTC) submitted ground-breaking expansion plans, which were approved by Merton council and rejected by Wandsworth council.

The GLA were asked to rule, and they passed the plans. That decision is now the subject of a Judicial Review, launched by Save Wimbledon Park earlier this year. The estimated legal costs of bringing such a challenge are £200k, for which a crowdjustice funding appeal is currently underway.

A capacity crowd at St Barnabas Church in Southfields, heard legal and environmental presentations about the nature of the judicial challenge and the impact to the area if it all goes ahead.

Special guest and local resident Andy Hamilton (A Have I Got News For You regular) gave an impassioned speech on the importance of green open spaces under threat.

Mr Hamilton said: “It's important that the community win this battle to stop the AELTC swallowing up valued green spaces in order to build an industrial scale tennis complex.”

Save Wimbledon Park say AELTC were invited but did not attend, with their place on the stage was taken by a tennis racquet bearing their name.

Meeting organiser Simon Wright said “Another sell-out meeting indicates the strength of local feeling that these are the wrong plans for Wimbledon Park.

“During the Q&A session, the audience made it very clear that they do not want 39 practice courts, vast maintenance hubs, concrete driveways and a stadium the size of the Royal Albert Hall to be built in Wimbledon Park.”

Among those speaking out against the planned expansion was Thelma Ruby, who said: “I am 100 year old actress, living overlooking Wimbledon Common golf course. I am appalled by the Wimbledon tennis plan to ruin my life by chopping down hundreds of precious trees and turning a glorious heritage landscape into a polluting building site.

“If I have to see the desecration of my view and polluting lorries passing my door every 10 minutes and hear chain saws cutting down the trees I love instead of the sound of birds and Canada geese, I would rather not be alive. I am prepared to chain myself to a tree to save it.”

School boy Gabriel, nine, of Bishop Gilpin Primary School, said: “I think the AELTC planning is a terrible idea. A few months ago I started a petition to save the trees in Wimbledon Park.  My friends and I spoke to the whole school, and put posters up, I have over 100 signatures.

“My petition is about the trees and wildlife because I care about the environment.  I also love tennis I even play every week at the Wimbledon Club, but I would rather keep the trees and quit tennis if it helped.  I think it is important to protect these trees at all costs.”

Matt Birch, headteacher at Bishop Gilpin Primary School said: ” Gabriel has devoted himself to ensuring that the school community knows and understands the Save Wimbledon Park campaign.

“Gabriel has worked tenaciously in his own time to share the message and has demonstrated his true belief in the cause and we are very proud of him.”

Allies and Morrison has unveiled plans to modernise Henman Hill, the grass slope at Wimbledon, where tennis fans can watch matches on a big screen

The plans for the All England Lawn Tennis Club will be carried out after next year's Wimbledon Championships, ready for the 150th anniversary of the tournament in 2027.

The practice plans to reduce the hill's gradient of the hill through the introduction of low retaining walls, increasing seating capacity by 20 per cent and optimising views of the No 1 Court screen. 

Replacement pathways made from permeable material have been designed to improve accessibility, while a new pergola at the top of the hill will provide punters with cover from sun and rain. 

The scheme, which has been designed with landscape architect LUC, will also increase biodiversity, with the All England Club promising ‘a stunning new floral display on the uppermost tier of the hill'. 

The plans are separate from Allies and Morrison's £200 million proposal to treble the size of Wimbledon's grounds, adding 39 courts and an 8,000-seat show court on a former golf course. 

The expansion was approved by the Mayor of London in September, despite hundreds of objections and 21,000 people signing a petition against it. Critics say green metropolitan open land should not be built on, adding that the scheme would impact a Grade II*-listed garden.

The expansion plans are now set to be heard at a judicial review in July, which is brought by campaign group Save Wimbledon Park.

Speaking about the plans for Henman Hill, Deborah Jevans, chair of the All England Club, commented: ‘The redevelopment of our world-famous hill, in time for the championships 2027, will allow even more tennis fans to enjoy its unique atmosphere and vantage point.

‘I am particularly pleased that these plans will increase the accessibility of the hill for our guests using wheelchairs or who have additional accessibility requirements.'

A consultation about the plans for the local residents will take place on Thursday 10 April, before a planning application is submitted to the London Borough of Merton. 

Allies and Morrison has been contacted for comment.

“Tennis is broken. Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent,” said PTPA's executive director Ahmad Nassar last month. The Novak Djokovic-led Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) had just filed a major lawsuit. Their target? The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA. One of the issues at hand is pay disparity. That move sent waves through tennis. Now, top stars like Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka, Novak Djoković, and more are speaking up, asking Grand Slams to increase their share of revenue. Jessica Pegula, the new World No. 3, is among them. What did she say?

Let's talk money. The Grand Slams do shell out big bucks, but how much exactly? The US Open in 2024 had the richest prize pot in tennis history at $75 million—a 15% jump from the previous year. Wimbledon wasn't far behind, handing out $65 million. The Australian Open saw a 12% rise, reaching nearly $60 million. The French Open followed closely, offering around $59 million—up 7.8% from 2023.

Transitioning from numbers to action, L'Equipe first reported that a letter demanding a major revenue share increase was sent to the heads of all four Slams—Craig Tiley (AO), Stephane Morel (French Open), Sally Bolton (Wimbledon), and Lew Sherr (US Open). According to the Associated Press, the letter was dated “March 21” and featured 20 handwritten signatures from top players on both the men's and women's sides.

Speaking at a UTS event in Nimes, World No. 6 Casper Ruud added fuel to the fire. “As a player, I don't feel like it's fair… If you compare with other major sports around the world, NFL, MLB, NBA, they are closer to 50 percent revenue sharing.” The numbers don't lie. As per the PTPA, professional tennis players only get about 17.5% of the total revenue generated by the sport. Compare that to NBA athletes, who receive nearly 50%. That's a massive gap. And it's not sitting right with the top players anymore.

After her win at the Charleston Open, Jessica Pegula spoke about the letter and the larger movement with Tennis Channel.

She said, “That was more about the Slams trying to secure higher revenue shares—revenue that would go towards prize money, considering how much money they're making. I think there are also other things, like player welfare, but more details will probably come out in a couple of months. I'm always pushing for that kind of stuff. It's amazing to see what Ben (Navarro) has done for tennis, especially in the U.S., and particularly for women. That's awesome to hear. There's a massive discrepancy. People often assume there's equal prize money across the board, but it's really only at the Slams—and maybe one or two of the 1000-level tournaments. There's a huge drop-off between the 250s and the 500s. So just starting that trend toward better equity is huge for us. It's amazing.”

With tennis players getting just 17.5% of revenue, is it time for a major overhaul?

Debate

Speaking of Ben Navarro, the father of World No. 11 Emma Navarro and owner of the Charleston Open, made a big move. His company, Credit One Bank, extended its title partnership with the tournament through 2031. Thanks to this, the Charleston Open became the first WTA 500 to offer prize money on par with ATP 500 events—well before the 2033 deadline.

Pegula walked away with $164,000 after her Charleston win. The total prize pool? $1,064,510. All WTA 500 and 1000 events are now expected to match ATP levels. From 2026, the pool will rise to around $1.15 million and continue to grow. Meanwhile, many ATP 500s already offer over $2 million. So there's still a long way to go.

Beyond the paycheck, Pegula's Charleston title was special for another reason—it was her first-ever clay-court win.

After losing the Miami Open final to Aryna Sabalenka just a week earlier, Jessica Pegula bounced back in style. She adjusted beautifully to the green clay in Charleston and won her second title of the year. This also marked the eighth singles title of her career. The 6-3, 7-5 victory over fellow American Sofia Kenin sealed the deal. At 31, the American finally conquered clay.

The win gave her 300 points, boosting her from No. 4 to No. 3 in the rankings, equaling her career best from October 24, 2022. It also knocked fellow American Coco Gauff to No. 4, though there's less than 40 points between them. With that, Pegula also became the No. 1 American woman in tennis. There's more good news.

Article continues below this ad

Pegula had missed last year's entire clay season due to injury. But this year, she's heading into Madrid, Rome, and Roland-Garros with zero points to defend. That's a free shot to rack up more wins. And she's leading the WTA Tour in victories this season with 25, ahead of even World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who has 23.

Jessica Pegula is making moves on and off the court. Whether it's fighting for fair pay or collecting titles, she's showing up. Will this movement finally push tennis toward true equality—or is it just the start of another long rally?

Let the world know your perspective.

The former world No. 1 has been off court since the 2024 US Open.ByDavid KanePublished Apr 07, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 07, 2025

Caroline Wozniacki surprised fans with the news that she and husband David Lee are expecting their third child.“Officially switching to zone defense!” joked the former world No. 1 on social media Sunday. “Our family couldn't be more excited to welcome baby #3 soon! 👶🏼”Wozniacki had been in the midst of a comeback since 2023, having missed the prior three seasons to begin retirement and become a mother to daughter Olivia and son James. In the 18 months since she returned to action, she reached back-to-back US Open fourth rounds and the 2024 BNP Paribas Open quarterfinals, but has been off the court since a fourth-round US Open defeat to Beatriz Haddad Maia.

“I just have to sit down with the family and kind of see what's best for us,” she said of her comeback at the time. “Then kind of go from there.“I think right now I just need to take a deep breath and, you know, kind of go through the motions here.

Rafael Nadal's Unbelievable Triumph: The Epic Comeback That Shook the Tennis World

In a jaw-dropping reflection, Rafael Nadal revisited the 2022 Australian Open final showdown against Daniil Medvedev, where he stunned the world with a remarkable comeback. Admitting that he had doubts about his victory, Nadal showcased unparalleled resilience to clinch his second Australian Open title in a match that will go down in history.

The Spanish tennis maestro's journey to the final was nothing short of spectacular, conquering formidable opponents like Denis Shapovalov and Matteo Berrettini en route to his sixth final appearance in Melbourne. Despite facing setbacks in previous Australian Open finals, Nadal refused to let go of his dream of clinching the prestigious title.

The final match against Medvedev was a rollercoaster of emotions and intensity. Nadal found himself trailing by two sets but refused to back down. In a nail-biting turn of events, Nadal fought back from a precarious 2-3, 0-40 position in the third set, demonstrating his unwavering determination. With sheer grit and skill, he clawed his way back into the match, eventually triumphing over Medvedev with a final score of 3–6, 6–7(5), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5.

Nadal's victory not only secured his 21st Grand Slam title, propelling him to the top of the male major winners' list alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic but also solidified his status as a tennis legend. The intensity of the match was not lost on Nadal, who confessed to moments of uncertainty during the battle.

“I thought I was going to lose. But it was very important not to let myself go. I've been a player with a good capacity for self-control,” Nadal revealed. “The 4% was worth fighting for. That's always been my point of view.”

Following his historic win, Nadal embarked on a phenomenal 21-match winning streak at the start of the season, a testament to his unwavering determination and unparalleled skill on the court. His exceptional performance culminated in his 14th French Open title and 22nd Grand Slam trophy, further solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.

Nadal's unparalleled comeback at the 2022 Australian Open will be etched in the annals of tennis history as a testament to his indomitable spirit and unyielding resolve in the face of adversity.

 The three champions from last week's clay-court ATP 250 tripleheader have all made strides in the latest edition of the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 Jenson Brooksby has enjoyed a mammoth jump after winning his maiden tour-level crown in Houston as the World No. 507, while Flavio Cobolli also lifted his first ATP Tour trophy in Bucharest. Luciano Darderi ensured it was a two-title Sunday for Italy with his victory in Marrakech. 

 ATPTour.com looks at the movers in the PIF ATP Rankings as of Monday, 7 April. 



 No. 172 Jenson Brooksby, +335 
With his stylish championship-match run as a qualifier at the Fayez Sarofim & Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship, Brooksby became the third-lowest-ranked titlist in ATP Tour history (since 1990). The former World No. 33 saved match point in three matches in Houston, including against third seed Alejandro Tabilo in the second round and top seed Tommy Paul in the semi-finals. After charging past Frances Tiafoe in the final, Brooksby has stormed 335 spots up the PIF ATP Rankings to No. 172. Read First-time Winner Spotlight. 

 

 No. 36 Flavio Cobolli, +9 
Cobolli bounced back from an eight-match tour-level losing streak in style at the Tiriac Open presented by UniCredit Bank, where the Italian dropped just one set all week en route to his maiden ATP Tour crown. The 22-year-old needed seven championship points in Bucharest to see off Sebastian Baez in the final, but he sealed victory with a classy lob to claim the trophy. He has risen nine spots to World No. 36, just six places shy of his career high. Read First-time Winner Spotlight. 

 

 No. 48 Luciano Darderi, +9 
Another Italian jumping nine spots after a title run is Luciano Darderi, who downed top seed Tallon Griekspoor in the Grand Prix Hassan II final. Like Cobolli, Darderi had endured a difficult start to 2025 and arrived in Marrakech with a 2-8 tour-level record for the year, but he showed few signs of nerves in closing out for his second ATP Tour trophy. 

 No. 66 Mattia Bellucci, +5 (Career High) 
Bellucci continued his 2025 rise by reaching his second ATP Tour quarter-final in Marrakech. The 23-year-old Italian, who enjoyed a breakout semi-final run at ATP 500 level in February in Rotterdam, fell to Griekspoor in the last eight but has nonetheless risen to a career-high World No. 66.

 No. 95 Vit Kopriva, +11 (Career High) 
Kopriva has broken the Top 100 for the first time at the age of 27 after reaching his first ATP Tour quarter-final since 2021 in Marrakech. The Czech, who won an ATP Challenger Tour title in Naples in the last week of March, downed Borna Gojo and second seed Lorenzo Sonego in Morocco to seal the milestone. 
 Other Notable Top 100 Movers 
No. 6 Jack Draper, +1 (Career High) 
No. 23 Jakub Mensik, +1 (Career High) 
No. 61 Francisco Comesana, +3 (Career High)

No. 82 Christopher O'Connell, +5

 Alejandro Tabilo won a first-round epic on Monday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, where he prevailed in a topsy-turvy deciding set to deny a Stan Wawrinka vs. Novak Djokovic clash in The Principality. 

 Facing Wawrinka on Court Rainier III, Tabilo recovered from a slow start and held his nerve after squandering a 5-3 lead in the deciding set to eventually prevail 1-6, 7-5, 7-5. 

👉 All in the mind 👈Tabilo digs deep to battle past 2014 champion Wawrinka@ROLEXMCMASTERS | #RolexMonteCarloMasters pic.twitter.com/UWTopwstt2

 Wawrinka, 40, was making his 15th appearance in The Principality, the fourth most in the Open Era. The 2014 champion was trying to record just his second tour-level win of the season and looked impressive at times against Tabilo, taking large cuts from both wings to overpower the Chilean in the early stages. 

 However, Tabilo refused to go away. The 27-year-old won 52 per cent of points on the Wawrinka first serve in the third set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and earned victory on his third match point, having squandered a chance at 4-5. 



 Tabilo had not won a tour-level match on clay since Rome last year, losing eight matches in a row on the surface.  His reward for getting over the line is a meeting with two-time champion and former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Djokovic. Their only previous meeting came in Rome in 2024, when Tabilo shocked the Serbian en route to the semi-finals. 

In other early action on Day 2, Jiri Lehecka overcame Sebastian Korda 6-3, 7-6(7). The Czech is competing on clay for the first time since he advanced to the semi-finals in Madrid last season. He will take on Lorenzo Musetti after the Italian battled back to defeat Buyunchaokete.

Musetti upset Djokovic en route to the quarter-finals in Monte-Carlo in 2023, but it looked like he would be exiting early at this year's event. However, from a set-and-a-break down, the 23-year-old earned a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win against the Chinese qualifier.

Gael Monfils continued his impressive season with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 comeback win against Fabian Marozsan. The Frenchman holds a 6-2 record at ATP Masters 1000 events in 2025, having reached the third round in Indian Wells and the fourth round in Miami.

 

The 38-year-old, who won the title in Auckland earlier this season, made his debut in The Principality in 2005, losing to Rafael Nadal in the first round. Still going strong 20 years later, Monfils will play seventh seed Andrey Rublev in the second round.

Daniel Altmaier shocked Jannik Sinner at Roland Garros two years ago and earned another impressive win on clay Monday when he defeated 16th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 7-6(5), 6-3 to clinch his first main-draw victory at the event. The German qualifier will next meet Richard Gasquet.

American Marcos Giron improved to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Denis Shapovalov with a 6-3, 7-6(5) win.

Former World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki will soon become a mother for the third time, she announced Sunday in a post on social media.

Posing on the beach with her husband, retired NBA player David Lee, and their two children, Wozniacki made a reference to her husband's athletic career in sharing the news.

""Officially switching to zone defense!"" she wrote, joking that she and the 2015 NBA champion, 41, will soon be outnumbered by children. The growing family received well-wishes from Wozniacki's peers including former World No. 1 Karolina Pliskova, former Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard, and three-time major champion Angelique Kerber -- a good friend of Wozniacki's who announced her own second pregnancy earlier this year.

A post shared by Caroline Wozniacki (@carowozniacki)

The couple shares daughter Olivia, 3 -- who is seen in the family snapshot holding ultrasound photos -- and son James, 2 -- both of whom were born during Wozniacki's three-year hiatus from the Hologic WTA Tour. The 2018 Australian Open champion, now 34, retired from tennis after playing in Melbourne in 2020, and returned in the summer of 2023.

Wozniacki said at the time that she “still [had] goals” she wanted to accomplish, and wanted to serve as a role model for her children.

""I want to show my kids that you can pursue your dreams no matter your age or role,"" she said.

In the two years of her return, Wozniacki twice reached the fourth round of the US Open -- where she was runner-up twice -- and took a set from eventual champion Coco Gauff at the 2023 edition. Last year, she reached the quarterfinals of Indian Wells, got to the third round at Wimbledon, represented Denmark at the Paris Olympics, and returned to the Top 100 in the PIF WTA Rankings. 

The Dane's last match to date was a fourth-round loss to Beatriz Haddad Maia in Queens last summer, after which Wozniacki said, ""I just have to sit down with the family and kind of see what's best for us, then kind of go from there,"" as it related to her continuing comeback.

Despite having not played this year, Wozniacki was still on hand at the Australian Open as a commentator, and carried the trophy into Rod Laver Arena on Day 1 of the tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

To add to the stat's uniqueness, Draper isn't even a lefty in real life, as he described after his semifinal win over Carlos Alcaraz at Indian Wells.“I think, weirdly enough, my leftiness is a big plus, but I think the fact that I'm actually a right-hander, I think that really helps me, because my forehand has been improving all the time,” he said. “My forehand is naturally the shot where, you know, I'm not as comfortable. It's always been my backhand that has been the shot, like, I can hit with my eyes closed, you know. I really have no problem against any player with their forehand into my backhand. Usually that's something where players struggle. But with me, that's a big strength of mine.“I think the mix of that is a big advantage.”The 23-year-old is the No. 5 seed in Monte Carlo this week, with a bye into the second round. He has nothing to defend at the first Masters 1000 clay-court event of the year, having fallen in the first round a year ago.

Winning racer and championship-winning team owner ‘Shige' Hattori has died. Hattori was involved in a three-car traffic accident on Saturday morning. The tragic incident took place around 9:15 a.m. EST on I-77 northbound in Mecklenburg County, about 30 minutes north of Charlotte, North Carolina. He was driving a 2025 Toyota Crown when he crossed the center line, colliding with oncoming traffic. Everyone else involved suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

The Huntersville Police Department confirmed Hattori's passing and the details of the crash on Monday morning. Speeding or impairment were not believed to have been factors in the tragic accident, which remains under investigation. 

Hailing from Okayama, Japan, Hattori moved to the States in 1995 as he branched out into the American open-wheel racing scene. He competed full-time as an Indy Lights driver for three years, winning twice during the 1998 season at Homestead-Miami Speedway and Gateway.

He graduated to CART and IndyCar in the years to follow, driving for various teams and starting over two dozen races. His tenure in CART was tumultuous, but he improved mightily as an IndyCar driver. His career included three Indianapolis 500 attempts, making the iconic race twice in both 2002 and 2003, finishing as high as 20th. His best showing in IndyCar came while driving for Bradley Motorsports, finishing sixth at Texas Motor Speedway during the 2002 season.

However, Hattori's motorsports journey then took him from open-wheel racing to stock cars around 2004. Competing with Germain Racing in the NASCAR Truck Series, he struggled to acclimate and crashed out in six of the ten races he started. But this was not the end of his NASCAR experiment. 

His true impact on the sport would come a few years later as he ventured into team ownership. Hattori Racing Enterprises was established in 2008 and started actively competing in both the NASCAR Xfinity and Truck Series in 2013. He brought new sponsors into the sport and gave opportunities to future Cup stars like Alex Bowman and Ross Chastain. While the organization never placed higher than fifth in an Xfinity Series race, Hattori's NASCAR operation reached stunning heights in the Truck Series.

The race team won a total of 14 Truck races with Brett Moffitt and Austin Hill, but their crowning achievement came in 2018. Moffitt led the team to the Championship 4, beating Noah Gragson and Kyle Busch Motorsports to win the NASCAR Truck Series title. Hattori's team moved away from full-time competition in 2023, only running a partial schedule in recent years, but his impact on the sport's lower divisions has been immense.

The team reacted to Shige's tragic passing with the following statement: ""We are heartbroken to confirm that Shigeaki ""Shige"" Hattori was pronounced deceased on the morning of Saturday, April 5, in Huntersville, N.C., following a motor vehicle accident. He was 61. A native of Okayama, Japan, Shige moved to the United States in the 1990s to pursue his dream of becoming an open-wheel race car driver. He won two INDY NXT by Firestone races and made two starts in the Indianapolis 500.

""His passion for motorsports ultimately led him to NASCAR, where he competed in the NASCAR Truck Series (NCTS) in 2004 and 2005. He transitioned to team ownership in 2008 and founded Hattori Racing Enterprises (HRE). He won 14 NCTS races as a team owner and reached the ultimate achievement by winning the 2018 series championship. Shige was known for his relentless drive, focus and competitive spirit. Team ownership through HRE and Hattori Motorsports had become both his passion and his life's work. He had a unique gift to constantly inject a light-hearted attitude and one-of-a-kind sense of humor into his race teams that will never be forgotten.

""We'll miss you dearly. Farewell, Shige.""

“Shigeaki Hattori was a passionate racer and highly successful team owner, but beyond all his team's statistics – which includes a NASCAR Truck Series championship – Shige was a genuine, beloved member of the garage who worked tirelessly to lift our sport and his people. We are deeply saddened by his tragic passing. NASCAR extends its thoughts and prayers to his family and many friends.”

“Everyone at Toyota and TRD, U.S.A. is saddened to learn of Shige Hattori's tragic passing. Toyota's history with Shige spans decades. Through his long run as a driver to his history-making championship success as an owner, Shige's motivation and work ethic to achieve at the highest level never wavered. His endearing personality was infectious and unforgettable. We are thinking of his family and friends as they process this terrible loss.”

Carlos Sainz has been fined €20,000, with €10,000 of that suspended, by the FIA stewards for being late for the national anthem ahead of Formula 1's Japanese Grand Prix.

The Williams driver was late to the Japanese national anthem on the grid due to a stomach upset and was visiting a doctor at the track ahead of the race.

According to the FIA, Sainz was ""not in place for the national anthem at the specified time of 1344hrs"" before the Suzuka race, breaching Article 19.4 b) of the regulations.

The driver has been given a €20,000 fine, with €10,000 suspended for a 12-month period.

Sainz received the fine despite being examined by Dr. Messina of Med-Ex, who verified his stomach issues prior to the race, adding that they administered medication.

The mitigating circumstances meant that the usual penalty of €60,000 was reduced.

""The driver arrived at the national anthem position after the anthem had commenced,"" the stewards noted in their explanation.

""During the drivers' briefing on Friday all drivers were reminded of the requirement to be in position by the time prescribed in the regulations and the need to show respect for the host country's anthem.

""Displaying respect for the national anthem is a high priority and all parties need to consider every eventuality in planning to be in position for the anthem by the required time.""

Sainz, who started 15th after a three-place grid penalty for impeding Lewis Hamilton in qualifying, finished the Japanese GP in 14th place for Williams.

Last weekend in MotoGP, Marc Marquez was shown talking to his Ducati mechanics during the United States national anthem at the Americas GP, but wasn't penalised given it is not part of the MotoGP regulations.

William Byron's performance at Darlington Raceway was one rarely seen in modern NASCAR, absolutely dominating the majority of the race. Byron led every lap in Stage 1 and Stage 2, going on to lead the first 243 (of 297 total) laps, without a single lead change.

The last time a driver led every single lap in a Cup race was Jeff Burton almost 25 years ago, but Byron's chance of completing the NASCAR version of a no-hitter did not pan out the way he hoped it would.

Despite a shocking show of dominance, all it took was one round of green-flag pit stops to unravel Byron's advantage.

No one passed him on track, but Byron fell back to third as Tyler Reddick and Christopher Bell pulled off the ‘undercut', through the cycle of green flag pit stops. Now in traffic for the first time, Byron struggled to make forward progress. He ended up losing more spots to Ryan Blaney and eventual race winner Denny Hamlin, who both had fresher tires after running long in the previous run.

A late-race caution paved the way for Byron to find a way back up to second, but it was still a bitter loss after showcasing such dominant speed from the 24 car.

""First off, really proud of my team, bringing that level of effort and preparation, have a car like that,"" said Byron. ""For us to execute like that, it was looking like it was going to be a perfect race. We were going to lead every lap. Was really proud of that.

""Those guys could be aggressive on the other side of the green flag cycle, we lost control there. Once we lost control, too late in the going to kind of get back up there. Yeah, it sucks. I'm sure it will sting a lot tonight. There's still a lot of positives. It stings in the moment, for sure.""

Byron, who won the season-opening Daytona 500, continues to lead the championship standings with a 49-point advantage over his closest competition.

MotoGP's race direction has given Motorsport.com an in-depth analysis of the chaos that unfolded on the Grand Prix of the Americas starting grid in unstable weather conditions.

The Austin event called for quick thinking given several things failed to go as planned – including the safety car crashing into the barriers just 45 minutes before the race start, although this particular incident had no influence on what subsequently happened.

As per the rules, the pitlane opened 25 minutes before the start, at a time when the track was drying but still lightly drizzling. All riders were free to complete one or several laps – going through the pitlane – for five minutes, before taking their spots on the grid; Fabio Quartararo crashed then.

As the United States anthem was played just seven minutes before the start, the rain had stopped, the temperature had risen, and the track was quickly drying. Most riders realised they were about to start the race at a disadvantage, as their bikes were set up for a wet track with wet-weather tyres. Only Brad Binder, Enea Bastianini and Ai Ogura gambled on slick rubber – all from the sixth row of the grid.

A now-viral video clip shows that Marc Marquez was not only thinking about a bike swap but also how to minimise his rivals' reaction time. He could have started from pole with slick tyres and a wet set-up, but opted to run back to the pits and grab his alternate GP24, with him and his Ducati squad incorrectly assuming he would have to start the race from the back, not be given a ride-through penalty.

“The riders who leave the grid and change tyre types at this moment (from wet to dry or vice versa) must start the warm-up lap from the pitlane, take their qualifying position on the grid, and serve a ride-through penalty when directed by race direction,” as per Article 1.18.7 of the regulations.

Watch: Watch Marc Marquez decide on his grid gamble

Article 1.18.7 was tweaked after Jack Miller was alone on pole at the 2018 Argentine Grand Prix while the remainder of the field lined up at the back at Termas de Rio Hondo.

“It was adjusted because neither the organisation nor the infrastructure is prepared for a large number of riders to swap bikes just before the race and then take positions at the back of the grid,"" race director Mike Webb told Motorsport.com.

""That's why it was decided that each rider would start from their position and the penalty would come afterward.""

Marquez proved to be so influential that many riders followed his lead, running across to the pitlane. In other words, it was chaos with under one minute before the formation lap.

As safety was compromised, race direction aborted the start with a red flag – which wiped the slate clean and, as a consequence, was detrimental to Binder, Bastianini and Ogura.

“The red flag was shown for safety reasons,” Webb said. “When Marc ran to his box, nearly half the grid followed him.

“In those conditions, with so many people and bikes moving around the grid and pitlane, it simply wasn't safe to start the race. We couldn't even close the pitwall gates because of the number of people there.”

At this point, one might wonder whether a ‘start delayed' protocol would have been fairer for all riders, but Webb argued that reordering the grid afterwards was unrealistic.

“We decided to show the red flag and restart the procedure because we thought it was the safest and clearest option,” he detailed.

“If we had gone with ‘start delayed', to follow the regulation we would have had to move riders who left the pitlane to the back of the grid, taking us back to Argentina 2018, where it proved unfeasible.”

After a 10-minute delay, the quick-start procedure was implemented, and the lights went out.

Race leader Marquez crashed out on lap nine; Francesco Bagnaia eventually secured his first victory of the season, and second-placed Alex Marquez took the lead in the standings.

From everything that unfolded in Texas, Webb drew one clear conclusion: “What happened in Austin is unprecedented, but it will lead us to review parts of the regulations – mainly to simplify them so that everyone involved understands them clearly.”

News of Max Verstappen's Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix triumph was delivered to Jos Verstappen while sitting in a rally car en route to success in the European Rally Championship.

Last weekend offered up a double victory for the Verstappen family as Max's masterful drive from pole to win the Japanese Grand Prix preceded father Jos claiming the Masters Class on the asphalt roads at Rally Sierra Morena, Spain.

Rally Sierra Morena marked Jos Verstappen's debut in the European Rally Championship, with the event the first of a three-year plan to compete in the series, after the Dutchman switched to rallying in 2022.

Amid the competition Jos was keeping a close eye on his son's progress in Japan and was able to watch part of Sunday's race before jumping in his Skoda Fabia RS Rally2 car to begin Saturday's morning loop of stages. He was informed of Max's win by ERC TV crews at the end of stage seven.     

“We were watching it just before the stage, but I couldn't watch the last 14 laps so it's good [he's won],” said Jos Verstappen. “This [win] was good [for me], but Max's win is more important.”

Jos Verstappen and co-driver Renaud Jamoul delivered an impressive performance on Sierra Morena's challenging asphalt stages. The pair were joint third-fastest after the opening stage, before going on to finish 13th overall behind event winner Nikolay Gryazin.

Fifty-three-year-old Verstappen lifted the inaugural ERC Masters Class victory - for drivers aged over 50, introduced into the championship for the 2025 campaign – leading Andras Hadik by 2m31.2s.

“It's fine to win the Masters [Class] but that's not what we came for,” added Verstappen. “We want to get closer to the top guys and that was the difficulty.

“But I must say some things I am pleased of, but there are a lot of other things to improve a lot, and to learn. We need to do more of these kinds of rallies with a lot of notes, a lot of corners, that's what we have to improve and that's why we are here. We're not giving up, it only motivates me, and we will get there.

“It's a medium list, it's a little bit everywhere, it's not only one thing but for sure there's a lot in the notes. It's me who can absorb all the information, but it's a question of doing it more and more on these kinds of rallies – that's where we have to focus.”

Verstappen will swap asphalt for gravel when the ERC heads to Hungary for the second round from 9-11 May.

“Gravel is another story, but we said the first year is all about learning, getting experience,” he said. “The second year, hopefully we will get a little bit better, and we will see in the future if we get a little more competitive.”

Ryan Blaney was one of the fastest drivers at Darlington, but in the end, circumstances prevented him from reaching Victory Lane. It seemed like every time the Team Penske driver got near the lead, something would happen that would put him deeper in the field. Here's how Blaney managed to salvage fifth, despite it all.

First, there was an untimely caution in the middle of green-flag pit stops during the second stage of the race. Blaney pitted from third but ended up back in 14th, due to a caution for debris from Brad Keselowski's loose wheel. He fought back quickly, charging back up to fourth by the end of the stage.

Bad luck wasn't done with him yet, as a slow pit stop dropped Blaney all the way down to 20th.

Blaney once again marched through the field and made sure to have fresher tires than most of the leaders for the final run to the finish, pitting later than most. It paid off perfectly, quickly making up ground before finally catching race leader Tyler Reddick. He made the pass for the win with four laps to go, only for misfortune to rear its ugly head once more.

A sudden caution for Kyle Larson, who was more than 160 laps down, pushed the race into overtime. On pit road, Blaney lost the lead and never recovered, finishing a disappointing fifth. 

Blaney's reaction to the final caution: ""Oh no. I thought we finally had the race won... We did a good job. Great strategy call of kind of running long, giving us time to get down, run down the 45, a lot of those guys that short pitted. It was a great call.""

Blaney had the car to win at Darlington, but he never had the right amount of luck. ""Never really got to control the race. I feel like nothing ever really went our way. Pit road, we got to work on a little bit. Caution coming out during the cycle set us way back. I felt like we just kept making up spots.

""Really proud of the 12 folks for giving me a fast car. Just really wasn't meant to be. I really wanted and would have liked to have won here. That would have been really neat. Just wasn't meant to be. Proud of the effort. We'll keep plugging along.""

Fernando Alonso has compared Suzuka to Monaco in terms of being a Formula 1 race that is basically won on a Saturday during qualifying.

Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix saw a dearth of overtaking as the spectacle failed to spark into an entertaining race with Max Verstappen winning from pole.

It is something that has become an issue in recent years at Suzuka in the same way that Monaco has been highlighted as a race where success is determined by a driver's starting position.

F1 will be hoping the Monaco issue is now set to be solved after it introduced two mandatory pitstops for the 2025 grand prix.

But Alonso, who finished 11th for Aston Martin on Sunday, fears Suzuka may have now gone the same way as the race in Monte Carlo.

“This is Suzuka, I don't remember a race when we saw too many overtakes here without the weather changing,” said the two-time F1 world champion.

“It seems like we repeat always on Thursday, how great Suzuka is, how great Monaco is, the glamour, the spectacular weekend.

“And then on Sunday, we wake up and we say: ‘Monaco is boring. What can we do to the track?' ‘Suzuka is boring.' This is Formula 1, and Suzuka is great, because Saturday is incredibly high adrenaline.”

Speaking after the race, Ferrari boss Frederic Vasseur said this season could become a “quali world championship” if the trend of struggling to overtake seen in both China and Japan continues.

In what is the final year of the current regulations, there has not only been a convergence in car design but simultaneously teams have also found ways around rules that were originally introduced to promote more overtaking.

Across 2024 there were 70 fewer overtakes than a year earlier, despite there being two extra grands prix. All four races in 2025 meanwhile (three grands prix and one sprint) have been won from pole.

Maybe one stop was not the race that we were hoping for,” added Alonso on Sunday's grand prix. “In the past with multiple stops, maybe the tyres are different but when we don't have grip, we complain that there is no grip and when we have too many stops.

“We complain the tyres don't last, so instead of seeing the negative part of the weekend I try to enjoy what we experienced this weekend.”

Suzuka began an F1 triple-header with this weekend being the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Saudi Arabia next week.

Red Bull Formula 1 team boss Christian Horner thinks Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri having equal status made it harder for McLaren to fight Max Verstappen in Suzuka.

Having been outqualified by Verstappen's stunning pole lap on Saturday, Norris and Piastri spent the grand prix chasing the reigning champion in an intrinsically quicker McLaren, with Suzuka's one-stop race void of overtaking opportunities.

In the second stint Piastri asked the team to swap positions and hand him a chance to fight Verstappen, the Australian feeling he had extra pace in hand.

But that call never came, with team boss Andrea Stella not convinced Piastri was actually faster than Norris in the Red Bull's dirty air.

""I don't think it is so clear that Oscar was faster,"" Stella said. ""Lando was trying to get Max's slipstream even closer, but anytime you went below a second there was a significant loss of grip.

""At this track you need seven, eight tenths of performance advantage in order to be able to overtake.""

While Horner envies McLaren's position of having two frontrunning cars, which Red Bull is yet to have as it tries its luck with Yuki Tsunoda as Verstappen's latest team-mate, he did feel its equal driver approach also came with compromises that made it harder for the team to attack the Dutchman.

It pitted third-placed Piastri first because of pressure from behind, leaving Norris to come in on the same lap as Verstappen to negate any strategic options.

""I guess the problem they have is they have two drivers that are fighting for the drivers' championship,"" Horner offered.

""The difficulty they have is that they've made a bet where they're going to let them race. So that's the compromise that inevitably comes with that.""

Asked if Norris could have beaten Verstappen by pitting one lap earlier, he replied: ""The undercut was reasonably powerful. There's 'could have, should have, would have', I'm sure, up and down the pitlane.

""I think the majority of the hard work was done on Saturday. I guess 90% of the cars finished in the order that they started in. It was a flat-out sprint race today. There was very low degradation.

""We know the McLarens are very, very fast. And it needed Max to be inch perfect with two very fast McLarens right behind him.

“For 53 laps he made not a single mistake and had the pace to cover them, keep them out of his DRS. I think that's one of Max's best weekends.""

Oliver Bearman, Haas F1 Team

Haas team principal Ayao Komatsu has praised the maturity shown by Oliver Bearman both on and off the track after the Formula 1 rookie sealed a top 10 finish in Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix.

Having taken eighth in China following the disqualifications of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc, Bearman scored a point in his own right at Suzuka, qualifying in 10th and finishing in the same position.

Both Bearman and Komatsu professed surprise at the 19-year-old even getting out of Q1, let alone making it all the way to the top 10 shootout.

The achievement was all the more impressive given Haas had arrived in Japan with an untested floor upgrade.

Bearman made it work where his more experienced team-mate Esteban Ocon struggled, and Komatsu insisted he was not surprised by the youngster's ability to feed crucial information back to the team.

“We knew that from last year, this is a big part of the reason why we signed Ollie,” he said.

“We started working with him in Mexico ‘23 when he was 18. He was impressive straight away in that regard and then last year, every time we worked with him, his feedback was accurate, he understood the programme, he understood the objectives.

“So it's not just about driving fast; of course he can drive fast, but he really is able to, let's say, digest or understand what's required of him and then execute the programme. So it's great, but we're not surprised. I'm not surprised because we knew how much potential he had.

“For everyone to execute the race in that way and Ollie to drive in that way to get P10 was a really good reward. So it's just lots of work just to get one point. I'm very pleased that we managed to get something out of this weekend.

“If you look at our competitiveness on Friday, it didn't look like we were getting out of Q1, so Friday night I was focusing, how can we get a bit more performance out of the car and driver, to get out of Q1. Then we tweaked a few things overnight, and then FP3 to qualifying, and then to get to Q3 was amazing.”

While Haas clearly took a big step forward in terms of performance, Komatsu did admit it was something of a “risk” to bring the new floor to Japan.

The fact it ultimately proved a risk worth taking, however, will not lead to similar chances being taken with future updates to the car.

“It's not hard, because we're pretty clear,” he said on the challenge of being restrained with other upgrades. “Obviously depending on the size of the issue.

“The fact that this upgrade we brought here actually did what it's supposed to do it actually takes that pressure off, if you like. If this made no difference, and then we had to set up the car in a very non-performing window, then that might be more added pressure, ‘oh shit, haven't solved anything at all'.

“But still, we knew that in other areas, if we don't go through the diligent iterative process, we can get lost completely. So it was good that this worked, but no, no, for the future development, we won't be shortcutting.”

The studio hopes that ""Great American Stories"" will become an anthology franchise, ripped from the pages of literary classics like John Steinbeck's novel.



		By Tony Maglio, Alex Weprin 

	April 7, 2025 7:01am	




	If you're one of those people who prefer a good book to the boob tube, AMC is about to make you feel conflicted.


	On Monday, AMC Networks announced it is developing a new TV franchise produced by AMC Studios and “built on iconic American stories.” Up first: John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.




	“Each season of the anthology series will be devoted to a different celebrated work, historical moment, or individual narrative celebrating and highlighting the American spirit,” the company said. The Great American Stories anthology will air on the AMC cable channel and stream on AMC's primary streaming service (out of a bunch), AMC+.

	If you want to Anne Rice-ify classic American literature, who better to adapt the novel than Rolin Jones, who did the same thing with Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire (and Friday Night Lights, and Boardwalk Empire)? Jones will take on Grapes and then “manage the franchise” from there, “working with acclaimed creative talent connected to individual seasons,” per AMC.


	“I actually look at it as big and epic as what we've seen with Walking Dead, the Anne Rice universe and Dark Winds,” says AMC chief commercial officer Kim Kelleher in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “Even if you haven't read the book since high school, there's a lot of expectation and build up around this. And I feel like the roster of talent he's put around it is going to do it justice.”


	Kelleher says that the company is planning to roll out a new edition of the anthology each year, based on different tales, though she declined to comment on any future literary inspirations.


	Jones, a playwright and television writer, will have some help in the form of Mark Johnson, who oversees the entire Anne Rice Immortal Universe. Johnson's got the résumé, his film and TV-producing credits include Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Natural, Rain Man, Diner, Donnie Brasco, The Notebook and a bunch more.


	“For more than a year we have been searching for the perfect story to launch our next big television franchise, and we found it in The Grapes of Wrath, which is as timely and relevant today as it was when first published in 1939,” Dan McDermott, the president of entertainment for AMC Studios and AMC Networks, said in a statement to press. “Our country is built upon so many unforgettable historic and dramatic moments, tales of bravery and courage, classic novels, short stories, and chronicles well known and never-before-told. As a network that began its life as American Movie Classics, this is the franchise we're destined to bring to the screen.”

	











	“We're thinking about Great American Stories like one of those resolute car factories in Michigan — bring in visionary creators, give them an assembly line of singular talent to build the thing, hand them the keys and get the hell out of the way,” Jones added. “This is Dan McDermott's big, bold, torpedo bat swing at AMC. He's hired me to roll a beauty off the factory floor every year. I hope to never have another job for the rest of my career.”


	A timely “torpedo bat” reference there out of Jones; clearly an MLB fan.


	“Never have I felt more professional pressure than in accepting this challenge to help translate some legendary American stories to the television screen,” Johnson said. “I am utterly grateful to AMC for this invitation and truly indebted to Rolin for his trust in me. What a terrifying opportunity!”

Warner Bros.' kid-friendly movie blew past all expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, with final numbers coming in more than $12 million ahead of Sunday's already historic estimates.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The box office blues have been banished in historic fashion.


Warner Bros.' A Minecraft Movie, made with help from Legendary Pictures, struck gold with a record-shattering $163 million opening domestically and $150.7 million overseas for a global start of $313.2 million, according to final weekend numbers. Thanks to a huge Sunday, that's up more than $12 million from Sunday's domestic estimate of $157 million and $144 million overseas for a global haul of $301 million.




	The film came in tens of millions ahead of expectations to score the top start ever for a video game adaptation, besting the $146.4 million three-day launch of Universal Pictures' The Super Mario Bros. Movie over Easter weekend in 2023. (Opening on a Wednesday, Mario Bros. earned $204 million through Easter Sunday.)

A Minecraft Movie easily boasts the top start of 2025 to date, and is the biggest domestic launch since Deadpool & Wolverine in July 2024 ($211 million). Just as noteworthy, it came in ahead of Barbie ($162 million) to mark Warners' biggest domestic opening since 2016 when Batman vs Superman debuted to $166 million. Saturday's gross of $60 million is the biggest in the history of Warners, not adjusted for inflation. Legendary put up 25 percent of the $150 million production budget (that doesn't include marketing costs).


	The star-studded, high-wattage ensemble pic couldn't have come at a better time. The 2025 box office has seen its fortunes fall off dramatically in recent weeks. Minecraft is just the shot of confidence Hollywood studios and cinema owners needed after pics including Disney's Snow White bit the poisoned apple. 


	It's also a needed victory for embattled Warner Bros. movie studio chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, and for the studio overall. Ditto for Legendary, whose movie chief Mary Parent — known for her deft handling of big IP — is a credited producer and is given major props for suggesting that Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre) be hired to direct the pic.


	“We're absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world,” Abdy and De Luca said in statement thanking all involved, from Hess to the cast to Legendary and Vertigo, another producing partner. They also thanked their marketing and distribution teams. “A Minecraft Movie's decade long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP's Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.”

	











Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Jennifer Coolidge and Danielle Brooks star in the PG-rated film, as well as Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen. The movie, based on the Mojang Studios video game of the same name, centers around four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they must master their new reality's quirks while embarking on a quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, as Black steps into the shoes of the iconic character Steve.


	Warners global distribution chief Jeff Goldstein said the film worked everywhere, from small towns to the biggest cities. And, reached in London, Parent said the opening is a both a reflection of the mandate to celebrate the world of Minecraft in a joyful way, and the singular experience that only theatrical can offer. “This game is a global phenomenon,” she said.


	She's not spinning. Minecraft is the the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold. By some estimates, there are 125 million active daily players. (Microsoft bought Mojang in 2014).


	On Saturday morning, based on Friday's huge haul of $58 million, insiders at Warner Bros. projected a $135 million domestic start, up from an expected $60 million-pls. Some rival studios thought it had a shot at as much as $150 million, but massive walk-up business saw the final tally come in even higher.


	Not even so-so reviews or a B+ CinemaScore dinged A Minecraft Movie (moviegoers under 18 gave it a perfect A). 

	











	Exit polls from PostTrak did the best job at explaining the movie's out-of-this world start: Teens between ages 13 and 17 made up 35 percent of the audience, while the largest quad was between ages 18 and 24, according to those with access to the data. Those are the demos best known for repeat viewing. Families also turned out in force, while males — as expected — dominated at 65 percent to 67 percent of the audience. General audiences and parents/kids gave the movie four out of five stars on PostTrak, while kids delivered five out of five.


	Overseas, A Minecraft Movie is even showing promise in China, where it topped the weekend chart with $14.6 million, the best showing of any Hollywood title this year. Legendary East is handling the film in China.


	“This was lightning in a bottle,” said Goldstein.


	The next-closest film was A Working Man, which came in No. 2 with $7.3 million. Distributed by Amazon MGM Studios in the U.S., the pic has earned $27.8 million in its first 10 days of release. Fathom's screening of part two of The Chosen: Last Supper followed closely with $7.2 million.


Snow White, now in its third weekend, placed No. 4 with $6.1 million domestically for a tepid global total of $168.4 million.

From the nostalgic and scene-setting intro of “Toronto's Window” to the groovy “1999,” the 13-track debut album gives fans a look inside the head (and heart) of one of K-pop's brightest stars. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	“I never thought I could dream in detail,” NCT's Mark Lee begins his newly released song, “Toronto's Window,” expertly kicking off his debut solo album, The Firstfruit.


	The 25-year-old K-pop star, known simply by his stage name Mark, debuted nine years ago as a member of SM Entertainment's mega-group NCT and is still learning new things about himself creatively. “I really got to find myself while creating this album,” Mark tells The Hollywood Reporter on a Zoom from Seoul, South Korea. “Now that it's done, it even put me on the idea of my second chapter.”

	As one of the busiest working performers in the world of K-pop — Mark is a member of NCT subgroups 127 and Dream and has worked in supergroup SuperM, along with other NCT formations — the Canada-born singer and rapper has never shied away from a challenge. On The Firstfruit, Mark gets vulnerable and open like he never has before. “Toronto's Window” serves as an almost origin story to listeners before jumping into the album's title track, “1999.”




			Related Video		







	In its totality, the 13-track album is a clear window into the mind of one of the genre's brightest (and arguably most earnest) stars. Below, Mark digs into The Firstfruit with THR, explaining the process of making the album, what his father said to him after listening for the first time, how much this album has aged him and why it had to start in Toronto. 


What was the process of making The Firstfruit like? Do you have a favorite or most challenging part of the process?


	It took almost a year to create everything, but I think the most important part of the process — every part was important but — after “200” came out there was a turning point for me to realize that “I need to change everything that I've been working on.” That was the start of The Firstfruit. I had an idea of another album, but it wasn't The Firstfruit but after “200” came out, things weren't adding up. There was a specific turning point that I realized I had to start everything from scratch again. That was the hardest and the most challenging part, but it was the most important part of the process.


You previously said you put a lot of yourself in this album. Do you feel it has changed you now that you're on the other side of it?












	Absolutely. I have been trying to put my finger on what this feeling actually was, and then I realized. I think this album helped me find myself, and I hope that it can help my listeners to find themselves if they haven't yet. I think that's the point of this album for me.


On the album, “1999” is really such a cool track. It's a very different direction than I would've thought you were going with this, which is exciting. Why did you feel this was the sound to kick off this new version of you?


	The first time I heard it, I wasn't like, “This is the one.” We had other options. Among all the other options, this was the one that captivated me the most because I was working on it with [the producer] Dress. He came with the beat and with the hook. Before that, though, I've always been proud of my falsetto. I've always been confident about my falsetto. I just left it as that. One day he just came with the song and the hook itself is all falsetto. Then we looked at the other options and I just felt like, “No, I think it has to be this one.” After we put the “1999” theme into the song, it really brought everything to life and it was the one. I'm really proud how it really knocks people off on the first [listen]. I think all my group members said the same thing as well. Everyone was like, “I did not expect something like ‘1999.'” I think it's a good thing.


Between solo work and the many groups you've been in, you have a big music catalog. Do you find yourself wanting to surprise people because you've done quite a bit already?












	Just because I wanted to. I did want to as well, but just me as an artist, I realized that there were so many different types of genres that I could have pulled off to be my title track. It was actually harder for me to choose which genre. I realized that's just what I have in me. I guess just meeting the right meaning and meeting the right objective of the song, it makes it easier for me to choose the genre.


Do you feel that this album or even the work you've put in over the last few years has changed the way you view performing and making music? Or do you find it's evolving as you get older yourself?


	I think it's both. I grow as this album made me grow at least five years, I feel like. I get to know what type of an artist and performer I imagine myself being on stage. That's why for “1999,” too, we usually use headsets, but I imagine myself using a handheld mic. When it comes to actually singing live and all these different performing elements, it's a mixture of strategy and also just my growth.


Do you have a favorite track on the album yourself?


	I love all of them. Did you hear “Mom's Interlude?” I think that's my current favorite because I can't believe I actually put that on the album. I can't believe it made it on the album. It's so vulnerable and it's not even a song, it's just me talking with my mom, but I just love it so much.


Between that and “Toronto's Window,” which I saw that you posted a video today of it that was very cinematic and cool. That's not something you typically get to do on an album. Is it exciting to get to do that in this space?












	Every aspect of this album feels like it's something that I've never done. “Toronto's Window,” too. I got that beat from [producer] Code Kunst and to put that on the first track of the album…. I feel like it's easier putting it this way. [On] all of the albums I've released before, I don't think I've ever seen an intro track like this one before. I think that's the feedback that my group members told me as well. It really just sets the mood for the album in the most perfect way. So this album, it's like an autobiography, so it has to start with Toronto because that's where it all began.


Did you find yourself anxious to show this music to your group members or other people in your life? You said it's very personal to you, so did you feel a little bit more precious with it?


	I felt like it was very, very precious, but at the same time I was kind of worried if this would be the right choice. I actually had a conversation with my dad, who said, “I'm actually very surprised on how honest and vulnerable you made this album and it actually kind of inspired me as your dad.” That conversation made me realize this was the right choice. I was kind of proud of myself, too.


Is there anything else you think is important to mention about The Firstfruit?


	I just want to say that I'm not asking for the world to love this album, but I am in a way requesting for the world to take the moment to listen to this album from start to finish at least once because then they'll get to know me better.

The hit HBO series' music supervisor Gabe Hilfer explains why you didn't hear any songs from the chart-topping megastar: “I feel like you're crossing a boundary because they're no longer their fictional character.” 


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	“[The White Lotus] is the well-established brainchild of Mike White,” music supervisor Gabe Hilfer told The Hollywood Reporter of working on the hit HBO show. “It's his sandbox to play in, and we're all there to help him just make it as exactly what he wants it to be.”


	Hilfer, who joined for the show's second season, said his main task as music supervisor is to take viewers into the each season's resort setting. He noted that season two was “very distinctly” Italian, while season three, which wrapped up its run Sunday night, is distinctly Thai. He added that they always strive for authenticity but that getting into the point of view of each season's guests is important.

	“You're immersed when you enter The White Lotus, and we want music to be a part of that too,” Hilfer said, adding that he was vaguely familiar with Thai music prior to season three due to past projects. “I also reached out to a lot of people that I know who have contacts in Thailand, and we ended up having a couple great resources in Bangkok, who were immensely helpful because basically their whole job is working on music licensing with Thai artists.”


	With the show heavily featuring the music of Thai artists and having one of the biggest pop stars in the world in the cast, it begs the obvious question: Why wasn't Lisa's music in the show? “I've worked on a lot of things that have musicians as actors, and I kind of feel like you're crossing a boundary because they're no longer their fictional character,” Hilfer explained. “It's just a little meta if you're hearing their music while you're seeing them on screen, but they're not playing themself.”


	The music supervisor says there was a discussion with her label but that it never came up in the body of the show. “If she was playing Lisa on vacation at the White Lotus, maybe it would've been kind of a fun little wink, but as she is Mook in this and has a different role, I think it would've been a little too self-aware or meta,” he said, adding, “Obviously, she's such a megastar, and Blackpink is its own phenomenon.”


	Hilfer also weighed in on fans' passionate online debates for things such as the main title sequence. “The show is a phenomenon in popularity and gets talked about so much,” he said. “Popularity just brings more eyeballs and more opinions and scrutiny. If you work on something that is incredible, but nobody watches it, nobody's really commenting and giving you their opinion on specific stuff.”

	











	He added, “When I hear the stuff — and I'm not deaf in terms of reading the stuff online and I see what people say — I look at it as almost flattery because it means that people are paying attention so much and they've loved it so much before that they're having a hard time with change.”

Ten of the season three stars united on Sunday to watch and break down the action-packed finale.


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


[This story contains major spoilers from The White Lotus season three finale, “Amor Fati.”]


	As the season three finale of The White Lotus arrived on Sunday night, 10 members of the show's cast gathered at the Four Seasons Westlake Village hotel to watch the episode together and give their immediate thoughts. 




Jason Isaacs, Leslie Bibb, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Tayme Thapthimthong, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola, Jon Gries, Nicholas Duvernay and Charlotte Le Bon were in attendance at the finale event, as they watched the finale for the first time — and emotionally witnessed the deaths of Wood's Chelsea, Walton Goggins‘ Rick and Scott Glenn's Jim Hollinger.

	“We were all crying backstage, we held each other for a long time,” Isaacs told the crowd. “I don't know because if it's this thing is coming to an end or because it's just such a beautiful story.” 


	Wood was particularly emotional over the death of her character, noting how “for about two weeks before we shot it, I felt super weird. It was like this odd, ominous thing that was just hanging over us, and then it was like the hottest day ever and Walton had to like carry me so many times and it was so hot.”


	“And also, you know, Chelsea doesn't know what's gonna happen to her, but I know, so it's this odd thing,” she continued, musing it also “looked exactly how it felt, which is really strange” while also admitting “it's not soaked in.”


	Thapthimthong's security guard character Gaitok shoots Rick as he's trying to get help for a wounded Chelsea, as the actor explained, “At first I felt like I don't want to shoot him in the back, let's turn around and have little gunfight… but we had a discussion with [creator] Mike [White] and I remember he said like, ‘Trust me, it will be justified.' And I feel like it really was,” as Wood sadly shook her head.


	Plenty also went on with the Ratliff family in the finale, as Isaac's patriarch makes a plan to poison his family before changing his mind at the last minute, only for youngest son Lachlan to be accidentally poisoned and nearly die. 


	The group then heads home to their soon-to-be-disrupted lives, as Isaacs mused of what's next, “I think the Ratliff wing at Duke University was probably pulled down. He, ironically, of all the characters that Mike throws into this mix, he's the one that actually, genuinely finds real spiritual enlightenment at the end, and is OK when he looks in the water at the end.”

	











	“What will happen to them? They'll have to get jobs. I think that's going to stick in Victoria's throat quite hard,” Isaacs joked of the other family members. “I doubted them and they will be fine, they just won't be fine in gigantic houses with huge Tesla trucks.” 


	Schwarzenegger — joking his character Saxon “went through the ringer, with these two girls and my brother really put me through it” — said he only read his character's parts of the finale and was still processing the ending. He admitted to crying for Wood in the finale and said he had this “really weird feeling right now, just spending so much time with all these cast members and then watching someone die; I don't know how to describe it, you feel like something really happened.”


	Hook said of her character's turn in deciding she couldn't handle a year at the monastery in Thailand, “I guess she is her mother's daughter” and raved about the storyline, saying, “She's just a little rich girl and that's The White Lotus, and it's so good. And I actually feel like she kind of did the reverse of everyone” in other characters finding enlightenment and Piper coming to terms with being spoiled. 


	Nivola added of shooting Lochlan's near-death, “It was really emotional. I never died in anything before, and I didn't in this! It was fun to get to do that, like it's a new, weird thing to pretend to die.” And Bibb reflected on the fan love of her character's trio with Carrie Coon and Michelle Monaghan, recalling when they first read the scripts, and actresses were “like, uh, our storyline is kind of boring. Compared to, like, jerk-offs… we're like, ‘No, you're amazing. Oh my god, did you see what she was doing?'” But when a crew member told her their storyline was his favorite, Bibb said, “I looked at Michelle and I was like, maybe we're not stuck. Maybe something will happen.” 

	











	Gries, who has appeared in all three past seasons, also shot down the idea he may appear in the fourth, saying, “I don't think so, but I don't know so. All I can say is every time I leave, I assume it's over.”


	Wood summed up the finale by celebrating how “there was a lot of hope in it and a lot of softness. All of the connections, the way the ladies connect with each other and the way the family did, I found it incredibly uncynical, especially for The White Lotus. It was very, very, very moving.”


	“Obviously being the one that dies, this whole time I've been so sad, like Mike kills hope! Because Chelsea is hope and he kills her,” she continued. “And it's like yeah, but then what I saw just then was like there's so much love in it, and that's why it's so much more painful because you're having to hold it all at the same time. But that's life isn't it? It's love and pain all the time.”

	The statement continued: “Clem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie. His talent, energy, and passion for music was unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable. Beyond his musicianship, Clem was a source of inspiration both on and off the stage. His vibrant spirit, infectious enthusiasm and rock solid work ethic touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.”

	











	Burke (born Clement Anthony Bozewski in Bayonne, N.J. on Nov. 24, 1954) joined punk/new wave pioneers Blondie in 1975, not long after the group was formed by singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein.

	Burke performed on all of Blondie's albums, from their 1976 self-titled debut, to their breakthrough 1978 LP Parallel Lines (which featured their Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Heart of Glass”), 1979's Eat to the Beat and 1980's Autoamerican. He was behind the kit during a pivotal, world-changing time in mid-1970s New York when Blondie, along with The Ramones, Patti Smith, Talking Heads and Television, were regularly playing in such legendary bars as CBGB and Max's Kansas City, setting the stage for the punk revolution in America, and across the world. 


	Following their string of hit albums, the band announced their split in late 1982 before getting the original members back together for a brief 1997 tour and then a world jaunt the next year and a new album, No Exit, in 1999. The group's eighth studio album, The Curse of Blondie, dropped in 2003, followed by more touring and 2014's Ghosts of Download album and their final known recorded set with Burke, 2017's Pollinator LP.


	With an exuberant, high-energy style influenced by the Who's Keith Moon and Beatles' Ringo Starr — he played left-handed on a right-handed kit just like Ringo — Burke told Tidal in 2022 that he never thought of his day job as work. “Especially when I do things with my friends and my little side projects that I have with various bands,” he said. “With drumming, you kind of have to keep doing it. You don't really wanna lose your chops. You wanna be prepared to play when you have to play. So it works both ways. I help people out by playing with them, and they help me to keep my abilities together.”

	











	He also noted in that interview that the thing that initially attracted him to Stein and Harry was that he was on a quest to find his David Bowie, Jim Morrison or Mick Jagger. “I was emphatic about that. I needed to work with people that I felt had that sort of charisma and creativity,” he said. “Debbie was amazing. You could sense that immediately. And I'm not talking about just her beauty. I'm just talking about her whole essence as a human being, as a person. I would put her on the same level as Bowie, as far as the things that she comes up with creatively.”


	After Blondie's split in 1982, Burke stayed very busy performing and recording with a wide variety of bands, including the Romantics, Pete Townshend, Iggy Pop, Plimsouls, Bob Dylan, the Eurythmics, Joan Jett, Wanda Jackson, Dramarama, Nancy Sinatra and Johnny Thunders. He even briefly filled in for a couple of gigs in 1987 for his pals in the Ramones under the stage name Elvis Ramone. During his eight-year (1980-1988) run with the Eurythmics, Burke performed on three albums with the group, including on their 1986 Grammy winning single “Missionary Man.”


	He also teamed up in 1983 with another '80s punk icon, former (and again) Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, to form the group Chequered Past with vocalist Michael Des Barres and bassist Tony Sales and former Blondie bassist Nigel Harrison. In keeping with his indefatigable work ethic and affection for fellow punk-era players, Burke formed another all-star group in 2011, the International Swingers, which featured another Sex Pistols refugee, bassist Glen Matlock, as well as Generation X guitarist James Stevenson and Supernaut singer Gary Twinn.


	Burke is featured on all of the Blondie's No. 1 hits, which also included “Call Me,” “The Tide Is High” and “Rapture,” providing whatever the songs needed, from funky disco-leaning rhythms to reggae, funk and pop beats. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 alongside  bandmates Harry, Stein, founding keyboardist Jimmy Destri and bassist Gary Valentine and guitarist Frank Infante. 

	











	In their tribute to their lost friend, Blondie honored Burke's many side gigs, writing, “Clem's influence extended far beyond Blondie. A self proclaimed ‘Rock & Roll survivalist,' he played and collaborated with numerous iconic artists, including Eurythmics, Ramones, Bob Dylan, Bob Geldof, Iggy Pop, Joan Jett, Chequered Past, The Fleshtones, The Romantics, Dramarama, The Adult Net, The Split Squad, The International Swingers, L.A.M.F., Empty Hearts, Slinky Vagabond, and even the Go-Go's. His influence and contributions have spanned decades and genres, leaving an indelible mark on every project he was a part of.”


	The message ended with condolences for Burke's family, friends and fans across the world. “His legacy will live on through the tremendous amount of music he created and the countless lives he touched,” Blondie said.

	A couple is ready to “take it the next level” after a nice date in the “Making Love” sketch that aired on SNL Saturday night (April 5). Silk pajama-clad lovers-to-be (Jack Black and Sarah Sherman) turn the night into a musical performance, with a little help from Bowen Yang and Brandi Carlile — and with all four of them flying.


	Black, the host of Saturday Night Live‘s latest episode, and Sherman are lifted up as they sing (and making swimming motions in the air). 


	“First we do things to me for a while,” Black sings, “and then we do things to you for not that long.”

	They try to incorporate some dirty talk, and get the champagne flowing — right into Sherman's eyeballs.


	“That was so romantic,” Sherman musters, to which Black agrees: “For me as well.” Together, they harmonize: “Because we're making love.“


	“Then without even saying a word, we both know it's time to bring in a third,” they sing.


	“Hello, I'm here to fix your problems,” croons Yang, who appears out of nowhere. “And this will definitely end well.”


	Spoiler: Black panics, feels weird for inviting a guy from work to join them, and decides the way to make things all right and “dandy” is “to bring in a fourth … and the fourth is Brandi.”


	Watch the “Making Love” sketch below to hear the always-cool Carlile croon her words of wisdom while mid-air.


	Elsewhere on Saturday night's show, the singer-songwriter fulfilled her duties as musical guest with Elton John, performing “Little Richard's Bible” and “Who Believes in Angels?” from their new album released this week. Carlile and John's collaborative project, Who Believes in Angels?, was released on Friday (April 4).

Robert De Niro will receive the Cannes Film Festival‘s honorary Palme d'Or at the opening night ceremony of the 78th edition, the festival has confirmed.


	As part of the honor, De Niro wil also give an onstage masterclass in the Debussy Theatre for festival-goers on May 14.


	De Niro has been a frequent presence at Cannes over the years. He was last on the Croisette in 2023 to debut Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon. De Niro was president of the Cannes jury in 2011. 


	“I have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,” De Niro said in a statement provided by the festival. “Especially now, when there's so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together — storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It's like coming home.”

	De Niro is one of contemporary cinema's most beloved figures. His history at the Cannes Film Festival is stacked. In 1976, he starred in two competition films, Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, which won the Palme d'Or. 


	He opened the festival in 1982 with Scorsese's The King of Comedy, and the next year presented Once Upon a Time in America, Sergio Leone's last film, before returning to the Croisette with Roland Joffé's The Mission, which also won the Palme.


	De Niro was last seen onscreen in Netflix's political thriller Zero Day and Barry Levinson's Alto Knights. 


	This year's Cannes Film Festival runs May 13 to 24.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


SPOILER ALERT: The story includes details about the Season 3 finale of HBO's The White Lotus, created by Mike White. 


Sam Nivola just went down in The White Lotus history for playing the first murder victim who lived to tell the story. His character Lochlan Ratliff did not even realize he got this close to being (accidentally) killed by his own father.


	If you thought that Lochlan finally facing his brother Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger) over that drug-infused Episode 6 brother-on-brother sex act would be his biggest moment in the finale, you were not even close. Yes, Saxon finally confronted Lochlan over the events of that night on the yacht, and Lochlan's explanation — while pretty weird — seemed to squash the incest speculation that had surrounded Season 3 from the start, reaching fever pitch after Episode 6.

	











	“In a family of narcissists … I am a pleaser and want to be give people what they want,” Lochlan told Saxon, explaining that since all his brother cares about is “getting off,” he felt Saxon was “left out” during the sex romp so he decided to help his brother out. OK…




			Watch on Deadline		







	There was also Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook) rejecting her brother Lochlan's offer to spend a year with her at Thailand's Buddhist center. But the real drama surrounding the Ratliff family came when dad Timothy (Jason Isaacs), facing financial ruin, concocted a plan to poison everyone but Lochlan since the youngest sibling seemed to be the only one in the family who thinks he can live without money.


	Timothy changed his mind at the last minute but there were some seeds of the poisonous “suicide tree” fruit left in the blender, and they got into Lochlan's protein shake the next morning. He threw up but then seemingly died, with his family flashing before his eyes and visions of drowning as, from the surface, four monk-like figures look at him from above.


	His father, who somehow slept through the blender noise despite finally running out of Lorazepam the night before, was stricken by grief when he found his son lying by the pool, motionless. Only after Rick (Walton Goggins) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) got shot to death did Lochlan come back to life, waking up in his father's arms.


RELATED: Mike White Teases Location For Season 4 Of ‘The White Lotus'












	In an interview with Deadline after the Season 3 finale, Nivola spoke about Lochlan's near-death experience and what may have saved him. He discussed filming the “death” scene with Issacs as well as the underwater sequence, revealing another version of it that didn't make the final cut, which would've thrown viewers off even more as it had Lochlan in one of The White Lotus‘ signature body bags. (The Episode 6 line from the Buddhist monk's speech to Timothy, “You die, you land back into the water” already gave the drowning scene a strong death vibe.)


	Nivola shared the extended version of another finale scene that was trimmed and addressed Lochlan's heart-to-heart with Saxon. He dissected Lochlan's justification for his actions, explained whether Lochlan is sexually attracted to his brother and addressed again his sexuality. Nivola also revealed how the viral scene of Saxon and Lochlan wearing each other's swim trunks after the yacht sex scene came about. 


	He also spoke about why Lochlan wanted to stay in Thailand with Piper, what may be next for the Ratliffs, would Lochlan choose UNC over Duke and whether the trip and near-death experience has changed him. Nivola also addressed whether his and Schwarzenegger's similar upbringing as children of well known actors factored into the duo's close personal relationship.


DEADLINE: When did you find out that Lochlan would have a near-death experience in the finale? 


NIVOLA: When I read the script right at the beginning. We got sent all the scripts just a few days before we flew out to Thailand, so I knew it all coming in, which, thank god. It's so annoying sometimes with these big shows, they're so secretive that they don't let the actors read the script, which really frustrates me, because it's like what, you think the actors are gonna leak their own material? We need to know what the f*ck is going on in the show if we're gonna do a good job.


DEADLINE: When you read that scene with Lochlan by the pool, did you have any inkling that he would survive? It looked like a real death…


NIVOLA: Yeah, I totally thought he was gonna die before I got to the end of the episode, and then I was happy he didn't. I think it's a good little red herring because I think it would have been too sad if he died, and it's a great distraction from the people who actually die because then you don't expect that even more. It's great storytelling from Mike, as always.


DEADLINE: Was this your first death scene? 


NIVOLA: Yes, it was.


DEADLINE: Did knowing that Lochlan is headed to that near-death experience impact how you played him throughout the season? 


NIVOLA: I didn't actually play him differently. I think Walton and Aimee Lou's storyline, for example, feels very much like there's a Chekhov's Gun involved, and some sh*t is gonna hit the fan and someone's gonna die, and I think they did a great job of playing that suspense the whole time. I think what made it easier for me —  but also just made sense — is that I don't feel like it's really expected. It's not like Lochlan is living in some sort of very dangerous situation. And so, I played him just like how I would play him normally because it's not like he knows he's gonna potentially die.


DEADLINE: To be clear, was it the vomiting that allowed Lochlan to survive the poisoning?


NIVOLA: I think so, yeah, I think he got it all out. And also, I think maybe it wouldn't have killed him anyway, because obviously Timothy doesn't know about the dosage, how much of these seeds you need to actually kill someone. He's got a couple of fruits, but then I only got the residue of it in the blender. 

	











DEADLINE: How was it filming the scene where Jason Isaacs is holding Lochlan's lifeless body? Was it emotional for you?


NIVOLA: It was because I love him so much, and it was sad seeing him sad. He got himself really worked up, and he was saying that he was thinking of his own kids dying, and that made me really sad, because I had also just met his kids who were so sweet. Yeah, it's emotional, especially because this show makes you so close to your character because you're living in the same place that your character lives and you're hanging out with your family members.


DEADLINE: What about the underwater “death” scene? 


NIVOLA: We filmed that fully underwater. It was really scary, It was kind of amazing. I was down there, probably 10 feet underwater, with scuba divers all around me giving me their oxygen masks. I couldn't see, obviously, because I didn't have goggles on. We shot it all day, and we did a couple versions of it where I was in a body bag and crawling out of a body bag in my dream. 


	And that was so scary, because I had to be zipped in a body bag with no air, and then unzip myself. Of course, it was all safe. They wouldn't have put me in a in a unsafe situation, but it was really scary in a fun way.


DEADLINE: Mike White is known for filming longer episodes before trimming them down. Was there another scene that didn't make the final cut?


NIVOLA: Part of the scene that I have with Timothy where he says, You think you could live with no money? and I say, Yes, I think I could. The rest of that scene got cut out. He says, What are you reading? And I'm like, I'm reading this book about tsunamis, and f*cking 300,000 people died, or however many it was. How do you find any meaning in life when it can all just change like that on a dime, which I think was a cool way of describing the turmoil that he's going through. And then Timothy says, What if money doesn't matter or something? And I'm like, Okay, I don't see how that's related to what I just said and he is just totally thinking about his own thing. That was a funny little bit.


DEADLINE: We have to discuss Lochlan's conversation with Saxon in the finale. He seems to be trying to put all that incest talk to rest. It was an extreme people pleaser situation where Lochlan didn't have sexual intentions toward Saxon; he just wanted to be nice to his brother because he felt he was left out. Is that right? 


NIVOLA: Yeah, I think that's exactly it. He's a people pleaser. His brother's whole thing is, I'm the sex guy, I'm really into sex, one of my passions in life is sex and money, basically, and working out. The reason Lochlan wants to get laid is because he wants to do what his brother wants him to do, he just wants approval from him because he looks up to his brother, and so then the whole sex act is just a really f*cked up, extreme way of trying to make him happy and proud.


DEADLINE: Did we find out anything more about Lochlan's sexuality or was that still left open?


NIVOLA: I don't think he's sexually attracted to his brother. To me, that wasn't something I was thinking about, like he's gay or straight or whatever he is. I don't think it really matters for his purposes, or for my purposes as an actor because I think his whole struggle isn't about sex, and it's not about love, and it's not about sexuality. It's more about just people and his relationship to people, whether they'd be male or female or anything in between.

	











DEADLINE: Lochlan and Saxon swapped swim trunks coming off the yacht. Was it something you did for fun and everybody got obsessed over it, or was it an accident?


NIVOLA: No, It was Mike's idea. He thought it would be really funny. We were about to start shooting the first scene that took place the next day. He was like, wait, you can swap, it would be really funny. And we did it.


	I'm happy people are noticing it. We didn't think anyone was going to notice, but I think it's pretty hilarious because they also don't fit: my shorts are way too tight on him, and his are way too baggy on me, and it looks ridiculous.


DEADLINE: What lies ahead for the Ratliffs? It seems like Lochlan is the most adjusted to the new reality because he doesn't care about money that much. What do you see happening? Will Lochlan go to UNC over Duke now because it's a public university and significantly cheaper in-state. Is college even an option?


NIVOLA: I don't know. It's such an earth-shattering thing that's happening to them, I don't know what's going to happen, how their way of life is going to change. I think of all of them, Lochlan is probably best prepared to deal with the no money, not for good reasons, but because he is already so lost that he can't really get much more lost than he already is.


	So I think he'll be all right. I don't even know if he'll go to college, I don't even know if that's the right thing. I don't know what he needs, and he definitely doesn't know what he needs.


DEADLINE: There was a moment where Lochlan didn't even want to go back to America; he was prepared to stay in Thailand a whole year with Piper. What was that about?


NIVOLA: That's just about wanting to connect with his sister. It's very similar to the other thing, actually. He just wants the approval and love and attention and respect of his siblings who he really looks up to and who he's really close to, and I think he just wants Piper to like him. And so he's like, I'll do the thing you're doing. And that's why, again, it's really confusing to him when she's like, I don't want you to come. Like, why, I thought that would be a fun thing for us to do together.


DEADLINE: When he woke up, Lochlan told his dad “I saw God.” Will this change him you think?


NIVOLA: No, I don't think it will. I think he wants to have a spiritual experience. For example, I think God and religion are a really beautiful way that many people find identity and find a way to define themselves and figure out what kind of a person they are — I think he wants that for sure. And he's been watching Piper go through that spiritual journey as well. I think he's just grasping at straws. I don't think he really does change very much. He's still in the really sh*tty circumstance that he's in, and he still has all these insecurities.


DEADLINE: You'd mentioned in an interview that Lochlan came to Thailand completely lost and is leaving completely lost. So he's taking nothing away from this experience?


NIVOLA: No, I don't think so. I think he definitely takes away the fact that you shouldn't sleep with your brother, and that that's a bad thing. I think he definitely knows that now. But I think part of what's so good about Mike's writing is that it would be too simple if it were The White Lotus is a hotel that changes you: you come in one person, you leave another person. That's just not really how life works. 

	











	Some people change when they go through intense, traumatic experiences, some people never change, and that's just how life goes. And that's not to say that he won't ever change. He is 18 years old, he's got a long life to live, and most people haven't figured out who they are at 18. I'm 21, I still don't know who I am. I think he will figure it out. But I don't think this week at a hotel, even though all that crazy stuff happened, will change him very much.


DEADLINE: You have spoken about your off-screen bond with Patrick Schwarzenegger. Could it be your similar upbringing that brought you closer together? You both have been in the spotlight since you were little with famous parents?


NIVOLA: It's very different. His dad is Arnold Schwarzenegger, and my parents are amazingly talented, brilliant people [actors Emily Mortimer and Alessandro Nivola], but they're a lot less in the public eye. He grew up with security, and his dad was the governor of the state of California. It was definitely different in a lot of ways but also similar. And I think we did bond on that but also on so many other things. I feel just as close with Sarah Catherine as I do to him because I think we have the shared lived experience of being young actors and going around and also the shared experience of being in Thailand all together, which was such a specific, strange, beautiful thing that only we really understand, and everyone else in this cast.


DEADLINE: The White Lotus has been a big series for you: first on-screen kiss, first sex scene, first death.


NIVOLA: Yeah, a lot of firsts. First time to Thailand.  I'm sad it's coming to an end, and I love all those people I worked with. I've loved to have them all as friends, and I'm so grateful that everyone is liking the show.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","How Kevin Bacon & His Wife Overcame Losing Their Fortune to Bernie Madoff","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kevin-bacon-overcame-bernie-madoff-scheme/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 03:59:01 GMT","

Actor Kevin Bacon has not spoken much about Bernie Madoff since he and his wife were victims in the Ponzi scheme that led to Madoff's arrest in 2008.

However, in an interview with Esquire that was published on April 4, they asked if it was okay to discuss Madoff.  

“There's not that much to say, really,” Bacon answered. “If it seems too good to be true, then it's too good to be true.” 

The interviewer followed that up by noting that Bacon and his wife, Kyra Sedgwick appeared to be not “too jaded from the experience”

 “No, not jaded,” he answered. “More careful. But not jaded.”

“I go to this gym. It has a few machines and only a handful of people there at any given time. There's no showers, it's very bare bones,” he added. “But there's a leg press machine. A leg press can be brutal… The machine is right next to a window, and when I look out that window, I'm looking right at the building where Madoff was.” 

“I'm in excruciating pain, doing the leg press, staring out that window,” Bacon continued. “It's perfect, in a funny way, because I also have to think, I can get through this. And that's how we felt about Madoff.

Bacon has never revealed the exact amount he lost to Madoff, but Madoff's Ponzi scheme is said to have defrauded people of an estimated $64.8 billion total. 

While it was a very tough time for Bacon after they learned they had been defrauded by Madoff, he leaned on his family to help him get through it. 

“It sucked, and we were certainly angry and all the things,” Bacon explained to Esquire. “But then we woke up the next day and said, ‘What do we got? We love each other. We love our children. We're healthy. No one took away our ability to make a living.' So we got back to work.”

A post shared by Kevin Bacon (@kevinbacon)

In 2022, Bacon appeared on the Smartless podcast, hosted by Jason Batemen, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes, and opened up about how he was impacted by Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. 

Specifically, Bacon revealed that he and Sedgwick “had most of our money in Madoff” and admitted that he received a “portion” of the losses returned, but not everything.

“Certainly, you get angry and stuff, but I have to say, there were a lot of people who were much worse off than we were – old people, people whose retirement funds were completely decimated,” Bacon said on Smartless. “So there's always going to be somebody that's going to have it a lot worse than you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Sons of Anarchy Reboot: Everything Revealed By the Cast So Far","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/sons-of-anarchy-reboot-rumors/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:13:27 GMT","

Rumors have started to swirl, and speculation is mounting among fans about a potential “Sons of Anarchy” reboot. Created by Kurt Sutter, the series originally aired from 2008 to 2014 and followed the criminal exploits of an outlaw motorcycle club in a fictional California town.

After seven acclaimed seasons, the show concluded with a dramatic finale and later inspired the spinoff, “Mayans M.C.” Now, comments from cast members are fueling discussions about a possible return and it is generating significant buzz. Here's what we know so far about these intriguing developments.

During a recent panel for the movie Emily the Criminal, star Theo Rossi—who portrayed hacker and intelligence officer Juice Ortiz on SOA—was asked about a possible reboot or spinoff. 

“There might be something coming up where we're all back together, which is insane… If it happens, it's wild, but if it doesn't, it would be perfect and really cool because we also talk every day,” Rossi revealed.

This cryptic statement, first reported by Deadline, suggested a new project could reunite him with co-stars, including Charlie Hunnam. However, both Juice and Hunnam's Jax Teller met tragic ends in the original series, raising questions about how such a reunion could occur.

Hunnam's Jax Teller was the heart of “Sons of Anarchy,” but he appeared to die in the series finale. Fans will never forget when he rode his motorcycle into an oncoming semi-trailer as a sacrificial act reminiscent of Hamlet. This connection was even emphasized with a Shakespearean quote. 

Jax's death seemed final, but the lack of a body has fueled speculation. Is it possible that he faked it?

A “Sons of Anarchy” spinoff doesn't necessarily mean a continuation of Jax's story, though. Another possibility is a sequel series focused on Jax's sons, Abel and Thomas. This would allow for Jax to appear in flashbacks or in dreams. 

At Liverpool Comic Con in 2022, Hunnam actually pitched a different angle for a sequel when he mentioned a project that “doesn't involve Jax Teller, but does involve me.” He described this fresh narrative at the time as being in the early stages, with “the ingredients just being measured out.”

He also teased a potential return while speaking to Access Hollywood.

“I have an idea that I'm exploring in its infancy where that could be a possibility.

“It would be something that I would be incredibly excited about, so we're sort of, like I said, in the infancy of exploring the viability of the idea,” he told the outlet.

Since “Sons of Anarchy” ended more than a decade ago, Hunnam has built a diverse resume in both film and television. He starred in “Crimson Peak” (2015), “The Lost City of Z” (2016), “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” (2017), and “The Gentlemen” (2019). 

He also had supporting roles in “Triple Frontier” (2019) and “Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire” (2023). 

Looking ahead, Hunnam recently wrapped filming on season 3 of the Netflix hit, “Monster.” He is also set to lead “Criminal”, an upcoming TV adaptation of Ed Brubaker's comic series, alongside Emilia Clarke and Luke Evans.

Despite his busy schedule, Hunnam remains tied to “Sons.” He reiterated at Liverpool Comic Con in 2023 that a non-Jax project was in development, but it was still in the very early stages. Fans will just have to wait and see what happens.

All seven seasons of “Sons of Anarchy” are streaming on Hulu.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Why Scream Queen Jenna Ortega Really Left the ‘Scream' Franchise","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/scream-queen-jenna-ortega-left-scream/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Jenna Ortega's role in the “Scream” reboot has been praised for helping to reinvent the franchise.

When the actress revealed that she wouldn't return to the decades old movie series, fans were shocked.

Ortega recently revealed why she ultimately decided not to come back.

Speaking with The Cut about her new movie “Death Of A Unicorn,” Ortega says the original reports of her shooting schedule creating conflicts were untrue. 

“It had nothing to do with pay or scheduling,” Ortega says. Deadline originally reported that Netflix's “Wednesday” was taking up the actress' time. 

Ortega cites that a lot was happening at the time. Her costar, Melissa Barrera, was caught up in controversy surrounding comments she made. And “Scream VI” directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin already left the project after indicating they hoped the series would continue with or without them.

“The Melissa stuff was happening and it was all kind of falling apart,” the actress continues. 

Gillett and Olpin left the movie to focus on their 2024 film “Abigail.” Christopher Landon stepped up to direct “Scream VII” before deciding to leave the project due to creative differences.

“If ‘Scream VII' wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”

Kevin Williamson ultimately took the reins of the movie, which started shooting in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2025.

A post shared by Jenna Ortega (@jennaortega)

Later in the interview, Ortega notes that she feels more confident in her career as she has more control over things like her “Wednesday” character. She became a producer of the show during its second season, something she'd been aiming for since season one.

“I feel a bit more empowered to speak my mind,” she tells The Cut.

Ortega isn't unfamiliar with franchises. She stars in the previously mentioned “Wednesday” series that is a spinoff of “The Adams Family.” She also took on the role of Lydia Deetz in “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”

“I've happened to join a lot of franchises, which is so great to be a part of legacy,” says Ortega of her recent work. 

Right now, the actress wants to make new things that aren't based on intellectual property. 

““I'm really trying to prioritize new directors and original stories,” Ortega adds. “I know on the outside, maybe people are looking at my choices like, ‘Man, what the hell is this girl doing?' I never thought I would do a movie with unicorns. But an original script is exciting. If I can help get it made, I love to do that.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hunky Co-Star Added to ‘Chicken Sisters' Cast as Hallmark Confirms 2nd Season","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/chicken-sisters-renewed-david-james-elliott/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:13:27 GMT","

Good news for fans devouring “The Chicken Sisters” as Hallmark Channel airs its first season, which premiered exclusively on Hallmark+ in the fall of 2024. On April 7, 2025, the network confirmed via Deadline that the star-studded series has been renewed for a second season. Not only that, but the show has a new home and a new Hallmark hunk on board. 

A post shared by David James Elliott (@djameselliott)

As previously reported, the series renewal is no surprise to the cast of “The Chicken Sisters” — led by Lea Thompson (Nancy), Wendie Malick (Gus), Schuyler Fisk (Amanda), and Genevieve Angelson (Mae). They have already reunited in Vancouver to film the new season. On April 4, Angelson posted a photo in her Instagram Stories while getting her hair and makeup done, writing, “and we're back!” 

But according to Deadline, they'll be joined by a new cast member for season 2 — actor David James Elliott, best known for the decade he spent, from 1995 to 2005, starring on “JAG” opposite another Hallmark star, Catherine Bell. Elliott, 64, will play a man from Gus' past who returns to the fictional town of Merinac, Kansas. 

He joins a handful of Hallmark hunks who are part of the cast, including “Ruby Herring Mysteries” alum James Kot, who plays Amanda's husband and new restaurant owner Frank Jr. The first season cast also included “Ride” alum Jake Foy and Ektor Rivera, who co-starred with Lacey Chabert in 2022's “Groundswell,” but their casting for season two hasn't been confirmed yet. 

Based on KJ Dell'Antonia's popular book of the same name, “The Chicken Sisters” follows the drama between two fried chicken restaurants in the same small town, Mimi's and Frannie's. 

The townspeople's loyalty is deeply divided over the restaurants, owned by separate families with complicated ties to each other. The drama is only exacerbated by the arrival of a production crew for the reality TV show “Kitchen Clash.” 

Months after the first season of “The Chicken Sisters” premiered on Hallmark+, where it's still available to stream, the series made its Hallmark Channel debut on March 30, airing on Sunday nights through May 18. According to Deadline, the second season will premiere on Hallmark Channel, with each new episode available to stream the day after it airs. 

In another interesting shift behind the scenes, series co-creator and season one showrunner Annie Mebane has been replaced by Erin Gibson, who was a writer on the first season. 

Samantha DiPippo, senior vice president of programming for Hallmark Media, told Deadline, “We're grateful to Annie Mebane for creating the series for television and expertly bringing to life the town of Merinac and its colorful characters in K.J. Dell'Antonia's beloved book. The show is in great hands with Erin Gibson taking the reins as showrunner this season and we know that our stellar cast … will serve up something special for viewers.”

After Hallmark Channel aired the first episode on March 30, Fisk shared some behind-the-scenes details in her Instagram Stories, including gushing about her castmates. The daughter of Hollywood legend Sissy Spacek, Fisk said it's “a dream to get to act alongside the incredible wendie malick” and called Angelson “the best tv sister” and “the bessssst friend.” 

Of her TV mom, Thompson, Fisk wrote, “i sat next to @lea_thompson at our first table read for the show after basically just meeting her. i was (still am) so in awe of her. she has a poise and strength and a vibe that you just want to be around.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","HGTV Fans Thrilled About Star's Just-Announced Return","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/scott-mcgillivray-vacation-house-rules-2025/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 03:59:01 GMT","

HGTV has packed its April 2025 schedule with new shows, from kicking off the sixth season of “Rock the Block” to debuting the new series “Castle Impossible.” 

On April 4, the network added one more surprise to the schedule: a new season of “Vacation House Rules” with real estate investor and contractor Scott McGillivray and his designer, Debra Salmoni — music to the ears of fans in the U.S. who have wondered whether the Canadian-based show would air again on HGTV. 

Season 6 of “Vacation House Rules” is already scheduled to premiere on Canada's new Home Network on April 7. For U.S. fans, HGTV now says it will debut on April 26. 

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

Fans were thrilled to see the news of Scott McGillivray's return on HGTV's social media accounts, given that there hadn't been any status updates on the shows since it last aired in the spring of 2024. Thousands liked and commented on the post. 

“I absolutely love Scott's show & any show he is on or hosts,” one person wrote on Facebook. “He so knowledgeable & so genuine. He's a wonderful host, am so happy he's back!!!!! ❤️❤️”

Another wrote, “I enjoy Scott and Debra so much! They have a great chemistry. Glad to see them back!”

On Instagram, one fan gushed, “😊😊This is GREAT news! LOVE, LOVE his show!” while numerous others called it “the best show ever 😍.”

A post shared by Scott McGillivray (@scott_mcgillivray)

In “Vacation House Rules,” McGillivray renovates vacation homes alongside designer and friend Debra Salmoni. Together, the duo transform spaces in ways that will help their clients create new revenue streams by renting out the getaways. Filmed in Ontario, the series typically premieres in Canada weeks before making its way to U.S. airwaves.

McGillivray, who is married with two daughters, first appeared on HGTV Canada on “Income Property” in 2009. He's also helmed the Canadian series “Moving the McGillivrays,” “Buyers Bootcamp,” and “Renovation Resort Showdown” with his longtime friend and fellow HGTV star Bryan Baeumler. In 2024, he pitched in on HGTV's “100 Day Hotel Challenge” with Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt. 

On April 3, McGillivray told CTV that he's grateful for every chance he gets to keep doing what he loves.

“I like fixing things, that's what I love to do,” he told the outlet. “So, fortunately for me, I get to get up every day find something wrong and try to fix it, whether it's a real estate challenge or a renovation challenge or a design challenge. You know, I've been kind of blessed to be able to share that with everybody throughout the shows for so many years.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Cameron Mathison Bravely Searches Debris of His Destroyed Home","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/cameron-mathison-debris-destroyed-home/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 11:35:12 GMT","

Hallmark alum Cameron Mathison lost nearly everything after his home was destroyed in the fires that ravaged  Los Angeles in January. On April 6, 2025, Mathison shared on social media that he was bravely going through the debris, hoping to find anything left. 

Mathison's home was a total loss after fires swept through L.A. He was able to grab a few items when he evacuated, but almost everything was destroyed.  

Now, months later, he's hoping to find a few items that might somehow be salvageable. 

In an Instagram reel, Mathison shared a photo of himself wearing hazmat gear as he was just about to start digging through the rubble. He simply captioned the photo with a crying emoji. 

In a video, he said, “Spending the day here in Altadena at what is left of our beautiful home. This swing, the kids grew up on, it's all falling apart but it still kind of exists. So we're looking through the rubble, through the debris, to find anything at all that we can find to salvage. We've got some jewelry that we're looking for, some china, some Tibetan statues and art, and here we go. Just fingers crossed we get something, you know? Just memories.” 

Behind him, as he talked, he showed the debris that marked all that was left of his once stunning home.

In another Instagram reel video, he showed a team of people in hazmat suits working with him to look through the rubble for anything that could be salvaged. 

He wrote, “So so grateful for all the help from family and friends today.”

In March, Mathison reached out on social media and asked anyone who was a part of his past to help him rebuild lost memories. 

A post shared by Cameron Mathison (@cameronmathison)

He wrote: “I'm on a mission to rebuild a lifetime of memories that were lost in the fire—please share any PHOTOS you have of me and the family from over the years. I'd be so grateful if you could pass this request along to anyone else who knows me, so I can piece back together the moments that mean so much!”

He asked anyone with photos to email them to him so he could start piecing back together what was lost. Specifically, he asked for photos from elementary school, his modeling years, his children, or any other major moments in his life.

In a new interview, Jenna Ortega clarified why she stepped away from the “Scream” franchise. The actress, who starred in the fifth and sixth “Scream” films as Tara Carpenter, confirmed in 2023 that she was not returning for the seventh franchise installment. It was originally reported that “Scream VII” conflicted with her “Wednesday” Season 2 shoot in Ireland after the SAG-AFTRA strikes. The announcement that Ortega was leaving “Scream VII” was announced one day after co-star Melissa Barrera's firing. 

Now, Ortega has shared that her exit was in fact because the film itself was “falling apart.”

 










Ortega's co-star Barrera, who played her onscreen half-sister, was fired for pro-Palestine comments that “Scream” production company Spyglass Entertainment deemed antisemitic. Directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, who helmed the fifth and sixth films in the series, had already parted ways with the franchise; Christopher Landon was going to direct the seventh film, but also left the project amid the backlash.

Ortega cited the turmoil of “Scream VII” as to why she decided to leave the film. “It had nothing to do with pay or scheduling,” Ortega told The Cut. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart. If ‘Scream VII' wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”

These days, Ortega is leading recent A24 release “Death of a Unicorn,” as well as reprising her titular “Wednesday” role for the series.

As for “Scream VII,” original star Neve Campbell will now be back in the franchise as Sidney Prescott, after sitting out from the sixth film due to a pay dispute; reboot actors Mason Gooding and Jasmin Savoy Brown will also return for the seventh installment. The first “Scream” actor Matthew Lillard will additionally star despite his character Stu being (most likely) deceased, with original screenwriter Kevin Williamson directing.

Barrera previously told Deadline that she considers Ortega to be her “family for life.” Of being part of the “Scream” franchise for two films, she said, “I'm grateful of what I got to infuse in[to] the franchise and that's something I will be proud of forever.”

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 8, “Amor Fati.”]

“The White Lotus” did warn us: Violence begets violence.

In the Season 3 finale of Mike White's treacherous drama, cycles of violence take center stage as they spin on, end, or reroute in terrifying directions. Once again, a few days in paradise has left these characters changed forever — at least the ones who survived.

After conceding that he isn't a violent man, Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) finds himself at a crossroads. On one side, there is nonviolence, his Buddhist upbringing, and leaving the job he takes such pride in to pursue other avenues; in the other direction, accepting the option or at least the reality of violence will further his current career, and possibly his relationship with Lisa Manobal's Mook, who is weirdly rigid about his options. There is a sense that her interest hinges up his machismo and his job title, and (sadly) the show has barely bothered to give her more character than that.

 








Related Stories ‘Barry Lyndon' + ‘Monkey Shines' = This Week's ‘The Righteous Gemstones' ‘Billy Joel: And So It Goes' Documentary to Open 2025 Tribeca Festival 

Gaitok's affection for Mook and his own self respect are what drive him toward his actions later in the episode. In his eyes, Valentin and his friends not only committed a crime, but violated Gaitok's trust. He was disrespected at work by a colleague, and despite his aversion to violence, he hates that he didn't spur to action during the robbery. The word “honor” doesn't come up, but Gaitok is a man who values it and wants it back.

The karmic impact of violence manifests differently with Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), who starts out adamantly against taking Greg's (Jon Gries) hush money but comes around to it, thanks to son Zion (Nicholas Duvernay). There are obvious moral qualms in taking financial gifts from someone who almost-definitely killed (or at least played a role in her demise) his wife — but it's also hard to deny Zion's practicality. They can't stop this man, they can't change what he did, and if his mom can get a better life out of it, isn't that a net positive for the universe? Zion goes full Business Bitch with Belinda's blessing, and watching her bank balance shoot up was easily the most satisfying beat in this episode.

But while Belinda escapes the violence to come and the wrath of Greg (so far), she ends up perpetuating a cycle that hurt her deeply when she leaves things hanging with Pornchai (Dom Hetrakul). Just a few episodes ago, Belinda was grappling with the pain of Tanya's (Jennifer Coolidge) rejection and how it felt to delay her dream because of a wealthy woman's whims; with Greg's donation in the bank, Belinda leaves Thailand and Pornchai in a similar position to where she herself once was.

 










When it comes to reaping what you sow, no one has done more introspection this season than Timothy (Jason Isaacs), whose business dealings and their ultimate fallout will change life as his family knows it forever. Timmy has spent his phone-free vacation ideating every fatal outcome for his family, and eventually deciding that it's not enough to take his own life, or his wife's, but that he should also kill his two eldest children out of mercy. Lochlan (Sam Nivola) — pure of heart, a self-proclaimed “pleaser,” and the only one who can find a worthwhile life without their usual luxuries — is spared the sentence, unbeknownst to him as Tim hands out the poisoned piña coladas.

“The White Lotus” hints at the dark and twisted often enough, but “Amor Fati” goes far beyond flirtation with these themes — and even then, Mike White controls the viewer. You simply cannot look away from this picture-perfect family about to die via smoothie machine, or imagine the horror Lochy will experience as witness and survivor. The nightmare gets grimly inverted the next morning, when Lochy makes his first protein shake from the dregs of the deadly fruit and ostensibly dies after a vivid vision of himself drowning and crying out to four faceless individuals for help. It's a strikingly surreal and spiritual scene for show that normally opts to mine tension from everyday human behavior, and it works even if it shifts the tone drastically. 

 










Lochy lives (I did say in a previous review that he or his siblings dying would simply be too sad), but death has officially checked in to the resort by this time. A newly composed Rick (Walton Goggins) reunites with Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) only to come face-to-face once again with Jim (Scott Glenn), who's taking no chances. The old man has a gun strapped to his person now, and he tells Rick that his mother was a “drunk and a slut” and a “liar,” that his father was not a good man. Poor Rick starts to spiral instantly; it's as if the interaction kicked him back into childhood and the character begins to re-mature at hyperspeed before our very eyes. He returns to Chelsea as a wounded child, seeks Amrita's  (Shalini Pereis) help as a source of wisdom and guidance, and finally spots Jim again while in something akin to an adolescent rage. He doesn't care about the consequences, internal or external. He just needs to do something.

Tragedy — Greek, Shakespearian, Lucasfilmic tragedy — surrounds Rick in his final moments. He executes Jim only to learn that the man was his father, but before he has time to unpack that even slightly, he's on the lam from White Lotus security in a full-blown shootout. Chelsea, of course, sticks with him, and of course catches a stray that kills her before he can even call for help. The end of Rick's life is the end of Gaitok's innocence, the violence and torment moving from the dead man into his killer.

 










And at the same time that Rick's actions destroy his life and his love, Timothy's threaten to take his son from him, but Lochlan lives. How interesting that the Ratliffs escaped a devastating fate while it so mightily befell Rick and Chelsea. Earlier in the episode Victoria told her daughter that it's their responsibility to live well in honor of those who can't — the kind of cognitive dissonance required in her position, perhaps, but the episode gives them all that chance when someone like Rick never even had it. Death loomed over him for as long as he could remember, and finally welcomed him into its arms.

In a culture where endless sequels and nonsensical IP cash grabs have muddied the grandeur of blockbuster cinema, it's nice to know we still have Tom Cruise and “Mission: Impossible.” The 7-film franchise hasn't had one miss yet — despite what many may say about the first sequel directed by John Woo — and looks to continue its streak with number 8, titled “The Final Reckoning.” This latest installment picks up directly following the events of the previous film, “Dead Reckoning,” which sees legendary spy Ethan Hunt face his most lethal foe yet in the form of an A.I. known as the Entity. Watch the trailer for the film below.

 










Originally titled “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” “The Final Reckoning” completes the plot set up in the previous film, with Hunt now in possession of the key necessary to defeat the Entity. But before he can do that, he must first gather his team to find the sunken Russian submarine that houses the source code needed to destroy the technology. This includes returning cohorts Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, as well as new players Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, both of whom appeared as adversaries in “Dead Reckoning Part One.”

Footage of Cruise's death-defying stunts for “The Final Reckoning” — including hanging off the side of a WWI bi-plane and holding his breath as a submarine fills with water — was first unveiled at CinemaCon 2025 last week with star himself in attendance. He would go on to present an award to the film's co-writer/director, Christopher McQuarrie, later in the week. Cruise also recently discussed shooting the underwater scenes in an interview with Empire.

“I'm breathing in my own carbon dioxide,” Cruise said. “It builds up in the body and affects the muscles. You have to overcome all of that while you're doing it, and be present.”

In celebration of the Memorial Day Weekend release of “The Final Reckoning,” Museum of the Moving Image is hosting a special “Mission: Impossible” exhibition that honors the stunt work involved in making the series so special. It will feature sections on each films, accompanied by behind-the-scenes footage and artifacts. This exhibit opens April 18.

Ready for another trip into the whimsical, yet emotionally nuanced world of Wes Anderson? The auteur has kept unusually busy over the last few years, releasing “The French Dispatch” in 2021 after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, “Asteroid City” in 2023, “The Wonderful World of Henry Sugar and Three More” in 2024, and now “The Phoenician Scheme” in 2025. His latest ensemble adventure is set in the world of 1940s espionage and stars returning Anderson players Benicio del Toro, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Rupert Friend, Benedict Cumberbatch, Bill Murray, and Willem Dafoe, as well as newcomers to his troupe Michael Cera, Mia Threapleton, and Riz Ahmed. Watch the trailer below.

Shot at Babelsburg Studios in Germany where Anderson produced “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and “Isle of Dogs,” “The Phoenician Scheme” sees del Toro as Zsa-zsa Korda, one of the richest men in Europe and father to Threaplton's character, Sister Liesl. Cera will portray her tutor, Bjorn Lund, with all three being wrapped up in a globe-trotting conflict involving the family business. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






Speaking with French publication Le Monde in 2023 as he was planning the project, Anderson said of the film, “My next feature film will be linear, with Benicio Del Toro in every shot. I can't tell you much more than that except that it will be about espionage, a father-daughter relationship, and, let's say, with a rather dark tone.”

Anderson wrote the screenplay himself, but conceived the story for “The Phoenician Scheme” with frequent collaborator Roman Coppola, who's credited on the screenplay of “The Darjeeling Limited” and also contributed to “Isle of Dogs,” “The French Dispatch,” and “Asteroid City.” The last script he fully co-wrote with Anderson was 2012's “Moonrise Kingdom,” which was nominated for Best Original Screenplay. However, not joining Anderson for the first time in the writer/director's career is his loyal cinematographer Robert Yeoman. Instead, “The Phoenician Scheme” was shot by French DP Bruno Delbonnel, whose credits include the recent Apple TV+ limited series from Alfonso Cuarón, “Disclaimer,” as well as “Across the Universe,” “Inside Llewyn Davis,” and “Darkest Hour.” Alexandre Desplat, who scored 6 of Anderson's films, was also part of the team.

 










“The Phoenician Scheme” is expected to be announced as part of the 2025 Cannes lineup on April 10, with Anderson having previously premiered three of his features there in the past (“Moonrise Kingdom,” “The French Dispatch,” and “Asteroid City”). Focus Features is set to distribute the film in the U.S., while the studio's parent company, Universal Pictures, will handle the international release.

“The Phoenician Scheme” will receive a limited release on May 30, followed by a nationwide rollout on June 6 from Focus Features.

When Jane Remover surprise-dropped “JRJRJR,” the sky screamed with the last fireworks and a sulfurous haze hung in the air. It was midday on January 1, 2025, and the song felt something like a war cry—instilling fear in enemies and glee in digicore OGs. And if you thought the glitch-wracked “JRJRJR” was overwhelming, then brace yourself for the apocalyptic “Psychoboost.” Named after an attack move associated with the Pokémon Deoxys, this song hits like a laser shooting through your brain. In the video game's lore, Deoxys spawned from an alien virus that descended from outer space—I wouldn't be surprised if the same scenario brought us Revengeseekerz. Rather than continue with the dustbowl shoegaze and soft balladry of Census Designated, the album does a complete 180. This is some of the most all-out intense music they've ever made, an inferno of raw thoughts that pushes everything—rap, pop, voice, their artistic persona—to the breaking point.

What kind of revenge is being sought here? Maybe revenge against industry shenanigans, revenge against people trying to see Jane fail, revenge against the world. Or maybe this is revenge without a referent, revenge as a state of mind. There are so many reasons to be defensive as an artist now, especially one with a very online, parasocial fanbase. Revenge is like an attack stance, a vehicle to talk their shit and go berserk. Jane's singing and screaming, shapeshifting and sinning, telling haters who dare speak ill to kill themselves. They're spamming Palkia battle cries and comparing themselves to Avril Lavigne. “Three years ago I could've touched a million/Three years ago I had that magic in my hand,” Jane declares at the start, knowing they've struck it again.

“Hyper” and “maximal” aren't enough to describe the extreme overload here. It reminds me of the way a computer with a low-level GPU shudders while straining to render something high-res. The flash-fire finale to “Professional Vengeance” erupts like a motherboard under magma. Sprees of giddy rap bleed into EDM pop with layers and sublayers of screams that ripple into pure noise. Every empty inch is thronged with chants and record scratches and video game samples that sound like personal heirlooms. It captures the same live-time thrill I get listening to Jane's leroy mashup tapes and NTS sets—a wonderfully unpredictable anarchy. “Experimental Skin” judders so frenetically it sounds like they recorded the song and then let five DJs tweak it out by jitter-clicking every button at once. It's hard to fathom that just two months ago Jane released an album of patiently unfurling rock under an alt account.

What makes it work so well is that this anarchy is not an anything-goes anarchy: These songs are so carefully composed, so intentional, that every cyborgian burp and steel snare fits perfectly. Everything and nothing tramples each other. Jane sculpts the songs like an animator making sure every pixel of a motion graphic is properly textured. There's the wah-wah guitar on “Fadeoutz,” the heavenly stutter-choir to open up “angels in camo,” the yawning harmonica across “Dreamflasher.” Jane practically hosts an Easter egg hunt for longtime fans, littering songs like “JRJRJR” with samples of their old music. The length of the tracks (a five-minute song could qualify as an EP in the rage rap scene) could be tiresome if not for Jane's increasingly expressive vocals. They flutter out into sweet pop melodies and contort in new and weird ways, like the maniacal laughter on “Experimental Skin.”

Inside the maelstrom is a mind sprinting just as fast, snapping between highs and lows while struggling to keep up with a lifestyle that's constantly changing. It's such a contrast to the Jane of yore, who was too afraid to record vocals at home in case it disturbed their parents. Now they're performing to thousands of feverish fans but also wracked by anxiety and trying to hold on to the relationships they cherish. There are moments of unhurried beauty, like the gothic comedown of “Dark night castle,” but the most frequent feeling is a kind of ravenous unburdening, a brain at the brink. On “Dreamflasher,” Jane desperately tries to cling on to the feeling of being loved by the one person who matters. Maybe the solution is to give it all up, they wonder: “I'd put down the mic just to feel that way forever.”

Instead of the tender working-through-differences approach favored by other introspective singer-songwriters in Jane's generation, the Revengeseekerz approach is catharsis via chaos. When you feel like your life's falling apart, fuck it—let's dance all night. Instead of wallowing in self-pity and passive aggression, let's explode some brains and give these “dead bitches a proper sendoff.” Jane's lyrics could be frustratingly opaque in the past. Here they mostly manage to balance the cryptic and direct, darting from blurry vignettes about relationships gone awry to gems like, “Jesus never had it with a freak bitch.” Jane's voice pierces the hazardous noise at moments of max impact, like when they shriek, “I can't let you bitches win!”

Everything begins and ends with “JRJRJR,” the lead single and final song on the album. Jane's swerving through Silverlake and self-doubt, talking about balling out on a new face, a new name, a new city, while the music convulses like a power plant in the early stages of implosion. Its self-possessed recklessness distills Revengeseekerz into a single concentrated blast. It's almost like a taunt: Nothing you know or think about Jane Remover will ever stay static. They can't be bound to a genre, a scene, a geographic location, or even a name.

Midway through their ambitious 2021 debut, For the First Time, Black Country, New Road jokingly called themselves “the world's second-best Slint tribute act.” Between frontman Isaac Wood's agitated sprechgesang and the group's queasy, off-center grooves, the self-inflicted burn made sense—and could have applied to a whole wave of nervy, British post-punk upstarts who talked more than they sang and attracted critical adoration around the turn of the decade.

Since then, things changed fast, even by the mercurial currents of UK rock scenes. Fontaines D.C. rose to arena status. Shame pivoted to a more melodic sound. black midi split. But no peer has transformed more dramatically than BC,NR. Wood stopped muttering and started singing, bringing a stately grandiosity to 2022's Ants From Up There—then departed the group before the album was even released. His bandmates chose to retain the name but not the songbook, sharing vocal duties and hurriedly composing new material in time for summer festival dates that they had thought would be in support of Ants.

If most bands release live albums as a stopgap release (or, less generously, a cash-in), 2023's Live at Bush Hall was something else: a document of a band reborn. Its songs were jubilant (“Up Song”), tender (“Turbines/Pigs”), democratic—and, in a rare move for a band today, without studio equivalents. In typical fashion, Black Country are already distancing themselves from that era. “I just didn't want to hang out with those songs anymore,” Tyler Hyde, bassist and one of three vocalists, told Rolling Stone UK.

Now, three years after Wood's departure, comes the studio debut of this new incarnation. And Slint, frankly, is not one of the first 2,000 reference points that come to mind. Folky and pastoral, with recorder solos and mandolin excursions and proggy journeys-in-song, Forever Howlong is as ambitious as anything this band has done. But the album radiates a deep warmth, a communal spirit that courses through the harmonies and stylistic shifts, one that has sustained this six-piece through years of upheaval and reinvention. This is music with an unabashedly twee heart, overflowing with baroque instrumentation and melody—the very things a sardonic post-punk group might regard with suspicion. 

With saxophonist Lewis Evans choosing to step away from the mic, vocal and lyric duties are now shared between three women. Violinist Georgia Ellery, also of Jockstrap fame, has the most expressive voice and buoyant pop hooks. Her “Besties,” which kicks off the album in a burst of technicolor harmonies, seems like a straightforward paean to female friendship before revealing a layer of unrequited queer yearning: “I know I want something more,” the narrator cryptically concedes, complicating the song's cheery façade. Ellery's writing is dynamic enough to bridge far-flung centuries together: Who the hell mentions TikTok in a song that opens with a Baroque-sounding harpsichord overture? Similarly, what sort of medieval traveler gets betrayed by a man who looks “just like James Dean,” as does the poor heroine of Ellery's “Two Horses,” a slow, winding narrative whose violent denouement ought to come with a warning label for equestrian lovers?

Indeed, Forever Howlong displays an affection for the archaic and the medieval that has more in common with mid-aughts indie eccentrics like Joanna Newsom or the Decemberists than the band's post-Brexit peers. Witness “For the Cold Country,” a six-and-a-half-minute prog-folk epic that's been morphing and stunning fans on tour for months. With lyrics written and sung by keyboardist May Kershaw, it chronicles a “metal-clad knight” who faces some deep identity crisis, putting down his shield and blade and accepting that his best battles are behind him. Amazingly—with the help of Kershaw's angelic voice and a gossamer, choral backing—this tale of medieval malaise is rendered without the slightest hint of ironic detachment. Instead, it goes down as the album's moving centerpiece, matched only by the next track, the Tyler Hyde-led “Nancy Tries to Take the Night,” a bleak, Oliver Twist-inspired tale that rises to a Reich-ian woodwind crescendo.

Friendship is the throughline on Forever Howlong, even when complicated by romantic yearning (“Besties”) or intergenerational disconnect (“Happy Birthday”). The knight of “For the Cold Country” only finds solace in confiding in an unnamed companion. And often, the torment that ripples through the album is social alienation of a particularly adolescent flavor. “Salem Sisters” compares struggling to connect at a summer barbecue to burning at the stake, its morbidly funny conceit enlivened by a kooky piano-pop backing, while “Mary” taps into the angst of a schoolgirl relentlessly bullied by her peers. “Made the fool/That's life at school/What a way to treat your friend,” Kershaw, Ellery, and Hyde sing in harmony before a recorder solo—one primitive enough to be played by actual schoolchildren—plays them out.

Harmony plays a vibrant role throughout the record, but it feels symbolic that the loneliest lament is the one that brings all three singers together in the vocal booth. Hyde told NME that she “wanted to have a song where we all sang on it because that highlights the sisterly bond that we have.” The band's history is already tumultuous enough to fill a Behind the Music episode, but these songwriters have continually managed to turn that bond into a treasure, reveling in the creative power of community. On Forever Howlong, Black Country, New Road is a multi-headed beast, more collective than band—one without a clear center of gravity but with an overflowing creative spirit.

Dave Allen, the bassist who played with Gang of Four in their heyday, died at home with his family on Saturday, April 5, the band announced on social media. While no cause of death was given, the band said Allen had been living with early-onset dementia for several years. He was 69 years old.

David Geoffrey Allen grew up in a working-class family in the North English town of Kendal, later moving to Leeds and playing in the local music scene. He joined Jon King, Andy Gill, and Hugo Burnham in the early days of Gang of Four, replacing original bassist Dave Wolfson in time to work on the band's 1979 debut, Entertainment! The album's spartan arrangement of post-punk and funk elements, paired with a lyric sheet full of witty barbs that critiqued and demystified consumer capitalism, made the band a cult sensation, beloved by critics, art punks, and indie-rockers for decades to come. Allen remained with the band for second album Solid Gold, a record that made waves in the United States and secured their enduring legacy as a major influence on the likes of R.E.M., Nirvana, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

After Solid Gold's release, in 1981, tensions within the group—as well as issues with exhaustion and drug use—prompted Allen to part ways with his bandmates during a tour. The same year, he formed Shriekback with XTC's Barry Andrews. It was the first in a series of Allen side projects (later including the Elastic Purejoy, Low Pop Suicide, King Swamp, and Faux Hoax) that preceded his eventual return to Gang of Four for a 2004 reunion tour. He left again soon after—there was no love lost between Allen and the late Andy Gill, who long butted heads about issues stemming from the band's early days—and entered a career in the music technology sector that landed him positions at Beats Music and Apple Music.

In their statement remembering Allen, surviving Gang of Four members Hugo Burnham and Jon King recalled a recent afternoon with Allen and his family. “We talked and laughed for hours, sharing rich and vivid memories of good times together,” they wrote. “Adventures, careers in music, raising families, our interwoven lives spanning half a century. We've been so very lucky to have had the Ace of Bass in our lives.”

Burnham and King continued, “We know that Dave would have wanted nothing more than to step onstage with us again in Portland on our farewell US tour. But it's now a bridge too far. Goodbye, Old Friend.”

	Andy Greene



	The three-decade history of Blink-182 is marked by epic highs and miserable lows. At the peak of their popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, they were selling out arenas all over the globe and scoring hits like “What's My Age Again” and “All the Small Things.” But there were also two extremely ugly band splits that played out before the public, near-death experiences due to a plane crash and a cancer battle, partial reunions, and long periods where it looked like the band would never return. The only constant member from their formation in the San Diego suburbs to the present day is singer and bassist Mark Hoppus. Here are 10 of the juiciest revelations from his new memoir, Fahrenheit-182.


	Raynor was in the band from the very beginning, and plays on their first two records, including breakout single “Dammit.” But, in 1998, Raynor was told he had to either quit drinking or quit the band. Unhappy with the ultimatum, he chose the latter. They moved on with new drummer Travis Barker, and didn't hear from Raynor for another year when he suddenly called. “He ran through a laundry list of grievances, both real and imagined, cursed me and Tom [DeLonge], called us hypocrites,” Hoppus writes. “I said I was sorry, this was just the way things were. We sat in long silence. Then we hung up. That was the last time I talked to Scott.”

	The three members of Blink were given a chance to shoot cameos in 1999's original American Pie as a high school band (with a monkey) who watched Jason Biggs' fumbling attempt at sex with Shannon Elizabeth on a webcam. They were instructed to merely look shocked at what they saw on a computer screen while a professional actor said, “That guy's in my trig class.” Hoppus blurted out “Go, trig boy. It's your birthday.” The improvised line made the final cut. When the movie became a massive hit, strangers started to yell “Go, trig boy” at him in public. “It was a quick, throwaway gag,” Hoppus writes. “I have no idea why it caught on as a popular quote. Maybe it's because the entire movie is quotable. Keep in mind, this is the movie that immortalized the phrase, ‘This one time, at band camp…'”

	“[That's] always the most fun,” he writes. “Everyone's on top of the world. Nothing can touch them. Doors open wherever they go. People kiss their rings and do any favor they ask. No one ever stops to worry what might be waiting for them around the corner in the third act. Life is too good to worry about how they might end up stuffed into a car's trunk or hanging in a meat locker.”


	At the peak of Blink's success, a woman began parking her car outside their homes. Using binoculars and a telephoto lens, she kept a journal that listed their license plates, when they typically arrived home each day, and the times they turned off their lights at night. She wasn't technically breaking any laws, but it made all of them deeply uncomfortable, and Hoppus eventually moved to a house behind a gate to get away from her. Months later, she showed up at a San Diego record store where they were signing copies of their new album. Mark and Tom quickly signed her album and avoided eye contact. Travis did not. “I'm not signing that shit,” he said. “You hang around our houses? You stalk us? You follow our wives? Get the fuck out of here, I'm not signing shit.”


	When the new band released their first LP in 2001, Hoppus shrugged it off in public. Things were very different behind the scenes. “What the fuck is going on? I asked myself,” Hoppus writes. “It was a big conspiracy against me. I questioned everything about myself: Am I bad musician? Do people think I'm a dick? What is it about my personality that's making everyone so fucking eager to do something else without me?”

	The tour came at a time when Blink-182 were ascendant and Green Day were at a low point right before American Idiot. “I got the sense that Green Day fucking hated that they'd been reduced to opening for us,” Hoppus writes. “It must have been a difficult pill to swallow. There was a lot of tension on that tour. Some nights we drank together like old war buddies. Other nights we got into screaming matches with their manager in the hallways.” They haven't toured together again despite some overtures from Blink's camp. “We keep asking for a rematch and they keep refusing,” Hoppus writes. “They're the rival gangs across town who both despise and respect each other.”

	











	DeLonge's decision to sever any direct communication made the situation even more painful.  “Everything had to go through lawyers and management,” Hoppus writes. “My best friend of more than a decade, and I had to have my people call his people. I was paying a lawyer top dollar to communicate with the kid I used to break into abandoned buildings with to skateboard…I didn't just lose my best friend. When Blink fell apart, I lost everything.”


	After DeLonge left the group, Hoppus and Barker attempted to carry on making music together under the name +44. “People knew the name Blink-182,” Hoppus writes, “but the who the hell was +44? It felt like I was giving the world a math problem.” At this same time, Hoppus feels that DeLonge's group, Angels and Airwaves, was not living up to their hype. “Tom had over-performed and under-delivered,” he writes, “which might've made people skeptical towards another post-Blink project. We had to work twice as hard for everything. All the supports and safety nets we had in place were suddenly gone. Radio stations used to roll out the red carpet for a new Blink album, but now we had to play the game and kiss ass for airplay crumbs.”

	The band got back together shortly after Travis Barker's plane crash in 2008. They cut a new LP and toured the globe, but old tensions remained. “Tom arrived as late as he could, walked directly to his dressing room, and closed the door,” Hoppus writes. “Showtime came and we did what we do. The second the show ended, he was in his car back to the hotel, never to be seen.” They had plans to tour in 2015 until DeLonge decided he didn't want to do it. “It was ridiculous,” Hoppus writes. “Tom was out of control. Pretty soon we were speaking to each other solely through management. All fighters retreated to their corners to sulk as the saddest millionaires punk rock ever suffered. Did we really get the band back together only to end up running it into the ground, reverting to petty arguments about schedules? Again?”


	Tom became my best friend again,” Hoppus writes. “Some days I just wanted to waste away on a couch feeling sorry for myself. But Tom wouldn't let me. Every day he sent me a new joke. Or an old photo of us rocking out. Or just a dick pic .The past was never mentioned. All that mattered was right now.”

	If anyone knows her way around protests, it's Daryl Hannah. The actress and director has been arrested a half-dozen times protesting for environmental causes. But even she can have a hard time getting her head around the almost daily chaos of the second Trump administration.


	“There are too many horrible things to even talk about,” she says from California, where she's been helping her family deal with the loss of their home from the L.A. fires. “A lot of my focus has to do with the environment and the potential destruction, considering what we've been facing already with these fires, floods, hurricanes, and global devastation. To not take that seriously and start going in the other direction is just so fucking stupid. Sorry for my French, but it's just so short-sighted on behalf of all living things.” And don't get her started on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who once joined Hannah in protesting the Keystone XL oil pipeline (both were arrested). “So disappointing,” she says, “because he was such a good, powerful environmental advocate for so long. The fact that he would be part of this administration is shocking to a lot of people.”

	











	How does she make sense of it all? “We've taken to not watching the televised news so much because it can be way too overwhelming,” she says. “We just choose our reliable outlets, because it definitely is better for our mental health.”


	By “we,” Hannah means herself and her husband, Neil Young. More than just Young's partner, Hannah has also taken an active in role in his work, working on his stage backdrops and album covers and documenting his music. In the roughly decade since they became a couple, Hannah has made a movie about the making of his Barn album with Crazy Horse, has filmed all his tours for his archives (including every show on last year's tour with the Horse), and even made what she calls an “improved imaginary goofball home movie” (2018's surreal Western Paradox, starring Young, Promise of the Real, and Willie Nelson).

	Her new film, playing in theaters April 17 with a possible wider distribution after, offers another perspective on Young and his life. Filmed on the bus, backstage, and onstage during his 2023 run of solo shows on the West Coast, Coastal provides a pretty intimidate look at Young on the road during his first tour in four years. Filming the bus scenes on her iPhone, Hannah captured him just before and after shows interacting with his son Ben (who was born with severe cerebral palsy) and his small crew. “It's not even a new iPhone,” she says. “It's not the latest model. But I didn't want to have a big camera or anything, because I didn't want to make Neil feel self-conscious at all. I wanted to him forget about it.”

	











	Hannah says she'll be filming this year's run of Young shows with the Chrome Hearts, but has no plans to turn that into a doc at the moment. Instead, she's shopping around her first feature script, what she calls “a homage to Sunset Boulevard, but kind of more a dark comedy instead of a film noir”; she also hopes to direct herself. “Because this [Trump 2.0] is so overwhelming, it's actually quite important to focus on the things we love, because that's what keeps you refueled,” Hannah says. “It's important not to just get lost in the depression and the fear and all that. It's really important to stay focused on the things that bring you joy.”


You've been filming most of Neil's recent tours. What made you want to turn this particular footage from 2023 into a doc?Well, usually I film the tours so Neil has archival footage. I don't necessarily make them into documentaries. I usually film everything, tours and recording sessions. That's how the Barn documentary happened as well, because I was filming it. A lot of that was shot on my iPad, but they were like, “You can't be seen!” Crazy Horse is very, very private when they're making music. They don't want to be self-conscious at all.

How did you get around that?Hide? [Laughs.] Neil says that sometimes I just become a camera lump. I fold into my sweatshirt and just turn into a little lump with my iPad.


	This [2023 run] was a solo tour. I've been thinking for a long time that I would like to show certain aspects of what it's like for him. Even friends of mine will be like, “Oh, can I come to the party after the show?” I'm like, “Party? We get on the bus and start heading to the next town.” If people think it's a rager, I wanted to share how sort of human it really is, at least for us. I wanted to show that it's very solitary and kind of almost, you know, normal existence in some ways.


	I especially was kind of stunned myself by the fact that after a show, he almost can't talk. He's drained. He has to just sit there and stare out the window for a while, and re-enter his body. I think, in the end, I kind of somehow miraculously got what I was hoping to get, which was sort of a mix of  almost the loneliness of being on a solo tour,  where you have a little moment of pensive, maybe even melancholy after the show, or just sort of a drained feeling. I kind of wanted to dissuade people of their notion of what rock & roll tour is.

	











The closest we get to backstage guests are shots of Joni Mitchell and Lukas Nelson at one show.That was the first show in L.A. Joni and my mom and Lukas came. That was the only time we had people backstage. My mom and Joni are both in their eighties. It was so funny, because when my mom was saying, “I was singing at the end,” Joni was like, “I was singing louder! I was the loudest!”


What was it like to go back on tour with him after four years?He was really nervous, actually. He talks about it in the film. He said, “I don't know if I can do this — we'll see.“ But he's been obviously making music for so many decades that it's kind of in his DNA at that point. So even though he was nervous, it was very second nature once he got onstage and started to play. It's hard for him to not be playing music in some way, shape, or form. I don't think there was ever a concern that he was never going to tour again. I don't think it's possible. He's so engaged with music, I just don't think there's some point where he's going to say, “That's it for me.”


Many of his peers are doing farewell tours now.  He's not that person. The venues may change. I don't know how things are going to evolve, but he's never going to not play music. I can't ever foresee a moment where he'd do something like that.


When you said you “miraculously” got what you needed for this film, what did you mean?We placed the cameras [at the concerts] in front of the instruments we thought he might play and some nights he would never use them. [Laughs.] Neil never has a set list. He just plays what he feels in the moment. Well, there's no way to accommodate that, so some nights we'd set the cameras for one of the three pianos on stage, or for a certain guitar and the organ maybe. And he wouldn't play any of them! So there were great versions of certain songs I would have liked to have used, but we didn't even capture them because he didn't even go to those instruments the whole night. We would have literally nothing for an entire night sometimes, you know, because of him choosing to do different songs.


Were you allowed to get mad at him over that?Well, that's his forte, you know. That's just who he is. I'm not going to start saying, “You have to play …!” [Laughs.] That would be horrible, right? He only listens to his muse. That's kind of what he's known for in some ways, because it has to be authentic for him, or he won't do it. So I'm not going to mess with that.

	











	I was absolutely determined to have “I'm the Ocean” at the beginning and “When I Hold You in My Arms” at the end. Those are really the heart of it to me. “I'm the Ocean,” even though it was written a long time ago, for that record with Pearl Jam, resonates with all of the shit we're facing today and all of these crises. And even in the ways we have to stay positive and remember that we don't need to focus on all the negativity all the time too.   


	With “When I Hold You in My Arms,” once again, it's one of those songs that resonates with what's going on in the world today: “New buildings going up/Old buildings coming down.” And how important it is to lean on someone you love or someone you care about to have that refuge. The fact that he plays both the electric guitar and the piano in that song, I've never seen him do that. And I've been around for a while. [Laughs.]


Given you're both the filmmaker and the spouse here, what are the challenges of making a movie like this in terms of what you do and don't include?  You even slipped in a few scenes of Neil addressing you behind your iPhone and saying he'd missed you.That was a little bit hard, because I really wanted to make a cinema verité film; that's my favorite style of documentary. And when I was in the editing room, I really was fighting those kind of moments because I didn't want to have myself or the camera acknowledged in order for it to be true cinema verité. You're supposed to be a fly on the wall.  


	But all of those moments, when he's looking in the camera, even when he's talking to Ben, I find them really moving. So, even though I fought it and fought it for months during editing, I finally decided to put them in because there was an aspect that you would never catch otherwise. When Neil looks in the camera, there's such a beautiful openness and vulnerability and charm. You really see so much more into his soul.


At one point, we see Neil talking to Jerry, his bus driver, about how the fans want to hear the hits because those are often the only songs they know. That's an unusual comment to hear in a movie like this.But it's pretty true. People go to a show and want to hear the song they're familiar with, their favorite song played at their wedding or whatever. So I think that's kind of true for everybody, but Neil specifically decided on this tour that he was going to do songs he'd never really played before, “hidden by hits,” as he calls it. It was like people were hearing them for the first time, and in many cases, they really listened. I mean, you could hear a pin drop in all of those theaters.

	











Does Neil have any sort of approval over the finished film?He doesn't get any approval. Another thing that is specific to him is that if he sees something, he gets attached to it. So if I showed him the film in an earlier form and then changed something, he'd be like, “What happened to that part?” So I didn't show it to him until I was really done with it, because I don't want him to lock in on something, and then I've changed it.


	But he really liked it. I was a little bit nervous because I don't think we've ever filmed him with Ben before. I said to Neil, “Are you going to be comfortable with that?” But he absolutely loved it. 


	Sometimes I film a lot of things for him, like messages to people for when someone's getting celebrated for something and they want him to film a video message. I did one for Paul McCartney, since he was receiving some kind of award, or maybe it was his birthday. We did one take, but the birds in our backyard were really loud. And I was like, “Could you do it again?” And Neil's like, “Nope!” He does not do a take two.


The film is black and white, but at the very end, as we see the next highway in front of the bus, it turns to color.My favorite movie in the world is The Wizard of Oz.  I have to do something from that in every one of my movies, something a little magical.


In the end, what do you think you captured about him that's not in other documentaries, even the ones he's made?People generally think of him as a sort of kind of inscrutable guy. It's funny how many people are intimidated by him; they go, “Scary!” Before I knew him, I was like, “Oh, God, he's so scary.” So I wanted to dissuade people of that notion. And those moments of intimacy really show something that I don't think I've ever seen before in any documentaries.


At the Oscars last month, you presented the editing award and gave a shout-out to Ukraine: “Slava Ukraine!” Was that spontaneous?I'd been planning it, but I didn't want to tell anyone. I didn't know until I got there that night that they had a 10-second delay so they could bleep people. So I was trying to sneak it in there so they wouldn't bleep me. I didn't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Neil. I didn't want anyone to try to talk me out of it. I was just trying to disguise my intentions until the last second. I'm not sure why they didn't bleep me, but I'm glad they didn't. I think possibly it was because people cheered, and then people [watching] would have thought, “Why are they cheering?”

	











Afterwards, many people wondered why more presenters that night didn't say similar things.I 100 percent agree. It was weird, especially because it was just a few days after that horrific meeting in the Oval Office. You'd think more people would have wanted to send a little bit of love to the Ukrainians. I went to Ukraine many years ago for a film festival, in 2014, and I cried when I left, because I fell in love with those people. They have a great sense of humor. They're full of heart and soul. Even then, people in Ukraine were struggling economically and there were still bullet holes in some of the buildings. It was not a super-groovy, wealthy country. But people were happy and full of love. I really have a beautiful, deep connection with the people of that country. And I'm just horrified at the decisions that are being made now on behalf of us.


Neil announced a free show in Ukraine but then canceled.Yeah, everybody wanted to go, the whole band. But [authorities] just said they could not possibly allow it to happen because of the danger, to the audience as well as to us and the band members. When many people gather in one place it just becomes the obvious target. We were both really disappointed. But we will definitely try to go at some point.


When you were at the Oscars and once more in such a Hollywood scene, did you flash back to your life in the Eighties and Nineties, when you starred in so many hit films?    No! [Laughs.] Well, kind of. You have to go to a rehearsal, where they show you where to stand and whatever. I brought my sister and told her I was going to change the script. Not the part about Ukraine, but I rewrote the whole part about editors too, because they had me saying something I didn't feel reflected editing. I really have a lot of respect for editors and for the process and how important and challenging that work is, and how it really is where the film is created.


	But I was really, really nervous. My sister was with me in the Eighties and Nineties, when I would do those [shows]. And when I would even suggest changing an “and” or an “if,” they would give me hell! I'd be called into the producer's office and they would berate me. It was intimidating. Sometimes even the other actors I was co-presenting with would join in on the berating and say, “Well, I'm absolutely fine with all of that. You don't have to change a thing for me!” Thanks a lot for the support, mother …!


	But this time it  was really interesting, because, first of all, I noticed the backstage was full of women. I've never seen that before. There was not even one woman that I remember ever [in the past shows]. Also, all the writers were women. So when I told them I wanted to change one line, they were like, “Fine.” When I told them I wanted to change the whole thing, they were like, “Great.” I was shocked. To a certain degree, a lot of that patriarchal, misogynistic style of producing that show seems to be gone. I didn't expect it at all, because I obviously have a lot of bad flashbacks from things I experienced in my career. I love, love making movies and I love the work, but the other parts of it can be really a nightmare. A lot of the personalities you have to deal with, and certainly the sort of old-school, misogynistic structure of the industry, especially when you're a young girl, you're drowned in it.

	











Do you ever wonder what your life would have been like if you'd decided to play the game and keep taking roles in films like Steel Magnolias and such?I don't even think that's a possibility. In a certain way, I'm very similar to Neil. I am who I am. I'm not going to be able to fake it. That was part of the problem for me, too, when I had to do a lot of press and stuff. If I had a bad experience on a movie, I couldn't do the press. I can't really say, “Oh, it was so great!” It's not possible for me. I'm not that good at lying. I'm not good at self-promotion either. I love the idea of disappearing into a character. But I want it to be about the character, not about me and my daily life. That was the reason I wanted to do movies in the first place, to disappear into these fantasy worlds.


Speaking of which, did the makers of Splash Too offer you a part in that sequel?They did. And I don't think any of us really liked the script, but I particularly didn't. A lot of times, they'll try creating sequels just to try to squeeze a little more juice from the stone, see if they can get some more money out of it. And it's not organic to the story. 


You went public about your terrifying experiences with Harvey Weinstein in The New Yorker in 2017, talking about how he was pounding on your hotel room door and later asked to touch your breasts.That was the tip of the iceberg. I experienced stuff like that in almost every movie. It was gnarly to be a young woman in those times. I never had an agent or a publicist or anything like that. So I was really kind of not protected.


You've worked since Kill Bill, on TV and indie movies, but that seems to be the last major film we saw you in.It totally was. It was my last real movie. I mean, I'm fine with it. But I never really got any offers after that either. I was offered one other movie that was not a very good part, but that was [makes a sound like a car stopping]. I think some of it definitely had to do with Harvey, because he was like, “Oh, she's difficult,” or whatever he said.

	It was pretty gnarly blowback. We were going to the Cannes Film Festival, and I had agreed to host some charity events. This was right after he tried to come into my hotel in in Rome. He took off on the plane with all the other actors and left me there. I not only had to find my own way, my own flights back and forth, but I still had to go to Cannes — and they'd canceled my hotel room and there was nothing available. He canceled everything, the hair and makeup, everything. So I had nothing. I arrived in order to do all these things, and I was dragging my suitcase on the cobblestones, trying to go from person to person's room, sleeping on people's couches each night. It was really a screwed-up situation. It was a bad time.

	











	So it was probably a combination of that and the fact that I turned 40: an “oh, my God, how dare I turn 40!” thing. Who knows, but it's just the way it is. I've never been comfortable with being a known personality. I put my creative energies elsewhere, and I've been directing for years now, and I love it. At least I'm still making films, but it doesn't have to be about me.

Jenna Ortega didn't leave Scream VII over her busy “shooting schedule.” In a new interview with The Cut, Ortega revealed that she exited the movie because things went awry after her co-star Melissa Barera was fired from the film for publicly supporting Palestine.


	“It had nothing to do with pay or scheduling,” Ortega told the outlet. “The Melissa stuff was happening, and it was all kind of falling apart.”


	She continued, “If Scream VII wasn't going to be with that team of directors and those people I fell in love with, then it didn't seem like the right move for me in my career at the time.”


News of Ortega's departure from the film in November 2023 came just one day after Spyglass Media Group, the production company behind the Scream films, fired Barrera for her social media posts, which they deemed antisemitic.


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	At the time, Variety reported that Ortega's departure was “apparently not influenced” by Barrera's firing. Still, speculation grew that her exit was due to the production company's treatment of her co-star, since Ortega, too, has been vocal about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

	At the time, Scream VII director Christopher Landon deleted a statement on X that read, “Everything sucks. Stop yelling. This was not my decision to make.” He later stepped away from the movie, saying the film had become a “dream job that turned into a nightmare.” Kevin Williamson, the film's original screenwriter, took over directing duties and ended up welcoming Neve Campbell back to the franchise.


	“I'm very happy and proud to say I've been asked, in the most respectful way, to bring Sidney back to the screen and I couldn't be more thrilled!!!” Campbell wrote on Instagram at the time. “Well, actually I could.”

This post contains spoilers for the third season finale of The White Lotus, “Amor Fati,” which is now streaming on Max. 


	The finale of The White Lotus Season Three begins with a montage of various characters getting ready for their final full day at the Thailand resort, including Piper and Lochlan waking up after their night at the monastery. The head monk greets all his guests with a speech about the elusive nature of life itself, acknowledging that it brings with it many questions when we want resolution. Life gets easier, he suggests, once we accept that there is no resolution. 


	As a mostly self-contained season of scripted television, The White Lotus does not allow itself to be as mysterious or unknowable as the monk argues that our own lives are. So “Amor Fati” offers resolution aplenty. But given how predictable, contrived, and/or outright silly these resolutions are, maybe it would have been better if there had been none at all? 


	This was already the bumpiest of the series' three seasons. Expanding to eight episodes (after six in the first season and seven in the second) resulted not in more depth, but in certain ideas — Tim's murder-suicide fantasies, the friends' decades-old resentments — being repeated much too often. The stories of both Belinda and Gaitok felt badly underfed, as Lotus creator Mike White's level of interest in the non-wealthy — and/or non-white — characters has dipped with each passing season. If not for the specter of the mass shooting teased in the season-opening flash-forward, the whole thing would have felt like a meandering tone poem, elevated by some good performances (especially by Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood, and Carrie Coon), the occasional zinger (mostly from Parker Posey's Victoria), and random bits of sexual experimentation (Lochlan giving his brother a hand, Frank's monologue about his ladyboy fantasies). 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But having seen the shooting in context, as well as all the other climaxes — or lack thereof — I wonder if maybe these deaths aren't now the promotional cart driving the narrative horse. Or if White has simply run out of things to say about the terribleness of the idle rich, but has become too successful himself through this show to stop. The first (and still best) and second seasons reached their creative high points in their respective finales, where “Amor Fati” just summed up all the things that weren't working about Season Three.

	For the final time, let's break it down character group by character group: 


	We have to start at the end regarding the trio of old friends. They are first-person witnesses to one murder, and are at least in the vicinity when four other people are shot and killed, and their reaction is … what? We have no idea, because we literally do not hear them speak in the aftermath of those five deaths. There is a brief glimpse of the pals cuddling up together on the boat taking them back to the mainland for their flights home. But if they are traumatized by the ordeal, or are simply using it as another reason to cast all their petty grudges aside and embrace their friendship, we have no idea. 


	As a whole, the finale doesn't seem to know what to do with the idea of this huge and horrifying burst of violence happening in the middle of the resort, since Belinda, Zion, and the Ratliffs seem similarly untroubled to have been on the property at the time. (When Tanya shot up all the gays who were trying to murder her in the Season Two finale, that at least was on a yacht, and not at the hotel itself.) But the others get to talk about something in the season's closing minutes, where the friends are all but ignored — a frustrating but somewhat fitting conclusion to a subplot that was buoyed much more by the three actors involved in it than by the material they were asked to play.

	When you hand Coon — a.k.a. one of the greatest and most emotionally raw actors working today — a heartfelt monologue like the one that Laurie delivers at the friends' final Thailand dinner, of course it's going to be at least a little effective. But the words she was delivering with such force were wildly at odds with how the character was portrayed throughout the season. The idea that she was scared straight after her bad night with Aleksei, followed by the glimpse of the other two happily playing together in the pool, didn't make sense after we had watched her so clearly hate both of them for the rest of the week. Maybe if they'd saved the speech for after, again, the three of them were witnesses to a mass shooting, it might have seemed more honest?  


	What a bummer! It's not that Belinda is corrupted by the life-changing bribe she and Zion are able to negotiate with Greg. It's that her corruption felt inevitable and unearned at the same time. Belinda felt like a rich and complicated person in the first season. Her relationship with Tanya had many layers, and wasn't just about a wealthy woman emotionally leeching off of a poor one. Brought back for a new season, Natasha Rothwell didn't have a lot to do, and Belinda was a much thinner sketch this time around. And compared to pretty much every other younger character in the show's history — from the Mossbacher siblings in the first season to the Ratliffs here — Zion was granted zero depth. He was just a cartoon chasing after dollar signs. 

	











	That Belinda does to Pornchai what Tanya once did to her is ironic, but not in a particularly interesting way. The series' worldview about what money does to people is so unwavering, and so relatively one-note, that of course she was going to abandon the guy once she had some cash in hand.  


	As with Belinda, White goes for some simplistic irony here. She's the woman who thinks of herself as good, but who gladly accepts $5 million to look the other way about a murder, while he's a Buddhist who doesn't want to hurt anybody, yet gets rewarded — with both a promotion and the affection of the woman of his dreams (who's in fact not that great and only going to corrupt him) — for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back. And … that's it. Maybe Lisa from Blackpink is such an inexperienced actor that White didn't feel he could give her an actual three-dimensional character to play, or maybe he just didn't care, but this was another subplot where there was no there there. 


	Well, if nothing else, we have found a brand that is about to be much more upset about being associated with Tim Ratliff than Duke University has proved to be. The second the camera offered a close-up of the logo on the blender that Tim tried to use to blend poisoned cocktails for everyone in the family but Lochlan, you can assume Bosch's crisis PR department moved into high gear. 


	But Chekhov's Blender just felt silly. Not just because it seemed as if the older Ratliffs all drank about as much of the concoction as poor Lochlan did after he diluted what was left in the blender with protein powder and water. And also not just because — 17-year-old prestige TV spoilers follow — Tim was attempting to pull the same terrible murder-suicide stunt that a Walton Goggins character did (in the finale of The Shield), on a show that also featured Walton Goggins. Primarily, it felt silly because the show had presented so many fake-out fantasies of Tim killing himself and/or his loved ones that by the time it happened, it was hard to watch either scene with the poisoned drinks and believe someone was actually going to die. The decision to cut between Lochlan seemingly dying by the side of the pool and him having a vision of drowning in the pool only leaned into the bait-and-switch quality, so that by the time his eyes flickered open in front of his grief-stricken father, it had all become a bad and ineffective joke. 

	











	And then White somehow backed even further from the ledge he had seemingly placed the family, by showing that Tim had somehow made it through this ordeal finally learning a lesson about the importance of family over material assets. It's supposed to be a more bittersweet ending than, say, the Mossbachers being brought together by the bogus robbery attempt in Season One, since we know the Ratliffs are about to lose all their money and that Tim is going to prison for a bit. But the story up until now was played much darker than most anything in prior seasons, so to end on even a slightly upbeat note didn't ring true to what had come before. 


	After teasing the idea, in Sam Rockwell's memorable fifth episode monologue, that Frank experiments with gender whenever he drinks and does too many drugs, the finale backed off that in favor of just showing him dancing manically in his underwear surrounded by (presumably hired) young women the morning after he fell off the wagon. But if that part of the story didn't go where it seemingly should have, the Rick part went exactly where everyone knew it would, at least regarding the true nature of his relationship with Jim Hollinger. Jim didn't kill his father, because of course Jim was his father.


	And Rick killed him. And got Chelsea, and then himself, killed in the process. 


	To this subplot's credit, Goggins and Wood were wonderful throughout the season, particularly both of them in the finale sequence where it seemed like Rick actually had finally let go of the grief he'd been carrying all his life, and Goggins at the climax when an utterly haunted and ruined Rick couldn't stop himself from seeking vengeance. But if Tim Ratliff successfully pulling off a murder-suicide of most of his family would have played as incredibly dark for White Lotus, it also would have been at least somewhat in the series' fundamentally comedic DNA. When Tanya began shooting up the yacht and then fell to her death from it, that was all played for laughs, after all. This was presented as straight drama (other than perhaps Fabian squealing and falling into the water), which badly disrupts the tone of the show, and invites a level of scrutiny it simply isn't built for. If the true nature of Jim and Rick's relationship was meant to be a surprise, it wasn't. If Rick was meant to be a crack shot capable of taking out both of Jim's bodyguards with relative ease, it would help to know literally anything about his past other than that his mother died when he was young and that he and Frank used to party together.

	And if the resort was going to be host to such a horrific event — not so long after people died violently either on or near two other White Lotus properties over the past few years — then the show needs to be prepared to deal with the consequences of that. You can't just put everyone on boats like everything is normal, and have Pornchai and the other staffers waving goodbye from shore, when everyone would be getting interviewed by the local police at this point.


	It was simultaneously predictable and nonsensical. The finale was followed by clips of White talking about his goals for this season, while also teasing what's to come with the upcoming fourth season. “There's always room for more murders in the White Lotus hotels!” he promised. At a certain point, aren't the TripAdvisor reviews alone going to ruin their business model?

May Unveil Hours of 'Arthur' Outtakes as Evidence in Russell Brand Assault Case","https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/russell-brand-assault-case-warner-bros-arthur-outtakes-1235311778/","Mon, 07 Apr 2025 16:18:20 GMT","

	In 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery was named as a co-defendant when an extra in the film Arthur sued Russell Brand for sexual assault. In the case, Jane Doe alleged that Brand “exposed his penis to me on the set and in full view of the cast and crew,” adding that the actor later “assaulted me as a member of the production crew guarded the door from the outside.” Brand denied the allegations at the time. When her identity was revealed to him under seal, he claimed to have no recollection of ever interacting with her. But a recent progression of the case finds Warner Bros. offering to submit hours of unseen footage from the set for evidence.


	According to The Times, Patrick Lamparello, an attorney who represents Warner Bros, said the company is in possession of “four or five hours, it could be more, around eight,” hours of outtake footage from Arthur. The film was released in 2011 and was shot in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Police Department is not currently investigating Brand. Last week, the actor was charged with rape, indecent assault, and sexual assault in connection to incidents involving four women in the U.K. between 1999 to 2005. The Jane Doe assault case was submitted in New York.

	











	In the lawsuit, the actress alleged that Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Discovery, Bender-Spink, and Langley Park Pictures —the co-defendants in the case — either had employees on set the day she was allegedly assaulted, or at least bear some responsibility for what she claims transpired. Warner Bros. also denied the allegations at the time.

	Brand's legal representatives have expressed concern about the overlap in these assault cases, stating there is “reasonable belief criminal prosecution is possible in the US based on allegations tantamount to criminal sexual misconduct occurring in the US, of which he has been falsely accused both by this civil plaintiff and several others through the media.” Last week, Judge Shlomo Hagler rejected a request from Brand's legal team to delay proceedings in the New York case. 


	“I've always told you guys that when I was young and single before I had my wife and family … I was a fool, man,” Brand said last week in response to the U.K. charges. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict, and an imbecile. But what I never was, was a rapist. I've never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.” He is expected to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 2.

What could technological advancements in AI, declining birth rates, psychedelics, and UFO sightings possibly have to do with Donald Trump's political rise and reshaping of modern conservatism? Ross Douthat is on a mission to find out for The New York Times.

Interesting Times With Ross Douthat, a new podcast from the Times Opinion section, isn't aiming to be an explicit foray into the conservative podcast ecosystem, according to the host. Instead, “It's trying to be a window from The New York Times into a changed world with a conservative guide,” Douthat tells Vanity Fair. Each Thursday, starting April 10, the conservative opinion writer will explore the New Right through discussions with newsmakers in an attempt to offer a place within the Times that “tries to engage with a world that has been deeply unsettled.”

The new podcast will serve as a place where this “strange new world meets the concrete realities of politics,” Douthat explains in an interview, telling me that the podcast will touch on the modern conservative movement, political party realignment, organized religion, technology, pop culture, and even aliens. Douthat, who often writes about religion, said he plans to explore “the weirder edges of religion right now—from psychedelics to UFOs. Not just what's going on with Catholicism, but what's going on with unidentified flying objects and people having wild spiritual encounters while taking ayahuasca,” he says.

“The conceit of the show is that these weird things have some kind of real connection to what's happening in normal politics,” he adds. “We're going to be trying to make that connection clear.”

Douthat, 45, joined the Times in 2009 after a stint at The Atlantic and with two books already under his belt: Privilege: Harvard and the Education of the Ruling Class and, with Reihan Salam, Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream. Douthat's since been one of the Times' most reliable conservative voices on the Opinion page, providing an intellectual perspective from the right that's surely more palatable to Times readers than a MAGA firebrand. Douthat's also knocked out five more books in that time and cohosted the paper's Matter of Opinion podcast, which typically featured columnists from varying political points of view. It's on Matter of Opinion where Douthat also flew solo this year in interviews with conservative and contrarian voices like Steve Bannon, Chris Rufo, and Marc Andreessen.

“We knew pretty much immediately after the election that we wanted to do a show like this,” Kathleen Kingsbury, the Times opinion editor, tells me. “What we were trying out in the last few months, and you saw this a little bit with those interviews, was trying to figure out what the format should be.” According to Kingsbury, those interviews performed particularly well with Times readers consuming the content in all forms—audio, video, and transcript. “People were hungry for understanding and guidance for this moment, in a way that just blew us away,” she says.

Trump's return to power has sparked a fresh wave of calls for a better understanding of the right, with California governor Gavin Newsom, for one, kicking off his new podcast with Charlie Kirk, followed by Michael Savage and Bannon. Douthat tells me his podcast was green lit following the success of his interviews with figures on the right, which he said are a “good example of what the show wants to do,” while ensuring me that's “not going to be all that the show is, by any means.”

“It wasn't something we decided a year ago or something. It was much more in the last few months, where there was just sort of this sense that after the election, the landscape had shifted and I might be a good person to help Times readers understand what was going on,” he adds. While he is “slightly intimidated” to transition from Matter of Opinion cohost to the host of his own podcast, Douthat says that opinion leadership has been “very enthusiastic about the idea.”

Kingsbury, who took over the Opinion section in 2020, says she's been “committed to bringing a broader range of viewpoints into the section, and that particularly includes conservative voices.” Douthat, she says, “has long been a brilliant voice in text for Opinion, and I feel even better that we're going to be able to bring this show around him, his interests, and his ideas going forward.”

While the Times has built out their opinion offerings by bringing writers with varying political views together via roundtables, the paper sees a niche for Douthat in the audio space, pushing him to the forefront of his own show, using similar tactics that allowed for the success of the Ezra Klein Show, one of the Times' fastest-growing podcasts.

Douthat's show will also be available as a video podcast on YouTube, a strategy that has been particularly successful for Ezra Klein, an opinion columnist who, like Douthat, cut his teeth in the aughts political blogosphere, albeit from the left. “We're basically making that show video first, knowing that we find a larger and different audience on YouTube than we do if we just continue to publish on site,” Kingbury says. “We're really focused on figuring out how to think more broadly. I think Opinion is the part of the Times that has probably made the most inroads in this, but you see it across the Times. We're trying to figure out how to offer our audiences more and more ways to interact with our journalism and engage with it.”

“Like a lot of big successful organizations, the Times is not a dominant presence on YouTube, or anything like that,” says Douthat, adding that “there's certainly room for Times audio to grow.”

In this article

The market has been through a housing crash, a dotcom bubble, a global pandemic, and the twin headwinds of the Russia-Ukraine war and runaway inflation in recent history, but no downturn caused by the policy of a U.S. president. That's now changed.

""This is the Trump recession.""

Those were the words of a U.S.-based chief executive officer in response to a flash survey CNBC circulated among members of its CEO Council in the days after President Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement Wednesday.

Surprise over the tariffs' size and a big response from China triggered two days of market panic and a 10% loss in the S&P 500 to end last week, with the uncertainty over trade policy rattling investors and sending markets in Asia, Europe and the U.S. market all lower. Over the weekend and on Monday morning, more Wall Street figures began speaking out about the hit to business confidence and the coming hit to the economy, from hedge fund manager Bill Ackman to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon.

The CNBC survey showed the C-suite concerns are widespread. While there are many tariffs-related issues where CEOs indicated that uncertainty has to be a default position for now, they were clear on a few outcomes should the current trade policy proceed in its current form: a recession is coming, prices are going to increase, and job losses are likely.

A majority of CEOs (69%) expect a recession, according to the survey, with over half of those CEOs saying the downturn will hit this year. Three-quarters of those CEOs do expect a recession to be moderate or mild, rather than severe, matching the extent of the pessimistic view of the economy from a recent CNBC CFO Council survey.

JPMorgan just raised its recession odds for this year to 60%.

A little over one-third of CEO respondents (37%) said they do expect to cut jobs this year, with another 14% saying they have not made that decision, but it remains a consideration. The second-largest portion of CEO respondents said it's still too soon to know.

Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described the tariffs as ""significantly larger than expected,"" and added, ""the same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,"" he said.

The CEO flash survey was conducted among a sample of the CNBC Council membership that included 22 chief executives.

CEOs expressed a wide variety of views and emotions, with concerns ranging from the sector-specific issues that will drive up the cost of everything built into strategic growth plans and sold to consumers, to perplexity over the tariffs math and logic, fear of the consequences for American brands worldwide, and outright anger.

""Disappointingly stupid and illogical,"" is how one CEO described the tariffs. ""Without faith that our government knows what it is doing, it is impossible for businesses to thrive.""

""Trump has imposed tariffs on component parts that are simply unavailable in the U.S. and never will be. He has surrounded himself with an incompetent cadre of yes men and women unable or unwilling to offer him cogent counsel,"" said another.

The uncertainty that has driven the market selloff among investors was evident in the responses, with 46% of CEOs indicating tariffs would be bad for their business, but over a third (36%) saying it is still too soon to know. Among CEOs who are taking a wait-and-see approach, they are ""war rooming"" scenarios that involve their suppliers and consumers.

""We imagine that our suppliers will have to swallow part of the tariff and we will have to pass on part of the tariff to our customers. We are controlling what we can control, pricing and sourcing decisions. We can't control the impact of tariffs on the consumer mindset which we imagine could be significant,"" one CEO said.

Almost all CEOs whose companies sell goods and services said price hikes are coming, anywhere from 5% to 20%, and the vast majority (82%) expect ""resurgent inflation.""

The CEO who called the ""Trump recession"" said the loss of market value will end the consumer spending that was driven by the wealth effect, especially for the key 40-60 year-old demographic.

CEOs who said they sell in as many as 100 markets are also increasingly worried about how other nations respond to U.S. tariff policy, not just in the form of government policy, but the consumers they rely on for overseas sales.

""The biggest issue I worry about is boycotts of American brands and anti-American sentiment,"" said a CEO whose company derives 40-45% of sales outside the U.S. ""There is real backlash happening."" 

""There is real potential for boycott of American goods that has a meaningful impact on corporates, who will then have to cut jobs. There is increased probability of stagflation,"" said another CEO Council member.

The services boom that has driven the U.S. economy to be the envy of the world's markets, led by software, social media and cloud computing, will also be targeted. As one CEO explained, ""tariffs as commonly thought of are applied to goods but the world is now much more oriented towards services than in the past and countries will try to build up employment and taxes in their services while limiting services that are based in other countries.""

Trump and his advisors argue that the reshoring boom, with new construction and manufacturing in the U.S., will ultimately prove the short-term concerns wrong.

Over the weekend, they did not back down, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying ""the tariffs are coming""; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissing concerns about a recession, saying Trump is ""building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.""

In a CNBC interview on Monday morning, Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro said Vietnam's recent offer to take tariffs on the U.S to 0% was not enough to gain a reprieve, adding that it is the ""non-tariffs cheating that matters.""

Trump said ""Sometimes you have to take medicine"" in comments on Sunday night about the stock market plunge. Trump cited the trade deficit with China as his rationale for pressing on with his tariffs plan. ""We have to solve our trade deficit with China,"" he said. ""We have a trillion-dollar trade deficit with China, hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose with China. And unless we solve that problem, I'm not going to make a deal.""

But those comments reflect some of the confusion over the trade policy that has been voiced in recent weeks: why the U.S. has chosen to fight a trade war with a vast number of countries, including our closest allies, if the problem is China.

Right now, CEOs are signaling that building plans are being downsized, and at least for now, few CEOs said the administration's priorities would lead their company to build new domestic manufacturing.

""Increased capital expense for construction will delay, or reduce the scale of projects,"" said one CEO.

According to a CEO from the construction sector, ""tariffs on building goods will likely slow and postpone capital construction projects.""

Another CEO expects the corporate hesitation to build to compound a construction slowdown that is already likely to occur based on cuts in government funding of research and potential Medicare changes, which will have ""a material impact"" on institutional construction, as education and healthcare also pull back on expansion plans.

In all, 45% of CEOs responding to the survey said any reshoring would take a minimum of two years, and more likely three years or more.

That fits into a picture of uncertainty that leads CEOs to be negative on the most important, underlying question of all: will the tariffs be good long-term policy? CEOs who said they believe the short-term pain will be worth the long-term economic gain remain in the minority, with a little over one-quarter of respondents saying they ""agree somewhat"" that the tariffs will ultimately prove beneficial. Many more (45% of CEOs) say they disagree ""strongly"" with this view. In all, 59% said they disagreed with the views the tariffs would ultimately be judged successful.

The mix of uncertainty and economic pessimism, with the former directly contributing to the latter, is what comes through most clearly in the corporate outlook.

In a CNBC interview on Monday morning, former St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard laid out the case why this level of uncertainty can be a self-fulfilling recession prophecy. ""The effects are immediate because it affects expectations about investment globally ... I mean, who wants to invest when you don't know what the rules are going to be? And so major projects are all going to be delayed. All around the world until you get some clarity on how this is going to play out.""

CEOs taking the CNBC survey agreed, with one commenting, ""All of the uncertainty with how it's being handled will harm our business and limit investment until this is all concluded.""
