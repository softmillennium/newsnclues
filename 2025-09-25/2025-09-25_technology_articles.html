                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Siddhartha “Sidd” Srinivasa has spent his career at the intersection of robotics research and real-world deployment. He helped start Berkshire Grey, launched Amazon's Robotics AI group, helped re-architect Cruise's autonomy stack, and leads the Personal Robotics Lab at the University of Washington as a professor. Now he's adding a new role: venture partner at Madrona Venture Group, where he'll help shape investment themes and evaluate startups in robotics and embodied AI at the Seattle-based firm. GeekWire caught up with Srinivasa for a conversation about the state of robotics, opportunities for entrepreneurs, and why he believes Seattle can become a global leader in AI and robotics. The interview was edited for brevity and clarity. GeekWire: Why did you decide to join Madrona? Sidd Srinivasa: “I want to give back to the Pacific Northwest and make the Pacific Northwest an even bigger superpower in AI and robotics. Where is robotics right now in terms of progress? A large part of that is because electric motors have gotten better and cheaper, and our ability to produce them and to be able to scale them has gotten much better. And what these foundation models help us do is deal with all the common sense stuff that goes into getting any task done.” Srinivasa: “The place where we have a huge problem with robotics right now is that though we are able to address a lot of the common sense tasks like folding your laundry or clearing your table — those are not the important tasks people would pay money for. Yes, we have pretty amazing demos, we have cool videos of humanoids picking up an apple and putting it down. We certainly did that at Amazon and with fulfillment. But beyond fulfillment, I haven't seen any great success in robotics.” That adaptiveness is what we need robots to do efficiently. And I would say general purpose robotics is certainly five years behind self-driving in terms of capability and technology.” Srinivasa: “I am not sure whether the humanoid form factor is the right form factor to align around. I do believe that one day we will have capable robots performing useful tasks in our home. Which sectors look closest to achieving viable unit economics? Srinivasa: “There's still a lot of juice left to squeeze in fulfillment. There's over 50-to-60% of fulfillment that is yet to be automated — things like packing an Amazon box full of items. I've been really interested in computational agriculture from an observability point of view — knowing what's going on in a greenhouse without having to walk the line. If we are able to build robots that can be very easily repurposed and retrained to perform multiple tasks and have a small form factor, then I think that's a space that can be really disrupted.” What advice do you have for robotics founders? The pull has to come from a real customer need. The second thing I would say is that there is this tendency to believe that robots can follow the software model. Maintaining, servicing and taking care of software is really easy. But that's not the case with real, physical robots. I would think very carefully about not just the actual application, but also the modality by which you are putting your robots out there.” How do you think about robotics and job displacement? Srinivasa: “Ever since I started working on robots, I've been very rightfully asked: will robots take our jobs? The lazy argument is to say the Industrial Revolution created more jobs than it took away, so robotics will, too. So we have an entire generation of people who lost their jobs, who we did not re-skill to be able to take on the new roles that were coming up. It's not just a nice thing to do. Any thoughts on Seattle as a robotics hub? Srinivasa: “I think one of the things that's incredibly appealing about Seattle, and particularly about the University of Washington, which I think has been a pioneer in this, is just how closely faculty are able to work with industry while still maintaining and honoring their faculty position. I think it's also incredibly valuable for dual careers. And I think it's a great place to start a company, not just because of Madrona, but also because of so many other VCs, as well as the huge amount of talent that's out here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft has blocked an Israeli military unit from using some of its technology services after the company found evidence supporting a report that the tech was being used for surveillance of  Palestinian civilians. Microsoft President Brad Smith announced in a note to employees on Thursday the decision to cease and disable services being used by Unit 8200, an Israeli military spy agency. He said an ongoing review by Microsoft had found “evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting.” “We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,” Smith wrote. “We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.” He also noted that Microsoft's respect for the privacy rights of its customers — in this case, the Israeli military — meant that among other things, it could not access customer content. The company previously acknowledged limits as to what it could verify, citing a lack of visibility into use of its technology on private servers outside its cloud. Members of the group No Azure for Apartheid have been calling on Microsoft to cut all ties to the Israeli military and government. A week later, several protesters made their way into and occupied Smith's office in Building 34. In his memo to employees, Smith said that the company will continue providing cybersecurity services to Israel and other countries in the Middle East. I want to let you know that Microsoft has ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD). As we publicly announced on August 15, we decided to undertake a review of allegations that appeared in an article published on August 6 by The Guardian about a unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). We have reviewed The Guardian's allegations based on two principles, both grounded in Microsoft's longstanding protection of privacy as a fundamental right. As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust. First, we do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. Second, we respect and protect the privacy rights of our customers. At no point has Microsoft accessed IMOD's customer content. Rather, the review has focused on Microsoft's own business records, including financial statements, internal documents, and email and messaging communications, among other records. While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting. We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians. Its reports were based in part on sources outside Microsoft that had information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments. I appreciate that many of you will have additional questions. I'll share more information in the coming days and weeks, when it's appropriate to do so, including lessons learned from this review and how we will apply those lessons as we go forward. Microsoft will continue to be a company guided by principles and ethics. We will hold every decision, statement, and action to this standard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep. Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning — much like they would check social media or a news app. Pulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI's consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive. “We're building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,” said OpenAI's new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. “And ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction — starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this week that some of ChatGPT's new “compute-intensive” products would be limited to the company's most expensive subscription plan — which is the case for Pulse. Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. Each report is displayed as a “card” featuring AI-generated images and text. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones. A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: “Great, that's it for today.” According to Fry, that's an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. Pulse is compatible with ChatGPT's Connectors, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that's set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events. If users have ChatGPT's memory features turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI's personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes. But it's hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry says the service can “vary tremendously” in how much computing power it spends on a given task — for some projects, it's fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI's agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They built Juicebox, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates. After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity. Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia's internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup's growth potential. When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed. “I'm not sure I've ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch. Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team. What sets Juicebox's search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would. Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls. While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like Eightfold are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings. Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup's technology stack. “We've invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it's] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.” Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deal includes a $1 billion civil penalty — the largest ever in an FTC case involving a rule violation — and $1.5 billion in refunds for consumers who the agency says were harmed by deceptive Prime enrollment and cancellation practices. “The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.” Earlier this month, a federal judge in Seattle ruled that Amazon violated online shopper protection law by collecting payment information before disclosing full Prime terms, a setback that loomed over the company as the trial began this week. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.” According to the FTC, Amazon employed confusing checkout flows and deceptive user interfaces — commonly described as “dark patterns” — to nudge shoppers into Prime sign-ups they didn't expect. In parallel, the FTC alleged that Amazon created a complex cancellation process. Amazon cannot have a button that says, “No, I don't want Free Shipping.” The FTC estimates 35 million consumers will be eligible for refunds. There were an estimated 197 million Amazon customers who had a Prime membership as of March 2025, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners — up about 7% from the June 2024 quarter. That accounted for about 7% of Amazon's overall revenue in the quarter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Thursday, the AI platform Clarifai announced a new reasoning engine that it claims will make running AI models twice as fast and 40% less expensive. “It's a variety of different types of optimizations, all the way down to CUDA kernels to advanced speculative decoding techniques,” said CEO Matthew Zeiler. “You can get more out of the same cards, basically.” The results were verified by a string of benchmark tests by the third-party firm Artificial Analysis, which recorded industry-best records for both throughput and latency. That computing load has grown particularly intense with the rise of agentic and reasoning models, which require multiple steps in response to a single command. First launched as a computer vision service, Clarifai has grown increasingly focused on compute orchestration as the AI boom has drastically increased demand for both GPUs and the data centers that house them. The product comes amid intense pressure on AI infrastructure, which has spurred a string of billion-dollar deals. “There's software tricks that take a good model like this further, like the Clarifai reasoning engine,” Zeiler says, “but there's also algorithm improvements that can help combat the need for gigawatt data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian shark experts have revealed that some special wetsuit materials aiming to keep sharks from ripping your arm off or gouging out your guts might actually be helpful. As detailed in a study published today in the journal Wildlife Research, the team investigated the extent to which four bite-resistant wetsuit materials—Aqua Armour, Shark Stop, ActionTX-S, and Brewster—could lessen injuries and blood loss from great white and tiger shark bites. “Our study showed that bite-resistant materials incorporated into wetsuits can reduce damage from large white and tiger sharks (up to 3 metres) compared to standard neoprene wetsuit, even from moderate and severe bites,” Tom Clarke, a researcher from Flinders University's College of Science and Engineering, said in a university statement. The team tested each material with real sharks and classified the bite damage in one of four categories of severity, from superficial to critical. They compared the damage to that allowed by standard neoprene material. This approach revealed that “while there were small differences between the four tested materials, they all reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe haemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,” Clarke continued. While sharks rarely bite humans (you're more likely to die from constipation, champagne corks, and lawn mowers) our interactions with them are increasing around the world as coastal communities expand and marine activities become more sought-after. (As another side note, it would be interesting to know how researchers track provoked shark bites. Do they ask shark attack survivors, “How much, on a scale of one to ten, were you asking for it?”) “While these suits don't eliminate all the risk (e.g. internal injuries may still occur), our results indicate that they can reduce blood loss and trauma from major lacerations and punctures, potentially saving lives,” said Charlie Huveneers, leader of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders University. So if a shark chomps down on your shin, it sounds like you could still break a leg—but maybe the beast won't rip away your entire calf. Conventional chainmail suits work well, but they are too heavy and stiff for people to use while surfing or diving. On the other hand, new wetsuits made from strong and light fiber (frequently seen in sailing rope) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (a tough polymer) are flexible as well as effective, according to the statement. I assume there's little chance of putting the materials through human trials. Little is known about how leopard sharks mate in the wild. Rare footage shows a female doing the deed back-to-back with two different males. Ice generates electricity when it gets stressed in a very specific way, new research suggests. The material self-assembles and dissolves easily, making it an easy-to-recycle alternative for manufacturing EV batteries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged this week that Retail Ecommerce Ventures, the company that bought RadioShack out of bankruptcy in 2020, ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of $112 million. REV was founded by Taino Lopez and Alexander Mehr and spent recent years buying up distressed retail ventures including Dress Barn, Franklin Mint, Linens ‘N Things, Modell's Sporting Goods, Pier 1 Imports, RadioShack, and Stein Mart. Lopez and Mehr allegedly promised investors in their company annualized returns of 25%, along with equity and a monthly preferential dividend as high as 2.083%. They are also accused of assuring investors that funds raised would be for one specific portfolio company, and REV had never failed to pay a single investor. But that wasn't true, according to the SEC. Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations. The SEC alleges that about $16.1 million in investor funds were diverted for personal use by Lopez and Mehr. The 49-year-old Lopez and 46-year-old Mehr both lived in Puerto Rico, according to the court filing, though their company was registered in Delaware and their primary place of business was Miami, Florida. Lopez appeared on CNBC in Aug. 2020 to talk about the acquisition of Modell's Sporting Goods. REV was focused on going online-only, but Lopez mentioned that there would be possibilities to open up physical stores in the future. The SEC says REV raised more than $230 million from at least 660 investors nationwide. The agency also outlines instances where it claims Lopez and Mehr made false statements to investors about the company's health. Following the Zoom calls, Defendant Lopez and Mehr sent email updates to all existing investors recapping the calls. In one email recap Defendant Lopez sent to investors on February 18, 2021, he claimed that Dress Barn and Stein Mart were “on fire” and “cash flow is strong,” that “there are plenty of public companies operating at heavy losses” but that's “not us,” and that REV had “brands with a positive EBITDA.” Aside from Lopez and Mehr, REV's chief operating officer, Maya Rose Burkenroad, is also named as a defendant in the court filing on fraud charges for soliciting investment in the company. Lopez, Mehr, and Burkenroad didn't respond to emailed questions on Wednesday. Lopez, who has quite a presence on YouTube as an influencer and gives advice on everything from investing to dating, posted a new video on Wednesday but didn't seem to address the SEC charges.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. With this 2.0 speaker system, the firm says it will be introducing its “first wireless speakers for desktop gaming.” Obviously, Sony has a long legacy of wired speakers for PCs, dating back to its VAIO multimedia PC days. The new PC, Mac, and PS5-compatible Sony Pulse Elevate speakers use PlayStation Link wireless connectivity, which promises lossless audio with ultra-low latency. Other key features are the inclusion of a microphone with AI noise cancellation, an easy-access volume knob, and battery power for portability. In each speaker, these are situated above woofers, which extend the bass response so you can “feel every impact” when gaming. Tempest 3D AudioTech is supported on the PS5 platform, in compatible titles, for positioning audio. It seems like Mac users will miss out on this extra configurability. The speakers are easy to position and detach from their charging docks, upon which they sit on your desk. That may be welcome if you have multiple systems sharing a desk space, for example. The design offers “simultaneous Bluetooth and PlayStation Link connectivity.” And thanks to Bluetooth, you will also be able to pair them with your smartphone.

While the report doesn't specify which models are set for an increase, it specifically highlights that chips launched in October 2022 (13th-gen chips), noting that prices will increase from $150-160 to $170-$180. This could encompass some popular i3 or i5 models, depending on the region and availability. This increase will occur despite the company announcing that the integrated GPU drivers for these processors will be placed on legacy software support, effectively putting them on the back burner, despite some having launched as recently as 2023. Digitimes cites industry insiders who say "lukewarm" consumer response to AI PCs as a factor. That, coupled with customers seeking value options, has led many to opt for lower-cost previous-generation models instead. According to the report, some brands are even experiencing supply shortages, especially as the volatility of chip pricing is making them reluctant to place long-term orders. Due to this, PC and component prices may increase slightly as we approach the end of 2025. Windows 10's end-of-life this coming October might result in some corporate sales, especially for companies unwilling to pay for extended support. The upcoming holiday season may drive some sales figures, especially if companies release great deals. We've pinged Intel for comment and will update as neccesary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The industry is getting billions, but it's way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand. This week, Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced it has another customer for its first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. Eni, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, signed a billion-dollar deal to buy electricity from the facility. Neither does the smaller reactor Commonwealth is building first to demonstrate that its tokamak design will work as intended. Investors are pouring billions into the field to build power plants, and some companies are even signing huge agreements to purchase power from those still-nonexistent plants. All this comes before companies have actually completed a working reactor that can produce electricity. Nearly three years ago, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hit a major milestone for fusion power. It was a game changer for the vibes in fusion. The NIF experiment finally showed that a fusion reactor could yield net energy. But in some ways, the NIF results didn't really change much for commercial fusion. To operate a fusion power plant, not only do you have to achieve net energy, but you also need to do that on a somewhat constant basis and—crucially—do it economically. So in the wake of the NIF news, all eyes went to companies like Commonwealth, Helion, and Zap Energy. Who would be the first to demonstrate this milestone in a more commercially feasible reactor? Or better yet, who would be the first to get a power plant up and running? So far, the answer is none of them. To be fair, many fusion companies have made technical progress. Zap Energy demonstrated three hours of continuous operation in its test system, a milestone validated by the US Department of Energy. (And that's not to mention a thriving, publicly funded fusion industry in China.) But as Ed Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at Berkeley, summed it up to me: “They don't have a reactor.” (He was speaking specifically about Commonwealth, but really, the same goes for the others.) Commonwealth raised over $800 million in funding earlier this year. And now it's got two big customers signed on to buy electricity from this future power plant. Why buy electricity from a reactor that's currently little more than ideas on paper? By putting a vote of confidence behind Commonwealth, Eni could help the fusion startup get the capital it needs to actually build its plant. The company also directly invests in Commonwealth, so it stands to benefit from success. If fossil-fuel companies and tech giants want to provide it, all the better. One concern I have, though, is how outside observers are interpreting these big commitments. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been loud about his support for fusion and his expectations of the technology. He's certainly not the first to have big dreams for fusion, and it is an exciting technology. But despite the jaw-dropping financial milestones, this industry is still very much in development. To meet the growing electricity demand and cut emissions from the power sector, we'll need a whole range of technologies. It's a risk and a distraction to put all our hopes on an unproven energy tech when there are plenty of options that actually exist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a world where hallowed news organizations transform into conservative mouthpieces and ​milquetoast late-night jokes are grounds for suspension, satirical headlines from the Onion can feel closer to real life than parody. It launches in theaters in New York City, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and San Francisco for one day only on October 2; after that it will be available online. Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile is a 20-minute mockumentary that launches in select theaters on October 2. Onion CEO Ben Collins says his writers decided to go big on Epstein once Donald Trump started acting “dodgy” when fielding questions about Epstein this summer. “There's this big gap where information should be,” Collins says. The mockumentary fills much of that gap with Trump himself. It opens with a fake voicemail from Epstein to Trump that heavily implies the president arranged his death. From there, Bad Pedophile skewers all the standard true-crime tropes. Talking heads ask hard-hitting questions like, “Was he ever even alive to begin with?” and “Was Jeffrey his first name, or was Epstein his last name?” In addition to the portrayals of journalists, lawyers, and former associates, they throw in a priest whose title is “pedophile expert.” To give you a hint of what satirical tack the Onion is taking, this is a world in which Epstein is described as an “all-American molester” whose accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell first met him through a classified ad seeking a “gross pervert assistant.” About a third of the way in, we hear another fake audioclip, this time portraying a Department of Justice official telling Maxwell in a 2025 interview, “We need you to help us cover up some of Donald Trump's crimes.” (The Justice Department released redacted transcripts of the actual Maxwell interview last month.) This is when Bad Pedophile takes a sharp turn to chronicle the relationship between Trump and Epstein. Like any good satire, the mockumentary's sharpest moments are flecked with bits of truth. While it has Epstein working at a fictional Deep State, it also calls out his allegedly real relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world, including Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton—throwing in a few extra “allegedlies” in the process. The release of Bad Pedophile will be more limited than was originally planned. Collins says a movie theater company was set to launch the mockumentary nationally but pulled out in the wake of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's death. “It does show you, this moment, if you are trying to get a merger through or something, or some sort of business from the government, or if you're just afraid of the ire of the president, the only real way to get stuff out there is independently,” says Collins. “If you see Jeffrey Epstein's name and your immediate thought process is, ‘Oh, this might offend the president,' that's not the problem of people making a joke. It's the problem of a broken and insanely failing society.” According to The Wall Street Journal, he was told he was named in the files, although it's unknown in what context. “In the last year, we've been able to say a lot of stuff that other places are afraid to say,” says Collins.

Intel is in preliminary discussions with Apple regarding a potential investment, according to Bloomberg, which cites sources familiar with the matter. The two companies are also reportedly exploring ways to work more closely together, although it remains to be seen whether any potential deals can be reached, as negotiations are in the early stages and may not come to fruition. The reported talks with Apple follow a string of recent deals, including major funding from Nvidia and SoftBank, and conversion of CHIPS Act funding from the U.S. government to equity. These moves are believed to be a part of the company's revival strategy that not only includes securing money, but also securing commitments to use the company's products and services going forward to justify developing Intel's next-generation 14A process technology and building production capacities that will support the node. Apple used Intel's CPUs inside its PCs from 2005 to 2020, but it never used the company's low-power processors for its iPhones or iPads. Instead, it switched its Macs to Arm-based SoCs in 2020. Even Thunderbolt 5 controllers/retimers found in the latest MacBook Pro come from Apple, yet are certified by Intel. Intel's timing to enter negotiations with Apple seems favourable as the high-tech giant has just received investments from Nvidia, SoftBank, and the U.S. government. Such high-profile backers reflect a growing belief in Intel's comeback, so it should be easier for the company to persuade Apple and other potential investors to buy Intel stock. Obviously, a deal with Apple would further underscore confidence in Intel's direction, which would carry symbolic weight and bolster Intel's public image. However, if the rumored deal does not yield any agreement, this might harm Intel's position.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From its inception, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) operated as a rogue entity within the US government, slashing staff and funding, gaining access to government systems, and overriding agency decisionmaking—all without oversight from officials who have little understanding of its reach and methods. A report issued by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) on Thursday adds new insight on how this incursion happened, while raising grave concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic data breach that would affect all Americans and serious questions about who DOGE operatives answer to. “A clear pattern emerged across agencies—officials who questioned DOGE were pushed out, and DOGE-affiliated personnel were installed in key positions such as Chief Information Officer,” the report finds. Throughout the report, committee investigators describe DOGE representatives as working clandestinely within the agencies they were sent to serve and in spaces kept under armed guard, seemingly not beholden to government officials. “At one point, GSA officials said they did not have the key to open a locked room that had windows covered with black paper, trash bags, and tape,” the report says, describing HSGAC staffers' attempts to inspect the agency's offices. “When staff asked why the most senior officials in offices charged with building management and security could not open an office door, GSA could not provide an answer.” “Senior officials at SSA, GSA, and OPM all failed to provide information about who was in charge; what conduct DOGE teams were engaged in; and what data those teams had been given access to, including the authorities and restrictions guiding their access,” the report says. “None of the agencies could answer simple questions about organizational charts and employee roles.” In response to a request for comment, an OPM spokesperson who did not give their name denied that OPM had any “‘DOGE' employees” and said, “This is absurd. Who was—and is—in charge of all this is unclear to the investigators. “However,” the report says, “whistleblowers told staff that Ms. Gleason is just a figurehead with no real power over DOGE staff at agencies and that most DOGE staff actually function outside of the US DOGE Service.” (Gleason did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Earlier this year, SSA chief data officer Chuck Borges filed a whistleblower complaint accusing the agency of mishandling data and creating an unsecure server to hold it. It's unclear if data was manipulated or shared outside of government. The committee notes that it's “very likely” that US adversarial nations, including Russia, China, and Iran are aware of the cloud system DOGE set up at SSA. “One whistleblower told staff that the purpose of the database might be to provide free SSN verification for other federal agencies, but circumventing basic safeguards suggests that project may have other purposes.” In response to questions, an unnamed SSA spokesperson referred WIRED to a September 16 letter from Commissioner Frank Bisignano to Senator Michael Crapo, and says, “based on the agency's thorough review, the Numident data and database–stored in a longstanding secure environment used by SSA–have not been accessed, leaked, hacked, or shared in any unauthorized fashion.” The spokesperson also asserted that “there are no DOGE employees at SSA, only SSA employees.” “DOGE isn't making government more efficient—it's putting Americans' sensitive information in the hands of completely unqualified and untrustworthy individuals,” said Gary Peters, a Democratic US senator from Michigan and ranking member of HSGAC, in a statement on Thursday. “They are bypassing cybersecurity protections, evading oversight, and putting Americans' personal data at risk. We cannot allow this shadow operation to continue operating unchecked while millions of people face the threat of identity theft, economic disruption, and permanent harm. The Trump Administration and agency leadership must immediately put a stop to these reckless actions that risk causing unprecedented chaos in Americans' daily lives.” When visiting the GSA offices, committee investigators saw “cloud infrastructure and enterprise network infrastructure diagrams” drawn on a whiteboard, but GSA officials blocked their view “with their bodies,” the report says. According to the report, GSA officials “could not even confirm that the Starlink terminal was configured with basic security settings recommended by Starlink itself,” making staffers “concerned that any data sent or received over the Starlink device at GSA and other locations could be an easy target for foreign adversaries." Starlink terminals have also been installed at the White House. This was not the only apparent effort to circumvent government policies and protections around data. “The CIO asked many technical questions as part of his role,” they said in response to a question about Hogan. “All his work at OPM complied with the agency's security and regulatory requirements.”) It was a measure taken, according to Dan Callahan, assistant commissioner for building and facilities management, because the DOGE members were “concerned for their safety.” Upon further inquiry, investigators found that this concern stemmed from “communication with an SSA employee that ‘included cursing. “They accompanied the visit when entering secure areas with sensitive information.”) The White House and GSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages? When Kenneth Wehr started managing the Greenlandic-language version of Wikipedia four years ago, his first act was to delete almost everything. Wehr, who's 26, isn't from Greenland—he grew up in Germany—but he had become obsessed with the island, an autonomous Danish territory, after visiting as a teenager. He'd spent years writing obscure Wikipedia articles in his native tongue on virtually everything to do with it. He even ended up moving to Copenhagen to study Greenlandic, a language spoken by some 57,000 mostly Indigenous Inuit people scattered across dozens of far-flung Arctic villages. Machine learning is bringing us closer to a Babel-fish-style universal translation device. Virtually every single article had been published by people who did not actually speak the language. Wehr, who now teaches Greenlandic in Denmark, speculates that perhaps only one or two Greenlanders had ever contributed. But what worried him most was something else: Over time, he had noticed that a growing number of articles appeared to be copy-pasted into Wikipedia by people using machine translators. They were riddled with elementary mistakes—from grammatical blunders to meaningless words to more significant inaccuracies, like an entry that claimed Canada had only 41 inhabitants. Other pages sometimes contained random strings of letters spat out by machines that were unable to find suitable Greenlandic words to express themselves. “It might have looked Greenlandic to [the authors], but they had no way of knowing,” complains Wehr. What Wehr describes is not unique to the Greenlandic edition. Wikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed and tested. Many of these smaller editions have been swamped with automatically translated content as AI has become increasingly accessible. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations. And after auditing the Wikipedia edition in Inuktitut, an Indigenous language close to Greenlandic that's spoken in Canada, MIT Technology Review estimates that more than two-thirds of pages containing more than several sentences feature portions created this way. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages, grammatical or otherwise, can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. That can make the models' translation of these languages particularly error-prone, which creates a sort of linguistic doom loop as people continue to add more and more poorly translated Wikipedia pages using those tools, and AI models continue to train from poorly translated pages. “These models are built on raw data,” says Kevin Scannell, a former professor of computer science at Saint Louis University who now builds computer software tailored for endangered languages. “They will try and learn everything about a language from scratch. There isn't perfect data on the scale of this problem, particularly because a lot of AI training data is kept confidential and the field continues to evolve rapidly. But back in 2020, Wikipedia was estimated to make up more than half the training data that was fed into AI models translating some languages spoken by millions across Africa, including Malagasy, Yoruba, and Shona. In 2022, a research team from Germany that looked into what data could be obtained by online scraping even found that Wikipedia was the sole easily accessible source of online linguistic data for 27 under-resourced languages. This could have significant repercussions in cases where Wikipedia is poorly written—potentially pushing the most vulnerable languages on Earth toward the precipice as future generations begin to turn away from them. Automation has been built into Wikipedia since the very earliest days. Bots keep the platform operational: They repair broken links, fix bad formatting, and even correct spelling mistakes. These repetitive and mundane tasks can be automated away with little problem. There is even an army of bots that scurry around generating short articles about rivers, cities, or animals by slotting their names into formulaic phrases. Anybody can use it to cause massive damage with a few clicks. But community-run platforms live and die on the size of their communities. It is not magic,” says Amir Aharoni, a member of the volunteer Language Committee, which oversees requests to open or close Wikipedia editions. “If you use machine translation responsibly, it can be efficient and useful. Unfortunately, you cannot trust all people to use it responsibly.” Trosterud has studied the behavior of users on small Wikipedia editions and says AI has empowered a subset that he terms “Wikipedia hijackers.” These users can range widely—from naive teenagers creating pages about their hometowns or their favorite YouTubers to well-meaning Wikipedians who think that by creating articles in minority languages they are in some way “helping” those communities. “The problem with them nowadays is that they are armed with Google Translate,” Trosterud says, adding that this is allowing them to produce much longer and more plausible-looking content than they ever could before: “Earlier they were armed only with dictionaries.” This has effectively industrialized the acts of destruction—which affect vulnerable languages most, since AI translations are typically far less reliable for them. And sometimes models struggle to identify a language because it is similar to others, or because some, including Greenlandic and most Native American languages, have structures that make them badly suited to the way most machine translation systems work. Research produced by Google before a major expansion of Google Translate rolled out three years ago found that translation systems for lower-resourced languages were generally of a lower quality than those for better-resourced ones. Researchers found, for example, that their model would often mistranslate basic nouns across languages, including the names of animals and colors. (In a statement to MIT Technology Review, Google wrote that it is “committed to meeting a high standard of quality for all 249 languages” it supports “by rigorously testing and improving [its] systems, particularly for languages that may have limited public text resources on the web.”) Wikipedia itself offers a built-in editing tool called Content Translate, which allows users to automatically translate articles from one language to another—the idea being that this will save time by preserving the references and fiddly formatting of the originals. But it piggybacks on external machine translation systems, so it's largely plagued by the same weaknesses as other machine translators—a problem that the Wikimedia Foundation says is hard to solve. (Notably, English-language Wikipedia has largely banned its use, claiming that some 95% of articles created using Content Translate failed to meet an acceptable standard without significant additional work.) But it's at least easy to tell when the program has been used; Content Translate adds a tag on the Wikipedia back end. Still, many Wikipedia editors I spoke with said that once their languages were added to major online translation tools, they noticed a corresponding spike in the frequency with which poor, likely machine-translated pages were created. They may see themselves as providing smaller communities with rough-cut articles that speakers can then fix—essentially following the same model that has worked well for more active Wikipedia editions. But once error-filled pages are produced in small languages, there is usually not an army of knowledgeable people who speak those languages standing ready to improve them. There are few readers of these editions, and sometimes not a single regular editor. Yuet Man Lee, a Canadian teacher in his 20s, says that he used a mix of Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate a handful of articles that he had written for the English Wikipedia into Inuktitut, thinking it'd be nice to pitch in and help a smaller Wikipedia community. “I did not think that anybody would notice [the article],” he explains. Nobody has touched the article since he created it. Lee, who teaches social sciences in Vancouver and first started editing entries in the English Wikipedia a decade ago, says that users familiar with more active Wikipedias can fall victim to this mindset, which he terms a “bigger-Wikipedia arrogance”: When they try to contribute to smaller Wikipedia editions, they assume that others will come along to fix their mistakes. Lee says he had previously contributed several articles to Wikipedia in Tatar, a language spoken by several million people mainly in Russia, and at least one of those was eventually corrected. But the Inuktitut Wikipedia is, by comparison, a “barren wasteland.” “I am now thinking that it may have been a bad idea. It is this commitment that drives many of the regular small-language editors I spoke with. They all feared what would happen if garbage continued to appear on their pages. Abdulkadir sees an urgent need for the Fulfulde Wikipedia to work properly. He has been suggesting it as one of the few online resources for farmers in remote villages, potentially offering information on which seeds or crops might work best for their fields in a language they can understand. If you give them a machine-translated article, Abdulkadir told me, then it could “easily harm them,” as the information will probably not be translated correctly into Fulfulde. Abdulkadir said he had recently been forced to correct an article about cowpeas, a foundational cash crop across much of Africa, after discovering that it was largely illegible. If someone wants to create pages on the Fulfulde Wikipedia, Abdulkadir said, they should be translated manually. Nevertheless, he estimates that some 60% of articles are still uncorrected machine translations. Abdulkadir told me that unless something important changes with how AI systems learn and are deployed, then the outlook for Fulfulde looks bleak. “It is going to be terrible, honestly,” he said. Both had been automatically translated via Wikipedia's Content Translate and contained so many mistakes that she said it would have given her a headache to continue reading them. “There are some terms that have not even been translated. “This one even includes letters that are not used in the Igbo language,” she said. Iwuala began regularly contributing to Wikipedia three years ago out of concern that Igbo was being displaced by English. She often finds herself having to explain at online edit-a-thons she organizes, or over email to various error-prone editors, that the results can be the exact opposite, pushing users away: “You will be discouraged and you will no longer want to visit this place. You will just abandon it and go back to the English Wikipedia.” Hawaiian, which was teetering on the verge of extinction several decades ago, has been undergoing a recovery effort led by Indigenous activists and academics. “We have been fighting tooth and nail in an uphill climb for language revitalization. There is nothing easy about that, and this can add extra impediments. People are going to think that this is an accurate representation of the Hawaiian language.” The consequences of all these Wikipedia errors can quickly become clear. AI translators that have undoubtedly ingested these pages in their training data are now assisting in the production, for instance, of error-strewn AI-generated books aimed at learners of languages as diverse as Inuktitut and Cree, Indigenous languages spoken in Canada, and Manx, a small Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Many of these have been popping up for sale on Amazon. “It was just complete nonsense,” says Richard Compton, a linguist at the University of Quebec in Montreal, of a volume he reviewed that had purported to be an introductory phrasebook for Inuktitut. Rather than making minority languages more accessible, AI is now creating an ever expanding minefield for students and speakers of those languages to navigate. “It is a slap in the face,” Compton says. He worries that younger generations in Canada, hoping to learn languages in communities that have fought uphill battles against discrimination to pass on their heritage, might turn to online tools such as ChatGPT or phrasebooks on Amazon and simply make matters worse. According to UNESCO, a language is declared extinct every two weeks. But whether the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, has an obligation to the languages used on its platform is an open question. “Ultimately, the responsibility really lies with the community to see that there is no vandalism or unwanted activity, whether through machine translation or other means,” she said. Usually, Bhattacharjee added, editions were considered for closure only if a specific complaint was raised about them. But if there is no active community, how can an edition be fixed or even have a complaint raised? Bhattacharjee explained that the Wikimedia Foundation sees its role in such cases as about maintaining the Wikipedia platform in case someone comes along to revive it: “It is the space that we provide for them to grow and develop. Inari Saami, spoken in a single remote community in northern Finland, is a poster child for how people can take good advantage of Wikipedia. Their parents created the Inari Saami Language Association in a last-ditch bid to keep it going. There are now several hundred speakers, schools that use Inari Saami as a medium of instruction, and 6,400 Wikipedia articles in the language, each one copy-edited by a fluent speaker. This success highlights how Wikipedia can indeed provide small and determined communities with a unique vehicle to promote their languages' preservation. We care about quality,” says Fabrizio Brecciaroli, a member of the Inari Saami Language Association. “We are planning to use Wikipedia as a repository for the written language. We need to provide tools that can be used by the younger generations. Wikipedia has even offered a way to introduce words into Inari Saami. “We have to make up new words all the time,” Brecciaroli says. “Young people need them to speak about sports, politics, and video games. “The ultimate goal is to make sure that Inari Saami survives,” Brecciaroli says. That may be true—though large language models like ChatGPT can be made to translate phrases into languages that more traditional machine translation tools do not offer. Brecciaroli told me that ChatGPT isn't great in Inari Saami but that the quality varies significantly depending on what you ask it to do; if you ask it a question in the language, then the answer will be filled with words from Finnish and even words it invents. “ChatGPT only needs a lot of words,” Brecciaroli says. That is the hope.” This is an idea supported by multiple linguists I spoke with—that it may be possible to end the “garbage in, garbage out” cycle. (OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, did not respond to a request for comment.) Still, the overall problem is likely to grow and grow, since many languages are not as lucky as Inari Saami—and their AI translators will most likely be trained on more and more AI slop. Wehr, unfortunately, seems far less optimistic about the future of his beloved Greenlandic. Months of bitter debate followed between dozens of Wikipedia bureaucrats; some seemed to be surprised that a superficially healthy-seeming edition could be gripped by so many problems. Then, earlier this month, Wehr's proposal was accepted: Greenlandic Wikipedia is set to be shuttered, and any articles that remain will be moved into the Wikipedia Incubator, where new language editions are tested and built. If you prompt either Google Translate or ChatGPT to do something as simple as count to 10 in proper Greenlandic, neither program can deliver.
