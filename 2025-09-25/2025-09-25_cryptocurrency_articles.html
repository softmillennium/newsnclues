                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the 80th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Pakistan took a visible step forward in shaping the global debate on technology, youth, and sustainable development. Across both engagements, Bilal Bin Saqib and Pakistan's message was clear: for the developing world, technology is not an optional add-on but an essential tool for survival, resilience, and progress. In the social business forum, Pakistan underscored the reality that millions of young people are already using digital tools to receive remittances, fund micro-enterprises, and connect with the global economy. This adoption is not driven by speculation but by necessity, families seeking faster payments, entrepreneurs looking for capital, and communities searching for solutions. The challenge, as Pakistan framed it, is how to channel this grassroots energy into transparent, accountable, and socially productive systems that can scale. Pakistani Crypto Minister stated that AI is not a luxury reserved for advanced economies, but a necessity for developing nations seeking to leapfrog structural barriers. His call was for global cooperation to ensure equitable access, ethical safeguards, and collaborative models that allow the Global South to build capacity rather than fall further behind. At UNGA80, it was treated as an active participant in shaping the global conversation on the intersection of technology, development, and youth empowerment. The progress made in digital adoption, particularly in crypto and blockchain, was acknowledged in New York as a case study of how emerging economies can move quickly when driven by need. For Pakistan, this marks a subtle but important shift in perception. No longer simply a recipient of development agendas, the country is positioning itself as a contributor of ideas and models, demonstrating how digital assets, social business frameworks, and AI can converge to tackle challenges of poverty, inequality, and climate vulnerability. The UNGA80 discussions showed that Pakistan is increasingly being viewed not as a follower, but as a country ready to lead in the Global South's engagement with emerging technologies. Bilal Bin Saqib also met with Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, the President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, and Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development and Innovation, Zhaslan Madiyev, during his visit to New York.

Other Fed officials, including Beth Hammack and Austan Goolsbee, urged the bank to exercise caution when cutting rates. Cryptocurrencies do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates, as that leads to a risk-on sentiment. In contrast, most coins rally when there is greed, as this stimulates fear of missing out among investors. Liquidations also jumped by over 800% on Monday to more than $1.65 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real-world asset specialist Centrifuge has launched what it calls the first licensed S&P 500 index fund on blockchain rails, opening one of the world's most recognized equity benchmarks to on-chain investors. The initiative fits into a broader trend of bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and equities, often called real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Proponents explore tokenization for operational gains, speedier settlements and around-the-clock trading. Centrifuge, which has built infrastructure for tokenizing private credit and fixed income since 2017, sees SPXA as its entry point into equities, a tokenization trend that has recently taken off. "Indices are the best way to bring stocks on-chain," Bhaji Illuminati, CEO of Centrifuge, said in a statement. "They're simple, collateral-ready and unlock liquidity in ways individual securities can't."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped below $112,000 on Thursday amid a broader sell-off in crypto and stocks. While the largest cryptocurrency declined 2%, ethereum (ETH-USD), solana (SOL-USD), and other coins saw larger declines in what has been a rocky week for the crypto market. Ether fell roughly 5% to below $4,000 before paring losses, marking its lowest level since August, as ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net outflows over the past 24 hours. More than $1.6 billion in long positions was liquidated earlier this week, spooking investors. According to CoinGlass, over the past 24 hours, $511 million across all cryptoassets was liquidated. The action comes as stocks decline from recent records amid investor concerns of frothiness driven by AI enthusiasm and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates. The Treasury has been refilling this account in recent weeks by issuing T-bills and bonds, serving as a type of liquidity drain for crypto. The diversion of cash into government debt can reduce demand for risk assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The rout in bitcoin and ether extended into crypto-related stocks on Thursday. Trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) each declined more than 1%. Bitcoin holder Strategy (MSTR) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) also declined.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SharpLink has appointed Superstate as its digital transfer agent, according to a statement on Thursday, using its Opening Bell onchain issuance solution to tokenize SBET equity in a legally compliant way. The firm said it aims to demonstrate how public companies can use blockchain infrastructure to create shareholder value, improve market efficiency, and drive forward the next generation of capital markets. The two companies also plan to explore compliant ways for tokenized equities to trade on automated market makers and other DeFi protocols, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's Project Crypto initiative to modernize securities regulation for digital assets and onchain markets. "SharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate's Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company," Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said. "We're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond." SharpLink joins other public firms such as the recently-formed Solana treasury company Forward Industries and crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital in leveraging Superstate's Opening Bell for stock tokenization, albeit on the Solana blockchain in their case. Robinhood, xStocks, and Coinbase are also pursuing onchain solutions for public equities as the tokenization trend gains traction. Chaired by Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin, SharpLink embarked on its Ethereum treasury strategy in June and has since accumulated more than 830,000 ETH ($3.3 billion) and generated over 3,815 ETH ($15.3 million) in staking rewards. It is currently the second-largest corporate Ethereum holder behind Tom Lee's BitMine, according to SER data. And now we are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum," Lubin said Thursday. "As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink's conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built." SBET is trading down 5% in Thursday trading, according to The Block's SharpLink price page, echoing a broader correction across the crypto market.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ohio has taken a decisive leap into the digital economy, formally approving a vendor to process cryptocurrency payments, including Bitcoin, for various state fees and services. This landmark decision, finalized on September 25, 2025, marks a significant re-engagement by the state with digital assets, building on previous efforts and positioning Ohio at the forefront of governmental crypto adoption. This renewed commitment to integrating cryptocurrencies into state operations is a clear signal of Ohio's progressive stance on emerging financial technologies. The state's approach, which involves a third-party processor immediately converting crypto payments into U.S. dollars, safeguards against market volatility while leveraging the efficiency of digital transactions. The chosen third-party vendor will now facilitate the acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for a range of state fees, ensuring immediate conversion to U.S. dollars before funds are deposited into state accounts. This strategy shields the state from direct exposure to crypto market fluctuations. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose confirmed that his office, responsible for nearly half a million transactions annually, is poised to be among the first agencies to implement this new payment method. Complementing this, the recently advanced Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) further solidifies the state's crypto-friendly environment by exempting cryptocurrency transactions under $200 from capital gains taxes, a measure designed to encourage everyday crypto usage. Ohio's journey into cryptocurrency payments has been a dynamic one. However, this initial program was suspended in 2019 due to legal and procedural concerns. The current initiative, championed by Secretary LaRose and Treasurer Robert Sprague, began gaining traction in April 2025 with a formal request to the State Board of Deposit to re-authorize cryptocurrency payments, citing updated legal guidance. The Ohio House of Representatives further bolstered these efforts by passing the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) in June 2025, signaling strong legislative support for broader digital asset integration. Industry leaders like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter have publicly praised Ohio's forward-thinking approach, recognizing its potential to set a national precedent. Initial reactions from the cryptocurrency industry have been overwhelmingly positive. The approval is widely seen as a validation of digital assets' growing legitimacy and utility. Ohio now joins a select group of U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana, that have formally embraced cryptocurrency for government payments, with its progress expected to serve as a significant "test case" for other states considering similar integrations. Crypto Payment Processors: Companies specializing in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions are direct beneficiaries. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), a major publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange and infrastructure provider, stands to gain significantly. Its Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has been a vocal supporter, and Coinbase's role as a licensed money transmitter in Ohio positions it well to either be the chosen vendor, a partner, or simply benefit from increased crypto adoption that drives users to its platform. Increased government acceptance of crypto payment rails will likely lead to higher transaction volumes and greater institutional trust for these and other crypto payment gateway providers. Blockchain Technology Providers: Companies that provide the underlying blockchain infrastructure, security, and consulting services to payment processors or directly to state governments could see increased demand. The overall trend towards integrating blockchain technology into public finance opens new avenues for these companies. Companies with Crypto Exposure and Traditional Payment Networks: Public companies that have already invested in cryptocurrencies or offer crypto-related investment products may see a positive impact as mainstream adoption increases the perceived stability and utility of digital assets. Furthermore, traditional payment networks like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which have been actively exploring and partnering with blockchain and crypto companies, could integrate crypto payment rails into their existing systems or partner with approved processors. This ensures their continued relevance in an evolving payment landscape. Traditional Payment Processors and Banks: Companies primarily focused on fiat-based payment processing for government fees might experience a marginal decrease in transaction volume if a significant portion shifts to crypto. Many major banks are already exploring blockchain and crypto services, aiming to integrate rather than compete directly. Since Ohio's system converts crypto to USD, funds will still flow into the traditional banking system, mitigating direct losses but increasing the pressure for adaptation. Companies Resistant to Crypto Innovation: Any public company in the financial services or technology sector that entirely dismisses or is slow to adapt to the growing demand for and regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency payments could lose market share or relevance in the long run. Ohio's approval signals a broader governmental acceptance, which could accelerate consumer and business adoption of digital assets, leaving laggards behind. In essence, Ohio's move provides a significant boost to the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as a payment method, potentially leading to new revenue streams and enhanced market positioning for proactive crypto and blockchain companies. Ohio's renewed commitment to accepting crypto payments for state fees is far more than an isolated local event; it's a potent indicator of the mainstreaming of digital assets and reflects profound shifts in broader industry trends. As of September 25, 2025, this initiative fits squarely into a national movement towards the institutionalization and regulated utility of cryptocurrencies, promising ripple effects across various sectors and setting important regulatory precedents. The state's current efforts build upon its pioneering but ultimately suspended 2018 OhioCrypto.com initiative. By formally authorizing a vendor to process crypto payments, Ohio joins a growing cohort of U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana, that are actively integrating digital assets into their financial infrastructure. This collective state-level innovation signals a bottom-up pressure for federal clarity and further legitimate crypto's role in public finance. Firstly, there's an undeniable increase in government and institutional adoption of digital assets. This growing governmental embrace signifies a maturation of the asset class, moving beyond speculative trading to practical utility. Secondly, cryptocurrencies are increasingly recognized as a maturing asset class. Regulatory clarity, such as the SEC's settlement with Ripple and anticipated XRP ETF approvals, is boosting institutional confidence. Stablecoins are gaining traction as mediums of exchange, integrated by major players like Visa (NYSE: V) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), underscoring their growing utility for payments and settlements. The technological advancements in payments are also a crucial backdrop. Innovations in blockchain scalability, AI, and Web3 are enhancing transaction speed, security, and efficiency, making crypto payments a more viable option for large-scale operations like state governments. The U.S. is witnessing a shift towards clearer, more supportive crypto regulations, exemplified by the "GENIUS Act" signed by President Trump in July 2025, which provides a federal framework for stablecoins. While states like Ohio lead, federal efforts to clarify oversight and establish consistent rules (e.g., for the SEC and CFTC) will ultimately shape the national environment. It will intensify competition among payment processors, encouraging both traditional and crypto-native providers to innovate for government use cases. Historically, the adoption of cryptocurrency by a state government mirrors past shifts in payment technologies, from the gradual acceptance of credit cards to electronic funds transfers. Each new technology necessitates addressing concerns about security, reliability, and regulatory frameworks. Ohio's repeated foray into crypto payments, learning from its 2018 experience, demonstrates a persistent willingness among states to explore digital asset utility. This state-level experimentation, alongside the global discussion around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), underscores a fundamental evolution in how money and value are exchanged, blurring the lines between private and public monetary systems. Ohio is effectively serving as a crucial laboratory for this ongoing financial transformation. Ohio's recent approval of a crypto payment processor for state fees sets the stage for a dynamic period of implementation, observation, and potential expansion. Its passage would cement a favorable legal framework, clarifying regulations for crypto users and businesses within the state. Ohio's progress will undoubtedly serve as a benchmark for Colorado, Utah, Louisiana, and other states exploring similar initiatives. Looking to the long term, Ohio's vision extends beyond mere payment acceptance. A successful implementation could pave the way for widespread government adoption of crypto, potentially encompassing a broader range of services and even individual income tax payments. Discussions around establishing an "Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve" (HB 18/SB 57) are ongoing, which could see a portion of state funds allocated to digital assets, aligning with trends in nearly 50 other states. This could enhance financial efficiency and transparency for the state, leveraging blockchain's inherent capabilities. Robust cybersecurity and risk management protocols will be critical, especially if a crypto reserve is established. Expanding supported cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin will likely be necessary to meet diverse user needs. Perhaps most importantly, sustained public education campaigns will be crucial to overcome skepticism and ensure broad understanding and adoption, learning from the lower-than-anticipated uptake of the 2018 program. Ohio's crypto-friendly environment could attract a wave of blockchain businesses, fostering job creation and economic growth. Clear regulatory frameworks often boost investor confidence, drawing more capital into Ohio's digital asset market. Adoption barriers, such as unfamiliarity or perceived complexity, could also slow uptake. A less favorable outcome could see limited impact due to technical glitches, user hesitancy, or new regulatory hurdles, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of ambitions. The most impactful scenario might involve federal preemption or harmonization of crypto regulations, which would require Ohio to adapt its policies to a new national standard, potentially streamlining some aspects while introducing new constraints. Ohio's commitment in 2025 positions it at a pivotal juncture, with its success offering a blueprint for the future of digital assets in public finance. Ohio's recent approval of a vendor to process cryptocurrency payments for state fees, effective September 25, 2025, represents a significant and well-considered advancement in the state's digital economic strategy. This move, building upon previous exploratory efforts, firmly establishes Ohio as a leader in governmental crypto adoption, alongside states like Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana. It's a clear signal that digital assets are moving beyond niche speculation into the realm of practical, everyday utility within public finance. Key Takeaways: The core of this initiative is the modernization of state payment systems, driven by a growing demand for diverse payment options. By leveraging a third-party processor to instantly convert cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into U.S. dollars, Ohio effectively mitigates volatility risks while offering cutting-edge payment flexibility. This strategy is complemented by robust legislative efforts, including the "Ohio Blockchain Basics Act" (HB 116) and discussions around an "Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve," which collectively aim to create a comprehensive, crypto-friendly ecosystem within the state. This holistic approach distinguishes Ohio's current endeavor from its earlier, more limited foray into crypto payments. Ohio's actions align perfectly with broader national trends, where numerous states are exploring or implementing similar digital asset initiatives. This evolving landscape fosters greater investor confidence and encourages broader market participation. Globally, crypto adoption continues to accelerate, with Bitcoin remaining a dominant force, increasingly accepted by traditional financial institutions and governments alike. By demonstrating a successful model for integrating digital assets into government services, Ohio contributes to the normalization of crypto and accelerates its mainstream adoption. Furthermore, Ohio's efforts to cultivate a thriving blockchain ecosystem aim to attract innovation, talent, and investment, positioning the state as a vital hub in the emerging digital economy. Firstly, observe the actual implementation and usage rates of crypto payments for state fees in Ohio. While regulatory clarity is a strong tailwind, the inherent fluctuations of crypto markets will continue to influence adoption and investment decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. While Tether and Circle's USDC are the clear leaders right now, it's very possible a yet-to-be-released stablecoin could emerge as the long-term winner. That's according to Austin Campbell, a professor and former executive at stablecoin firm Paxos, who shared his thoughts on the latest edition of Fortune's Crypto Playbook (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube). Stablecoins such as Circle's USDC and Tether have long been popular among crypto traders as a form of settlement, but a series of high-profile acquisitions and IPOs—as well as Congress passing comprehensive legislation this summer to regulate the technology—have catapulted them into the mainstream. Now, big tech firms and banks alike are exploring integration, while new challengers are entering the market every week. According to Campbell, there is fierce competition between entrenched stablecoins like Tether and new entrants like Agora—whose appeal lies in the fact that their value doesn't fluctuate like Bitcoin or Ethereum—but that doesn't mean a new contender can't take the throne. While many crypto proponents make a similar argument for blockchain technology as a whole, Campbell has more claim to the potential growth for stablecoins. Congress's passage of the Genius Act in July is one catalyst, along with their clear use case over traditional payment rails, with stablecoins touting lower fees and faster transaction speeds. He pointed to payment firms from Mastercard and Visa to Stripe embracing stablecoins, even though their adoption might upend existing business models. But unlike other corners of the crypto industry, from NFTs to decentralized finance, the presence of established firms might make stablecoins more appealing to companies that would otherwise shy away from the volatile industry. “But if you have a major company like Stripe putting so many resources into it, obviously that could create demand.” FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH's breakdown from a key chart pattern can now lead to more losses for Ether price, targeting the $3,600–$3,400 zone in the short term. Ethereum now faces heavy long liquidation clusters at $2,370–$2,500. Ether price technicals hint at another 10%–15% drop this month. An Ethereum trader lost $36.4 million following the liquidation of a massive long bet, after Ether (ETH) slid below the $4,000 mark on Thursday. Wallet “0xa523” had staked 9,152 ETH on a price rise, only to be wiped out in one of the largest single-trader losses in the past 24 hours. Wallet “0xa523” was left with just $500,000, with its total realized losses exceeding $45.32 million, leading Lookonchain to call it Ethereum's “biggest loser.” The wipeout came amid a $331.66 million long squeeze that has punished bullish traders over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Ether's price has dipped 10.56% in the same period. Related: How one trader turned $125K into $43M on Ether — and what you can learn from it CoinGlass's liquidation heatmap highlights a huge build-up of leverage between $2,370 and $2,500. Therefore, if ETH keeps falling, many longs are set to be liquidated in that range, making it a likely area where selling could intensify before the market regains its footing. On the upside, a big cluster sits at $4,760–$5,000. Short sellers will be in trouble and could be forced to buy back, driving prices higher, if ETH rebounds to those levels. Popular analyst Kamran Azghar highlighted around $3,600 as a “key demand” zone, noting that the ETH price may rebound to seek $4,900 or higher. Meanwhile, Ethereum's weekly chart showed price retesting a key horizontal support zone around $3,800–$4,000, as highlighted by analyst Cold Blood Shiller. A successful defense of this level would strengthen the case for bullish continuation, turning former resistance into support. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First Public Company to Natively Issue Equity on the Ethereum Blockchain; Collaboration to Explore Regulated Trading of Tokenized Shares on Automated Market Makers Minneapolis, MN, Sept.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) (“SharpLink” or the “Company”), one of the world's largest corporate holders of Ether (“ETH”) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today announced its intention to tokenize its SEC-registered common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain, appointing financial technology firm Superstate as its Digital Transfer Agent. SharpLink intends to partner with Superstate to tokenize its equity on Ethereum through its Opening Bell platform, expanding Superstate's multichain capital markets infrastructure. SharpLink and Superstate also intend to closely collaborate on advancing how tokenized public equities can ultimately trade on Automated Market Makers (“AMMs”) and other decentralized finance (“DeFi”) protocols in a fully compliant manner. This initiative aligns with the SEC's broader Project Crypto innovation agenda aimed at modernizing U.S. securities regulation to better enable digital assets, blockchain and onchain markets. This work has the potential to position SharpLink's tokenized equity, along with future Opening Bell tokenizations, for secondary market trading on AMMs. Doing so would demonstrate how compliant tokenized securities can deliver broader utility, enhance liquidity and modernize capital flows for a new era of investor and issuer engagement. Commenting on the new partnership with Superstate, SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, stated, “Tokenizing SharpLink's equity directly on Ethereum is far more than a technological achievement – it is a statement about where we believe the future of the global capital markets is headed. By working with Superstate, not only are we enabling our shareholders to hold SBET shares natively on Ethereum, but we are also embarking on entirely new frontiers for how compliant, tokenized public equities could one day trade seamlessly through AMMs – an evolution we believe could redefine market structure itself.” Joseph Lubin, SharpLink's Chairman of the Board, Founder and CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum, added, “We're proud to have been the first public company to become a Digital Asset Treasury company on Ethereum, onboarding traditional finance to Ethereum. Launched in 2025, Opening Bell is a regulated onchain issuance and tokenization platform that allows companies to tokenize SEC-registered equity via blockchain infrastructure. Shares tokenized with Opening Bell remain fully compliant and legally equivalent to traditional book-entry equity, but can also be held in self-custodied wallets, integrated with digital financial products and made available to global investor segments. “SharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate's Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company,” said Superstate CEO Robert Leshner. “We're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond.” Since that time, the Company has accumulated more than 838,000 ETH and generated 3,815 ETH in native and liquid staking rewards as of late September, establishing itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum in the world. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) is one of the world's largest publicly traded companies to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset – a move that aligns the Company with the future of digital capital and gives investors direct exposure to Ethereum, the world's leading smart-contract platform and second largest digital asset. Superstate is a financial technology firm reshaping public capital markets. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, entities are generally required to measure certain digital intangible assets at fair value, with changes reflected in net income each reporting period. Additionally, for other certain types of crypto assets that are considered digital intangible assets, the Company uses the historical costs less impairment model.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, with thousands of ICOs launched over the past decade, competition for investor attention has become fierce. This is where ICO marketing plays a crucial role. It goes beyond basic promotion, focusing on building trust, creating awareness, and establishing a credible project identity. A strong ICO marketing strategy helps projects reach their target audience, communicate their vision, and ensure long-term sustainability in a highly competitive market. Core marketing components act as the backbone of any ICO strategy, ensuring that every touchpoint reflects professionalism, credibility, and transparency. Investors need clarity on not just what the project does, but also how it plans to achieve its vision. Without these essentials, even the most promising ideas risk fading into obscurity. Every successful ICO begins with a deep understanding of its target audience and the market it operates in. An experienced ICO Marketing Agency can provide in-depth investor research, helping identify whether the token offering appeals more to institutional investors, retail traders, or crypto enthusiasts. Market analysis further uncovers trends, opportunities, and gaps within the industry. Competitor benchmarking and regulatory awareness refine positioning, ensuring that messaging resonates with investors while staying compliant in a complex and evolving blockchain landscape. A thriving community is one of the most powerful assets an ICO can have. In the decentralized world of blockchain, community members aren't just spectators they are advocates, investors, and contributors who help spread awareness and drive growth. Active engagement fosters loyalty, while open communication channels create trust between project teams and supporters. Strong communities are also resilient, helping projects withstand challenges and build long-term momentum. Content is the bridge that connects complex blockchain ideas to investors in a clear and compelling way. A well-designed content strategy helps projects simplify technical details, showcase their expertise, and establish authority within the crypto ecosystem. Educational resources such as whitepapers, blog posts, and case studies offer transparency, while visually engaging formats like videos and infographics make information accessible to a broader audience. Beyond attracting investors, consistent content builds long-term trust and enhances search visibility. In a market flooded with hype, authentic and informative content ensures that projects stand out for the right reasons. In today's digital ecosystem, credibility is often amplified by voices of influence. Influencers serve as trusted intermediaries, helping projects reach audiences that already value their opinion. Media partnerships and interviews further validate the project's credibility, placing it on reputable platforms. By leveraging these collaborations, ICOs can tap into established communities, generate buzz, and foster trust at scale. Paid advertising channels allow projects to precisely target investors who are actively seeking blockchain opportunities. From crypto-friendly networks to search engine marketing, paid campaigns put the project directly in front of potential backers. When integrated with organic efforts, paid advertising provides a balanced approach, ensuring both immediate traction and sustainable growth for an ICO launch. This is why transparency, consistent communication, and post-ICO support are essential. Verified audits, performance monitoring, and milestone reporting reinforce credibility. Unlike paid ads, PR is often perceived as more authentic because it comes from third-party publications or journalists. Strong media coverage can amplify a project's reach, attract attention from investors, and position the team as innovators in the blockchain space. A successful ICO launch requires far more than innovative technology or token economics it depends on the strength of the marketing strategy. By focusing on trust, engagement, and credibility, ICOs can not only achieve a successful launch but also build a sustainable future in the competitive blockchain ecosystem. Alexei Dj is on a mission to make crypto development accessible and impactful for real-world use. Decentralized applications (dApps) have transformed digital ecosystems by providing transparency, security, and direct user control. However, scaling these applications on traditional blockchain networks presents significant challenges. High transaction costs, slow confirmation times, and limited throughput hinder the ability to serve large user bases effectively. Layer 2 blockchain solutions are designed to overcome these limitations by offloading operations from the main chain while maintaining security through cryptographic proofs. Leveraging these solutions allows developers to build high-performance, cost-effective, and scalable dApps capable of handling increasing user demands without compromising decentralization or application reliability. Cryptocurrencies offer exciting investment opportunities, but their rise has also fueled a surge in scams and frauds. For victims of crypto scams, recovering lost funds can seem daunting. This article explores the role of legitimate crypto recovery companies, with a focus on Puran Crypto Recovery (PCR), a trusted leader in restoring financial security in 2025. The stablecoin ecosystem has entered a new era where blockchain innovation meets tangible assets. Beyond fiat-backed tokens, a growing niche is emerging: commodity-backed stablecoins. These tokens are pegged to physical reserves such as gold, silver, oil, or a basket of metals, offering a hedge against inflation and bringing real-world assets on-chain. In this article, we explore the 10 commodity-backed stablecoin projects reshaping digital asset stability and why they matter in the broader conversation about Asset-Backed Stablecoins. That we lived in the house so long after what happened is something I'll never understand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The chief crypto analyst at crypto media platform Real Vision, Jamie Coutts, says Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins possess more upside potential. “Central banks, if (when) they reverse their balance sheet tightening, will set off another leg higher — with the move likely accentuated in altcoins. With that will likely come the conditions for a peak and potentially the setup for a deeper fall than what I would expect, worst case approximately 50%. According to Coutts, it is unlikely that the crypto market has reached a cycle top yet despite the recent pullback. “Liquidity's still supportive, but momentum refuses to deliver fireworks, frustrating everyone chasing a parabola. “Bitcoin's so-called ‘boring' climb actually echoes the slow crawl in global liquidity this cycle. “Still, two secular trends are bulletproof: blockchain adoption and monetary debasement. And for these reasons, it's best to zoom out and remember Bitcoin is fast becoming global collateral, it's an AI-beneficiary technology, the driver of energy grid stabilization/modernization and the anchor asset for global portfolios.” Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Philippines has launched a blockchain-based transparency system for its Department of Public Works and Highways after mass protests over alleged corruption in flood-control projects worth billions. Integrity Chain, developed by BayaniChain Ventures, was unveiled on Wednesday as a platform to record DPWH contracts and project milestones on a tamper-proof ledger. The goal is to turn “government records into digital public assets that are immutable, verifiable, and openly validated,” BayaniChain CEO and co-founder Paul Soliman told Decrypt. The project is part of a broader effort “to reshape accountability across every department and every peso spent,” making accountability “permanent, measurable, and unavoidable,” Soliman said. “Public trust will be rebuilt not on promises, but on cryptography, open validation, and a system where citizens themselves can verify outcomes,” he added. The declaration is remembered for widespread human rights abuses, censorship, and corruption. Similar to an earlier implementation at the Department of Budget and Management, Integrity Chain ingests data directly from DPWH systems, minting each contract, budget release, and project milestone as a digital public asset. Prismo, the orchestration layer, manages data handling, encryption, and validation. The platform runs on Polygon's Proof-of-Stake network, an Ethereum-compatible scaling solution that serves as its consensus and transparency layer. The records are then cryptographically time-stamped and anchored on-chain before reaching independent validators, so that “any attempt to withhold or manipulate information becomes visible rather than hidden,” Gelo Wong, chief growth officer and co-founder at BayaniChain, told Decrypt. Keys for validators are “hardware-secured, rotated periodically, and assigned to reviews through randomization,” with each validator action “recorded on-chain as its own public asset, ensuring that misconduct or bias is transparently logged,” Wong explained. More than 40 non-governmental organizations participated at launch, providing a “wide and diversified base of civic accountability,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The output of new enforcement actions from the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) has virtually ground to a halt in 2025, with a slowdown that greatly exceeds the slower pace of new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions. But, the CFTC Division of Enforcement has not gone away. A commodity trading adviser (CTA) as well as a commodity pool operator (CPO) and its principal, who previously pled guilty to orchestrating a novel cryptocurrency-related fraudulent scheme, have agreed to pay more than $2.8 million as part of a settlement with the CFTC, announced on September 17, 2025.1 The CFTC's announcement stated that it had obtained this judgment against Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), the CTA and CPO, and Peter Kambolin, its owner and registered associated person (collectively the "Defendants"). According to the consent order, these Defendants improperly allocated profitable trades between two commodity pools and certain proprietary accounts, misled pool participants, and violated CFTC requirements on trade allocation. The court found from January 2019 through November 2021 that the Defendants marketed SAM as a CTA and CPO offering strategies in exchange-traded cryptocurrency and foreign exchange futures. The Defendants ran at least two pools but executed those pool trades alongside trades of their proprietary accounts and then allocated the trades across the accounts each day. More specifically, the Defendants consistently directed profitable trades to their own accounts and assigned losing or less profitable trades to the pools, defrauding participants and violating CFTC requirements that customer trades be allocated fairly and equitably. They also misrepresented that the pools would primarily trade cryptocurrency and FX futures. Returning to the criminal case and his guilty plea, Kambolin's case marked the first time that prosecutors brought criminal charges related to cherry-picking against a commodity pool trader focused, at least in part, on digital asset futures. Kambolin was sentenced in January 2024 to two years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release and a year-and-a-half of home confinement.
