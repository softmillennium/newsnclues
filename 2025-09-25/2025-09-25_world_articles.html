While the scale has intensified dramatically, this enforcement of social hegemony through literary and aesthetic regulation is not a new phenomenon. Historian Andrew Hartman contends that “the history of America, for better and worse, is largely a history of debates about the idea of America.” We are watching this ideological question play out violently, attempting to delineate which bodies are “American,” what behavior is “American,” and what art, what literature, what television is “American.” One of the many ways this debate is performed is through grand displays of moral outrage over literature, as well as through the banning of books and education material. In the 2023-2024 academic year, schools and libraries across the country fought a record number of book bans — a figure that will likely rise as increasing restrictions are imposed on academic institutions, museums, and libraries. Gavin Newsom signed an assembly bill into law protecting school curricula from gender- and race-based bans. Tony Thurmond, state superintendent of public instruction, celebrated this victory, proclaiming that the measure “sends a strong signal to the people of California — but also to every American — that in the Golden State — we don't ban books — we cherish them.” While these safeguards are undeniably important, Thurmond's conviction that “we don't ban books” is missing a caveat: We don't ban books here — except in our state prisons. Access to literature for people experiencing incarceration has always been heavily monitored; often the very same books that state officials fight for access to in public schools are restricted in jails and prisons. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. On August 19, 2024, his memoir Badfish: Stories from the Dark House was published by Blue Ear Books. “DARK HOUSE” is used throughout the book as a surrogate word for prison. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, despite large doubts remaining about his culpability. (He had not matched the description of initial reports, nor was he selected by any eyewitnesses in photo lineups conducted in the days after.) Despite these acknowledgements, Murdoch is still living out his sentence at the High Desert State Prison in Susanville, California, 30 years later. The day Badfish wasreleased in August 2024, Murdoch's sister sent him a copy. In September, Blue Ear Books received a letter from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Division of Adult Institutions informing them that Badfish had been confiscated as contraband and placed on the centralized list of banned publications across California prisons. Murdoch confirmed over the phone that one year after the publication of his life story, he has still never seen his completed work. Recently, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was required to publicly list its Disapproved Publications, displaying the hundreds of titles that have been deemed a threat to security. There is no specific requirement for qualities that merit suppression, just that they present a “legitimate penological interest.” Basic Drawing by Louis Priscilla rests atop the “B” section — the list informs us that it “contains frontal nudity.” Considering nudity in art potentially dangerous seems ironic when the group “at risk” has nearly nonexistent privacy. Further down, we are told that Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is disallowed for lacking “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.” This murky phrasing does not reveal what qualities merit “serious value” in the eyes of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Further still, The Kite Runner allegedly“contains conduct which is or appears to be forceful, threatening or violent,” and Merriam-Webster's Visual Dictionary “presents a serious threat to facility security.” As we fight the increasing suppression of material in our schools, libraries, and historical records, we must not forget the people living through incarceration. These nonsensical justifications seem to be at odds with the newly minted “California Model” currently being implemented at San Quentin, inspired by the “Nordic Model” of imprisonment guided by rehabilitation. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation website claims that the model aims to expand education and job opportunities, reentry planning, and shift expectations for correctional officers to implement a more rehabilitative environment. However, the arbitrary limitation of reading material clashes with this vision. Book bans are recognized by California officials at the public school curriculum level to be damaging and controlling. Why does this recognition not extend to populations beyond students? The vast majority of those behind bars will leave at some point — should we not ensure that those re-entering society are better educated, better informed? “I think that my book, getting my book published, is a testament to rehabilitation — I had to teach myself how to read and write … I would have hoped the Department of Corrections would have stood behind me and supported me in that, but instead they banned my book,” he said. The strict regulation of art, news, and literature under the guise of “safety” or “value” or “obscenity” are smokescreens that have been employed to retain control over the voices and subject matter available to readers or viewers. As we fight the increasing suppression of material in our schools, libraries, and historical records, we must not forget the people living through incarceration — those who are all too familiar with navigating this erasure, arbitrary restriction, and state-sanctioned censorship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO and the EU have "declared war" on Russia through Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed at a G20 foreign ministers' meeting on Sept. 25. Lavrov's remarks come amid rising tensions between Russia and NATO following recent violations of the alliance's airspace by Russian drones and fighter jets. His comments echoed a similar statement made by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Sept. 15, who said that NATO is at war with Russia due to ongoing military support for Kyiv. Peskov's comments came days after Poland shot down Russian drones that entered its airspace. Following multiple Russian airspace violations across NATO member states, U.S. President Donald Trump said allies should shoot down Russian aircraft breaching their airspace, a position backed by several European officials. Poland shot down at least three Russian drones that entered its airspace on Sept. 10, while a few days later, Romania reported a Russian drone flying over its territory for nearly an hour. A recent surge in Russian airspace violations and other provocations on NATO territory, including disinformation campaigns, has heightened concerns in the West over the risk of a broader Russian military escalation.

She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Olena Zelenska thanked Melania Trump "for her support of Ukraine, particularly for her attention to children who have become victims of Russia's brutal war." "This creates a critical situation that threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also European countries," Energoatom said. NATO potentially shooting down Russian planes in its airspace "would be war," Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25. A DDoS attack on the SPB payment system and the telecom provider Transtelekom on Sept. 24 allegedly disrupted instant transfers and online payments for many users. "Behind this surprising optimism lies a signal of reduced U.S. involvement and a shift of responsibility for ending the war to Europe," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teachers' unions and civil rights groups say the legislation could stifle criticisms of Israel. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. A controversial California bill that would appoint an “Antisemitism Coordinator” is heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk. Teachers' unions and civil rights groups warn that the legislation, which is purported to combat antisemitism, will stifle criticisms of Israel and its genocidal assault on Gaza. AB 715 was introduced by Assembly members Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay). That coordinator would be able to review the curriculum, and threaten schools with fines and dismissals for refusing to remove material deemed “factually inaccurate.” Multiple lawmakers said they weren't given adequate time to assess it. The Assembly Education Committee's hearing on AB 715 was only informational. A last-minute waiver enabled the legislation to proceed without committee approval. “We've been robbed of the opportunity to demonstrate that people can trust us in this process,” said Assembly member Mia Bonta, who sits on the Education Committee. “It is very disappointing that our CA legislators are ignoring objections to this bill from every major teachers union, from every educational association and significant concerns of constitutionality from the ACLU to ramrod through this terrible bill at the very end of the legislative session without full opportunity for public input and without meaningful dialogue with Palestinians,” Jewish Voice for Peace Action national board member Seth Morrison told Mondoweiss. “It is beyond shameful that California lawmakers are fast tracking a bill that mirrors Trump's right-wing playbook of silencing Palestinians, all while this government is enabling Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza,” said AROC Action Executive Director Lara Kiswani. “We have compromised on numerous things with our colleagues who expressed concerns,” Assembly member Addis told the Jewish News of Northern California. JPAC Executive Director David Bocarsly said it represented a “historic stand against antisemitism in our schools.” “For far too long, Jewish students have endured slurs, bullying, and open hostility in their classrooms with nowhere to turn,” claimed Bocarsly. “AB 715 is a promise to those students — and to all children in California — that they are not invisible, that their safety and dignity matter, and that our state will not stand idly by in the face of hate. It's about protecting children, defending civil rights, and ensuring every student can walk into school proud of who they are.” Organizers, educators, and activists are calling on Governor Newsom to veto the “Classroom Censorship Bill.” He can either side with educators, civil rights advocates, and students whose voices are at risk of being silenced — or he can greenlight censorship that will make classrooms less free and less inclusive,” said CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said in a statement. “Real harassment and discrimination must always be addressed — but this bill is not the way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of US generals and admirals around the globe have been called to Virginia for a meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth next Tuesday, several US officials told CNN, though the reason for the meeting is unclear. One source familiar said they'd heard theories ranging from a group physical fitness test, to receiving a briefing on the state of the Defense Department, to a mass firing of officers, but regardless of the reason the sudden convening of so many senior military officers is highly unusual. “It's being referred to as the general squid games,” one official quipped. Some officials also voiced security concerns about having so many high-ranking officers in one place at the same time. Hegseth shuts down group advising on women in the military The meeting comes as the Trump administration has fired a slew of high-profile general and flag officers since taking office in January, in many instances due to Hegseth's campaign against diversity-related issues, but often also for unspecified reasons. Hegseth also ordered the Defense Department in May to cut the number of four-star generals and admirals by at least 20%. Before taking on the role of defense secretary, Hegseth repeatedly voiced disdain for much of the military's currently serving general and flag officer corps. In a podcast appearance last summer, Hegseth said a third of the military's senior officers are “actively complicit” in what he argued is a move towards politicization of the military. In a second podcast, he said senior officers are “playing by all the wrong rules” to cater to “idealogues in Washington, DC.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO and the European Union have declared a real war on Russia through Ukraine, and are already directly participating in it, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a meeting of G20 foreign ministers. He noted that the refusal to adhere to the principles of the UN Charter is "a manifestation of neocolonial ambitions, [which] leads to increased global instability and breeds regional conflicts." "A clear example is the crisis in Ukraine, provoked by the collective West, through which NATO and the European Union want to declare, in fact, have already declared a real war on my country and are directly participating in it," Lavrov said at the event taking place on the sidelines of the high-level week of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly. "The escalation in the Middle East is in the same row," Lavrov continued. "The unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has already claimed the lives of 65,000 people, and some UN officials working in the Middle East say there are estimates that the death toll is 10 times higher. None of Israel's neighbors can feel safe; we see this every day." The head of Russian diplomacy also noted that the Foreign Ministers' meeting is taking place in a year of "two epochal anniversaries." "Eighty years ago, with the Soviet Union playing a key role, German Nazism and Japanese militarism were crushed, with the Peoples' Republic of China making a special contribution to the victory. This victory made it possible to establish the United Nations, which the Founding Fathers called upon to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war' and 'promote social progress.' Reliance on the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in their entirety, comprehensiveness, and interrelationship, is the key to the peaceful, progressive development of all states without exception - both large and small," Lavrov stated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has the support of every living former chair of the central bank's powerful Board in her legal battle with President Donald Trump, who tried to fire her last month based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, according to an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court Thursday. An appeals court earlier this month kept Cook in her post through a preliminary injunction while her lawsuit challenging Trump's firing attempt moves forward — just days before the central bank's September policy meeting. The administration appealed that decision, and is now being considered by the nation's highest court. Former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen warned against overturning the injunction, stating that it would “threaten” the Fed's independence of politics and “erode public confidence in the Fed.” The brief was also signed off by some Republicans who once served in high-ranking government roles, such as former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Glenn Hubbard. “The Fed's ability to fight inflation is directly related not only to its actual insulation from short-term political pressures but also to the public's perception of its independence—because if the public and financial markets believe that the Federal Reserve is sufficiently insulated, they will act in accordance with that expectation, resulting in lower and more stable inflation, which is consistent with lower long-term interest rates,” according to the brief. Meanwhile, the allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook haven't been taken to court. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte first raised the accusations on social media and it is now being investigated by the Justice Department. So far, the administration hasn't revealed a smoking gun. Cook's legal battle is part of Trump's broader attempt to reshape the Fed's top ranks. At the central bank's rate-setting meeting earlier this month, Cook deliberated the economy alongside the newest Fed Governor Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser to Trump and who is taking an unpaid leave to serve a vacated term on the central bank's Board of Governors. Miran was sworn in an hour before the Fed's September 16-17 meeting, he told CNBC last week. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Restructuring comes after six quarters of falling sales and growing pressure from unions over working conditions Starbucks will lay off around 900 staff and pull down the shutters on some 100 cafes across North America as part of a $1bn restructuring plan to revive the world's largest coffee chain. The business, which eliminated 1,100 corporate positions earlier this year, will also close “many” open or vacant positions as it notifies affected employees affected by cuts on Friday. The firm's US sales have dropped for six straight quarters as consumers, grappling with years of higher inflation, think twice before ordering its pricey coffees. The latest cuts are designed to “reinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them”, the Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, wrote in a letter to employees on Thursday. But Starbucks Workers United, a union representing workers at hundreds of its stores, said the move “makes it clear things are only going backwards” at the chain. “Fixing what's broken at Starbucks isn't possible without centering the people who engage with the company's customers day in and day out,” it said. Starbucks attributed about 90% of the restructuring cost to its North American business, with $150m expected in employee separation costs and $850m in costs related to store closures. Starbucks also plans to “uplift” more than 1,000 store locations in the next 12 months, Niccol added, “to introduce greater texture, warmth and layered design”. In his letter, Niccol did not mention the union organizing efforts at Starbucks. More than 650 Starbucks stores in the US have unionized, with workers pushing for a first union contract.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 1,200 industry figures claim the pledge is ‘a document of misinformation' and that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are ‘often the loudest critics of government policy' More than 1,200 entertainment industry figures have signed a new open letter rejecting the recent high-profile pledge by thousands of their peers to boycott Israeli films over the war in Gaza. Stars including Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Debra Messing are among those who have lent their names to the letter, which says the previous pledge “advocates” for “the erasure of art”. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.” It accuses the pledge circulated by Film Workers for Palestine and signed by stars including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo of being not “an act of conscience” but rather “a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.” “When artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,” added Messing in a statement. The initial pledge was published on 8 September and was signed by some 1,200 professionals – rising overnight to 4,000 and now standing at around 5,000 – who vowed not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”. “As film-makers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,” the pledge reads. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.” The following week, studio Paramount also condemned the boycott in a statement which read: “Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace. The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication – not less.” To our fellow artists and the global film community, That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda. The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment. Israel's film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistently program dissent. They are often the loudest critics of government policy. The pledge uses nebulous terms like “implicating” and “complicity.” Who will decide which Israeli film-makers and film institutions are “complicit”? Or is “complicity” just a pretext to boycott all Israelis and Zionists – 95% of the world's Jewish population – no matter what they create or believe? Censorship has been used to silence film-makers before: Nazi Germany's propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood's own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimises falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame. We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Thursday with the Republican leader signaling that the U.S. government's hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara may soon be lifted. During Trump's first term, the United States kicked out Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after it purchased an air defence system from Russia. The two leaders forged what Trump has described as a “very good relationship” during his first White House go-around despite the U.S.-Turkey relationship often being complicated. U.S. officials have cited concerns about Turkey's human rights record under Erdogan and the country's ties with Russia. Trump in remarks before reporters focused his concerns on Turkey's continued economic relationship with Russia. Turkey has been one of the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuel since the European Union announced in early 2023 it would boycott most Russian seaborne oil. Since January 2023, Ankara has purchased more than $90 billion in Russian oil, coal and natural gas. Only China and India have bought more from Russia in that period. “The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,” Trump said of Erdogan. The push on Erdogan to become more engaged in pressuring Putin comes after Trump earlier this week said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia in the war. During Trump's first term, the United States kicked out Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after it purchased an air defence system from Russia.Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters Erdogan has made clear he is eager to see the hold on F-35s lifted, telling Trump that he came prepared to “thoroughly discuss” the issue. The Turkish president was even blunter in a television interview this week. “I don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go,” Erdogan said in an interview this week on Fox News Channel's Special Report with Bret Baier. President Joe Biden's administration kept Erdogan, who has served as Turkey's president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, at an arm's length during the Democrat's four years in office. Opposition parties and human rights organizations have accused Erdogan of undermining democracy and curbing freedom of expression during his more than two decades in power. Trump sees Erdogan as a critical partner and credible intermediary in his effort to find ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Trump and European leaders have followed Erdogan in embracing Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once commanded a rebel group that was designated a foreign terrorist organization. “He doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement.” He believes Turkey can play an essential role for European security and is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine, Syria and U.S. tariffs that have sparked a global trade war. Turkey also believes it has emerged as a credible broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. However, the fall of Assad aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and Israel, with their conflicting interests pushing the relationship toward a possible collision course. Trump has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be “reasonable” in his dealings with Ankara. Erdogan has been critical of Israel's handling of the war, which was launched after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and takin about 250 people captive. Erdogan, in his UN address, alleged that Israeli forces have committed genocide, an allegation contested by Israel and United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stu Kedwell, senior portfolio manager and global head of equities at RBC Global Asset Management Inc.Craig Bagol/The Globe and Mail Stu Kedwell was 19 when he inherited 40 shares of U.S. conglomerate 3M from his grandmother's estate. Although he launched a window-washing business and sold futons while earning a commerce degree at Queen's University, stocks still weren't on his radar. He and Doug Raymond co-run the $8.2-billion RBC North American Value Fund, a Canadian-focused equity offering that has outpaced the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index since 2005. We asked Kedwell why he's a gold bull and likes Berkshire Hathaway. After identifying companies that we want to own, we do scenario analysis to understand different outcomes for them. We want businesses that can compound faster than the stock market over time. We're finding more value in Canadian equities, which is 60% of the fund. All domestic sectors, except for technology, trade in line or below their long-term averages. Loan losses at the banks are a worry due to rising unemployment and falling condo prices, but they're well capitalized to deal with the challenges. We acquired shares of TD on weakness last year when it was dealing with money-laundering issues. Oil prices have fallen, but the balance sheets of energy firms are strong, and their free cash flow generation is very reasonable. These stocks are attractive if crude recovers in 18 to 24 months. In the meantime, we can collect attractive dividend income. TC Energy, which is more gas-focused, will also benefit from the build-out of liquefied natural gas plants in Canada. You own the iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold ETF. More central banks and foreign countries want to own it versus the U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons, including their worries after sanctions were imposed on Russia when it invaded Ukraine. The dollar has arguably plateaued and is set to weaken, so that's good for gold, as well as concerns about the growing U.S. fiscal deficit. We prefer owning an ETF in the gold sector to reduce the risk of owning individual stocks. Is it still attractive given that its legendary investor, Warren Buffett, will retire at year-end? I like conglomerates like Berkshire because you get revenue from many sources, and it's reallocated back across their businesses. Berkshire gets a lot of cash from its insurance group. When the skies are sunny, it's what you expect Berkshire to do. Among the so-called Magnificent Seven U.S. tech stocks, your fund owns Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple. We also owned chipmaker Nvidia but sold it in July because its valuation had already priced in its growth potential. It's growing at a strong clip with the right products and services. We own Meta and Alphabet because they have a lot of advertising exposure. Meta benefits from a rising user base on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We like Alphabet based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, despite concerns about AI chatbot risks to its Google search engine.

MOSCOW, September 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's proposed initiative to cease the development of biological weapons is brilliant, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.

"The initiative itself is brilliant," Peskov said at a news briefing in response to a related question from a TASS correspondent.

The Kremlin spokesman noted that Russia was ready to take part in the process of the global rejection of biological weapons but US President Trump's initiative must be documented.

"Undoubtedly, this is a very important proposal and it can only be welcomed. Naturally, the Russian side is ready to participate in this process of the global rejection of biological weapons," he said pointing out that Moscow supports Trump's initiative.

"However, it is better to document it in some way, again, at an international level," Peskov added.</p>

“Jimmy Kimmel Live” returned to ABC's late-night television on Sept. 23, after being suspended for six days over controversial remarks that the host made on air about the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.

The late-night show was suspended after Kimmel said in his monologue that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” MAGA stands for President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” policy agenda.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed two Russian An-26 transport aircraft and two radar stations in a drone attack on occupied Crimea, the agency reported on Sept. 25. The An-26, a Soviet-era twin-engine turboprop aircraft, has been widely used for short- and medium-haul transport, capable of carrying up to 40 troops or 5.5 tons of cargo. The radar station is a coastal defense system that provides early warning and tracks surface sea targets. Occupied Crimea has remained a key target of Ukrainian strikes, with recent weeks seeing intensified operations against airfields, radar stations, and other military infrastructure on the peninsula. HUR reported on Sept. 21 destroying three Russian Mi-8 helicopters and a radar station in Crimea. Just one day later, Ukrainian forces struck two Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. Sergey Lavrov alleged that NATO and the EU had moved beyond indirect support and were now parties to the war. Olena Zelenska thanked Melania Trump "for her support of Ukraine, particularly for her attention to children who have become victims of Russia's brutal war." "This creates a critical situation that threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also European countries," Energoatom said. NATO potentially shooting down Russian planes in its airspace "would be war," Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25. A DDoS attack on the SPB payment system and the telecom provider Transtelekom on Sept. 24 allegedly disrupted instant transfers and online payments for many users. "Behind this surprising optimism lies a signal of reduced U.S. involvement and a shift of responsibility for ending the war to Europe," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Together they chaired the Task Force on Nuclear Proliferation and U.S. National Security. Washington Must Adapt Its Playbook for a New Era of Nuclear Risk Worried about the prospect that many countries around the world would soon gain nuclear weapons, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson convened a committee of seasoned foreign policy leaders to advise him on what Washington should do to prevent proliferation. The Gilpatric committee's conclusion was unanimous: averting the spread of nuclear weapons to any state, friend or foe, should be a top national security priority. The United States also developed measures to cajole and coerce other countries into remaining nonnuclear, including extending security assurances, supporting civilian scientific endeavors, and threatening to cut off military support and impose economic penalties on proliferating states. Thanks in large part to such initiatives, U.S. efforts to combat proliferation over the last 60 years have succeeded more often than they have failed. An increasingly powerful China is scaling up its nuclear arsenal. Russia has backstopped its war in Ukraine with threats of nuclear use. And evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence are making it easier than ever for states to build the bomb. Against this backdrop, the Cold War–era tools and tactics that Washington has long relied on to manage proliferation challenges are eroding. These are storm clouds that American policymakers cannot ignore. So last year, drawing inspiration from the Gilpatric committee, we convened a bipartisan task force of senior national security leaders and experts to assess how nuclear proliferation is evolving and to make recommendations on how the United States can reinvigorate its approach. Despite differing views on a variety of security issues, the group, like Gilpatric's, reached a clear consensus: nuclear proliferation by any additional country would diminish U.S. power, complicate strategic planning, and increase the likelihood of nuclear use, accidents, and disasters. Instead of relying extensively on international treaties and great-power cooperation to control the supply of nuclear technologies, Washington will need to focus more on reconfiguring security alliances and pursuing new risk-reduction measures, including with competitors, that curtail the demand for nuclear weapons. The U.S. government will have to reassure its allies that it will come to their defense and harness new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that can strengthen international monitoring capabilities and make it harder to conceal illicit activities. None of these steps will be easy, given the world's many divisions. But throughout the mid-to-late twentieth century, the two countries sustained a high degree of cooperation in establishing and enforcing a global network of treaties, institutions, technology controls, and practices to inhibit nuclear proliferation. China was historically more skeptical of nonproliferation institutions and policies. This successfully limited Iranian enrichment of uranium—until U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord three years later. But recently, both Moscow and Beijing have begun to dial down their efforts. To advance its war against Ukraine, Russia has embraced military cooperation with both Iran and North Korea. In exchange for their support, it has ignored Tehran's and Pyongyang's nuclear advances, voting in international forums to protect Iran from censure and bartering for North Korean weapons in violation of a UN arms embargo on North Korea. More concerning, Russian nuclear saber rattling has reanimated concerns in Europe and elsewhere that revisionist powers might use nuclear coercion to pursue wars of aggression. But the details of what Russia has proposed, let alone what it will do, remain unclear, and the prospects of a successor treaty to replace New START when it expires in early 2026 appear dim. It is now common to hear people in Kyiv and other European capitals say that only the bomb can guarantee a state's survival. China's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and more aggressive regional military posture add yet another layer to this challenge. Beijing and Washington share common interests in preventing other states from developing nuclear weapons, but they have far less experience cooperating on nuclear issues than Moscow and Washington do. Moreover, Beijing likely sees solidifying a geopolitical counterweight to the United States and its allies as more important than preventing Iranian proliferation or reining in North Korea's nuclear expansion. In fact, many of Washington's greatest nonproliferation success stories involved these states. The U.S. alliance system is expensive, but it has done much to help Washington. U.S. officials have long believed that it would be harder to manage crises and prevent the use of nuclear weapons if more partners acquired nuclear arsenals. Extending deterrence has also afforded Washington significant influence over security dynamics in East Asia and Europe, where the United States has used its nuclear umbrella to cultivate valuable economic, political, and military relationships. Although doubts about whether the United States would truly risk nuclear war on behalf of its allies have always existed, such concerns have deepened in light of Washington's costly trade disputes, its criticisms of allies' “free-riding,” and its discussions on reducing the U.S. military presence abroad. These allies are also unsettled by Washington's periodic overtures to long-standing adversaries, particularly Russia. As a result, in recent years, current and former leaders and prominent security analysts in a variety of U.S. partner countries—including Germany, Japan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea—have openly discussed the need for independent nuclear arsenals or alternative security arrangements that would reduce their dependence on the United States. Some American analysts and officials have argued that the prospect of nuclear weapons acquisition by select allies may not be so bad and that it would help reduce the United States' defense burden and vulnerability to a nuclear attack. But in reality, nuclear proliferation by U.S. allies could trigger destabilizing reactions from adversaries, increasing the likelihood of escalating regional conflicts. Rather than encourage allies to develop nuclear weapons of their own, Washington should work with them to develop a new extended deterrence compact by updating the basic security bargains and divisions of labor that provide for mutual defense. Such an agreement should retain the U.S. nuclear umbrella for strategic deterrence while strengthening the conventional defenses of allies so they are better equipped to handle military threats from China, North Korea, and Russia. The United States can encourage its allies to invest more in deterrence by pairing steps to reinforce U.S. commitments with reciprocal and timely contributions from partners. Many allies are already increasing defense spending and augmenting their military capabilities, but this is only a start. In terms of hardware, allies need to acquire additional military systems, including conventional strike capabilities and integrated and layered missile defenses, that complement U.S. capabilities. Nonnuclear weapons have more range and utility than they did when extended deterrence arrangements were first established during the Cold War; as a result, they can serve as the first line of defense against aggression. But these countries must also invest in newer systems, such as anti-drone weapons. Poland, for example, was able to shoot down the drones, but only by scrambling its fighter jets. Tokyo and Washington's decision last year to elevate alliance discussions on extended deterrence to the highest levels of government is a positive step in this direction. As it strengthens its alliances, the United States should also pursue pragmatic engagement with China and Russia to mitigate proliferation. But realistically, the prospects for significant progress today are slim. Attempts to engage China and Russia in recent years have borne little fruit. And even if the United States suddenly found receptive partners in Beijing and Moscow, the emergence of a tripolar nuclear order calls for a fundamentally different approach to arms control. Attempting to equalize nuclear capabilities across the three powers cannot work. The United States should nevertheless seek openings where it can. To begin, Washington should take up Putin's suggestion to maintain the existing caps on their respective nuclear arsenals, which will otherwise be lifted when the New START treaty expires. In parallel, a senior U.S. official should signal to Chinese counterparts that Washington would be willing to discuss issuing a public statement in which the United States and China recognized their mutual nuclear vulnerability—a concept that has underpinned the nuclear relationship between Washington and Moscow for decades—as the first step in a bilateral process to identify and reduce nuclear risks. Separately, China, Russia, the United States, and the world's other recognized nuclear weapons powers could jointly commit not to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against countries that do not have them. Both China and Russia can make unique contributions to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. As a close neighbor and key transit point for illicit North Korean activities, China could, for instance, step up efforts to uphold the UN arms embargo on North Korea. It could also address concerns about its own opaque and rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal. As the United States should tell China (behind closed doors), its nuclear buildup is stoking security anxieties in Asia and leading other countries in the region to contemplate developing their own nuclear weapons. Russia was particularly integral to negotiating and implementing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and it has powerful leverage as the primary supplier to Iran's civilian nuclear program. Should it choose to, it could help push Tehran into a new nuclear pact with limits and monitoring mechanisms that go beyond what was in the original. But even if Moscow won't use its power to force through a new agreement, the United States can enlist Russia's help in preventing the present situation from getting worse. Moscow could, for instance, press Tehran to fully restore its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which requires that Iran provide unimpeded access to inspectors, and avoid escalatory actions such as withdrawing from the NPT. China, Russia, and the United States have reason to cooperate on other elements of nuclear security, even if they do not directly address rising proliferation threats. Washington should therefore seek reinvigorated technical dialogues on promoting high standards for nuclear security and making sure that nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of smugglers or terrorists. Already, powerful AI models can be exploited by states to weaponize nuclear materials more quickly and cheaply or to circumvent monitoring and verification. Other developments, such as 3D printing and specialized machine tools, have likewise reduced some of the technical chokepoints to proliferation. Cheaper and more advanced sensor technologies could aid in the detection of illicit nuclear activities, making it harder for proliferators to hide. The United States thus retains an abiding interest in curtailing nuclear proliferation. American policymakers, after all, do not want to live in a world in which they must neglect key security priorities, such as homeland defense and technological competition, to focus on nuclear crises. It needs to bring Cold War–era security commitments into the twenty-first century, making them more reciprocal and responsive in ways that can mitigate allies' fears of abandonment, strengthen collective defenses, and make U.S. defense burdens more sustainable. American strategy also needs to reflect a tripolar nuclear order. Averting proliferation in this geopolitical moment may seem difficult, and it will indeed require strong, bipartisan support to update U.S. strategy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. A Divide Is Growing Between the Region's Continental and Maritime Countries Policymakers and scholars in the West talk about Southeast Asia as a coherent region, but it has always been divided. Yet despite ASEAN's achievements in fostering cooperation between its members, a cohesive Southeast Asia remains more myth than reality. According to the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Influence Index, which maps the sway of foreign partners across the region, two distinct networks persist among countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam form a continental group that leans toward China. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore make up a maritime group in which the countries are well connected to one another, work with a wider array of governments from outside the region, and hedge between the United States and China. It lacks close friends among other ASEAN countries and relies on non-Asian partners, particularly the United States, more than any of its neighbors. The gap between these two networks of Southeast Asian countries is set to grow in the decades ahead, leading to a de facto Chinese sphere of influence in continental Southeast Asia. To prevent Beijing from encroaching even further, the United States should deepen ties with the countries that straddle Southeast Asia's two subregions: Thailand and Vietnam. The anthropologist James Scott referred to this difficult landscape as “Zomia” and described how it prevented any state from fully controlling these highlands for much of the region's history. In fact, these geographic barriers kept continental Southeast Asia apart from China for millennia and provided a natural limit to the expansion of the Chinese state. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has provided financing for new infrastructure megaprojects, especially railways, across the region. Many of these projects have physically linked continental countries to China, which has changed the nature of their relationships with Beijing in a way that is not true for maritime states. In 2021, for instance, southern China was connected by rail to the Laotian capital, Vientiane. In effect, Laos lacks full sovereignty over much of its own territory. But an oil and gas pipeline has continued to operate despite fierce fighting. Already, many companies have moved their supply chains from China to Vietnam, particularly its north—a shift from the historical norm in which southern Vietnam has been a more important center for trade and commerce. The U.S. tariff on Vietnamese products, at 20 percent, is still lower than those applied to Chinese goods, so China will likely continue to invest in Vietnam. China has also funded railway projects in maritime Southeast Asia. In 2023, for example, a $7.3 billion high-speed domestic railway opened joining Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, with Bandung. Although these projects in maritime countries add to Beijing's clout as an economic partner, they have not yet meaningfully connected either Indonesia or Malaysia to China. Whereas continental Southeast Asia has, through its connection to China, been transformed over the past decade, this is not true of maritime Southeast Asia, which has always been exposed by its geography to many trading partners. This has alarmed countries around the globe, which need shipping lanes to remain free and open for trade. In 2016, a UN tribunal rejected China's claims to the area within its “nine-dash line,” which covers almost the entire South China Sea. Because maritime Southeast Asian countries are bigger and more important to worldwide commerce than continental states, they tend to receive investment and development finance from a larger pool of foreign donors. They also draw more interest when it comes to defense. Maritime countries, under more pressure from China's sweeping maritime claims and steady encroachment in their exclusive economic zones, see the need to work with the United States and other Western countries. Washington has stepped up military sales and cooperation with the Philippines, which has borne the brunt of China's aggression at sea, as an investment in maintaining respect for international law and an attempt to prevent China from bending smaller countries to its will. Southeast Asia's two sets of countries will continue to diverge. The region's maritime states will remain open to many partners. China will be their biggest source of external influence but not by a huge margin, and many other countries, including the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, will attenuate Beijing's sway. China won't wield absolute power over these countries, but it will have much more leverage than any other state outside the region. For a United States that is looking to reduce its international commitments, a decision to stop competing with China there may make sense. Yet Washington should beware the consequences of such an arrangement. And if it does not want to undermine its own position in Southeast Asia, it should shore up ties with countries on the margins of Beijing's zone of influence: Vietnam and Thailand. It has a closed political system, history of aligning with the Soviet Union, deep ties with Cambodia and Laos, and growing links to China. For example, in 2023, it upgraded its relationship with the United States to a comprehensive strategic partnership—a sign it considered the United States to be a vital partner. The Trump administration has squandered such goodwill, treating Hanoi as an adversary in one-sided tariff negotiations, a move that risks long-term damage to U.S. standing in Vietnam. The United States should also pay more attention to Thailand. The country, a Cold War ally and an advanced economy, has historically been friendly to many external partners, including Western ones. The United States must invest more in this alliance and avoid punitive actions that push Thailand into Beijing's arms officials. By shoring up its ties with Vietnam and Thailand, the United States can help ensure that maritime Southeast Asia remains open, imposing a natural limit on China's ability to dominate Asia and preserving U.S. interests in the wider Indo-Pacific region.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — With China leading the way by announcing its first emission cuts, world leaders said Wednesday they are getting more serious about fighting climate change and the deadly extreme weather that comes with it. At the United Nations' high-level climate summit, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced the world's largest carbon-polluting country would aim to cut emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035. China produces more than 31% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, and they have long been soaring. With major international climate negotiations in Brazil 6½ weeks away, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened a special leaders summit Wednesday during the General Assembly to focus on specific plans to curb emissions from coal, oil and natural gas. In a video address, Xi pledged that China would increase its wind and solar power sixfold from 2020 levels, make pollution-free vehicles mainstream and “basically establish a climate adaptive society.” Europe then followed with a less detailed and not quite official new climate change fighting plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said last week, member states agreed that their emissions cutting targets would range between 66% and 72%. While the new promises are in the right direction and show stronger commitment to fighter climate change, “these targets will not be enough to keep us safe from climate destruction,” said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director for international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Xi and Brazil's leader also made statements on Wednesday afternoon that may have referred to U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks a day earlier on renewable energy and the concept of climate change. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is hosting the upcoming climate conference, said, “no one is safe from the effect of climate change. Walls at borders will not stop droughts or storms,” Lula said. Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said she was there to issue “a demand for us all to wake up from a community whose hospitals and schools are being destroyed'' by rising tides. She said she has regularly been awakened by floods and drought emergencies in her small island nation and that it will soon be others' turn. Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said his country knows this all too well, with recent floods that have affected 5 million people across over 4,000 villages, killing over 1,000. “As I speak to you, my country is reeling from intense monsoon rains, flash floods, mudslides and devastating urban flooding,” he said. “We are facing this calamity at a time when the scars of the 2022 floods that inflicted losses exceeding $30 billion and displaced millions are still visible across our land.” “Warming appears to be accelerating,” climate scientist Johan Rockstrom said in a science briefing that started the summit. Failure to protect peoples and nations from unmanageable impacts of human-induced climate change.” “We're dangerously close to triggering fundamental and irreversible change,” Rockstrom said. Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told leaders that every tenth of a degree of warming is connected to worsening floods, wildfires, heat waves, storms and many more deaths: “What's at stake is nothing less than everything and everyone we love.” In a news conference, Lula said he invited both Trump and Xi to the November climate negotiations, saying it's important that leaders listen to scientists. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, 195 nations are supposed to submit new more stringent five-year plans on how to curb carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Technically the deadline was in February and about 50 nations have filed theirs. Former U.S. President Joe Biden submitted America's plan late last year before leaving office and the Trump administration has distanced itself from the plan. Lula also praised China's announcement, but some advocates were underwhelmed, but they said China has reputation for under-promising and over-delivering on climate action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on what he described as “radical left terrorism” after a gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others. No ICE agents were harmed in the attack. In light of today's horrific shooting that appears to be motivated by a hatred for ICE, Secretary Noem has ordered DHS to immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country.This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric… pic.twitter.com/PKZRc8F8jZ In a post on Truth Social, Trump called the attack “despicable” and directly blamed Democratic rhetoric for inciting violence against law enforcement. “The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, must be stopped,” he wrote, pledging to sign an executive order this week to “dismantle these domestic terrorism networks.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that more ICE officers would be hired and that security would be increased at ICE facilities nationwide. She described the shooter as “evil” and accused Democratic lawmakers of “demonizing” law enforcement. Vance also labeled Jahn a “violent left-wing extremist,” saying evidence not yet made public indicates that the attack was politically motivated. “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell,” he said. Jahn's brother, Noah, expressed shock at his involvement, saying he had not known him to hold strong political views or hostility toward ICE. Public records show Jahn had past drug-related convictions and was registered as an independent voter.</p>
