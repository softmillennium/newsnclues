                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz overcame both an injury scare and a rain delay on a dramatic debut at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo, where he defeated Sebastian Baez 6-4, 6-2 on Thursday evening. 1 collapsed to the floor holding his left ankle and heel, which required strapping, only to later be interrupted by a 30-minute rain delay prior to serving for the first set. “When I planted the ankle, I was worried, because it didn't feel good at the beginning. I'm just happy that I was able to play good tennis after that and finish the match quite good. After dropping serve for 2-2 in the first set, Alcaraz stretched for a forehand and stumbled backward in clear discomfort before collapsing to the court, clutching his left leg and glancing anxiously to his team. 1 received on-court attention from the physio before moving to his chair, where his left ankle and heel were taped during a medical timeout. Alcaraz tentatively returned, but eventually retrieved some of his first-class shotmaking to seal the first set, which was halted for 30 minutes at 5-4. “I couldn't do anything at all during the first five minutes [after] I did it,” said Alcaraz, who improved to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Baez. Next in his campaign is Zizou Bergs, who ousted in-form Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo 1-6, 7-6(2), 7-6(4). The top-seeded Alcaraz is this week aiming to join 12 fellow ATP No. He owns a Tour-leading 63 wins and seven titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Alcaraz's seeded semi-final opponent Casper Ruud shook off a sluggish in his opener to overcome Japanese wild card Shintaro Mochizuki 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and keep pace in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The former Nitto ATP Finals runner-up is currently 13th, but he insists that qualification for the season finale is yet to cross his mind. Typically when we come back to Europe, there's only three or four more tournaments, so that's when you think about it,” said Ruud, who next plays Matteo Berrettini. “My goal is to have a good end of the season, and I haven't really had that in the past except for Turin, [where] I've had some good results. “Let's see… It was a little tough to play today, coming a long way from San Francisco, but I'm very happy I was able to overcome it.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah. Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah. China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

🥳🔥#LaverCup pic.twitter.com/AtQxBtVg85 Fritz had won both of his previous career meetings against Diallo, at Wimbledon and Canada earlier this year, and he made it 3-0 in Tokyo—though things could easily have gone the other way this time.Not only did Fritz have to battle back from a set down, but after evening things up at a set apiece, he had to serve to stay in the match twice in the third set, at 4-5 and 5-6—he was actually just a few points away from losing the match serving at 4-5, 40-30 in the decider.But the American held both times and once he got it to a tie-break he soared, opening up an early 3-0 lead, then holding all of his service points from there until grabbing one last mini-break to close the match out after just over two hours on court. "It's definitely a tough turnaround," Fritz said. I'm obviously a little jet lagged as well, so that comes into it.
