                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People who suspect that their sense of smell has been dulled after a bout of COVID-19 are likely correct, a new study using an objective, 40-odor test shows. Even those who do not notice any olfactory issues may be impaired. The results revealed that 80% of participants who reported a change in their smelling ability after having COVID-19 earned low scores on a clinical scent-detection test taken about two years later. Notably, 66% of infected participants who did not notice any smelling issues scored abnormally low on the evaluation as well, the authors say. Our findings confirm that those with a history of COVID-19 may be especially at risk for a weakened sense of smell, an issue that is already underrecognized among the general population." Horwitz, a professor in the Departments of Population Health and Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, adds that 60% of uninfected participants who did not report olfactory problems also tested poorly during the clinical evaluation. Hyposmia has long been connected to weight loss, reduced quality of life, and depression, among other concerns. Those with a diminished sense of smell may also struggle to detect dangers such as spoiled food, gas leaks, and smoke, experts say. In addition, scientists have flagged smelling dysfunction as an early sign of certain neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, which can affect the brain's scent-processing region. Along with Horwitz, Jacqueline Becker, PhD at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York is co-lead author. Hassan Ashktorab, PhD, at Howard University in Washington, D.C.; Andrea Foulkes, ScD, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston; and Joyce Lee-Iannotti, MD, at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, are study co-senior authors. Throughout the study, those with and without a history of COVID-19 completed surveys about their symptoms every 90 days from October 2021 through June 2025. In this scratch-and-sniff evaluation, which is considered the gold standard of its kind, participants were asked to identify 40 scents by selecting the right multiple-choice option for each odor. "These results suggest that health care providers should consider testing for loss of smell as a routine part of post-COVID care," said Horwitz. "While patients may not notice right away, a dulled nose can have a profound impact on their mental and physical well-being." Having a deeper understanding of how the coronavirus affects the brain's sensory and cognitive systems may help refine these therapies, notes Horwitz. Horwitz cautions that the study team did not directly assess loss of taste, which often accompanies problems with smell. In addition, it is possible that some uninfected participants were misclassified due to the lack of universal testing for the virus. This may help explain the surprisingly high rate of hyposmia identified in those without a supposed history of COVID-19, she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every new life begins after a genetic shuffle. When organisms make eggs or sperm, maternal and paternal chromosomes pair up and swap pieces of DNA in a process called crossing over. This exchange is essential: without at least one swap per chromosome pair, fertility and healthy chromosome numbers are at risk. How do cells make sure the balance is just right? The team discovered that tiny DNA structures called Holliday junctions are not just stepping-stones on the way to crossovers, as scientists long believed. Instead, they also help stabilize a zipper-like structure known as the synaptonemal complex, which holds paired chromosomes together. Our hypothesis was that Holliday junctions are more than passive DNA links. They are essential for building and maintaining the synaptonemal complex, ensuring that chromosomes stay paired until crossovers are ready to form." To test this idea, first author Adrian Henggeler turned to baker's yeast, a simple organism that scientists often use as a stand-in for human cells because it goes through meiosis in a similar way. By then cutting the DNA junctions using a unique molecular tool developed in the lab, he could see right away what happened next. "It was exactly what we had hypothesized, suddenly unfolding in front of our eyes." Without Holliday junctions, the chromosome zipper fell apart, new DNA breaks re-started forming, and meiosis could no longer proceed correctly. "This study uncovers a simple but elegant feedback loop," says Joao. "Once crossovers and the chromosome zipper are stabilized, the cell 'knows' it can stop making breaks and move forward safely with meiosis." If it does, it could shed light on fundamental mechanisms that safeguard fertility and maintain genome stability across species. Protecting double Holliday junctions ensures crossing over during meiosis. Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking a page from the private insurance industry's playbook, the Trump administration will launch a program next year to find out how much money an artificial intelligence algorithm could save the federal government by denying care to Medicare patients. The pilot program, designed to weed out wasteful, "low-value" services, amounts to a federal expansion of an unpopular process called prior authorization, which requires patients or someone on their medical team to seek insurance approval before proceeding with certain procedures, tests, and prescriptions. The move has raised eyebrows among politicians and policy experts. Still, it is widely used by private insurers, especially in the Medicare Advantage market. And the timing was surprising: The pilot was announced in late June, just days after the Trump administration unveiled a voluntary effort by private health insurers to revamp and reduce their own use of prior authorization, which causes care to be "significantly delayed," said Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. "It's something that we can't tolerate in this administration." But some critics, like Vinay Rathi, an Ohio State University doctor and policy researcher, have accused the Trump administration of sending mixed messages. On one hand, the federal government wants to borrow cost-cutting measures used by private insurance, he said. Patients, doctors, and other lawmakers have also been critical of what they see as delay-or-deny tactics, which can slow down or block access to care, causing irreparable harm and even death. “Insurance companies have put it in their mantra that they will take patients' money and then do their damnedest to deny giving it to the people who deliver care," said Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and a urologist. Public displeasure with insurance denials dominated the news in December, when the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare's CEO led many to anoint his alleged killer as a folk hero. And the public broadly dislikes the practice: Nearly three-quarters of respondents thought prior authorization was a "major" problem in a July poll published by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said both initiatives "serve the same goal of protecting patients and Medicare dollars." The pilot program, WISeR — short for “Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction” — will test the use of an AI algorithm in making prior authorization decisions for some Medicare services, including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy. The federal government says such procedures are particularly vulnerable to "fraud, waste, and abuse" and could be held in check by prior authorization. Medicare has historically used prior authorization in a limited way, with contractors who aren't incentivized to deny services. Pons told KFF Health News that no Medicare request will be denied before being reviewed by a "qualified human clinician," and that vendors "are prohibited from compensation arrangements tied to denial rates." While the government says vendors will be rewarded for savings, Pons said multiple safeguards will “remove any incentive to deny medically appropriate care.” "Shared savings arrangements mean that vendors financially benefit when less care is delivered," a structure that can create a powerful incentive for companies to deny medically necessary care, said Jennifer Brackeen, senior director of government affairs for the Washington State Hospital Association. The model, he said, ultimately depends on contractors to assess their own results, a choice that makes the results potentially suspect. Pons said the use of AI in the Medicare pilot will be "subject to strict oversight to ensure transparency, accountability, and alignment with Medicare rules and patient protection." "CMS remains committed to ensuring that automated tools support, not replace, clinically sound decision-making," he said. Experts agree that AI is theoretically capable of expediting what has been a cumbersome process marked by delays and denials that can harm patients' health. These companies have also insisted that humans, not computers, are ultimately reviewing coverage decisions. "I think that there's also probably a little bit of ambiguity over what constitutes 'meaningful human review,'” said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. A 2023 report published by ProPublica found that, over a two-month period, doctors at Cigna who reviewed requests for payment spent an average of only 1.2 seconds on each case. Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions told KFF Health News that the company does not use AI to deny care or claims. The ProPublica investigation referenced a "simple software-driven process that helped accelerate payments to clinicians for common, relatively low-cost tests and treatments, and it is not powered by AI," Sessions said. And yet class-action lawsuits filed against major health insurers have alleged that flawed AI models undermine doctor recommendations and fail to take patients' unique needs into account, forcing some people to shoulder the financial burden of their care. Meanwhile, a survey of physicians published by the American Medical Association in February found that 61% think AI is "increasing prior authorization denials, exacerbating avoidable patient harms and escalating unnecessary waste now and into the future." Those include reducing the scope of prior authorization and making sure that communications with patients about denials and appeals are easy to understand. The Medicare pilot program underscores ongoing concerns about prior authorization and raises new ones. While private health insurers have been opaque about how they use AI and the extent to which they use prior authorization, policy researchers believe these algorithms are often programmed to automatically deny high-cost care. “The more expensive it is, the more likely it is to be denied," said Jennifer Oliva, a professor at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University-Bloomington, whose work focuses on AI regulation and health coverage. As the use of AI by health insurers is poised to grow, insurance company algorithms amount to a "regulatory blind spot" and demand more scrutiny, said Carmel Shachar, a faculty director at Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation. The WISeR pilot is "an interesting step" toward using AI to ensure that Medicare dollars are purchasing high-quality health care, she said. Politicians are grappling with some of the same questions. "How is this being tested in the first place? How are you going to make sure that it is working and not denying care or producing higher rates of care denial?" asked DelBene, who signed an August letter to Oz with other Democrats demanding answers about the AI program. Meanwhile, House members of both parties recently supported a measure proposed by Rep. Lois Frankel, a Florida Democrat, to block funding for the pilot in the fiscal 2026 budget of the Department of Health and Human Services. AI in health care is here to stay, Murphy said, but it remains to be seen whether the WISeR pilot will save Medicare money or contribute to the problems already posed by prior authorization. "This is a pilot, and I'm open to see what's going to happen with this," Murphy said, "but I will always, always err on the side that doctors know what's best for their patients."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists reveal that shifting mealtimes, without any workouts, can help reshape the body as early eaters lost more weight, but late eaters boost their anerobic power. Study: Time-Restricted Eating Without Exercise Enhances Anaerobic Power and Reduces Body Weight: A Randomized Crossover Trial in Untrained Adults. A recent study in Nutrients examined the impact of TRE on endurance parameters and body weight in healthy adults without any specific exercise intervention. This is the first time a human study has directly compared delayed and early TRE in an untrained healthy group without formal exercise interventions. Animal experiments suggest that TRE improves certain aspects of physical performance even without exercise, but human evidence remains limited and mixed. Anerobic power is also linked to higher odds of physical function and independence with aging. Besides exercise strategies like aerobic or resistance exercise, or high-intensity interval training, dietary approaches like TRE also play a key role in building physical capacity. Research from both preclinical and clinical studies points to three main underlying mechanisms. First, TRE induces regular, prolonged fasting periods, causing a metabolic shift. This forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to fatty acids and ketones, promoting metabolic flexibility. Mitochondria supply more energy by breaking down fats into fatty acids and ketones. Insulin stimulates glucose removal from the blood, mainly into muscle and liver cells. Better circadian synchronization also reduces inflammation, improves skeletal muscle efficiency, and promotes cardiometabolic health, especially by avoiding late-night eating. Autophagy is the third pathway activated by TRE. This leads to removing damaged organelles, including mitochondria, and replacing them with new ones. The outcome is improved mitochondrial quality and greater antioxidant capacity. However, the authors caution that much of this mechanistic evidence comes from animal studies, with only indirect support in humans. TRE in overweight or obese people results in decreased body weight, improved blood cholesterol levels, and higher insulin sensitivity. However, the benefits of TRE in highly trained individuals could be modest, as they already have high metabolic fitness. It might be more helpful for untrained individuals without added exercise because they have low fitness levels. The current study used two TRE timings to understand how this affects metabolic outcomes. The study included 28 healthy university students, on average, aged 23.4 years. The participants were randomized to early vs. delayed TRE (eTRE and dTRE, respectively) for four weeks, after which there was a two-week interval. The groups were then switched for another four weeks. No formal exercise routine was allowed during the study period. After each TRE phase, the body weight, aerobic endurance, and anerobic power were assessed. Aerobic endurance refers to how long the body can sustain oxygen-fueled physical activity, typically tested by a constant-load cycling test. Anerobic peak power is the maximum force produced without oxygen in a burst of high-intensity effort, sustained for only a few seconds. It is typically tested by sprint cycling, which also allows peak power output to be measured. Body weight decreased after both TRE phases, but by 0.95 kg more with eTRE than dTRE. This corroborates prior research showing that early eating windows are more effective than later ones. This may be due to TRE-associated decreased calorie intake due to an absence of dinner, typically a more calorie-packed meal than breakfast. Additionally, an earlier eating window is better synchronized with the circadian rhythms of digestion and insulin sensitivity. This could reduce fat mass and lower glucose levels. However, the current study did not directly measure changes in body composition, so whether fat or lean mass contributed to the weight loss is unknown. Aerobic endurance remained unchanged with either form of TRE, despite decreased calorie intake, and without the benefit of prior exercise training. This may reflect a more efficient utilization of energy substrates under restricted eating conditions, but with constant physical demands. This metabolic flexibility favors aerobic fitness, irrespective of the eating window. Power output also increased more after dTRE than eTRE. Such gains were not previously visible in trained athletes, perhaps because they are already at the top of their form physiologically. Conversely, other research demonstrates TRE-associated metabolic adaptations that help the body regain energy after short bursts of explosive activity by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency. The study findings demonstrate that eTRE and dTRE are associated with weight loss and increased anerobic power, while aerobic endurance was preserved rather than improved. Future studies should examine whether these translate into clinical gains that are sustained over the long term and are suitable for all kinds of groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study involving the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) provides strong evidence that sugary drinks affect not only metabolic but also mental health – especially in women. As is well known, people who regularly consume sugary drinks not only have an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an increasing number of studies that are now showing that soft drinks can also affect mental health. So far, however, it was unclear whether there is a direct relation to major depressive disorder (MDD) and which biological processes might be involved. To answer these questions, researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort (MACS). The researchers included a total of 932 people, 405 of whom were patients with major depression disorder and 527 were healthy controls. This correlation was particularly pronounced in women: Among them, high consumption was associated with a 17% higher probability of depression (odds ratio 1.167) and more severe symptoms. Earlier studies had shown that Eggerthella is more common in people with depression. Sugary drinks such as cola or lemonade not only contain glucose and fructose, but also numerous additives – including preservatives and artificial sweeteners. Inflammation-promoting bacteria are favored, while the production of protective short-chain fatty acids decreases. Animal studies show that such changes can trigger inflammatory processes in the nervous system and thus increase depressive behavior. It is striking that this correlation appears to be sex-related. In men who regularly consumed soft drinks, the researchers found neither an increase in Eggerthella nor a correlation with depressive symptoms. It is still unclear why this effect only occurs in women. Hormonal differences or sex-related reactions of the immune system possibly play a role. "Microbiome-based approaches – such as targeted nutritional therapies or probiotic strategies – might help to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in the future." The researchers therefore argue that the influence of nutrition on mental health should be more strongly integrated into educational campaigns, care concepts and prevention programs. Changes in the microbiome can be influenced by diet – and are therefore a potential therapeutic target."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on September 15, 2025, titled "When strokes reveal a hidden malignancy: An atypical case of metastatic colorectal cancer with extensive thromboembolism." In this case report, Md Tanzim Ahsan from Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh (WWL) Teaching Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust and Sultana Azreen from Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, describe how a series of unexplained strokes led to the diagnosis of advanced colorectal cancer. The report shows that hidden cancers can sometimes first present through blood clots and strokes, well before any typical cancer symptoms appear. "Although symptoms raised initial suspicion for vasculitis or autoimmune etiologies due to limb swelling and headache, he did not report associated visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, or neurological deficits." The patient, a 71-year-old man, was admitted to the hospital with swelling in his left arm, headache, and non-specific neurological symptoms. Over the following weeks, he suffered multiple strokes affecting different areas of the brain, as well as blood clots in his veins, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. However, imaging and blood exams revealed signs of cancer. A biopsy of an enlarged lymph node confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer that had silently spread throughout the body. The patient had no typical symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as weight loss, digestive issues, or changes in appetite. Because of this, the cancer remained undetected until widespread blood clot complications appeared. This case illustrates a serious but often underrecognized condition known as Trousseau's syndrome, or cancer-associated stroke. It occurs when cancer causes abnormal blood clotting, leading to clots throughout the body. Clinicians are encouraged to maintain a high level of suspicion when evaluating patients with unexplained strokes, especially when imaging reveals multiple infarcts or embolic patterns without an identifiable source. The authors call for the development of clearer clinical guidelines to help healthcare providers recognize and screen for underlying cancers in stroke patients without obvious risk factors. As cancer rates continue to rise worldwide, early recognition of indirect warning signs, such as abnormal clotting, may allow earlier detection and improve patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study links exposure to radiation from medical imaging to a small-but-significant risk of blood cancers among children and adolescents. Funded by the National Cancer Institute, the study will help medical personnel make informed decisions about using imaging on children. The paper, "Medical Imaging and Pediatric and Adolescent Hematologic Cancer Risk," was published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. For his part of the study, Bolch used virtual patient anatomic models to reconstruct bone marrow doses in more than 3.7 million children who underwent CT imaging between 1996 to 2016. "We used a library of 3D anatomic whole-body computerized patient models developed in the early 2010s under a contract with the National Cancer Institute," said Wesley Bolch, Ph.D., a distinguished professor in biomedical and radiological engineering with the University of Florida's J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering. "We call this an organ dose reconstruction," said Bolch, who is also a member of the UF Health Cancer Center. The study is unique because it directly measures leukemia risks in these pediatric patients. Previously, researchers used established cancer-risk models, many of which were based on data from the atomic bomb survivors in 1945 Japan. Needless to say, Bolch noted, diagnostic X-ray exposures are vastly different from atomic weapon radiation fields. This is the very first study of its kind in the U.S. and Canada, and the very first study of cancer risks in children undergoing medical imaging where each patient was considered in a unique manner regarding their sex, body size and medical imaging exposure technique factors." Wesley Bolch, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor, Biomedical and Radiological Engineering, University of Florida While CT imaging contributes a greater fraction of total radiation, doses from nuclear medicine, radiography and fluoroscopy were also included for bone marrow-dose calculations. It demonstrates UF's dedication to research that safeguards patients and informs global healthcare practices," said BME chair Cherie Stabler, Ph.D. The incidence of hematologic cancers by age 21 years was 0.3% among those children exposed to bone marrow doses more than 30 milligray. However, fewer than 1% of the 3.7 million children in this study had cumulative doses exceeding 30 milligray. Plus, CT imaging doses today are much lower, and imaging systems are much faster than in the late-1990s and early-2000s. This research comes 25 years after a Columbia University research paper made the link between leukemia and some radiology scans, thus scaring "every mother in this country," Bolch said. In this case, the girl received a much larger amount of imaging than was really needed to form a diagnostic-quality image," Bolch said. "This paper scared a lot of people, but it really was a great service because it says, 'Oh, we're doing this wrong.'" The paper's lead authors are radiologist and epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman, M.D., from the University of California, San Francisco, and biostatistician Diana Miglioretti, Ph.D., from UC, Davis. "Their work involved collecting and organizing the medical records that showed what imaging exams were performed on the children, when they occurred, how they were acquired and what modality was used – CT, radiography, nuclear medicine or fluoroscopy," Bolch said. They also led the team that linked these patients to cancer registries that indicated which patients later developed bone marrow cancers. "This is where my laboratory came in," Bolch said. "We ran computer simulations of these imaging procedures to provide estimates of bone marrow radiation doses for each child, for each form of medical imaging and for each imaging examination. "Everybody went into action to figure out what is the appropriate lowest dose of radiation that would give us a good image. These risks are low, and when justified by the imaging physician, patient benefits, such as disease detection, will greatly outweigh these very small risks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A population-based study in Northern Sweden challenges assumptions about pollution and cellular aging, uncovering an unexpected signal of longer telomeres in patients with dementia that warrants further research. Study: Associations between air pollution and relative leukocyte telomere length among northern Swedish adults based on findings from the Betula study. Associations between air pollution and subsequent risk of dementia are growing clinical concerns, but remain understudied. The biological underpinnings of these associations are especially unclear. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers explored one hypothesized pathway involving telomeres (that shorten with age) by analyzing data from 473 older adults from Northern Sweden who had complete information on air pollution exposure, telomere length, and covariates. Study findings did not reveal an overall association between exposure to air pollution and telomere length. However, study analyses highlight a slight, statistically nonsignificant trend suggesting that individuals who later developed dementia had longer telomeres, despite higher exposure to pollution, a counterintuitive finding that warrants further investigation. Telomeres are segments of DNA at the ends of our chromosomes that protect the underlying genetic material from degradation, external damage, and fusion. Recent research suggests that environmental factors (particularly pollutants) can accelerate this shortening process. Simultaneously, decades of research have now conclusively linked telomere length (shorter is worse) to a variety of age-related chronic diseases, including dementia. Dementia is an umbrella term for several neurological conditions characterized by significant cognitive decline and memory loss, substantially hampering patients' daily lives. Unfortunately, mechanistic evidence for the association between air pollution and dementia remains limited, as previous studies have failed to explicitly test the relationship between these variables. The present study leveraged data from the Betula project, a long-running, population-based cohort focused on aging and dementia in Northern Sweden. Researchers collated two different time waves (T1 and T2 out of the seven total waves of the Betula study) collected in five-year intervals between 1988 and 1995. Notably, air-quality data for the locations of study participants were also available. Blood samples were used for relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) measurements via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Air pollution exposure was assessed using a high-resolution dispersion model to estimate the annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) and black carbon (BC) at each participant's home address in 1990, including source-specific estimates for vehicle exhaust and residential wood burning. Analysis further included linear regression models to investigate the association between these pollution levels and telomere length, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, lymphocyte proportion, and education. Linear regression analyses failed to demonstrate any significant associations between air pollution exposure (either PM₂.₅ or BC) and shorter telomeres. For total PM₂.₅ exposure, the beta coefficient (β, measure of relative leukocyte telomere length) was recorded at 0.01 (95% CI: -0.011, 0.024), indicating a negligible effect. However, subgroup analyses revealed a more complex, unexpected, and currently unexplained trend: a slight positive association between pollution exposure and telomere length. While not statistically significant, these findings mean that among future dementia patients, those exposed to higher levels of air pollution tended to have longer, not shorter, telomeres. This study, conducted in a low-pollution region of Northern Sweden, failed to validate the prevailing hypothesis that links air pollution to shorter telomere length (accelerated cellular aging) and, in turn, higher dementia risk. Instead, an unexpected and counterintuitive trend was observed in the dementia subgroup: higher air pollution exposure was linked to longer telomeres in participants who later developed dementia. These exploratory signals were imprecise and not statistically significant, necessitating further research to explain this observation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study from the Medical University of South Carolina, published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, reveals that shorter storage durations of donor human milk are linked to reduced gastrointestinal complicatoins in premature infants, including necrotizing enterocolitis. These findings suggestt that minimizing milk storage time may help to preserve protective properties crucial for preterm gut health, offering new insights into neonatal nutrition practices and improving outcomes for vulnerable newborns. An MUSC study published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition has found that those little best by dates for a particularly precious resource – donor human milk – have huge implications for the gastrointestinal health of very premature infants. "Our results showed that babies weren't as protected with the use of donor milk that was stored for a longer time as with donor milk that was stored for shorter periods of time," said physician-scientist Katherine E. Chetta, M.D., who led the study. Chetta's research program is focused on the science of breast milk, nutrition and intestinal rehabilitation. Donor human milk is a vital substance, given to almost all preterm babies, especially if their own mother's milk is unavailable, in short supply or otherwise unsafe. It can also reduce complications associated with formula, while supporting immune function, digestion and infants with specific medical conditions, such as low blood sugar, congenital heart disease and immunologic deficiencies. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of using donor milk is to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, as it's often referred to in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), where most pre-term babies are cared for. NEC is a very serious inflammatory disease that affects mostly preemies and can lead to bowel tissue dying. Although doctors and scientists have not yet identified the sole cause of NEC, they do have some ideas about several factors that, together, can cause injury to the premature gut, allowing bacteria in and creating inflammation. As a neonatologist at the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital, Chetta has long dealt with the devastating effects of NEC in her patients. "It's one of those key benchmark diseases that all NICUs are constantly trying to decrease," she said. As a physician-scientist, Chetta collaborates closely with the nutrition management center or "milk room," where the donor milk is stored. Of those premature babies, 226 remained free of disease while 36 developed NEC or another gut disease called spontaneous perforation, which also causes tremendous damage to intestinal tissue. The South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute, a Clinical and Translational Science Awards hub with an academic home at MUSC, provided statistical support for the . Laboratory results showed that, over time, certain milk components degrade even while in frozen storage. When preemies are on the edge of viability, and extremely low birth weight, that's when they seem to be the most susceptible to the effects of storage and can be most protected by having fresher milk. In short, for preemies: "Fresh milk is the best." Based on this study, Chetta and her team believe that these guidelines need to be reevaluated, especially regarding critically ill babies. Still, this laboratory finding has already influenced clinical practice in Chetta's NICU. "We're so convinced that we need a little bit fresher that we're already doing it just to be on the safer side," said Chetta, of feeding high-risk, premature infants the freshest milk possible based on the study results. The practical application of this finding doesn't mean discarding or wasting milk that is considered not quite as fresh but, rather, using fresh milk more quickly and optimizing freezing and storage procedures so that the sickest and youngest babies can have the freshest milk. To achieve these goals, Chetta worked closely with the Mother's Milk Bank of South Carolina and others involved in the handling of human milk. Based on her experience, she can offer some simple, easy-to-follow advice: "Other NICUs could talk to their own milk banks about bringing this milk in a little bit quicker from donor depot sites, as we did." We were just refocused on trying to get it under that threshold of 240 days." While this is still very new information, Chetta and her team have high hopes for its impact in the not-so-distant future. "I think improving outcomes can be expanded very rapidly once people start verifying some of the findings we have," she said.
