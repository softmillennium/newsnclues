            Amazon is paying a historic $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency announced Thursday, ending a 2-year dispute over allegations the company tricked consumers into signing up for its Prime subscription service and then made it hard to cancel.
    


            As part of the agreement, Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million customers that were ‚Äúharmed by their deceptive Prime enrollment practices,‚Äù the agency said in a press release.
    


            The agency said that this is the largest civil penalty in a case involving an FTC rule violation. It's also the second-highest restitution award obtained by the FTC.
    


            The settlement comes just a few days into a trial between the FTC and Amazon. The lawsuit was filed in 2023 under the Biden administration over the company's cancellation policies.
    


            ‚ÄúToday, the Trump-Vance FTC made history and secured a record-breaking, monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel,‚Äù said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson.
    


            ‚ÄúThe evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,‚Äù he added.
    


            ‚ÄúAmazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,‚Äù said Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin in a statement. ‚ÄúWe work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.‚Äù
    


            The company and executives also did not admit to any wrongdoing.
    


            Amazon can also no longer have a ‚ÄúNo, I don't want Free Shipping‚Äù button, the FTC said. The company needs to include ‚Äúclear and conspicuous disclosures‚Äù about the terms of Prime during enrollment process and have ‚Äúeasy ways‚Äù to cancel the program.
    


            Prime, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 annually, is a hallmark of the company's offerings and generates billions of dollars. The service initially started as an add-on for fast delivery. Since then, Prime has ballooned into a multi-pronged service that offers streaming entertainment, grocery delivery, fuel and food delivery perks, as well as subscriber-only deals.
    


            The $2.5 billion payout represents 5.6% of Prime's subscription revenue last year, which raked in $44 billion, according to Emarketer analyst Zak Stambor. He added that the settlement might ‚Äústreamline Prime's cancellation process, but it won't dent the program's dominance.‚Äù
    


            Amazon doesn't disclose how many US subscribers it has, but a third-party analysis from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that it has 197 million customers as of March 2025.

 Denmark briefly shut down air traffic at Aalborg Airport on Wednesday after unidentified ‚Äúdrones‚Äù were spotted hovering near the runway ‚Äì the latest in a string of unexplained sightings that also included a facility that hosts the Danish fleet of F-16 and F-35 fighter jets.

Northern Jutland police said ‚Äúmore than one drone‚Äù was seen circling Aalborg with their lights on around 9:44pm local time on Wednesday. Authorities later reported that drones were also observed near airports in Esbjerg, Sonderborg, and Skrydstrup, home to Denmark's fleet of F-16 and newly arrived F-35 jets.

Despite hours of monitoring ‚Äì and assistance from the Danish armed forces ‚Äì the alleged unmanned aircraft remained unidentified. Officials could not say what type of drones they were, who launched them, or why.

‚ÄúIt is too early to say what the goal of the drones is and who is the actor behind,‚Äù a police official told reporters, adding that they would try to bring them down ‚Äúif possible.‚Äù Eventually, the drones vanished without being intercepted.

The incident comes just days after Copenhagen Airport, the busiest in the Nordic region, was forced to halt flights for four hours due to similar sightings. Officials described that disruption as the most serious ‚Äúattack‚Äù yet on Danish infrastructure, though investigators also failed to locate or identify the culprit.

Oslo Airport in Norway was also briefly closed on the same night after a suspected drone sighting, prompting speculation that the unexplained activity could be part of a wider campaign of unrelated incidents routinely blamed on Moscow. Russia's ambassador in Copenhagen dismissed the claims as ‚Äúungrounded.‚Äù

The Danish incidents also follow major outages last weekend that affected electronic check-in and boarding systems at London's Heathrow, as well as airports in Berlin and Brussels. British authorities detained a suspect over what was described as a ransomware attack, but later released him on conditional bail.

Last year, a wave of mysterious drone sightings spread across the US, where clusters of suspected UAVs were repeatedly reported in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and eventually across much of the Northeast. Despite a joint federal‚Äìstate task force and speculation about everything from cartels to foreign surveillance, no hostile operator was ever identified. Investigations later concluded that most sightings involved authorized drones, misidentified manned aircraft, or other routine aerial and celestial objects ‚Äì amplified by confirmation bias and mass hysteria.

At least ten powerful earthquakes struck northwest Venezuela on Wednesday and early Thursday, sending tremors across the South American country as far as the capital Caracas.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Venezuelan Foundation for Seismological Research (Funvisis) said several tremors exceeded magnitude 5.8, including two that came in over 6.

The epicenter was near Mene Grande in the oil-rich state of Zulia, about 600km (370 miles) west of Caracas. The strongest, at magnitude 6.3, struck at 5:21 pm local time.

At least 21 aftershocks have been recorded in the past seven hours. Local seismologists are monitoring ongoing activity in the region.

No casualties have been reported, but videos and photos shared online showed cracked walls in high-rises and damaged roads.

The tremors were felt most strongly in the country's western states, in particular the city of Maracaibo, where residents evacuated buildings as cracks appeared.

Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said Civil Protection and military forces had deployed nationwide to assist with evacuations and damage.

‚ÄùNo human losses have been recorded, and President Nicolas Maduro has deployed a risk system throughout the country from the Command Post,‚Äù she said late on Wednesday.

Venezuela sits on several fault lines between the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates. About 80% of its population lives in seismic zones. The country has been hit by five major earthquakes in the past century, including a magnitude 7.2 off the northern coast in 2018. The last deadly quake in Venezuela occurred in the town of Cariaco in 1997, killing 73 people.

Poland was ready to grant asylum to a suspect in the Nord Stream bombing, the newspaper Rzeczpospolita has reported, citing sources. 

The two Nord Stream pipelines, built to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea, were damaged in a sabotage attack in September 2022. German prosecutors attributed the explosions to a small group of Ukrainian nationals. 

Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski repeatedly said in conversations that he was prepared to grant asylum in Poland to one suspect, identified as Vladimir Z., and even honor him with a state decoration, the paper wrote on Thursday. 

Vladimir Z., described as a diving instructor, had reportedly been living near Warsaw. After German prosecutors issued a European arrest warrant for him, the Polish authorities did not detain him, and he later fled to Ukraine.

German officials questioned why Poland failed to act and the escape strained relations between the two countries. The Polish authorities argued that nothing has been proven against Vladimir Z., reportedly telling their counterparts, ‚ÄúWhy should we detain him? For us, he's a hero.‚Äù 

Warsaw has been one of Kiev's staunchest backers since 2022, supplying weapons and pressing the EU and NATO to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow. Polish officials, including Sikorski, were also opposed to Nord Stream in the first place, which bypassed Poland as a transit country and deprived it of gas revenues. 

The German investigation has already led to the arrest of another suspect, former military officer Sergey Kuznetsov, detained in Italy in August. Prosecutors allege he coordinated a team that rented a yacht and planted explosives on the pipelines using commercial diving gear. 

Moscow has rejected Berlin's version, dismissing the claim that a small group of Ukrainians carried out the sabotage as ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù After Kuznetsov's arrest, Russia called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, accusing German officials of a lack of transparency and frequent leaks to the press.

Deputy Ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyansky said the German authorities were trying to cover up the true circumstances by blaming a private ‚Äúscapegoat.‚Äù President Vladimir Putin suggested the US likely orchestrated the sabotage, while Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service claimed it had ‚Äúcredible information‚Äù that US and British agents were involved.

MOSCOW, September 25. /TASS/. European countries are preparing to secretly deploy aircraft and air defense systems on the border with Russia, with movements of aircraft from the UK and France already recorded, under the cover of reports of alleged airspace violations by Russia, Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Russian State Duma's Defense Committee, told TASS.

Earlier, several NATO countries claimed that Russia had violated their airspace and reported incidents involving drones. Moscow dismissed these accusations as baseless and did not rule out the possibility that they were provocations.

""They (the Europeans - TASS) don't have the courage to do anything more serious,"" the lawmaker said, commenting on the situation with the drones. ""But we must understand that perhaps under the cover of this chatter, there is a secret deployment and preparation for redeploying aircraft and air defense systems to the border with Russia or Ukraine. We are closely monitoring the situation and have already recorded the movement of a number of aircraft from France and the UK,"" he emphasized.

Kartapolov noted that anything can be expected from modern Europe, ""because it is run by completely irresponsible politicians who don't care about their own citizens."" According to the lawmaker, the only exceptions are Hungary, Slovakia, and Serbia. ""All the rest are EU puppets. Whatever they are told to do in Brussels or London, that's what they will do,"" he added.

The head of the Duma committee noted that it is now ""absolutely pointless and useless"" to talk to European leaders and try to explain anything to them. ""Their intelligence level is extremely low, and unfortunately, their level of unscrupulousness is unimaginably high,"" Kartapolov concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The Kremlin spokesman noted that Russia was ready to take part in the process of the global rejection of biological weapons but US President Trump's initiative must be documented.

TEL AVIV, September 25. /TASS/. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he will not allow the formation of the State of Palestine. He made the remarks before departing for the United States, where he is set to address the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York and meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington.

""I am heading to the UN General Assembly and to Washington. At the UN, I will tell our truth - the truth of Israeli citizens, the truth of Israeli soldiers, the truth of our state. I will call out leaders who, instead of condemning murderers, rapists, and those who burn children, want to establish a state for them in the heart of Israel. This will not happen,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement released by his office at the airport.

""In Washington, I will meet President Trump for the fourth time and discuss with him the enormous opportunities that have emerged thanks to our victories, as well as the need to achieve the goals of the war by bringing back all our hostages [from Gaza] and defeating Hamas,"" the Israeli prime minister added.

Earlier, at a conference at the UN headquarters in New York, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, San Marino, and France announced their recognition of the State of Palestine. Additionally, on September 21, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Portugal also recognized Palestine. According to their statements, upholding the two-state solution is key to peace and security for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.

Israel launched a military operation against Iran overnight on June 13, stating its goal was to destroy Tehran's nuclear and missile programs. Overnight on June 22, Trump announced that the US had successfully struck three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. He said Tehran should agree to end the conflict. Netanyahu, in turn, stated that the US strikes were carried out in close coordination with Israel, called the decision historic, and thanked Trump for the move.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Democrats accuse Trump of intimidation tactics after memo outlines much more aggressive step than previous shutdowns

The White House is telling federal agencies to prepare large-scale firings of workers if the government shuts down next week in a partisan fight over spending plans ‚Äì prompting the Democrats to accuse Donald Trump of intimidation tactics.

In a memo released on Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is ‚Äúnot consistent with the president's priorities‚Äù.

That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan.

A mass firing would eliminate employees positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year, leading with the dramatic intervention by Elon Musk's ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge) early in the second Trump administration.

Once any potential government shutdown ends, agencies are asked to revise their reduction in force plans ‚Äúas needed to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions‚Äù, according to the memo, which was first reported by Politico.

This move from OMB significantly increases the consequences of a potential government shutdown next week and escalates pressure on the US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats.

The two leaders have kept nearly all of their Democratic lawmakers united against a clean funding bill pushed by the US president and congressional Republicans that would keep the federal government operating for seven more weeks, demanding immediate improvements to health care in exchange for their votes to approve the short term plan, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

‚ÄúWe will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,‚Äù Jeffries wrote in a post on X shortly after the OMB memo was released. ‚ÄúGet lost.‚Äù

Jeffries called Russ Vought, the head of OMB, a ‚Äúmalignant political hack‚Äù.

Schumer said in a statement that the OMB memo is an ‚Äúattempt at intimidation‚Äù and predicted the ‚Äúunnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has never been more important for the administration to be prepared for a shutdown if the Democrats choose to pursue one,‚Äù the memo reads, which also notes that the GOP's signature law, a major tax and anti-immigration spending package, gives ‚Äúample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted.‚Äù OMB noted that it had asked all agencies to submit their plans in case of a government shutdown by 1 August.

Meanwhile, hundreds of federal employees who were fired in Musk's cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration ( GSA) has given the employees ‚Äì who managed government workspaces ‚Äì until the end of the week to decide, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press. Those who accept must report to work on 6 October after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation.

‚ÄúUltimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,‚Äù said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official. ‚ÄúThey didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.‚Äù","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Restructuring comes after six quarters of falling sales and growing pressure from unions over working conditions

Starbucks will lay off around 900 staff and pull down the shutters on some 100 cafes across North America as part of a $1bn restructuring plan to revive the world's largest coffee chain.

The business, which eliminated 1,100 corporate positions earlier this year, will also close ‚Äúmany‚Äù open or vacant positions as it notifies affected employees affected by cuts on Friday.

The 900 Starbucks staff hit by the restructuring work in ‚Äúnon-retail‚Äù roles, the company said. It will also close 1% of the coffee houses it operates in North America.

Starbucks is scrambling to reverse its fortunes. The firm's US sales have dropped for six straight quarters as consumers, grappling with years of higher inflation, think twice before ordering its pricey coffees.

The latest cuts are designed to ‚Äúreinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them‚Äù, the Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, wrote in a letter to employees on Thursday. ‚ÄúI believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve.‚Äù

But Starbucks Workers United, a union representing workers at hundreds of its stores, said the move ‚Äúmakes it clear things are only going backwards‚Äù at the chain. ‚ÄúFixing what's broken at Starbucks isn't possible without centering the people who engage with the company's customers day in and day out,‚Äù it said.

Starbucks attributed about 90% of the restructuring cost to its North American business, with $150m expected in employee separation costs and $850m in costs related to store closures.

Starbucks also plans to ‚Äúuplift‚Äù more than 1,000 store locations in the next 12 months, Niccol added, ‚Äúto introduce greater texture, warmth and layered design‚Äù.

In his letter, Niccol did not mention the union organizing efforts at Starbucks. More than 650 Starbucks stores in the US have unionized, with workers pushing for a first union contract.

Negotiations between the union and Starbucks faltered months after Niccol assumed the role of CEO last September, as the union launched its largest strike ever at the company in December.

Starbucks workers with the union have criticized the ‚ÄúBack to Starbucks‚Äù changes under Niccol, and have threatened further strikes to push the company to reach a first contract with the union. Starbucks has claimed it is committed to fair bargaining.

‚ÄúI know these decisions impact our partners and their families, and we did not make them lightly,‚Äù Niccol said on Thursday. Shares in Starbucks dropped 1%.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

More than 1,200 industry figures claim the pledge is ‚Äòa document of misinformation' and that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are ‚Äòoften the loudest critics of government policy'

More than 1,200 entertainment industry figures have signed a new open letter rejecting the recent high-profile pledge by thousands of their peers to boycott Israeli films over the war in Gaza.

Stars including Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Debra Messing are among those who have lent their names to the letter, which says the previous pledge ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù for ‚Äúthe erasure of art‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe know the power of film,‚Äù begins the letter, which was released on Thursday by nonprofit bodies Creative Community for Peace and The Brigade. ‚ÄúWe know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.‚Äù

It accuses the pledge circulated by Film Workers for Palestine and signed by stars including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo of being not ‚Äúan act of conscience‚Äù but rather ‚Äúa document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.‚Äù

The open letter makes the point that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are ‚Äúoften the loudest critics of government policy‚Äù ‚Äì and frequently penalised by them for this. Last week, the winner of Israel's own academy awards, The Sea ‚Äì about a Palestinian boy who risks death to go to the beach in Tel Aviv ‚Äì was submitted as the country's entry to the Oscars. This led to the Israeli sports and culture minister vowing to cut funding from the awards.

‚ÄúWhen artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,‚Äù added Messing in a statement.

The initial pledge was published on 8 September and was signed by some 1,200 professionals ‚Äì rising overnight to 4,000 and now standing at around 5,000 ‚Äì who vowed not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are ‚Äúimplicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs film-makers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,‚Äù the pledge reads. ‚ÄúIn this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.‚Äù

In the immediate wake of the pledge, many in the Israeli industry expressed considerable disquiet about the boycott, with representatives from the country's producing, directing, screenwriting and documentary divisions saying the move was misguided and would only ‚Äúdeepen the darkness‚Äù.

The following week, studio Paramount also condemned the boycott in a statement which read: ‚ÄúSilencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace. The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication ‚Äì not less.‚Äù

To our fellow artists and the global film community,

We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.

The pledge circulated under the banner of ‚ÄúFilm Workers for Palestine‚Äù is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.

To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.

Israel's film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel's film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistently program dissent.

Israel's entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.

The pledge uses nebulous terms like ‚Äúimplicating‚Äù and ‚Äúcomplicity.‚Äù Who will decide which Israeli film-makers and film institutions are ‚Äúcomplicit‚Äù? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is ‚Äúcomplicity‚Äù just a pretext to boycott all Israelis and Zionists ‚Äì 95% of the world's Jewish population ‚Äì no matter what they create or believe?

History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence film-makers before: Nazi Germany's propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood's own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.

We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponised and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimises falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.

If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support film-makers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.

Let art speak the whole truth.

We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

UNITED NATIONS (AP) ‚Äî Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told global leaders Wednesday that the world is in ‚Äúthe most destructive arms race in human history‚Äù and urged the international community to act against Russia now, asserting that Vladimir Putin wants to expand his war in Europe.

In a bleak view of today's world, he told the annual high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly that weak international institutions including the United Nations haven't been able to stop wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere, and international law can't help nations survive.

‚ÄúWeapons decide who survives,‚Äù the Ukrainian leader said. ‚ÄúThere are no security guarantees except friends and weapons.‚Äù

Zelenskyy spoke from the podium of the vast assembly chamber a day after he met with President Donald Trump, who expressed support for Ukraine's efforts and criticized Russia. Trump said Tuesday that he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia, a dramatic shift from the U.S. leader's repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war sparked by President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor.

Zelenskyy did not comment on the surprise U.S. pivot, saying only that he had ‚Äúa good meeting‚Äù with Trump and with many other ‚Äústrong leaders.‚Äù

‚ÄúTogether, we can change a lot,‚Äù he said, expressing appreciation for support from the United States. and Europe and urging all U.N. member nations to condemn Russia while it ‚Äúkeeps dragging this war on.‚Äù

If Putin isn't stopped now, the Ukrainian president warned the assembly that he will keep driving the war forward, ‚Äúwider and deeper.‚Äù

‚ÄúUkraine is only the first, and now Russian drones are already flying across Europe, and Russian operations are already spreading across countries,‚Äù he said.

Zelenskyy said neighboring Moldova is defending itself again from Russian interference and should not be allowed to move toward dependency on Russia as Georgia and Belarus are. ‚ÄúEurope cannot afford to lose Moldova, too,‚Äù he said, stressing that the country needs funding and energy support, not just ‚Äúpolitical gestures.‚Äù

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, weapons and especially drones ‚Äúare evolving faster than our ability to defend ourselves.‚Äù

While drones previously were used by major countries, he said, ‚ÄúNow, there are tens of thousands of people who know how to professionally kill using drones.‚Äù

Recently, European airports had to shut down because of drones, Zelenskyy said, and last week North Korea announced the test of ‚Äúa tactical drone‚Äù which means even countries with limited resources can build dangerous weapons.

‚ÄúWe are now living through the most destructive arms race in human history, because this time it includes artificial intelligence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCompanies are already working on drones that can shoot down other drones, and it's only a matter of time ‚Äî not much ‚Äî before drones are fighting drones, attacking critical infrastructure and attacking people all by themselves ‚Äì fully autonomous and no human involved except the few who control AI system.‚Äù

Zelenskyy echoed U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in calling for global rules on how AI can be used in weapons, stressing that ‚Äúthis is just as urgent as preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.‚Äù

Stopping Putin now is cheaper than trying to protect every port and airport and every ship from drone attacks, and having to build underground schools and health centers as Ukraine has been forced to do to protect its citizens, he said. ‚ÄúStopping Russia now is cheaper than wondering who will be the first to create a simple drone carrying a nuclear warhead.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo we must use everything we have together to force the aggressor to stop, and only then do we have a real chance that this arms race will not end in catastrophe for all of us,‚Äù the Ukrainian leader said.

The Ukrainian leader said his country doesn't have ‚Äúbig fat missiles dictators love to show off in parades‚Äù but it is producing drones that can fly 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers which have been used against Russia.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine is building a new security architecture, and more than 30 countries are part of its coalition, and ‚Äúwe have decided to open up for arms exports ‚Äì and these are powerful systems tested in a real war when every international institution failed.‚Äù

UNITED NATIONS (AP) ‚Äî With China leading the way by announcing its first emission cuts, world leaders said Wednesday they are getting more serious about fighting climate change and the deadly extreme weather that comes with it.

At the United Nations' high-level climate summit, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced the world's largest carbon-polluting country would aim to cut emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035. China produces more than 31% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, and they have long been soaring.

The announcement came as more than 100 world leaders gathered to talk of increased urgency and the need for stronger efforts to curb the spewing of heat-trapping gases.

With major international climate negotiations in Brazil 6¬Ω weeks away, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened a special leaders summit Wednesday during the General Assembly to focus on specific plans to curb emissions from coal, oil and natural gas.

In a video address, Xi pledged that China would increase its wind and solar power sixfold from 2020 levels, make pollution-free vehicles mainstream and ‚Äúbasically establish a climate adaptive society.‚Äù

Europe then followed with a less detailed and not quite official new climate change fighting plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said last week, member states agreed that their emissions cutting targets would range between 66% and 72%. The EU will formally submit its plan before the November negotiations.

While the new promises are in the right direction and show stronger commitment to fighter climate change, ‚Äúthese targets will not be enough to keep us safe from climate destruction,‚Äù said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director for international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Xi and Brazil's leader also made statements on Wednesday afternoon that may have referred to U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks a day earlier on renewable energy and the concept of climate change. ‚ÄúWhile some countries are acting against it, the international community should stay focused on the right direction,‚Äù Xi said.

Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, who is hosting the upcoming climate conference, said, ‚Äúno one is safe from the effect of climate change. Walls at borders will not stop droughts or storms,‚Äù Lula said. ‚ÄúNature does not bow down to bombs or warships. No country stands above another.‚Äù

Said Guterres: ‚ÄúThe science demands action. The law commands it. The economics compel it. And people are calling for it.‚Äù

Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said she was there to issue ‚Äúa demand for us all to wake up from a community whose hospitals and schools are being destroyed'' by rising tides. She said she has regularly been awakened by floods and drought emergencies in her small island nation and that it will soon be others' turn.

‚ÄúIf we fail to wake up now and end our dependence on fossil fuels the leaders of every country in this room will be woken up by calls about catastrophes of wildfires, of storms, of heatwaves, and of starvation and drought,‚Äù she said.

Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said his country knows this all too well, with recent floods that have affected 5 million people across over 4,000 villages, killing over 1,000.

‚ÄúAs I speak to you, my country is reeling from intense monsoon rains, flash floods, mudslides and devastating urban flooding,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are facing this calamity at a time when the scars of the 2022 floods that inflicted losses exceeding $30 billion and displaced millions are still visible across our land.‚Äù

Anthony Albanese, prime minister of Australia, called this a decisive decade for climate action and said Australians know the toll of more frequent and extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, bush fires and droughts. ‚ÄúAustralia knows we are not alone,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWarming appears to be accelerating,‚Äù climate scientist Johan Rockstrom said in a science briefing that started the summit. ‚ÄúHere we must admit failure. Failure to protect peoples and nations from unmanageable impacts of human-induced climate change.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're dangerously close to triggering fundamental and irreversible change,‚Äù Rockstrom said.

Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told leaders that every tenth of a degree of warming is connected to worsening floods, wildfires, heat waves, storms and many more deaths: ‚ÄúWhat's at stake is nothing less than everything and everyone we love.‚Äù

In a news conference, Lula said he invited both Trump and Xi to the November climate negotiations, saying it's important that leaders listen to scientists.

Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, 195 nations are supposed to submit new more stringent five-year plans on how to curb carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Technically the deadline was in February and about 50 nations have filed theirs. Several countries filed or announced plans Wednesday.

U.N. officials said countries really need to get their plans in by the end of the month so the U.N. can calculate how much more warming Earth is on track for if nations do what they promise. Former U.S. President Joe Biden submitted America's plan late last year before leaving office and the Trump administration has distanced itself from the plan.

Before 2015, the world was on path for 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, but now has trimmed that to 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), Guterres said.

However, the Paris accord set a goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 19th century and the world has already warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since.

Simon Stiell, UN's climate chief, said the Chinese plan ‚Äúis a clear signal that the future global economy will run on clean energy. And that for every country, stronger and faster climate action means more economic growth, jobs, affordable and secure energy, cleaner air, and better health, for all of us, everywhere.‚Äù

Lula also praised China's announcement, but some advocates were underwhelmed, but they said China has reputation for under-promising and over-delivering on climate action.

‚ÄúChina's latest climate target is too timid given the country's extraordinary record on clean energy,‚Äù said former Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos, chair of the group The Elders. ‚ÄúChina must go further and faster‚Äù

NATO potentially shooting down a Russian plane in allied airspace ""would be war,"" Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25.

The comments come amid surging tensions between Moscow and NATO as the allies accused Russia of multiple airspace violations in recent weeks.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft violating their airspace, a statement welcomed by many eastern members.

When asked what Russia's reaction would be in such a case, Meshkov replied that downing a Russian plane would amount to war.

""You know, there are many NATO planes that violate Russian airspace, deliberately or not, but it happens quite often. They are not shot down afterward,"" the ambassador claimed, without providing an example.

Poland's air defenses downed at least three Russian drones in its airspace on Sept. 10, while another unmanned aircraft was recorded flying over Romania for almost an hour a few days later. On Sept. 19, Estonia said that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes.

Meshkov denied the accusations, echoing previous statements from the Kremlin. Moscow has also refuted any connection to suspicious drone sightings in Denmark and Norway earlier this week.

The recent incidents have further strained already tense relations between Russia and NATO countries, many of which have been supporting Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Recent months saw Western leaders warn of a potential open conflict with Russia in the coming years after the war in Ukraine ends.

President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Russia's recent airspace violations and other matters in separate meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24. 

Zelensky has been holding high-level meetings at the 80th U.N. General Assembly in New York, where leaders from nearly 150 countries have convened. He met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Sept. 23 and delivered an address to the Assembly on Sept. 24. 

The president's latest meetings included talks with the leaders of NATO and France. Both meetings touched on Russia's recent aerial incursions in Europe, which Zelensky said were ""not mistakes, but targeted actions,"" according to the Presidential Office. 

In the past month, Russian drones have breached Polish and Romanian airspace, while Russian fighter jets have entered Estonia. Unidentified drones were also spotted in Denmark. 

Zelensky and Rutte ""coordinated their positions and agreed on the next joint steps,"" the Presidential Office said. 

The two leaders also discussed the PURL (Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List) program, the Trump-backed scheme to sell U.S. weapons to NATO countries who will then provide arms to Ukraine. 

In the two months since the program's inception, contributions to PURL have already reached $2.1 billion, the Presidential Office said. 

Expanding the program ‚Äî in terms of both higher contributions and broader participation ‚Äî remains a NATO priority, Rutte said. 

In his meeting with Macron, Zelensky not only discussed Russia's airspace violations, but also Ukrainian air defense needs, sanctions against Moscow's shadow fleet, and the use of frozen Russian assets. 

""The leaders paid particular attention to the use of frozen Russian assets for the benefit of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron discussed specific instruments that would make this possible,"" the Presidential Office said. 

Macron said in recent interview with CBS News that he opposed confiscating frozen Russian assets, as that would violate international law. 

At the start of Russias full-scale invasion in 2022, the Group of Seven (G7) countries froze approximately $300 billion in Russian central bank assets, with about two-thirds held by the Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear.

European governments and G7 allies have been exploring ways to generate revenue from these immobilized funds without outright seizing them, which would have legal and political ramifications.

U.S. President Donald Trump's recent about-face on Ukraine's ability to defeat Russia followed briefings from American officials on the current battlefield situation and a possible future Ukrainian offensive, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 24. 

""I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sept. 23., following a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. 

The statement marked a stunning reversal from Trump, who has repeatedly stressed Russia's military might and prioritized warmer ties with Moscow over aid to Ukraine. 

In recent days, U.S. officials have briefed Trump about current battlefield conditions and a planned Ukrainian offensive that would require American intelligence support, the WSJ reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. 

These officials reportedly included Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg ‚Äî seen as the administration's strongest advocate for Ukraine ‚Äî and the recently appointed U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz. 

The briefing emphasized Russia's failure to make significant territorial gains despite mounting large-scale offensives in multiple regions of Ukraine. While Russia has concentrated thousands of troops in eastern Ukraine, Moscow continues to make incremental gains at the cost of staggering personnel losses. 

No additional details were provided regarding the planned Ukrainian offensive and the role the U.S. would play in the operation. 

Ukraine's last major offensive ‚Äî the surprise Kursk incursion launched in August 2024 ‚Äî ended in Kyiv's withdrawal from most of the captured territory after Russia staged a spring counteroffensive with support from North Korean troops. 

Ukraine has seen increased success with its long-range strikes against Russia, dealing major blows to Russian oil industry operations and disrupting aviation. Operation Spiderweb, a mass drone strike on Russia's military airfields, reportedly disabled over a dozen heavy bombers and caused billions in damage. 

While Trump's comments signal a dramatic shift in rhetoric towards Russia and Ukraine, it is unclear to what extent, if any, U.S. policy will substantively change.

Patriot.TV (OTCID:CBMJ) challenges Fox (FOX), Newsmax (NMAX), and Sinclair (SBGI) amid explosive growth, while legacy outlets Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Paramount (PARA), and Disney (DIS) face declining ratings and eroding trust.

ATLANTA, GEORGIA / ACCESS Newswire / September 25, 2025 / Conservative Broadcast Media & Journalism, Inc. (OTCID:CBMJ) and its flagship network Patriot TV, is proud to announce that nationally recognized TV and radio host, best-selling author, and political commentator Wayne Allyn Root is joining its lineup this week with his show, ""WAR Zone with Wayne Allyn Root.""

""What an honor to join Patriot TV and their millions of conservative viewers,"" said Wayne Allyn Root. ""My weekend powerhouse TV show, "" America's Top Ten Countdown"" , reaches millions on Real America's Voice TV. Now my daily video podcast WAR Zone will be on multiple dynamic platforms from Patriot TV, to serving as the official podcast of "" The Gateway Pundit"", reaching their 2.5 million unique daily readers, as well as livestreamed on X, Gettr, and TruthSocial. The left has tried everything to stop me, ban me, censor me, harass me, yet the popularity and reach of my shows just keeps exploding. That's called WINNING! ""

JD Rucker, President of Patriot TV, welcomed Root to the network with enthusiasm. ""Wayne Allyn Root is a powerhouse in conservative media,"" said Rucker. ""His addition to Patriot TV is a major win for our audience and our mission. We're excited to give him a platform that matches his reach and passion, and we know WAR Zone will be a cornerstone of our network."" The new program debuts this week across Patriot TV's streaming channels, The Gateway Pundit, Rumble, and major social media platforms. ""WAR Zone with Wayne Allyn Root"" will air live each weekday from 6:00-8:00 PM ET (3:00-5:00 PM PT). Viewers can expect Root's trademark mix of hard-hitting MAGA political analysis, lively interviews with high-profile conservative stars, and an unyielding defense of President Trump, America First, and personal freedom, and free enterprise.

The addition of Wayne Allyn Root's hit show comes amid an explosive period of growth andmomentum for Patriot TV. Under the leadership of JD Rucker, who took the helm as President and COO in late June 2025, the network has rapidly expanded its content, audience, and market footprint. In just a few months, Patriot TV's parent company Conservative Broadcast Media & Journalism (OTCID:CBMJ) has celebrated a string of strategic victories and milestones that bolster its position as a rising force in conservative media.

Patriot.TV's momentum has been fueled by a series of strategic wins under the CBMJ umbrella. The acquisition of "" The Conservative Playbook"" , a popular newsletter and website with more than 40,000 dedicated subscribers, instantly broadened the network's reach and reinforced its challenge to legacy outlets. The company also expanded internationally with the hiring of Scarlett Karoleva as European Affairs Correspondent, adding a global perspective to its lineup and further solidifying Patriot.TV as ""America's fastest-growing conservative news platform.""

Domestically, Patriot.TV has brought in several prominent voices, including Wayne Dupree, Drew Berquist, and David Pollack, each adding nationally recognized programs and their loyal audiences to the network. On the business side, a new partnership with Evergreen Media Partners has opened up lucrative advertising opportunities, giving brands direct access to Patriot.TV's highly engaged viewers while accelerating the company's monetization strategy.

These moves have been translated directly into results. In July 2025, Patriot.TV hit a record 1.6 million live viewers on Rumble, its strongest month to date.

Each of these accomplishments has occurred since JD Rucker assumed leadership in June, highlighting the impact of his vision and execution. ""Patriot TV is becoming the destination for truth-driven journalism,"" Rucker said in a recent statement. ""Bringing in bold voices and investing in quality content underscores our commitment to fearless reporting that the American people can trust."" Under Rucker's guidance, Patriot TV has transformed into a high-growth media platform, launching hit shows, forging partnerships, and unlocking value for its audience and shareholders alike.

Patriot TV's steady ascent is especially notable given the turmoil plaguing other political news outlets on a near-daily basis. The broader media landscape is in flux as audiences are rapidly abandoning traditional cable and broadcast networks in favor of independent streaming platforms. Many legacy outlets have been rocked by declining ratings, leadership shake-ups, and waning public trust, creating an atmosphere of instability in mainstream newsrooms. By contrast, Patriot TV has been consistently gaining viewers and momentum while avoiding the controversies that mire its competitors.

Industry trends underscore this shift. Major liberal-leaning media conglomerates, from Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN (WBD) to Paramount's (PARA) CBS News and Disney's (DIS) ABC, have suffered steep double-digit ratings declines and shrinking ad revenues. Even some conservative-leaning cable networks face stagnation as viewers seek unfiltered content. Meanwhile, digital-first outlets like Patriot TV are capitalizing on this exodus from legacy media. Patriot TV's meteoric rise is challenging the dominance of established conservative networks like Fox News (FOX) and Newsmax (NMAX), which remain relevant but now face mounting competition from more agile streaming platforms. In short, Patriot TV is surging ahead while old-guard media struggles, reflecting a broader seismic shift in viewer habits toward on-demand, values-aligned content.

With its authentic programming and innovative multi-platform distribution, Patriot TV has tapped into the growing demand for trustworthy conservative voices. The network's success comes as Americans increasingly bypass corporate media gatekeepers in favor of outlets that share their values and tell it like it is. Patriot TV's consistent positive growth, contrasted with the chaos and decline gripping much of the mainstream media, positions the company as a beacon of stability and opportunity in the current news ecosystem.

With over three million monthly video views and hundreds of thousands of engaged readers across its platforms, Patriot TV continues to expand its influence in the conservative media landscape. The addition of ""Wayne Allyn Root's WAR Zone"" further cements Patriot TV's position as a leading voice for Americans seeking news and commentary outside the mainstream.

Italy has sent a naval frigate to a flotilla of boats attempting to bring aid to the Gaza Strip. Activists, lawmakers and journalists in the convoy said drones attacked some of their boats. 

Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto condemned on Wednesday an apparent drone attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla as it left Greece en route toward Gaza.

He added that Italy was sending a naval ship to be nearby if the flotilla required assistance. ""The vessel is already en route to the area for possible rescue operations,"" Crosetto wrote on X.

""In a democracy, demonstrations and forms of protest must also be protected when they are carried out in accordance with international law and without resorting to violence,"" Crosetto said.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani called on Israel to ensure that no Italian citizens on any of the 51 ships in the convoy were harmed.

Italy's right-wing government does not support the activists and holds the Israeli blockade of Gaza to be lawful, but Tajani's office called on the Israeli government to remain in ""compliance with international law and the principle of absolute caution"" when dealing with those on board.

Some lawmakers with Italy's left-wing opposition parties are among the activists and journalists aboard the ships.

Israel has repeatedly criticized the flotilla, accusing those on board of complicity with the Hamas militant group. 

The Israeli Foreign Ministry warned on X that Israel ""would take the necessary measures"" to stop the flotilla if it did not accept a proposal to unload aid in an Israeli port.

""Israel will not allow vessels to enter an active combat zone and will not allow the breach of a lawful naval blockade,"" the ministry said Monday. ""Israel urges the participants not to break the law and to accept Israel's proposal for a peaceful transfer of any aid they might have.""

People aboard the ships reported ""flash bombs, explosive flares and suspected chemicals"" appearing above them overnight, counting ""15 or 16 drones.""

The vessels were attacked by 12 drones in international waters off the coast of the Greek island of Gavdos, said Marikaiti Stasinou, a spokesperson for March to Gaza Greece, which is part of the flotilla.

The Greek Coast Guard told news outlets that none of the boats were damaged. 

Two weeks ago, the flotilla said it had also experienced drone attacks while leaving Tunisia. Tunisian authorities have denied any involvement in the alleged attack.

The flotilla seeks to break the naval blockade of Gaza that started before the October 7, 2023, attacks led by Hamas in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw about 250 more taken hostage. 

The  Israeli military campaign in response has killed tens of thousands and left hundreds of thousands without adequate food and medical supplies. International organizations, including United Nations bodies, have characterized Israel's policy in Gaza as a genocide. 

Earlier attempts by similar flotillas to reach Gaza over the summer were intercepted by Israeli forces and their passengers sent home.

The weakened storm has moved toward Vietnam, with authorities bracing for landfall. The storm has killed at least 25 people and displaced millions.

A weakened Tropical Storm Ragasa moved west along China's southern coast toward Vietnam on Thursday after battering Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines, killing at least 25 people.

On Wednesday, China's Guangdong province faced the wrath of Ragasa, the world's strongest cyclone this year flooding homes and leaving over 56,000 households without power.

Tropical Storm Ragasa, downgraded from a super typhoon, peaked on Monday hitting the Philippines with maximum sustained winds of 265 kph (165 mph), killing at least 11 people.

A day later, the storm caused a lake burst that left at least 14 people dead in Taiwan.

More than 100 people were injured in Hong Kong in the storm's wake and about 1,000 flights were canceled. Hong Kong was under the highest typhoon warning for most of Wednesday as huge waves crashed over the areas along the eastern and southern shoreline. Additionally, widespread flooding submerged some roads and residential areas.

Meanwhile, authorities evacuated nearly 2 million residents from homes in Guangdong province, where the storm toppled more than 50,000 trees and forced schools and businesses to shut down.

""The winds were so strong, you can see it completely ripped everything apart,"" Lin Xiaobing, a worker at a restaurant devastated by the storm, told the AFP news agency.

Crews in China cleared thousands of downed trees and debris from the submerged streets in the cities of Yangjiang and Zhuhai, while relief workers cleaned up blocked roads and used boats to rescue stranded residents.

Beijing earmarked over $49 million (‚Ç¨41.74 million) for rescue and recovery operations, Xinhua reported.

In Hong Kong, schools and businesses reopened on Thursday as authorities tackled more than 1,200 fallen trees and widespread flooding.

Hong Kong resumed flights out of its international airport on Thursday after a 36-hour suspension.

""It is anticipated that flights will be scheduled until late into late night tomorrow, handling over 1,000 flights at the normal level,"" Hong Kong's Airport Authority said.

Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Ragasa made its second landfall in Beihai, Guangxi, at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday (2200 Wednesday UTC/GMT) as a tropical storm.

The weakened Ragasa, with winds of 65 kph, moved west toward Vietnam, where Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered immediate preparations.

Authorities moved to secure infrastructure, protect fishing vessels and evacuate residents.

Some of the flights were canceled or rescheduled.

Ragasa is forecast to remain a rain threat across Vietnam and parts of Southeast Asia before eventually dissipating.

Meanwhile, authorities in the Philippines warned that another system, Tropical Storm Bualoi, could hit the country's eastern coast on Friday.

The US Geological Survey reported the magnitude of the quake, which was located at a depth of 14 kilometers. No casualties have been reported.

A 6.3-magnitude earthquake shook west and north Venezuela on Wednesday, the US Geological Survey said.

There were no immediate reports of any casualties or serious damage.

The epicenter of the earthquake was located at a depth of 14 kilometers (8.6 miles) some 27 kilometers from Mene Grande, the USGS said.

A few hours later, the USGS reported on another 5.8-magnitude earthquake, 28 kilometers from Mene Grande.

Some 600 kilometers west of Caracas, Mene Grande is an oil town in a sparsely populated area of the state of Zulia.

Venezuela is the country with the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at approximately 303 billion barrels as of 2023-2024, significantly more than other countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Canada.

The Colombian Geological Survey measured the tremor at 6.1 and categorized it as a ""shallow depth"" event in Mene Grande, but the quake was also felt in neighboring Colombia, as well as the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire.

Strong temblors are not common in Venezuela, but Wednesday's quake shook buildings and caused alarm in cities including Caracas and Maracaibo. 

About 80% of Venezuelans live in seismic zones, but the South American country has not had a major quake since 1997, when 73 people died in Cariaco in the eastern state of Sucre.

In 1976, nearly 300 were killed and 2,000 injured when a quake hit Caracas.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

When many foreign leaders meet Donald Trump, they go into damage-limitation mode, hoping they will be spared punitive tariffs or a dressing-down by the US president.

Not so Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, who heads to Washington on Thursday hoping to right what he sees as a historical wrong, while bolstering his nation's military capabilities in the process.

It's six years since Ankara was booted out of the F-35 programme after procuring a Russian missile system, leaving it out in the cold while other US allies acquired some of the most advanced fighter jets in the world.

The two countries now appear to be edging closer to a deal that would see Turkey return to the fold and spell disaster for Israel.

However, some in Washington told The Telegraph they are concerned that such a move could upset a delicate balance of power in the Middle East. Israel, with its rancorous relationship with Turkey spiralling ever downwards, is lobbying furiously against the move that officials worry could challenge its bid for greater influence over Syria and beyond.

If Mr Trump wants to strike an agreement with Mr Erdogan, he will have to overcome hostility in Congress where Israel has its allies and fair share of critics over authoritarian Erdogan.

Washington expelled Ankara from the F-35 programme in 2019 after the latter's acquisition of the Russian S-400 long-range air defence system, raising concerns that it could expose their highly classified fighter jets to intelligence gathering by Moscow.

At the time, Turkey was keen to boost its air defence capabilities given its proximity to neighbouring conflicts in Iraq and Syria. When other options fell through, Ankara turned to the S-400.

Mr Erdogan has not forgotten the slight and readmission to the F-35 programme will be the most controversial item on his wish list when he steps into the White House on Thursday.

He has had some support from the US side: Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey, reportedly believes the issue could be resolved by the end of the year.

‚ÄúWe are working on many trade and military deals with the [Turkish] president, including the large-scale purchase of Boeing aircraft, a major F-16 Deal, and a continuation of the F-35 talks, which we expect to conclude positively,‚Äù Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform recently.

‚ÄúPresident Erdogan and I have always had a very good relationship,‚Äù he added.

Mr Trump has long boasted of his friendship with autocrats, but even among that select crowd he seems to have particularly enjoyed the company of Mr Erdogan.

According to accounts of his first term, he would banter with his Turkish counterpart, calling him ‚Äúthe sultan‚Äù. ‚ÄúPeople think he loves [Vladimir] Putin,‚Äù Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former White House chief strategist, once recalled. ‚ÄúErdogan is the one he loves.‚Äù

That relationship now appears to be paving the way for a multi-billion dollar deal between both countries. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Boeing and Lockheed Martin are poised to win aircraft orders from Turkey for as many as 250 commercial planes in addition to F-35 and F-16 fighter jets.

Ankara has also recently ended tariffs it imposed on the US in 2018, and has not retaliated against Mr Trump's move this year to impose 15 per cent tariffs.

However honeyed the diplomatic strategy, Mr Erdogan has been publicly blunt about what he wants to secure from his meeting with the US president on Thursday.

‚ÄúI don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership and I don't think it's the right way to go,‚Äù he told Fox News, the president's favourite TV channel, on Tuesday evening.

‚ÄúWe expect that the United States will also do what it needs to do, both about F-35s and also the issue of F-16s and their production, maintenance.‚Äù

At the same time, the Turkish leader suggested relations between Turkey and the US, particularly their defence industries, would ‚Äúgreatly‚Äù improve following his sit-down in the White House. This would have been music to the ears of a deal-hungry US president.

Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official who works as a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he believed Mr Trump would take a geopolitical setback in return for a deal.

‚ÄúTurkey wants to have F-35s and Trump and Tom Barrack want business deals in exchange,‚Äù he told The Telegraph. ‚ÄúFor short-term gain‚Ä¶ we are gambling with the future of regional security.‚Äù

Turkey's strategy of maintaining ties with everyone as a way to maintain stability at home has made it hard for outsiders to understand where its true loyalties lie, though sceptics abound, given Mr Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule over 22 years in power.

There are growing worries that Israel may seek to target Turkey, as bilateral relations have soured significantly since the Gaza war erupted in Oct 2023.

Israel's recent strike in Doha against leaders of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group it is battling in Gaza, has worsened those concerns.

Turkey, unlike its Nato allies, does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation, with the group's officials routinely visiting the country.

Turkey and Israel are also jockeying for greater influence in Syria, where a new government ‚Äì installed after the Assad regime fell last December, and staunchly backed by Ankara ‚Äì has struggled to consolidate power given fractious sectarian divisions that have led to bloodshed.

In recent years, Mr Erdogan has also engaged in sabre-rattling against Greece over a military build-up on the Greek Aegean islands. ‚ÄúWe can come down suddenly one night when the time comes,‚Äù he said in 2022, warning his ballistic missiles could hit Athens.

Ankara, which has occupied a third of Cyprus since an invasion in the 1970s, has also warned of ‚Äúdangerous consequences‚Äù if the island seeks to bolster its air defences.

Many influential voices in the US, including in Washington, are therefore nervous about the consequences in the Middle East of handing over a fleet of elite fighter jets over to the Turkish president.

‚ÄúUnder Erdogan's Islamist rule, Ankara is a destabilising force ‚Äì cosy with Hamas, flirtatious with Moscow and aggressive toward America's real allies,‚Äù read a New York Post opinion column this week, urging Mr Trump not to reward the Turkish leader's ‚Äútreachery‚Äù.

The disquiet goes even further afield: Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, reportedly lobbied Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, against readmitting Turkey to the F-35 programme.

‚ÄúWe are gambling the future of regional security. We're gambling Israel's security. We're gambling Greece's security. We're gambling Cyprus' security. We should not be doing this,‚Äù Mr Rubin said.

‚ÄúWho might Turkey in the future use the F 35 against? Is it more likely to use the F-35 against Russia or against Israel? And if you can't answer that question, then they shouldn't be getting the F-35.‚Äù

Members of Congress, outraged at Turkey enjoying the benefits of a US alliance and Nato membership while buying a Russian S-400, barred Ankara from receiving F-35s under the National Defence Authorisation Act while maintaining the missile system.

Possible compromises that have been floated include Turkey transferring its S-400 to Syria, ensuring it is not integrated with Nato systems, or locking them away in sealed depots.

In any case, it means Mr Trump will have to overcome concerns from lawmakers to transfer F-35s to Turkey if and when he strikes a deal with Mr Erdogan.

As recently as this week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress warned the president to proceed ‚Äúvery carefully‚Äù, arguing that Turkey's possession of the S-400 would endanger US military secrets.

‚ÄúRewarding Erdogan's government without meaningful changes in behavior would set a dangerous precedent and weaken the credibility of US foreign policy,‚Äù they said.

The space for an F-35 deal, with opposition both domestic and abroad, appears to be narrow. At the same time, both Mr Trump and his Turkish counterpart now look like they want Turkey back in the F-35 programme. And both men are used to getting their own way

Several GOP-led states are hoping to mitigate midterm losses by redistricting their maps before the next census.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

This week, a group of senators ‚Äî three Democrats and one independent ‚Äî introduced legislation that aims to reform the redistricting process and eliminate gerrymandering in every state in the country.

The proposed bill would forbid redrawing maps between census cycles, which is currently being performed by several Republican-led states seeking to subvert the will of voters in order to ensure a GOP-majority Congress in the second half of President Donald Trump's term.

The Redistricting Reform Act, sponsored by Senators Alex Padilla (D-California), Adam Schiff (D-California), Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia) and Angus King (I-Maine), is similar to a House version of the bill introduced by a group of Democrats last week. The legislation aims to eradicate gerrymandering by placing certain conditions on states when it comes to redistricting, mimicking the way Maine produces its congressional maps.

Those conditions include:

The bill forbids any state commission from drawing maps that favor one political party over another. It also enacts strict rules regarding who parties can select to serve on the commission, stipulating that the commission can not include members who, for a certain period of time (as determined by the states), hold or have held public office, have been candidates for public office, or have served or currently serve ‚Äúas an officer, employee, or paid consultant of a campaign committee of a candidate for public office.‚Äù 

Redistricting could only occur immediately after a census count is taken. Beyond that, states could only change their maps if they were required to do so by a judicial decree. 

Although the bill has been submitted by Democratic lawmakers in past congressional terms, it has recently taken on new importance, as Trump's political team is strategizing with several Republican states to redraw maps this year to mitigate potential losses in the 2026 midterm elections. Typically, the party of the president loses congressional seats in the midterms, but by redistricting now instead of waiting until the next census, Republicans can potentially keep control of both houses of Congress if the midterms end up being close.

Several states, including Kansas, Utah, and others, are considering redrawing their maps to eliminate Democratic-majority districts; Missouri and Texas have already redrawn their maps to do so. California, which is led by Democrats, will have a ballot initiative this year to redraw its maps, with hopes of matching the Democratic losses that will be felt by these Republican states' actions.

‚ÄúAbusing the redistricting process is one of the most serious threats to democracy and our Constitution,‚Äù King said in a statement regarding the bill. ‚ÄúNot only does partisan and off-schedule redistricting damage and disenfranchise American citizens' fundamental right to vote, but it also contributes to rising polarization in Congress and further diminishes public faith in our political process.‚Äù

Several other House Democrats have called for passing the Redistricting Reform Act to address abuse of power by Republicans, noting that, with myriad polling data demonstrating Democrats are preferred by American voters to run Congress beyond 2026, this mid-census redrawing of maps is a flagrant attempt to game the system. 

‚ÄúPresident Trump has unleashed a redistricting war across the country, calling up Republican-controlled states and demanding that they rig their maps. Why? Because he's an unpopular President who has stripped healthcare from millions, and he knows that rigging the redistricting process is the only way his party doesn't lose the House in 2026,‚Äù Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California) said regarding the House version of the bill. 

‚ÄúRepublicans are failing. Their policies are unpopular. Instead of trying to win on the issues, they are attempting to rig the outcome of the election and silencing Brown and Black voices,‚Äù Rep. Marc Veasy (D-Texas) said. ‚ÄúTexas was the beginning of their scheme, and we won't stand by as it happens across the country.‚Äù

Polling shows that, when it comes to how congressional and state legislative maps should be redrawn, the vast majority of Americans support ideas like those presented in the Redistricting Reform Act.

According to an NBC News Decision Desk poll published earlier this month, 82 percent of Americans back the idea of a nonpartisan commission producing maps. Only 18 percent of voters prefer the current method employed by most states, of allowing the political party in power to draw maps.

That sentiment crossed party lines ‚Äî it was backed by 92 percent of Democratic voters, 79 percent of independents, and 76 percent of Republican-leaning voters, the survey found. 

A Common Cause poll published this month also suggested strong opposition to Republicans' current mid-census redistricting scheme.

According to that poll, 76 percent of Democratic-leaning voters said they opposed mid-census redistricting, with 72 percent of independents in agreement. And while Republicans were more likely to approve of redistricting in between census counts, a majority, 57 percent, still said they were opposed.

The judge warned the Department of Justice that future violations may result in sanctions.

A federal judge has ordered prosecutors to respond to a letter from Luigi Mangione's legal team alleging that Trump administration officials' recent social media posts about the case appear to have violated his right to a fair trial.

‚ÄúIt appears ‚Ä¶ that multiple employees at the Department of Justice may have violated Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and this Court's order of April 25, 2025 specifically identifying the strictures of this rule,‚Äù U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Garnett wrote in her order on September 24 in response to the letter.

The rule stipulates that ‚Äúnon-lawyer personnel employed by a lawyer's office or subject to a lawyer's supervision‚Äù in a criminal case have a duty not to release an ‚Äúopinion that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication‚Äù if there is a chance that the opinion will ‚Äúinterfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.‚Äù

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

This includes any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, Garnett pointed out.

‚ÄúThe statements referenced in the [letter from Mangione's legal team] by two high-ranking staff members of the Department of Justice, including within the Office of the Attorney General, appear to be in direct violation of this Rule and the Court's April 25 Order,‚Äù the judge continued.

On September 19, the deputy director of the Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs reposted a clip of President Donald Trump saying that Mangione ‚Äúshot someone in the back as clear as you're looking at me‚Ä¶he shot him right in the middle of the back ‚Äì instantly dead‚Ä¶‚Äù The DOJ staffer wrote, ‚Äú@POTUS is absolutely right.‚Äù The chief of staff and associate deputy attorney general retweeted the same post. The original post was later deleted.

Future violations may result in sanctions, including ‚Äúrelief specific to the prosecution of this matter,‚Äù Garnett wrote. 

The letter to the court from Mangione's lawyers includes numerous examples of Trump administration officials speaking about Mangione's alleged guilt in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City last year. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges. 

During a White House press briefing on September 22, the White House press secretary said Mangione was a ‚Äúleft-wing assassin [who] shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson right in the back in New York City.‚Äù

The following day, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller said on Fox News that ‚Äúof course the healthcare CEO was brutally gunned down by another self-described so-called anti-fascist that was then celebrated by other self-described anti-fascists, so of course, really communist revolutionaries.‚Äù The White House deputy chief of staff for policy reposted the clip on X. 

Mangione's attorneys wrote that the government ‚Äúknows this statement to be false.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe Government has indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events, and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation,‚Äù the attorneys wrote.

‚ÄúA recent, tragic, high-profile murder has only increased this prejudicial rhetoric,‚Äù the lawyers continued, referencing the fatal shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk. ‚ÄúThe attempts to connect Mr. Mangione with these incidents and paint him as a ‚Äòleft wing' violent extremist are false, prejudicial, and part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case, especially one where the death penalty is at stake.‚Äù

Teachers' unions and civil rights groups say the legislation could stifle criticisms of Israel.

A controversial California bill that would appoint an ‚ÄúAntisemitism Coordinator‚Äù is heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk.

Teachers' unions and civil rights groups warn that the legislation, which is purported to combat antisemitism, will stifle criticisms of Israel and its genocidal assault on Gaza.

AB 715 was introduced by Assembly members Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay). The legislation would require lawmakers to appoint an ‚ÄúAntisemitism Coordinator‚Äù for the state. That coordinator would be able to review the curriculum, and threaten schools with fines and dismissals for refusing to remove material deemed ‚Äúfactually inaccurate.‚Äù

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The bill would also allow Israel supporters to file unsupported complaints of antisemitism with the California Department of Education.

The bill was recently passed in both chambers, but the process was fast-tracked, as there were only three days left in the legislative session. Multiple lawmakers said they weren't given adequate time to assess it.

The Assembly Education Committee's hearing on AB 715 was only informational. A last-minute waiver enabled the legislation to proceed without committee approval.

‚ÄúWe've been robbed of the opportunity to demonstrate that people can trust us in this process,‚Äù said Assembly member Mia Bonta, who sits on the Education Committee.

Education advocates warn that, if signed into law, the bill would have a chilling impact on classrooms throughout the state. It's opposed by including the California Teachers Association, the California Faculty Association, the Association of California School Administrators and California County Superintendents, the California School Boards Association, and the Council of UC Faculty Associations.

 ‚ÄúIt is very disappointing that our CA legislators are ignoring objections to this bill from every major teachers union, from every educational association and significant concerns of constitutionality from the ACLU to ramrod through this terrible bill at the very end of the legislative session without full opportunity for public input and without meaningful dialogue with Palestinians,‚Äù Jewish Voice for Peace Action national board member Seth Morrison told Mondoweiss.

‚ÄúIt is beyond shameful that California lawmakers are fast tracking a bill that mirrors Trump's right-wing playbook of silencing Palestinians, all while this government is enabling Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza,‚Äù said AROC Action Executive Director Lara Kiswani.

An earlier version of the bill identified examples where criticism of Israel crosses into antisemitism. These included ‚Äúequating Jews or Israelis with Nazis or Nazi Germany‚Äù and ‚Äúlanguage or images directly or indirectly denying the right of Israel to exist.‚Äù 

In response to the backlash, the examples were removed. ‚ÄúWe have compromised on numerous things with our colleagues who expressed concerns,‚Äù Assembly member Addis told the Jewish News of Northern California.

However, the lawmakers included information on anti-Israeli discrimination, which the aforementioned coordinator would have to take into consideration when reviewing teaching materials.

The bill's passage was celebrated by JPAC, Legislative Jewish Caucus, the ADL, and other pro-Israel organizations that helped lobby for it.

JPAC Executive Director David Bocarsly said it represented a ‚Äúhistoric stand against antisemitism in our schools.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor far too long, Jewish students have endured slurs, bullying, and open hostility in their classrooms with nowhere to turn,‚Äù claimed Bocarsly. ‚ÄúAB 715 is a promise to those students ‚Äî and to all children in California ‚Äî that they are not invisible, that their safety and dignity matter, and that our state will not stand idly by in the face of hate. This bill is about more than policy. It's about protecting children, defending civil rights, and ensuring every student can walk into school proud of who they are.‚Äù

Organizers, educators, and activists are calling on Governor Newsom to veto the ‚ÄúClassroom Censorship Bill.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is now Governor Newsom's test. He can either side with educators, civil rights advocates, and students whose voices are at risk of being silenced ‚Äî or he can greenlight censorship that will make classrooms less free and less inclusive,‚Äù said CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said in a statement.

‚ÄúCalifornia has some of the strongest civil rights protections in the country,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúReal harassment and discrimination must always be addressed ‚Äî but this bill is not the way. Governor Newsom should reject this flawed measure and stand with educators and students who deserve classrooms where truth and justice are not censored.‚Äù

 Washington Must Adapt Its Playbook for a New Era of Nuclear Risk

 Mariano-Florentino Cu√©llar, Ernest J. Moniz, and Meghan L. O'Sullivan

In 1964, China detonated a 22-kiloton nuclear device at a test site in the arid northwestern Xinjiang region‚Äîand the political fallout reached Washington. Worried about the prospect that many countries around the world would soon gain nuclear weapons, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson convened a committee of seasoned foreign policy leaders to advise him on what Washington should do to prevent proliferation. Led by the former U.S. deputy secretary of defense Roswell Gilpatric, the group asked what an increase in nuclear-armed states would mean for U.S. security, what assurances the United States could realistically offer states that decided to forgo nuclear weapons, and how far Washington should go to prevent more states from acquiring them.

The Gilpatric committee's conclusion was unanimous: averting the spread of nuclear weapons to any state, friend or foe, should be a top national security priority. To achieve that end, the committee provided a policy blueprint that Washington then went about implementing. Acting on the group's advice, U.S. officials began negotiating multilateral nonproliferation treaties and agreements, including, controversially, accords with the Soviet Union. The United States also developed measures to cajole and coerce other countries into remaining nonnuclear, including extending security assurances, supporting civilian scientific endeavors, and threatening to cut off military support and impose economic penalties on proliferating states. Thanks in large part to such initiatives, U.S. efforts to combat proliferation over the last 60 years have succeeded more often than they have failed. Only nine states possess nuclear weapons, and only North Korea has acquired them in the twenty-first century.

But the nuclear landscape is changing in ways that are bringing proliferation back to the fore. An increasingly powerful China is scaling up its nuclear arsenal. Russia has backstopped its war in Ukraine with threats of nuclear use. Iran's nuclear program was set back by recent U.S. and Israeli attacks, but it was not destroyed. U.S. allies, worried about their security and unsure about Washington's commitment to their defense, are also mulling going nuclear. And evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence are making it easier than ever for states to build the bomb. Against this backdrop, the Cold War‚Äìera tools and tactics that Washington has long relied on to manage proliferation challenges are eroding. The international treaties and regimes that govern nuclear issues, particularly the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), are badly frayed. Great-power cooperation on nuclear dangers has stalled.

These are storm clouds that American policymakers cannot ignore. So last year, drawing inspiration from the Gilpatric committee, we convened a bipartisan task force of senior national security leaders and experts to assess how nuclear proliferation is evolving and to make recommendations on how the United States can reinvigorate its approach. Despite differing views on a variety of security issues, the group, like Gilpatric's, reached a clear consensus: nuclear proliferation by any additional country would diminish U.S. power, complicate strategic planning, and increase the likelihood of nuclear use, accidents, and disasters.

But preventing proliferation will require a revamped approach. Instead of relying extensively on international treaties and great-power cooperation to control the supply of nuclear technologies, Washington will need to focus more on reconfiguring security alliances and pursuing new risk-reduction measures, including with competitors, that curtail the demand for nuclear weapons. The U.S. government will have to reassure its allies that it will come to their defense and harness new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that can strengthen international monitoring capabilities and make it harder to conceal illicit activities.

None of these steps will be easy, given the world's many divisions. But they are essential to preventing the emergence of new nuclear states‚Äîand thus enormous new risks.

The Soviet Union and the United States agreed on little. But throughout the mid-to-late twentieth century, the two countries sustained a high degree of cooperation in establishing and enforcing a global network of treaties, institutions, technology controls, and practices to inhibit nuclear proliferation. The cornerstone of this system is the NPT, which opened for signature in 1968 and now enjoys close to universal membership. Moscow and Washington upheld nonproliferation cooperation across all kinds of ups and downs in their relationship, including after the Cold War ended.

China was historically more skeptical of nonproliferation institutions and policies. But after joining the NPT in 1992, it also began participating, albeit selectively, in efforts to avert the further spread of nuclear weapons. For example, China, Russia, and the United States cooperated to stop North Korea's nuclearization during the 1990s and early 2000s, although they ultimately failed. They later partnered with European powers to negotiate and implement the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. This successfully limited Iranian enrichment of uranium‚Äîuntil U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord three years later.

But recently, both Moscow and Beijing have begun to dial down their efforts. To advance its war against Ukraine, Russia has embraced military cooperation with both Iran and North Korea. In exchange for their support, it has ignored Tehran's and Pyongyang's nuclear advances, voting in international forums to protect Iran from censure and bartering for North Korean weapons in violation of a UN arms embargo on North Korea. More concerning, Russian nuclear saber rattling has reanimated concerns in Europe and elsewhere that revisionist powers might use nuclear coercion to pursue wars of aggression. In 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he was suspending Moscow's participation in the New START treaty, which was negotiated with the United States in 2010 and is the last remaining bilateral agreement governing strategic nuclear arsenals. For now, Russia continues to adhere to the treaty's central limits, and Putin recently offered to extend those limits for an additional year. But the details of what Russia has proposed, let alone what it will do, remain unclear, and the prospects of a successor treaty to replace New START when it expires in early 2026 appear dim. It is now common to hear people in Kyiv and other European capitals say that only the bomb can guarantee a state's survival.

China's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and more aggressive regional military posture add yet another layer to this challenge. What has historically been a bipolar nuclear order is transforming into a tripolar one. Beijing and Washington share common interests in preventing other states from developing nuclear weapons, but they have far less experience cooperating on nuclear issues than Moscow and Washington do. Moreover, Beijing likely sees solidifying a geopolitical counterweight to the United States and its allies as more important than preventing Iranian proliferation or reining in North Korea's nuclear expansion.

Like its adversaries, many allies and close partners of the United States have flirted with the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons. In fact, many of Washington's greatest nonproliferation success stories involved these states. American officials used a variety of tools to stymie their nuclear weapons ambitions, but one of the chief instruments was a willingness to extend protection to allies by bringing them under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. These arrangements played a crucial role in preventing the wave of proliferation that appeared imminent in the 1960s and 1970s. In practice, this involves maintaining a large defense and security network in key regions, including the forward deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe.

The U.S. alliance system is expensive, but it has done much to help Washington. U.S. officials have long believed that it would be harder to manage crises and prevent the use of nuclear weapons if more partners acquired nuclear arsenals. Extending deterrence has also afforded Washington significant influence over security dynamics in East Asia and Europe, where the United States has used its nuclear umbrella to cultivate valuable economic, political, and military relationships.

Yet growing threats from China, North Korea, and Russia have made U.S. allies question the credibility and sustainability of the security umbrella, particularly given the recent shifts in U.S. policy. Although doubts about whether the United States would truly risk nuclear war on behalf of its allies have always existed, such concerns have deepened in light of Washington's costly trade disputes, its criticisms of allies' ‚Äúfree-riding,‚Äù and its discussions on reducing the U.S. military presence abroad. These allies are also unsettled by Washington's periodic overtures to long-standing adversaries, particularly Russia. As a result, in recent years, current and former leaders and prominent security analysts in a variety of U.S. partner countries‚Äîincluding Germany, Japan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea‚Äîhave openly discussed the need for independent nuclear arsenals or alternative security arrangements that would reduce their dependence on the United States.



Some American analysts and officials have argued that the prospect of nuclear weapons acquisition by select allies may not be so bad and that it would help reduce the United States' defense burden and vulnerability to a nuclear attack. But in reality, nuclear proliferation by U.S. allies could trigger destabilizing reactions from adversaries, increasing the likelihood of escalating regional conflicts. It could also make it harder for the United States to influence the behavior of allies and undercut efforts to thwart the nuclear weapon ambitions of unfriendly states, such as Iran.

Rather than encourage allies to develop nuclear weapons of their own, Washington should work with them to develop a new extended deterrence compact by updating the basic security bargains and divisions of labor that provide for mutual defense. Such an agreement should retain the U.S. nuclear umbrella for strategic deterrence while strengthening the conventional defenses of allies so they are better equipped to handle military threats from China, North Korea, and Russia. In turn, allies must better understand that their conventional military forces and American capabilities, conventional and nuclear, are part of one system for deterring threats and responding to attacks.

The United States can encourage its allies to invest more in deterrence by pairing steps to reinforce U.S. commitments with reciprocal and timely contributions from partners. Many allies are already increasing defense spending and augmenting their military capabilities, but this is only a start. In terms of hardware, allies need to acquire additional military systems, including conventional strike capabilities and integrated and layered missile defenses, that complement U.S. capabilities. Nonnuclear weapons have more range and utility than they did when extended deterrence arrangements were first established during the Cold War; as a result, they can serve as the first line of defense against aggression. But these countries must also invest in newer systems, such as anti-drone weapons. Recent events, including the incursion of Russian drones into Polish and Romanian airspace this month, underscore the urgency of adjusting to evolving forms of warfare. Poland, for example, was able to shoot down the drones, but only by scrambling its fighter jets. And relying on expensive missiles and planes to intercept cheap drones is not sustainable.

Equally critical, the United States and its allies must improve military and political coordination. Tokyo and Washington's decision last year to elevate alliance discussions on extended deterrence to the highest levels of government is a positive step in this direction. Deeper coordination to prepare for nuclear crises would also help allies understand how their contributions are critical to deterrence and increase their confidence that the United States would take action on their behalf. Washington can further reassure its friends by repeatedly and publicly reiterating its commitment to protect them.

As it strengthens its alliances, the United States should also pursue pragmatic engagement with China and Russia to mitigate proliferation. The most direct way to do this would be for the three countries to engage in arms control and risk-reduction efforts. But realistically, the prospects for significant progress today are slim. Attempts to engage China and Russia in recent years have borne little fruit. Engaging with Russia is likely to be especially difficult as long as the war in Ukraine continues. And even if the United States suddenly found receptive partners in Beijing and Moscow, the emergence of a tripolar nuclear order calls for a fundamentally different approach to arms control. Attempting to equalize nuclear capabilities across the three powers cannot work.

The United States should nevertheless seek openings where it can. To begin, Washington should take up Putin's suggestion to maintain the existing caps on their respective nuclear arsenals, which will otherwise be lifted when the New START treaty expires. U.S. officials should also propose a longer extension to New START while negotiators work on an agreement to replace it. In parallel, a senior U.S. official should signal to Chinese counterparts that Washington would be willing to discuss issuing a public statement in which the United States and China recognized their mutual nuclear vulnerability‚Äîa concept that has underpinned the nuclear relationship between Washington and Moscow for decades‚Äîas the first step in a bilateral process to identify and reduce nuclear risks. Separately, China, Russia, the United States, and the world's other recognized nuclear weapons powers could jointly commit not to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against countries that do not have them. This would demonstrate nuclear restraint and perhaps reduce the incentives for countries to seek nuclear weapons.

Both China and Russia can make unique contributions to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. As a close neighbor and key transit point for illicit North Korean activities, China could, for instance, step up efforts to uphold the UN arms embargo on North Korea. It could also address concerns about its own opaque and rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal. As the United States should tell China (behind closed doors), its nuclear buildup is stoking security anxieties in Asia and leading other countries in the region to contemplate developing their own nuclear weapons.



Russia was particularly integral to negotiating and implementing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and it has powerful leverage as the primary supplier to Iran's civilian nuclear program. Should it choose to, it could help push Tehran into a new nuclear pact with limits and monitoring mechanisms that go beyond what was in the original. But even if Moscow won't use its power to force through a new agreement, the United States can enlist Russia's help in preventing the present situation from getting worse. Moscow could, for instance, press Tehran to fully restore its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which requires that Iran provide unimpeded access to inspectors, and avoid escalatory actions such as withdrawing from the NPT.

China, Russia, and the United States have reason to cooperate on other elements of nuclear security, even if they do not directly address rising proliferation threats. The states are all leaders in civilian nuclear technologies, with ambitious goals to expand nuclear energy projects domestically and abroad. Even as they compete for contracts and influence in the nuclear export marketplace, they maintain shared goals. Washington should therefore seek reinvigorated technical dialogues on promoting high standards for nuclear security and making sure that nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of smugglers or terrorists.

Addressing the intersection of nuclear proliferation and emerging technologies will also require global buy-in, including from China and Russia, and the updating of international safeguards and multilateral export regimes. Already, powerful AI models can be exploited by states to weaponize nuclear materials more quickly and cheaply or to circumvent monitoring and verification. Other developments, such as 3D printing and specialized machine tools, have likewise reduced some of the technical chokepoints to proliferation. At the same time, the United States and other countries can and should harness emerging technologies to thwart proliferation more effectively. Cheaper and more advanced sensor technologies could aid in the detection of illicit nuclear activities, making it harder for proliferators to hide.

Fortunately, the vast majority of states still do not want nuclear weapons‚Äîin no small part because of the successes of U.S. strategy. But if even a handful of governments pursue the bomb, the world will be more volatile and dangerous. The United States thus retains an abiding interest in curtailing nuclear proliferation. American policymakers, after all, do not want to live in a world in which they must neglect key security priorities, such as homeland defense and technological competition, to focus on nuclear crises.

But to stop the further spread of nuclear weapons, Washington must address the rising interest in the bomb among its allies and bear in mind evolving threats from new technologies. It needs to bring Cold War‚Äìera security commitments into the twenty-first century, making them more reciprocal and responsive in ways that can mitigate allies' fears of abandonment, strengthen collective defenses, and make U.S. defense burdens more sustainable. American strategy also needs to reflect a tripolar nuclear order. In the past, U.S. cooperation with Russia could focus mostly on building up the nonproliferation regime. Today, Washington will need to push Beijing and Moscow to temper behaviors that are driving countries to consider nuclear weapons of their own.

Averting proliferation in this geopolitical moment may seem difficult, and it will indeed require strong, bipartisan support to update U.S. strategy. But consensus is within reach when it comes to halting the spread of nuclear weapons, if only because the alternative would be far more costly for the United States and the world.

 A Divide Is Growing Between the Region's Continental and Maritime Countries

 Susannah Patton

Policymakers and scholars in the West talk about Southeast Asia as a coherent region, but it has always been divided. The region's 700 million people speak hundreds of languages and follow different religions, and its 11 countries vary in political system, size, geography, and level of economic development. Throughout the Cold War, Southeast Asia was divided between the five original founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that were aligned with the United States‚ÄîIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand‚Äîand the three countries of Indochina‚ÄîCambodia, Laos, and Vietnam‚Äîthat aligned with China or the Soviet Union.

After the Cold War ended, ASEAN expanded to include Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, as well as the tiny sultanate of Brunei, increasing the salience of Southeast Asia as a geopolitical entity. Yet despite ASEAN's achievements in fostering cooperation between its members, a cohesive Southeast Asia remains more myth than reality.

The reality is of two regions, not one. According to the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Influence Index, which maps the sway of foreign partners across the region, two distinct networks persist among countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam form a continental group that leans toward China. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore make up a maritime group in which the countries are well connected to one another, work with a wider array of governments from outside the region, and hedge between the United States and China. The Philippines is an outlier. It lacks close friends among other ASEAN countries and relies on non-Asian partners, particularly the United States, more than any of its neighbors.

The gap between these two networks of Southeast Asian countries is set to grow in the decades ahead, leading to a de facto Chinese sphere of influence in continental Southeast Asia. To prevent Beijing from encroaching even further, the United States should deepen ties with the countries that straddle Southeast Asia's two subregions: Thailand and Vietnam.

Rugged, mountainous jungle separates China from Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, and through these countries, Cambodia and Thailand. The anthropologist James Scott referred to this difficult landscape as ‚ÄúZomia‚Äù and described how it prevented any state from fully controlling these highlands for much of the region's history. In fact, these geographic barriers kept continental Southeast Asia apart from China for millennia and provided a natural limit to the expansion of the Chinese state. By the twenty-first century, however, technology has overcome terrain. Roads, railways, and special economic zones have facilitated more exchanges of people and goods between China and continental Southeast Asia.

Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has provided financing for new infrastructure megaprojects, especially railways, across the region. Many of these projects have physically linked continental countries to China, which has changed the nature of their relationships with Beijing in a way that is not true for maritime states. In 2021, for instance, southern China was connected by rail to the Laotian capital, Vientiane. China's ultimate vision is to attach this line to projects across Thailand and Malaysia to establish a rail link between Singapore and the Chinese city of Kunming. The effects of the railway have been profound for Laos, a small developing country that is now heavily indebted to China. The value of trade between the two countries has soared since the railway opened, much of it from agricultural exports farmed by Laotians on land leased to Chinese investors.



Laos's connections to China have a darker side, too. In the early years of this century, Laos set up special economic zones in a legitimate effort to encourage foreign investment. But today, they are ungoverned spaces in which Chinese businesspeople and even security forces can operate outside the confines of the law. Drug trafficking, wildlife crime, the unregulated migration of workers from Myanmar and other neighboring countries, and cyber-scams have proliferated in these areas. In effect, Laos lacks full sovereignty over much of its own territory. In Myanmar, civil war has slowed progress on the road and rail projects aiming to connect China with the Indian Ocean. But an oil and gas pipeline has continued to operate despite fierce fighting.

Even Vietnam, traditionally wary of Chinese influence, has drawn high levels of Chinese private investment because of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Already, many companies have moved their supply chains from China to Vietnam, particularly its north‚Äîa shift from the historical norm in which southern Vietnam has been a more important center for trade and commerce. The U.S. tariff on Vietnamese products, at 20 percent, is still lower than those applied to Chinese goods, so China will likely continue to invest in Vietnam.

China has also funded railway projects in maritime Southeast Asia. In 2023, for example, a $7.3 billion high-speed domestic railway opened joining Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, with Bandung. Construction is underway on a project linking Malaysia's east and west coasts by rail, at a cost of around $12 billion. Although these projects in maritime countries add to Beijing's clout as an economic partner, they have not yet meaningfully connected either Indonesia or Malaysia to China.

Whereas continental Southeast Asia has, through its connection to China, been transformed over the past decade, this is not true of maritime Southeast Asia, which has always been exposed by its geography to many trading partners. The region's two largest maritime countries, Indonesia and the Philippines, are immense archipelagos, and together with Singapore and Malaysia, straddle key waterways connecting Asia with the world. Just as Scott dubbed the highlands of continental Asia ‚ÄúZomia,‚Äù the journalist Philip Bowring coined the term ‚ÄúNusantaria‚Äù to describe Southeast Asia's vast maritime expanses.

China has tried to assert control over the region's central waterway, the South China Sea. This has alarmed countries around the globe, which need shipping lanes to remain free and open for trade. In 2016, a UN tribunal rejected China's claims to the area within its ‚Äúnine-dash line,‚Äù which covers almost the entire South China Sea. Since then, dozens of countries, as far afield as the United Kingdom, have supported the ruling, underscoring the global importance of these waterways.

Because maritime Southeast Asian countries are bigger and more important to worldwide commerce than continental states, they tend to receive investment and development finance from a larger pool of foreign donors. They also draw more interest when it comes to defense. Of the new defense cooperation initiatives between Western and Southeast Asian governments since 2017, most have been with maritime countries and Vietnam. Maritime countries, under more pressure from China's sweeping maritime claims and steady encroachment in their exclusive economic zones, see the need to work with the United States and other Western countries. And the United States and its allies, particularly Australia and Japan, use maritime Southeast Asian countries to advance their own goals in relation to China. The United States views combined military exercises with the Philippines as a way to maintain access within the so-called first island chain, which separates China from the Pacific Ocean. Washington has stepped up military sales and cooperation with the Philippines, which has borne the brunt of China's aggression at sea, as an investment in maintaining respect for international law and an attempt to prevent China from bending smaller countries to its will.

Southeast Asia's two sets of countries will continue to diverge. The region's maritime states will remain open to many partners. China will be their biggest source of external influence but not by a huge margin, and many other countries, including the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, will attenuate Beijing's sway. Continental Southeast Asia, on the other hand, is likely to become part of Beijing's de facto sphere of influence. China won't wield absolute power over these countries, but it will have much more leverage than any other state outside the region.

U.S. President Donald Trump appears drawn to the idea of spheres of influence. He seeks to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere while showing greater deference to Russia's interests in Europe. Perhaps the United States will ultimately see continental Southeast Asia as part of a natural sphere of influence for China. For a United States that is looking to reduce its international commitments, a decision to stop competing with China there may make sense.

Yet Washington should beware the consequences of such an arrangement. And if it does not want to undermine its own position in Southeast Asia, it should shore up ties with countries on the margins of Beijing's zone of influence: Vietnam and Thailand. Vietnam is continental in character. It has a closed political system, history of aligning with the Soviet Union, deep ties with Cambodia and Laos, and growing links to China. But Vietnam is becoming more maritime in its outlook. For example, in 2023, it upgraded its relationship with the United States to a comprehensive strategic partnership‚Äîa sign it considered the United States to be a vital partner. The Trump administration has squandered such goodwill, treating Hanoi as an adversary in one-sided tariff negotiations, a move that risks long-term damage to U.S. standing in Vietnam.

The United States should also pay more attention to Thailand. The country, a Cold War ally and an advanced economy, has historically been friendly to many external partners, including Western ones. Yet since 2006, Thailand's democracy has eroded, and Bangkok has deepened both economic and defense ties with Beijing. The United States must invest more in this alliance and avoid punitive actions that push Thailand into Beijing's arms officials. Washington, for example, sanctioned Thai officials in March for deporting 40 Uyghur asylum seekers to China. By shoring up its ties with Vietnam and Thailand, the United States can help ensure that maritime Southeast Asia remains open, imposing a natural limit on China's ability to dominate Asia and preserving U.S. interests in the wider Indo-Pacific region.

            Israeli authorities have arrested an American-Israeli dual citizen on suspicion of spying for Iran, accusing him of sharing information on public figures and sending videos and pictures of locations across the country to his handlers.
    


            Yaakov Perl, 49, was arrested earlier this month after an investigation by the Shin Bet security agency and the National Crime Unit of the Israeli police.
    


            Perl had lived in Morocco in recent years, authorities said, and he first contacted the Iranian embassy there by phone in 2017.
    


            Police and the Shin Bet said in a joint statement Perl requested asylum for himself and his family but received no response. In 2023, he began engaging with Iranian news outlets on social media and publishing content critical of Israel and Zionism.
    


            In January, Perl wrote an article that authorities say supported Hezbollah following Israel's killing of the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.
    


            After the article's publication, he was approached by Iranian operatives, with whom authorities say he agreed to cooperate. When Perl was unable to recruit people in Israel to work with him, authorities say he traveled to Israel himself in July and began gathering intelligence at the direction of his Iranian handlers.
    


            ‚ÄúHe provided the Iranians with information on Israeli public figures and citizens, including former IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir,‚Äù police and the Shin Bet said. ‚ÄúAs part of his activities, Perl also took photos and videos of various streets and locations throughout Israel. He was paid in cryptocurrency for his work.‚Äù
    


            The statement said that Perl's actions were ‚Äúall based on ideological motives and opposition to Zionism.‚Äù
    


            Since October 7th, Israeli police have been involved in investigating more than 25 cases related to espionage activity linked to Iran, resulting in approximately 46 arrests, according to a police spokesman.

            The US Commerce Department said Wednesday that it had opened new national security investigations into the import of personal protective equipment, medical items, robotics and industrial machinery.
    


            The ‚ÄúSection 232‚Äù investigations, which were opened on September 2 but not publicly disclosed previously, could be used as a basis for even higher tariffs on a wide swath of medical and industrial goods including imported face masks, syringes and infusion pumps, as well as for robotics and industrial machinery like programmable computer-controlled mechanical systems and industrial stamping and pressing machines.
    


            The probe asks companies to detail projected demand for robotics and industrial machinery and the extent to which ‚Äúdomestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand,‚Äù as well as the role of foreign supply chains in meeting US demand.
    


            The US Commerce Department is particularly interested in the role of major exporters like China in meeting US medical needs and the ‚Äúimpact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices.‚Äù
    


            The potential tariffs could also cover surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves, gowns and other medical and surgical instruments and supplies including IV bags, gauze/bandages, sutures, wheelchairs, crutches and hospital beds.
    


Trump's tariffs are bigger than his tax cuts for most Americans



            The probe also covers pacemakers, insulin pumps, coronary stents, heart valves, hearing aids, prosthetics, blood glucose monitors, orthopedic appliances, computed tomography scanners and magnetic resonance imaging machines.
    


Pharmaceuticals including prescription drugs, as well as drones, are part of separate 232 probes.
    


            The robotics probe includes machine tools for cutting, welding and handling workpieces, autoclaves and industrial ovens. Laser and water-cutting tools and machinery are also included.
    


            The department has opened numerous probes into the national security ramifications of imports of wind turbines, airplanes, semiconductors, heavy trucks, polysilicon, copper, timber and lumber and critical minerals.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî An uptick in consumer spending helped the U.S. economy expand at a surprising 3.8% from April through June, the government reported in a dramatic upgrade of its previous estimate of second-quarter growth.

U.S. gross domestic product ‚Äî the nation's output of goods and services ‚Äî rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by fallout from President Donald Trump's trade wars, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.

The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports ‚Äî which are subtracted from GDP ‚Äî as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.

Consumer spending rose at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%. 

‚ÄúThe U.S. consumer remained a lot stronger than many thought, even in the midst of a stock market sell-off and a lot of trade uncertainty,‚Äù Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, posted on social media. 




A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. 

But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth. 

Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter. 

Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% ‚Äî ‚Äúnot great but much better than initially thought.''

Since returning to the White House, Trump has overturned decades of U.S. policy in support of freer trade. He's slapped double-digit taxes ‚Äî tariffs ‚Äî on imports from almost every country on earth and targeted specific products for tariffs, too, including steel, aluminum and autos. 

Trump sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the United States and to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4. 

But mainstream economists ‚Äî whose views Trump and his advisers reject ‚Äî say that his tariffs will damage the economy, raising costs and making protected U.S. companies less efficient. They note that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States, who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. Therefore, tariffs can be inflationary ‚Äî though their impact on prices so far has been modest. 

The unpredictable way that Trump has imposed the tariffs ‚Äî announcing and suspending them, then coming up with new ones ‚Äî has left businesses bewildered, contributing to a sharp deceleration in hiring.

From 2021 through 2023, the United States added an impressive 400,000 jobs a month as the economy bounded back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Since then, hiring has stalled, partly because of trade policy uncertainty and partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve's inflation fighters in 2022 and 2023.

Labor Department revisions earlier this month showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of fewer than 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has slowed even more ‚Äî to an average 53,000 a month.

On Oct. 3, the Labor Department is expected to report that employers added just 43,000 jobs in September, though unemployment likely stayed at a low 4.3%, according to forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet.

Seeking to bolster the job market, the Fed last week cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December and signaled that it expected two more cuts this year. But the surprisingly strong second-quarter GDP growth may give the central bank less reason to cut rates ‚Äî despite intense pressure from Trump to do so. Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge ‚Äî the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index ‚Äî comes out Friday.

Thursday's GDP report was Commerce Department's third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30. 

Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet currently expect the GDP growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the third quarter.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) ‚Äî Iran has likely carried out an undeclared missile test at its Imam Khomeini Spaceport, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed Thursday, underlining Tehran's effort to maintain its weapons program despite the 12-day war with Israel in June. 

Iran has not formally acknowledged last week's test at a circular pad that has hosted other major launches by the country's civilian space program. A single lawmaker in Iran's parliament, however, claimed, without offering evidence, that Tehran tested a possible intercontinental ballistic missile. 

The test and the claim raise concerns that Iran may be trying to expand the reach of its missiles as tensions remain high ahead of United Nations sanctions, which are likely to be reimposed this weekend over Tehran's nuclear program ‚Äî as it also repairs missile sites that were struck by the Israelis.

‚ÄúIsrael's successes in the 12-day war against Iran's missile attacks reinforced for Tehran the importance of developing more ballistic missiles and qualitatively better versions of them,‚Äù said Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The think tank has long been critical of Iran and has been sanctioned by Tehran. 

‚ÄúConsider this part of Tehran's efforts to build back better, and as quickly as possible,‚Äù he added.




On Sept. 18, Iranian social media users posted images of the sky over Semnan province, showing what appeared to be a rocket's contrail at sunset. Iranian officials did not acknowledge what caused the contrail, nor did Iranian state media report on the incident. 

Satellite photos taken prior to that by Planet Labs PBC show the circular pad at Imam Khomeini Spaceport ‚Äî about 230 kilometers (145 miles) southeast of Iran's capital, Tehran, in Semnan ‚Äî painted blue ringed with red, white and green lines ‚Äî the colors of the Iranian flag. 

But in satellite images since Sept. 18, the pad appeared discolored, though it wasn't fully clear until a more-detailed Planet image requested by the AP taken this Wednesday. That image shows significant scorch marks, the pattern of which resembled scorching seen at the pad following past launches. When rockets launch, the flames from their engines pour down onto pads. 

Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who studies missiles, said the scale of the scorching suggested Iran launched a solid-fuel missile, as burning aluminum oxide particles cause such marks. 

The north-south marks suggest a blast deflector being used as well to channel the flames, he said.

Iranian parliament member Mohsen Zanganeh, appearing on Iranian state television on Saturday, claimed that the Islamic Republic had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday. He portrayed it as a sign of Iran's strength as it faces challenges from Israel and the West. 

‚ÄúWe have neither abandoned (nuclear) enrichment, nor handed uranium over to the enemy, nor backed down from our missile positions,‚Äù said Zanganeh, a member of parliament's budget committee from Iran's Khorasan Razavi province. 

‚ÄúThe night before last we tested one of the country's most advanced missiles, which until now had not, so to speak, been trialed ‚Äî and that test was successful,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIn other words,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI mean to say that even under these conditions we are conducting a security test of an intercontinental-range missile.‚Äù

Zanganeh did not elaborate on where he got his information, nor did he provide any evidence to support his assertion. Iranian parliament members have made exaggerated claims in the past.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles typically have ranges greater than 5,500 kilometers (3,415 miles). That would extend far beyond the range reportedly allowed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which is 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).

The range of 2,000 kilometers encompasses much of the Middle East, including Israel and American military bases in the region. An intercontinental missile would at least put all of Europe in rage. The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees its Mideast operations, did not respond to a request for comment. 

Despite the lawmaker's claims, there are still many questions surrounding the launch ‚Äî including just what Iran sent into the sky. 

Iran has in the past used the pad to launch solid-fueled missiles called Zuljanah, named after a horse of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and a key figure in the Shiite faith who was massacred with his fighters at Karbala in the 7th century.

The Zuljanah can launch satellites in space. However, the fact that it uses solid fuel and is capable of reaching space has raised concerns by the U.S. government that Iran could potentially build an intercontinental ballistic missile. 

‚ÄúIf, as is increasingly being alleged, the test was of a space-launch vehicle, it represents a desire by Tehran to potentially threaten targets outside the Middle East, like the European continent and even the American homeland,‚Äù Taleblu said. 

Such missiles can deliver nuclear weapons, but Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess that Iran is not actively pursuing an atomic bomb, though it had been enriching uranium to up to 60% purity ‚Äî a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran also would need to miniaturize any possible nuclear bomb to put it atop a ballistic missile.

With Iran not formally acknowledging the launch and the erratic contrail that was left behind, the likelihood is that the launch may have failed. There's also no acknowledgment by U.S. space officials of Iran putting any new satellites into space on Sept. 18. 

Iran may also have used the launch to signal to the West that it will continue its missile program, despite sanctions and pressure ‚Äî though without a formal confirmation, it remains unclear just what Tehran was trying to do. 

‚ÄúThe problem is that so much happens with Iran,‚Äù Hinz said. ‚ÄúIt's hard to say what is coincidental and what is a pattern.‚Äù

DALLAS (AP) ‚Äî The gunman who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas, killing a detainee and critically wounding two others, left behind a note saying that he hoped the attack would ‚Äúgive ICE agents real terror,‚Äù the FBI director said Thursday.

The post by Kash Patel on the social platform X offered the first hint of a motive behind the shooting on Wednesday that targeted the ICE building, including a van in a gated entryway. The detainees were in the van. No ICE personnel were wounded.

The assailant, who authorities said fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop, was involved in a ‚Äúhigh degree of pre-attack planning,‚Äù Patel said, and agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from a Dallas-area home.

‚ÄúOne of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‚ÄòHopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'‚Äù Patel wrote, quoting an apparent abbreviation for armor-piercing bullets.

The gunman had also downloaded a document titled ‚ÄúDallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management‚Äù containing a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said.

Hours before the shooting, the assailant conducted multiple internet searches for ballistics information and video of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus this month, Patel said. Last month, the man searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents, he added.

Joshua Jahn, 29, was identified as the shooter by a law enforcement official who could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.




On Wednesday, Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with ‚ÄúANTI-ICE‚Äù written on it. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by the DHS on X.

The attack was the latest high-profile targeted killing in the U.S. It happened two weeks after Kirk was killed by a shooter on the roof of a building at Utah Valley University and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted a backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings ‚Äúa stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety and respect.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,‚Äù the group said in a statement.

Authorities have given few details about the shooting and did not publicly release the names of the victims. The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as ‚Äúan act of targeted violence.‚Äù

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

‚ÄúI was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them,‚Äù Cardona said, adding that they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a home in suburban Fairview, outside Dallas, that public records link to Jahn.

The house sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a police vehicle, and officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there ‚Äúat various times‚Äù between 2013 and 2018.

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

‚ÄúHe's a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,‚Äù Sanderson told the AP.

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that ‚Äúthe obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.‚Äù

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence. 

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are ‚Äúa heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.‚Äù

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4, attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was wounded. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a responding police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump's administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Dozens of immigration field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Thursday and signaling that the United States might soon lift its hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara.

During Trump's first term, the U.S. removed Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after Turkey purchased an air defense system from Russia. U.S. officials worried that Turkey's use of Russia's S-400 surface-to-air missile system could be used to gather data on the capabilities of the F-35 and that the information could end up in Russian hands.

Trump started his Oval Office meeting with Erdogan by offering hope that a resolution to the matter could be found during the leaders' talks.

‚ÄúHe needs certain things, and we need certain things, and we're going to come to a conclusion. You'll know by the end of the day,‚Äù Trump said. The president added to Erdogan, ‚ÄúAnd I think you'll be successful with buying the things‚Äù you would ‚Äúlike to buy.‚Äù

It was Erdogan's first trip to the White House since 2019. They forged what Trump has described as a ‚Äúvery good relationship‚Äù during his first White House term.

Over the years, U.S. officials have cited concerns about Turkey's human rights record under Erdogan and the country's ties with Russia. Tensions between Turkey and Israel, another important American ally, over Gaza and Syria have made relations difficult with Turkey at times.




Trump in remarks before reporters focused his concerns on Turkey's continued economic relationship with Russia.

Turkey has been one of the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuel since the European Union announced in early 2023 it would boycott most Russian seaborne oil.

Since January 2023, Ankara has purchased more than $90 billion in Russian oil, coal and natural gas. Only China and India have bought more from Russia in that period.

‚ÄúThe best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,‚Äù Trump said of Erdogan. 

Trump added that Erdogan is respected by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

‚ÄúI think he could have a big influence if he wants to,‚Äù Trump said.

The push on Erdogan to become more engaged in pressuring Putin comes after Trump earlier this week said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia in the war. It was a dramatic shift from Trump's repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war.

Erdogan has made clear he is eager to see the hold on F-35s lifted, telling Trump that he came prepared to ‚Äúthoroughly discuss‚Äù the issue.

The Turkish president was even blunter in a television interview this week. ‚ÄúI don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go,‚Äù Erdogan said in an interview this week on Fox News Channel's ‚ÄúSpecial Report with Bret Baier.‚Äù

Democratic President Joe Biden's administration kept Erdogan, who has served as president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, at an arm's length during Biden's four years in office.

The reluctance to engage deeply was borne out of Turkey's record of democratic backsliding as well as Ankara's close ties to Moscow.

Opposition parties and human rights organizations have accused Erdogan of undermining democracy and curbing freedom of expression during his more than two decades in power. International observers say that baseless investigations and prosecutions of human rights activists, journalists, opposition politicians and others remain a persistent problem in Turkey.

Trump sees Erdogan as a critical partner and credible intermediary in his effort to find ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The Republican's administration is also largely in sync with Turkey's approach to Syria as both nations piece together their posture toward the once isolated country after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in December.

Trump and European leaders have followed Erdogan in embracing Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once commanded a rebel group that was designated a foreign terrorist organization. 

Trump also said that Erdogan deserves credit for backing the rebel forces that ousted Assad from Syria.

‚ÄúI think President Erdogan is the one responsible for Syria, for the successful fight in ridding Syria of its past leader,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement.‚Äù

Trump's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, met with al-Sharaa on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

Erdogan has sought to position his country as a point of stability in a tumultuous moment. He believes Turkey can play an essential role for European security and is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine and Syria as well as U.S. tariffs, which have sparked a global trade war.

Turkey also believes it has emerged as a credible broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. 

Turkey is influential in neighboring Syria. The rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power in December. But the fall of Assad aggravated tense relations between Turkey and Israel.

Trump has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù in his dealings with Ankara.

Erdogan on Tuesday took part in a group meeting hosted by Trump on the sidelines of the General Assembly, when Trump gathered the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim countries to discuss the war in Gaza.

Erdogan has been critical of Israel's handling of the war, which was launched after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and takin about 250 people captive. More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and about 90% of homes in the territory have been destroyed or damaged.

Erdogan, in his U.N. address, alleged that Israeli forces have committed genocide, an allegation contested by Israel and United States.

DALLAS (AP) ‚Äî A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and wounding two others in a transport van before taking his own life, authorities said.

The suspect was identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with ‚ÄúANTI-ICE‚Äù written on it.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S., coming two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on a deadly shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Texas.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings ‚Äúa stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety, and respect.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,‚Äù the group said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that shots were fired ‚Äúindiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport,‚Äù a secure and gated entryway.




The wounded detainees were in critical condition at a hospital, said DHS, which previously said two detainees were killed and one was wounded before issuing a correction.

No ICE agents were injured.

By the evening, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by DHS on the social platform X.

At a midday news conference, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as ‚Äúan act of targeted violence.‚Äù




Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. and determined that someone had opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathan E. Maner said via email.

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

‚ÄúI was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God, no,‚Äù Cardona said.

Cardona said they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a suburban Dallas home that public records link to Jahn.

It sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a Fairview police vehicle, but officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there ‚Äúat various times‚Äù between 2013 and 2018.

Martyna Kowalczyk, CEO of Texas-based Solartime USA, said in a statement that Jahn worked for her company for less than a few months ‚Äúmany years ago.‚Äù

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, according to Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

‚ÄúHe's a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,‚Äù Sanderson told AP. ‚ÄúI don't remember him being that abnormal. He didn't seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.‚Äù

Sanderson said he tried to keep Jahn longer because he ‚Äúfelt bad for him.‚Äù

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that ‚Äúthe obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.‚Äù

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence. 

‚ÄúTo every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop,‚Äù Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson called the shooting not just an attack on law enforcement and the victims but ‚Äúan attack on our community and on our nation's heritage of civil and democratic discourse.‚Äù

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are ‚Äúa heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.‚Äù

‚ÄúViolence must never be allowed to define how we respond to migration,‚Äù said Anna Gallagher, the group's executive director. 

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside the Dallas ICE facility every Monday said: ‚ÄúViolence doesn't heal anything.‚Äù 

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as ‚Äúmoral witnesses.‚Äù They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and report for check-ins.

Sipe said she has noticed in recent months that people who enter are shuttled away on buses.

‚ÄúThey're taking them away, and we don't know where they're taking them,‚Äù Sipe said.

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4 attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him.

And in suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump's administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center. Sixteen people have been arrested outside, according to authorities who called the activists ‚Äúrioters.‚Äù

Dozens of field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some located in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

Some, like Dallas, have exposed loading areas for buses, which pose risks for escape and outside attack, Torres said. Other vulnerabilities are nearby vantage points for snipers and long lines forming outside without protection.

‚ÄúI would assure you that ICE, after today, is going to be a taking a hard look at physical security assessments for all of their facilities,‚Äù said Torres, currently head of security and technology consulting at Guidepost Solutions.

‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù audience members say the late-night host was emotional but didn't apologize when he returned after a nearly weeklong suspension. (Sept. 23)




NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night television Tuesday after a nearly weeklong suspension and, in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, said that he wasn't trying to joke about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

‚ÄúI have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,‚Äù Kimmel said. ‚ÄúI don't think there's anything funny about it.‚Äù

He added that he wasn't trying to blame any specific group ‚Äúfor the actions of what ... was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make.‚Äù He said he understood his remarks last week to some ‚Äúfelt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.‚Äù




But he made no apologies. And he criticized the ABC affiliates who took his show off the air. Two stations groups that represent about a quarter of ABC stations, Sinclair and Nexstar, ordered their outlets not to show Kimmel on Tuesday.

‚ÄúThat's not American. It's un-American,‚Äù he said.



The incident triggered a national discussion about freedom of speech and President Donald Trump's ability to police the words of journalists, commentators and even comics. ABC suspended Kimmel's show last Wednesday following criticism of his remarks about the aftermath of Kirk's killing. But the network brought him back following a backlash against parent company Disney.

Kimmel thanked many supporters, including fellow late-night hosts past and present and even a former boss at a radio station in Seattle who checked in with him last week. He also singled out people he knows aren't fans of his comedy but stood up for his right to speak, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

‚ÄúIt takes courage for them to speak out against this administration,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey did, and they deserve credit for it.‚Äù

Kimmel nearly broke down again in praising Kirk's widow, Erika, who publicly forgave her husband's killer.

‚ÄúThat is an example we should follow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was ... A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. And I hope it touches many. And if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that. And not this.‚Äù

Kimmel admitted that he was mad when ABC suspended him, but praised his bosses for putting him back on the air. ‚ÄúUnjustly, this puts them at risk.‚Äù

He mocked Trump for criticizing him for bad ratings. ‚ÄúHe tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show,‚Äù Kimmel said.

The decisions by Sinclair and Nexstar left ABC stations in Washington, D.C.; St. Louis; Nashville, Tennessee, and Richmond, Virginia among the cities airing something else. WJLA-TV, the Sinclair-owned station in Washington, instead aired a newscast and an episode of the chain's show, ‚ÄúThe National Desk.‚Äù

Kimmel's suspension came after an angry reaction to comments he made in monologues early last week. A relentless Trump critic in his comedy, Kimmel suggested that many Trump supporters were trying to capitalize on Kirk's death and were ‚Äúdesperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.‚Äù



Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr last week said it appeared that Kimmel was trying to ‚Äúdirectly mislead the American public‚Äù with his remarks about Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old Utah man charged with Kirk's killing, and his motives. Those motives remain unclear. Authorities say Robinson grew up in a conservative family, but his mother told investigators his son had turned left politically in the last year.

‚ÄúWe can do this the easy way or the hard way,‚Äù Carr said before ABC announced the suspension. ‚ÄúThese companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.‚Äù

Those remarks were key to the backlash, with Cruz saying that Carr acted like ‚Äúa mafioso.‚Äù Hundreds of entertainment luminaries, including Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand and Jennifer Aniston, signed a letter circulated by the American Civil Liberties Union that called ABC's move ‚Äúa dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.‚Äù

Podcaster Joe Rogan weighed in Tuesday on Kimmel's side. ‚ÄúI definitely don't think that the government should be involved ‚Äî ever ‚Äî in dictating what a comedian can or can't say in a monologue,‚Äù Rogan said. ‚ÄúYou are crazy for supporting this because this will be used on you.‚Äù

Some consumers punished ABC parent Disney by canceling subscriptions to its streaming services.

Trump had hailed Kimmel's suspension and criticized his return, writing on his Truth Social platform: ‚ÄúI can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back ... Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE.‚Äù

Actor Robert De Niro appeared on ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù on Tuesday, impersonating Carr being interviewed by Kimmel. De Niro, as Carr, said the FCC had a new motto, ‚ÄúSticks and stones can break your bones.‚Äù

Isn't there more to the saying, Kimmel asked, that words can never hurt you?

‚ÄúThey can hurt you now,‚Äù De Niro responded, saying you have to make sure to say the right ones.

Kimmel took the stage to a long standing ovation and chants of ‚ÄúJimmy, Jimmy.‚Äù One audience member, Walter Bates, said after the taping that Kimmel's discussion of Kirk's widow ‚Äúwas a very moving moment. I got very emotional and so did my wife.‚Äù

Trump's administration has used threats, lawsuits and federal government pressure to try to exert more control over the media industry. Trump sued ABC and CBS over news coverage, which the companies settled. Trump has also filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and successfully urged Congress to strip federal funding from NPR and PBS.

After pulling out of her planned performance at the premiere of Hulu's Lilith Fair documentary in protest over Kimmel's suspension, singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan appeared on Kimmel's show as the musical guest. McLachlan had been booked on the show prior to the preemption, a representative told The Associated Press.

The other guest was actor Glen Powell.

The suspension happened at a time when the late-night landscape is shifting. Shows are losing viewers, in part because many watch highlights the next day online. CBS announced the cancellation of ‚ÄúLate Show‚Äù host Stephen Colbert's show over the summer. Kimmel's contract with ABC reportedly lasts through May.

Colbert, in his own monologue Monday shortly after ABC announced Kimmel would return, grabbed his recently won Emmy Award for outstanding talk series, saying, ‚ÄúOnce more, I am the only martyr on late night!‚Äù

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the Military is going back to the basics on 'The Will Cain Show.'

The Pentagon next week is convening a meeting of top U.S. military leaders from across the globe. 

Multiple War Department officials confirmed to Fox News that top military commanders had been asked to fly to Virginia for a meeting next week, though the topic of the discussion is unclear. 

The Pentagon confirmed the meeting but did not offer details.

""The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,"" chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.

A meeting of this size and scope is highly unusual and would usually take place on a secure video teleconference ‚Äî around 800 generals and admirals are spread across the U.S. and world. 

The lack of details surrounding the gathering has some fearing a looming purge. War Secretary Pete Hegseth has previously said he wants to cut 20% of senior generals and admirals. 

The order, first reported by The Washington Post, applies to senior officers with the rank of brigadier general or above or their Navy equivalent and their top enlisted advisers. 

In May, Hegseth issued a directive to slash about 100 generals and admirals, along with a ""minimum"" 20% cut to four-star officers. He ordered an additional 10% reduction in general and flag officers across the military.

The secretary called the reductions part of his ""less generals, more GIs policy."" 

According to Hegseth, there are currently 44 four-star and flag officers across the military, making for a ratio of one general to 1,400 troops, compared to the ratio during World War II of one general to 6,000 troops.

Two Syracuse University students are facing hate crimes charges after authorities say one of them threw a bag of pork into a Jewish fraternity house during a Rosh Hashanah celebration on Tuesday.

Members of Zeta Beta Tau gathered at their fraternity house to mark the Jewish New Year when the ""deeply troubling incident"" happened, the New York school's chief student experience officer, Allen Groves, said in a community message.

A student, who is not part of the fraternity, entered the house around 6 p.m. and threw the meat inside while fraternity members were eating dinner, Groves said.

The meat, identified as pork, was in a clear plastic bag and was splattered against an interior wall and the floor, university police said.

According to Jewish law, consumption of pork is prohibited as pigs are not kosher.

The student then fled the home and got into a vehicle driven by a second student. The two, both 18, were soon captured and charged with burglary as a hate crime and criminal nuisance.

""Tonight's incident as reported to us is abhorrent, shocking to the conscience and violates our core value of being a place that is truly welcoming to all,"" Groves said. ""It will not be tolerated at Syracuse University.""

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY JANITORS SETTLE CASE AFTER BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY ANTI-ISRAEL RIOTERS ON CAMPUS

Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the hate crime charge came about because it happened on a Jewish holiday at a historically Jewish fraternity.

""This incident is not a foolish college prank and will not be treated as such,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""It will be treated for what it is, a crime directed against a group of Jewish students enjoying a celebratory dinner and seemingly secure in their residence.""

The two students accused in the hate crime attack were also referred for potential disciplinary action under the school's student conduct code. (iStock)

Body cam footage of Gazan boy, Abboud, 8, emerges alive after former GHF contractor Anthony Aguilar falsely claimed Israeli forces killed him outside a GHF site on May 28. (Credit: Gaza Humanitarian Foundation)

A young Gazan boy dubbed ""Amir,"" who traveled to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution site and was reported as having been killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in May, has been found alive hiding out with his mother. 

Both were safely extracted from the Gaza Strip earlier this month, though the location has not been disclosed for their security.

The boy, whose full name was later discovered to be Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, nicknamed Abboud, and who is 8 years old but will turn 9 in October, appeared with his mother, Najlaa, at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 late last month in a heavy disguise to avoid detection, a GHF representative involved in the operation confirmed to Fox News Digital.

An extensive internal operation by the GHF was launched to uncover the identity of the boy in late July after a former GHF employee, Anthony Aguilar, a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Army and retired Green Beret Lt. Col. turned alleged ""whistleblower,"" gave a series of explosive interviews in which he said a 10-year-old boy he called Amir had been killed by IDF forces after leaving a GHF aid site on May 28. 

EXCLUSIVE VIDEO REVEALS GAZA BOY, SAID TO BE KILLED BY IDF, IS ALIVE

In his account, Aguilar showed images taken using his cellphone of the boy approaching himself and another contractor clutching bags of food and barefoot. 

The former Green Beret turned GHF contractor for UG Solutions ‚Äî a subcontractor of the GHF which received $30 million in U.S. government funding to support its ""critical work"" ‚Äî described to multiple outlets an emotional encounter he had had with the Palestinian child, in which he claimed the boy had kissed his hand, touched Aguilar's face, and thanked him for the supplies of rice and lentils he had found. 

But the footage taken by Aguilar and handed over to GHF officials before it was obtained by Fox News Digital, did not show this interaction ever took place.

The GHF contested Aguilar's account on several fronts and pointed out the hand the boy kissed was that of Aguilar's colleague standing to his left, which the footage also showed.

When asked by Fox News Digital why he said the boy engaged with him in this manner despite what the footage shows, he maintained his story and said, ""Amir kissed my right hand. He kissed my forehead, too. He thanked us and told us he was very hungry and thankful."" 

In multiple interviews with various outlets, Aguilar described how the boy then returned to the group where other Palestinians were gathered at the distribution site before they were then dispersed by GHF contractors through the use of pepper spray, tear gas, stun grenades and bullets fired into the air, forcing them to flee the compound.

However, Fox News Digital was told that the GHF did not yet have access to non-lethal arms in the early days of the operations, according to a GHF colleague who was aware of Aguilar's position at SDS 3 on May 28. 

Additionally, Aguilar claimed that once the Palestinian civilians had been pushed out of the SDS center, IDF forces then opened fire on the crowd and killed ""Amir,"" along with other Palestinians. He reiterated this claim in an interview late last month in which he had told Dialogue Works that the boy had received a ""shot to the torso, a shot to the leg ‚Äî dead.""

But the GHF challenged Aguilar's story ‚Äî including the location of where he claimed the event had occurred.

In one of his first accounts of the incident on July 29 to Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Aguilar claimed the killing happened first outside GHF aid site SDS 1 before telling MSNBC on Aug. 2 that the shooting happened near SDS 2, and then telling Dialogue Works last month the events had occurred outside SDS 3. 

On Sept. 9, Chris Hayes gave an update on the report, telling viewers that the boy who was reported dead was, in fact, found to be alive. He said NBC producers had confirmed that the boy was now out of Gaza in an unnamed country. 

Multiple GHF sources confirmed that no such incident was reported at or outside SDS 1 or SDS 3, and SDS 2 was not yet even operational on May 28. 

Fox News Digital confirmed in speaking with multiple sources that Aguilar was on SDS 3 on May 28.

In comments to Fox News Digital, Aguilar said, ""I sincerely, and with bated breath and joy, hope that Amir is alive. I've always said as much. I have been in contact with his family and others, and Amir's family is not aware that he is alive, only that he is 'gone.' 

""I have always said that due to GHF and IDF restrictions from UG S[olutions] personnel moving beyond the concentration camp style corals extending from the North entrance, that I was NOT, say again, NOT able to verify Amir's death,"" he said. ""But I did in fact see Palestinians gunned down by IDF machine gun fire at the intersection of the SDS 3 exit and the military corridor, north of SDS 3, where an IDF Merkava tank was located.""

ISRAEL SAYS UN MISLEADS WORLD AS GAZA AID STOLEN AND DIVERTED FROM CIVILIANS

Abboud's stepmother also later told the GHF that the boy hadn't gone missing until July 28, two months after Aguilar said he had been killed.

Abboud ran away to be with his birth mother on July 28 amid a rift with his stepmother's family, whose custody he was put in following the death of his father, per Palestinian law. 

A GHF representative involved in the operation explained the search to find Abboud became not only a matter necessary to uncover what allegedly happened on May 28, but because there was increasing concern regarding threats posed by Hamas as traction picked up around the story.

The official explained that Hamas had a vested interest in making sure this child was not found, as it would discredit Aguilar's story that a Palestinian boy had been gunned down by Israeli forces outside a GHF site.

Ultimately, the GHF were able to locate the boy and his birth mother by speaking with local Palestinians and later, a family member who agreed to speak with the team before connecting them with Najlaa.

She then brought Abboud to the GHF site so that she, her son and four other male family members whose identities Fox News Digital has agreed to conceal, could be extracted from the Gaza Strip, after at least one of the male family members received direct threats from the Hamas terrorist network.

In an interview shared with Fox News Digital, Najlaa is seen sitting with Abboud and another young male, who was also set to be extracted with them, speaking with GHF officials. 

In the video, which Fox News Digital did not post to protect multiple identities, Abboud refers to Najlaa as his ""mama"" and, according to a translation of the comments, he says he is happy to be with her while smiling and sitting next to her. 

The identities of Abboud, his mother and his relatives were verified by GHF using facial recognition software that compared the images of the boy with those captured by Aguilar. 

Facial recognition software, biometric data and the death certificate of Abboud's father were used by GHF to verify the family members' identities and relationships, and were also shared with Fox News Digital.

Abboud also brought the shirt he was wearing in the footage taken by Aguilar, which is what the former GHF contractor said the boy was wearing when he was allegedly gunned down.

Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, arrived with the T-shirt he was wearing on May 28, 2025, in the footage taken by Anthony Aguilar at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation )

Aguilar did not respond to Fox News Digital regarding the intact shirt, and said, ""The new pictures are not Amir.""

When pressed on where specifically he thought there were discrepancies in the images of the boy, he said, ""Amir in my photos had a scar on his left clavicle. The boy featured by GHF does not. The Amir in my photos from SDS 3, does not have a scar on the right side of his forehead as the GHF's photos show.""

The GHF representative confirmed that the boy's scars were in fact used to verify his identity.

""I believe that is a boy of similar appearance,"" Aguilar said, noting he believes the outcome of the investigation ""is a lie.""

The GHF spokesperson for the organization, Chapin Fay, called Aguilar's story regarding the boy and his alleged murder by the IDF ""false"" during a press conference earlier this month.

Aguilar told Fox News Digital that the GHF statements made against him during a July 29 press conference were ""libel and slanderous.""

Fay described him as a ""disgruntled former employee"" who was ""terminated for cause"" after he engaged in ""volatile conflicts with staff and erratic behavior."" 

According to text messages shared with Fox News Digital, Aguilar also did not handle being removed from his role well, and threatened in a text exchange with a GHF official that he ""could be your best friend, or your worst nightmare"" if they didn't ""put [him] back to work.""

David Panzer, counsel for UG Solutions, echoed this belief in a statement he gave on July 29 in which he said, ""Mr. Aguilar was terminated from his contract with UG Solutions on June 13, 2025, due to poor performance, volatile conflicts with staff, and erratic behavior. 

""Since termination, Mr. Aguilar has spread a false narrative to media outlets around the world, all at the same time begging UG Solutions to hire him back,"" Panzer added. ""Mr. Aguilar's activities in the last several weeks make clear that he's making good on his threats to, in his own words‚Ä¶be UG Solutions's ‚Äòworst nightmare' if they didn't hire him back.""

Panzer said Aguilar's comments ""raise[d] substantial questions of motive.""

Two American TikTokers show why Japan's 7-Elevens are going viral, from matcha lattes and onigiri to the famous egg salad sandwich.

American 7-Elevens may soon look more like their Japanese counterparts ‚Äì with fresh meals and cult-favorite items that have long lured tourists to Tokyo's convenience stores.

Seven & i Holdings, the parent company of 7-Eleven, is planning a major upgrade to U.S. stores, adding higher-quality prepared foods, such as Japan's beloved egg salad sandwich.

""We have consistently emphasized our focus on food,"" the company told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""In Japan, fresh food accounts for over 30% of total sales,"" it said, noting that the strategy helps its stores pull in about 30% more revenue per day than rivals.

BEST GAS-STATION RESTAURANTS DEFY FOOD CONVENTIONS WITH FRESH BURGERS AND COUNTRY HAM

The company is weighing more than $13 billion in international investments over the next several years, much of it earmarked for upgrades and supplier networks to bring prepared meals to roughly 13,000 North American stores. 

It also plans to double U.S. store openings from 125 to more than 250 per year, adding 1,300 in the next five years.

""There is significant growth potential, but to fully realize it, we must enhance our organizational capabilities and are actively working on these initiatives,"" Seven & i said.

Japan's 7-Elevens ‚Äì nearly 22,000 nationwide ‚Äì are famed for everything from cheap meals to bill-pay services. By comparison, the U.S. has some 9,500 total stores.

AMERICA'S 15 BEST GAS STATIONS FOR FOOD, ACCORDING TO ONLINE REVIEWS

One of the top offerings expected in this country is the egg salad sandwich, made with fluffy milk bread and Kewpie mayonnaise. 

A Texas-based team is already working with Japanese suppliers to replicate the recipe, CEO Stephen Dacus, who took the helm in May, told The New York Times.

The hype has fueled a wave of foodie tourism online.

""I flew 14 hours all the way to Japan just to try 7-Eleven,"" Washington, D.C.-based influencer Darcy McQueeny said in an April TikTok video that got over 4 million views.

She stocked up on the egg salad and another fan favorite, the strawberries and cream sandwich. She also perused other hot sellers like onigiri ‚Äì a type of rice ball stuffed with fillings like tuna and wrapped in seaweed ‚Äì and a massive selection of fresh fruit.

""And it's so affordable,"" McQueeny said.

During a July visit to Tokyo, Los Angeles model and influencer Summer Marshall grabbed much of the same, plus ice cream in a squeeze pouch, a sealed cup of ice and an iced latte to try an internet-famous ice coffee hack.

""7-Eleven in the U.S. could never,"" Marshall captioned a TikTok video that got over 1 million views.

Singer Sabrina Carpenter went to a Japanese convenience store while touring in 2023 and received over 600,000 likes in a video about it. ""I've wanted to do a 7-Eleven Japan haul since the day I was born,"" she joked in her video.

GAS STATION FOOD IS 'EXTRAORDINARY' AND 'HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT,' SAYS TOP CHEF

The craze sparked a 5,000% spike in Google searches for ""7/11 Japan"" over the summer, according to Fast Company, and some travel companies now offer guided convenience store visits.

Despite the buzz, the U.S. market could be tougher. For decades, 7-Eleven has been linked more with sodas, snacks and hot dogs.

Rivals have tried and failed. FamilyMart shuttered its U.S. stores in 2015 after struggling to attract customers beyond gas-station food.

Dacus faces pressure to prove the strategy will work. Seven & i recently rejected a $47 billion takeover bid from Canadian rival Alimentation Couche-Tard.

Alongside food upgrades, the company plans to expand its 7Now delivery app.

Cultural differences also play a role. In Japan, small kitchens and apartments drive people to convenience stores multiple times a day. Frequent deliveries ‚Äì often two or three times daily ‚Äì keep shelves stocked with fresh meals, a logistical model not yet standard in the U.S.

""There is significant growth potential, but to fully realize it, we must enhance our organizational capabilities and are actively working on these initiatives,"" Seven & i said.

Jeff Lenard, vice president of media and strategic communications at the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), said demand is strong within the $650 billion convenience store industry, and profit margins are far higher on prepared food and beverages than on fuel.

""The average driver fills up once a week but eats three times a day,"" Lenard told Fox News Digital.

He said cultural trends are also helping. ""There's already an appetite for Asian culture, from music to streaming shows,"" he said.

Over the past 20 years, food service sales have more than doubled from 11.9% in 2004 to 27.7% in 2024, according to the NACS.

Lenard said the shift has changed public perception.

President Donald Trump may be the toughest president the nation has ever had on the matter of illegal immigration. He has certainly been more effective than any other leader in a generation. But, at the same time, he has always valued limited, skilled immigration. ‚ÄúI've always liked the visas,‚Äù Trump said of H-1B visas last December. ‚ÄúI have always been in favor of the visas. That's why we have them.‚Äù

But he has also criticized the way the visas are issued and to whom. At the first Republican primary debate, he said the visas were used ‚Äúfor the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.‚Äù He has promised to eliminate or reform the program, and he delivered on that promise with a major improvement this Monday.

‚ÄúThis program has been abused for too long,‚Äù the president said at the White House, ‚Äúdisplacing American workers and suppressing wages. It's time to fix it for our people.‚Äù

The executive order signed by Trump instructs the Department of Homeland Security to create a new $100,000 ‚Äúrestriction on entry‚Äù fee for each H-1B visa, a 10,000% increase from the current $10 registration fee.

First created in 1990, the H-1B visa was designed to help employers who could not find American workers to fill ‚Äúspecialty occupations,‚Äù defined as jobs that require at least a bachelor's degree or higher and a ‚Äútheoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge.‚Äù

Congress capped such visas at 65,000, with 20,000 more for positions that require a master's degree. These limits were expanded in the late 1990s and reduced again in the early 2000s. 

Employers always want more visas than are allowed and DHS has dealt with this by instituting a lottery. This is a bad system, making no distinction between the needs of a firm applying for an entry-level programmer and a hospital hoping to hire a specialized surgeon. Lottery applicants have had to pay $2,000-$5,000 up front for each application, but they get their money back if they don't win an H-1B visa.

This all changed in 2021 when DHS created a $10 registration fee for each applicant, massively cutting the price for each H-1B lottery ticket. Some firms responded by buying a lot more lottery tickets.

The worst offenders are so-called Business Process Outsourcing companies that help American firms outsource information technology, human resources, and claims processing services to cheap labor overseas. The BPOs need H-1Bs so they can have onsite employees here in the United States that manage cheap foreign workers abroad.

So not only are H-1Bs given to BPOs, taking away jobs from American workers, but they are also subsidizing an entire business model built on shipping American jobs overseas. When the H-1B $10 visa registration fee was created, these BPO firms flooded the system with applications, and since the lottery is based on chance, not merit or need, these same firms now get the lion's share of winning H-1B lottery tickets.

IF CALIFORNIA WON'T STOP LEFT-WING VIOLENCE, TRUMP WILL

The $100,000 entrance fee will end this abuse. Those who use H-1B visas to import cheap foreign labor will no longer be able to do so. Although the $100,000 is a one-time fee, and not a yearly one, only those firms that can produce a strong return with an H-1B employee will get a visa.

Trump's H-1B executive order is no silver bullet. It is a blunt instrument that will curtail flagrant abuses while letting American firms compete for the world's top talent. By raising the cost of entry, Trump has realigned the H-1B program with its original purpose, which was to meet genuine, high-skill needs rather than fueling outsourcing schemes. His reforms protect American workers, curb abuse, and reward employers committed to innovation and growth with global talent.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump's hints at bringing a new lawsuit against ABC appear to lack legal teeth, according to experts and recent judicial precedent.

Trump on Tuesday responded to Jimmy Kimmel's return to airwaves by alleging that the late-night host ‚Äúis yet another arm of the DNC‚Äù representing ‚Äúa major illegal Campaign Contribution.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do,‚Äù the president wrote on Truth Social. ‚ÄúLast time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative.‚Äù

Trump has leaned heavily on the courts during his second term to challenge media outlets, but as of Wednesday night, the president's legal team has not brought a new lawsuit against ABC, for predictable reasons, according to experts.

Brett Kappel, a campaign finance attorney with Harmon, Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg, told Forbes that Kimmel's on-air comments are ‚Äúclearly covered‚Äù as protected speech by the Federal Election Commission's media exemption and do not amount to campaign contributions, as Trump claimed.

While the FEC explicitly bars media corporations from directly contributing to campaigns, the media exemption specifically allows for broadcasting stations or periodical publications to publish ‚Äúany news story, commentary, or editorial‚Äù that may influence an election, as long as an involved candidate or political party does not own the station or publication.

Election law scholar Ned Foley similarly wrote in a Wednesday blog post that Trump's threat is ‚Äúincredibly alarming‚Äù on First Amendment and election law grounds. 

‚ÄúAccusing ABC of being an arm of the DNC and its content as being an illegal campaign contribution is the equivalent of accusing any media outlet of engaging in prohibited speech simply for engaging in political commentary,‚Äù he wrote, pointing to the FEC's media exemption. ‚ÄúThere is no credible claim, despite Trump's insinuation, that ABC is ‚Äòowned or controlled by' the Democratic National Committee, just as there would be no credible claim that The New York Times or any other liberal-leaning media outlet is.‚Äù

White House officials directed inquiries about a possible new lawsuit against ABC back to the president's Tuesday statement on Truth Social.

The Supreme Court previously ruled in 1963's Bantam Books v. Sullivan that government officials or bodies cannot leverage government authority to censor private parties.

‚ÄúPeople do not lightly disregard public officers' thinly veiled threats to institute criminal proceedings against them if they do not come around,‚Äù Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote at the time. ‚ÄúIt would be na√Øve to credit the state's assertion that these blacklists are in the nature of mere legal advice, when they plainly serve as instruments of regulation independent of the laws against obscenity.‚Äù

And the court itself reaffirmed Bantam Books last year, when the National Rifle Association, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union, claimed a New York state official had violated the First Amendment by pressuring companies to end their ties to the NRA in the wake of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

‚ÄúBantam Books stands for the principle that a government official cannot do indirectly what she is barred from doing directly: A government official cannot coerce a private party to punish or suppress disfavored speech on her behalf,‚Äù Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a unanimous opinion for the court.

Trump does have a long history of suing media companies, including a handful of successful lawsuits filed on the 2024 campaign trail and since entering office in January.

In December of last year, as referenced in Trump's Tuesday night statement responding to Kimmel's return, ABC settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos for $15 million.

Paramount settled a lawsuit with the president's legal team in July for $16 million regarding an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired ahead of the 2024 general election.

Though the White House technically lost a lawsuit brought by the Associated Press this spring, the president was still able to spin it as a win for his base by amending the way that all wire publications were included in the routine press pool rotations.

Still, a number of the president's legal fights with the media remain unresolved or have been thrown out of court.

Earlier in September, a federal judge threw out Trump's $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times, although the decision did give Trump's legal team a month to refile.

TRUMP CALLS FOR ARRESTS IN ‚ÄòTRIPLE SABOTAGE' INCIDENT AT UNITED NATIONS

And in July, the president brought a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and owner Rupert Murdoch regarding the paper's coverage of a letter, allegedly penned by Trump to disgraced financier and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, to be included in a book gifted to the latter for his 50th birthday.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The White House budget office is urging federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans if the government shuts down next week.

An Office of Management and Budget memo obtained by Punchbowl News on Wednesday detailed the administration's personnel plans for a shutdown, which go beyond the standard furloughs.

The memo asks agencies to find programs, projects, and activities, or PPAs, for which discretionary funding will lapse on Oct. 1, no alternative funding source is available, and the cuts are not consistent with ‚Äúthe president's priorities.‚Äù These cuts would be part of the standard reduction-in-force plans.

These PPAs would be permanently eliminated, turning the government shutdown into an opportunity for the Trump administration to further slim down the government. The OMB says programs ‚Äúthat did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown.‚Äù

The memo largely blames Democrats for any possible shutdown. Both parties have been at a standoff concerning how to fund the government. President Donald Trump recently refused a meeting with Democratic leaders, citing their alleged ‚Äúunserious and ridiculous demands.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, congressional Democrats are signaling that they intend to break this bipartisan trend and shut down the government in the coming days over a series of insane demands, including $1 trillion in new spending,‚Äù the memo says.

‚ÄúWe remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown, and the steps outlinedabove will not be necessary. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree,‚Äù the memo concludes.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries ripped OMB Director Russell Vought over the plans, calling him a ‚Äúmalignant political hack,‚Äù while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said of the plans, ‚ÄúThis is an attempt at intimidation. Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one‚Äînot to govern, but to scare.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today,‚Äù Schumer added.

Vought spearheaded the administration's initial government cuts.

An anonymous OMB official told Politico that programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and air traffic control will continue regardless of the shutdown.TRUMP TO TARGET ‚ÄòRADICAL-LEFT' GROUPS FUNDING VIOLENCE THAT LED TO CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH

Trump issued a statement Wednesday calling for the government to remain open and telling Democrats that the ball ‚Äúis in your court,‚Äù to which Schumer and Jeffries both responded on X, ‚ÄúWe're realistic about what the country needs so we're ready. When and where?‚Äù

Recruitment flyers featuring the words engraved on the bullet casings of the man who shot and killed Charlie Kirk were reportedly distributed and hung around Georgetown University‚Äòs campus. 

Advertisements for the ‚ÄúJohn Brown Club‚Äù used the words, ‚ÄúHey, fascist! Catch!‚Äù some of the very words engraved on bullet casings by alleged Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson. The circular included a QR code to scan for those interested in joining. It advertised the club as ‚Äúthe only political group that celebrates when Nazis die.‚Äù

Upon scanning the code, users are directed to a Google Docs sign-up page welcoming them to join the club. The page informs interested parties of the club's intentions before asking for email addresses. The greeting describing the club includes a misspelling of ‚Äúknow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're building a community that's done with ceremonial resistance and strongly worded letters. If you want to make a real change in your community, let us now [sic] below.‚Äù

Georgetown University officials removed the flyers later in the day. The ‚ÄúJohn Brown Club‚Äù does not appear to be officially associated with Georgetown University, as no club or organization by that name was listed among the existing undergraduate or graduate student clubs and organizations. 

The Washington Examiner emailed Georgetown University for clarification and comment about the posters and the ‚ÄúJohn Brown Club.‚Äù

John Brown was a 19th-century abolitionist in the United States. He first gained prominence during the violent clashes of the ‚ÄúBleeding Kansas‚Äù crisis in the 1850s between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in Kansas before it achieved statehood. Brown is particularly known for his roles in violent abolitionist efforts in the Pottawatomie massacre and the raid on Harpers Ferry, a federal arsenal in West Virginia. Brown was caught after the raid failed and was charged with treason. He was eventually executed for his actions. 

Education Secretary Linda McMahon criticized the posters in a post on X on Wednesday evening. She mentioned she spoke with university officials, who agreed to take them down. 

I am aware of the appalling posters that were displayed on Georgetown's campus today. At a moment like this, Georgetown has to determine what it stands for as an institution. ED officials have spoken to Georgetown administrators, who made the decision to remove the flyers.‚Ä¶

Allowing violent rhetoric to fester on our nation's campuses without consequences is dangerous. It must be condemned by institutional leaders,‚Äù McMahon said.

Trump administration officials and Republicans are pointing the finger at Democrats as having incited violence against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.

The latest in a string of physical attacks against federal immigration officers this year occurred on Wednesday at an ICE field office in Dallas, where a gunman whose rounds espoused an ‚Äúanti-ICE‚Äù sentiment opened fire and killed one detainee while critically wounding two others.

The attack came two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a university in Utah.

Republicans are now seeking to draw a direct correlation between the threats and claims that Democratic politicians and far-left leaders have made against ICE and the increase in political violence.

Vice President JD Vance spoke about the incident in Concord, North Carolina, and said evidence not yet made public confirmed that the shooter was ‚Äúpolitically motivated to go after people who are enforcing our border.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere's what happens when Democrats like Gavin Newsom say that these people are part of an authoritarian government, when the left-wing media lies about what they're doing, when they lie about who they are arresting, when they lie about the actual job of law enforcement ‚Äî what they are doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence,‚Äù Vance added. ‚ÄúYou don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell.‚Äù

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees ICE, blamed the attack on ‚Äúhatred‚Äù for ICE preached by politicians in the Democratic Party.

‚ÄúFor months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,‚Äù Noem said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.‚Äù

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also blamed Democrats' ‚Äúdemonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe.‚Äù

Democrats must stop demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe. pic.twitter.com/GsqWiXvnRu

The National Republican Congressional Committee said the violence seen on Wednesday was ‚Äúthe direct result of Democrats' long pattern of dangerous anti-ICE rhetoric, consistently putting criminal illegal immigrants first and demonizing law enforcement.‚Äù

Last month, the same ICE field office received a bomb threat from a man identified as Bratton Dean Wilkinson. Wilkinson allegedly showed up at the entrance to the building and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack, prompting the facility to go on lockdown as the SWAT team responded.

A dozen individuals who showed up in tactical gear carrying weapons at ICE's detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, in early July have been charged with attempting to ambush the building and shooting a local police officer.

On July 4, rioters assaulted federal agents at an ICE facility in Portland and targeted them with an ‚Äúincendiary device.‚Äù

Back in May, a city council member in Worcester, Massachusetts, helped to incite a mob into attacking ICE officers and local police as they attempted to make an arrest. A Massachusetts police union called on Etel Haxhiaj to face federal charges for organizing the violence.

Many incidents of sitting Democratic members of Congress comparing ICE to Nazis and the Gestapo have been made on social media and in public settings since the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown commenced in January.

Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-CA) shared an ICE officer's personal information with protesters. Officers cover their faces and names for personal safety, given the doxing and stalking incidents they have seen from those who oppose the agency's work.

Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (R-NJ), attempted to break past the fence into an ICE facility in New Jersey earlier this spring. McIver was arrested on charges of assaulting a federal officer while attempting to enter. McIver was indicted on federal charges in June and faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said ICE was comparable to ‚Äúsome 1800s bank robber or some KGB officer in Russia.‚Äù

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Congressional Hispanic Caucus chairman, said in July that the Trump administration's refusal to facilitate the visitations was a ‚Äúthreat to our democracy.‚Äù

Over the weekend, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law meant to curtail ICE from carrying out as many arrests throughout the state on the basis that Trump's immigration raids were ‚Äúlawless.‚Äù

Other laws included policies barring ICE from accessing schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and requiring schools, colleges, and universities to alert parents when ICE is on campus.

One such law, SB 627, made it illegal for local police and sheriff's department employees, federal police, and state police from states other than California to wear face masks while working. California state police were exempt from the face mask ban.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has previously threatened to unmask ICE agents, even comparing their operations to ‚Äúthe Soviet Union.‚Äù

On Wednesday afternoon, Jeffries joined House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (D-TX) to issue a statement that called the Dallas shooting ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù and went on to thank police who responded.

‚ÄúNo one in America should be violently targeted, including our men and women in law enforcement who protect and serve our neighborhoods, and the immigrants who are too often the victims of dehumanizing rhetoric,‚Äù the three House Democrats said in a joint statement, before blaming Trump for the violence. ‚ÄúThe political and ideologically-motivated violence in America has reached a breaking point this year. We need leaders who bring the country together in moments of crisis ‚Äì and that is what is required right now.‚Äù

ROUNDS FOUND NEAR DALLAS SHOOTING SUSPECT HAD ‚ÄòANTI-ICE' MESSAGE: FBI

Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin also followed suit and thanked police ‚Äúwho ran toward danger‚Äù before adding that the violence was not one-sided.

‚ÄúIt will take all of us ‚Äî not just one side of the aisle or the other ‚Äî to quell this epidemic of violence, which has no place in our democracy,‚Äù Martin said in a statement. ‚ÄúDemocrats remain committed to resolving differences through debate and elections, not with weapons. We also remain committed to enacting commonsense solutions to curb gun violence all across our country.‚Äù","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Violet Affleck, the 19-year-old daughter of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, took the stage at the United Nations this week, calling for urgent action on clean air, pandemic protections, and broader social justice issues.

Speaking at the ‚ÄúHealthy Indoor Air: A Global Call to Action‚Äù event in New York, the Yale freshman framed her generation as one already living with the failures of global leadership.

‚ÄúI represent a generation that in many ways already knows how we've been failed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are no strangers to protesting injustice. This summer alone has seen youth uprisings in Nepal, Angola, and Indonesia, to say nothing of ongoing youth mobilization worldwide for a free Palestine. And wherever we live, we've grown up in the shadow of the climate crisis with the threats, sacrifices, and scarcities that [it] will entail, looming over us.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúWe know what that means for our lives in no small part, thanks to the people in this room. And we are told by leaders across the board that we are the future. But when it comes to the ongoing pandemic, our present is being stolen right in front of our eyes.‚Äù

Affleck, who wore a face mask while delivering her remarks, then shifted her focus to COVID-19 and long-term health concerns.

‚ÄúHere's what we know about SARS-CoV-2. It is airborne floating and lingering in the air. One infection can result in disabling damage to almost every cell in the body from the brain and heart to the nerves and blood vessels,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery subsequent infection increases the risk of long COVID and places people who already have it in greater danger.‚Äù

She described her fears for children facing a lifetime of post-viral illness.

‚ÄúI am terrified for the children who do not, or soon will not, know a world without debilitating pain and exhaustion,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I am furious on their behalf. It is neglect of the highest order to look children in the eyes and say, ‚Äòwe knew how to protect you and we didn't do it.'‚Äù

The 19-year-old urged the international community to treat clean indoor air as a basic right, comparing it to the historic fight against indoor smoking. 

‚ÄúWe can recognize filtered air as a human right, as intuitively as we do filtered water,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe can create clean air infrastructure that is so ubiquitous and so obviously necessary, tomorrow's children don't even know why we need it.‚Äù

Affleck closed by urging older generations to keep their promises made during the height of the pandemic. 

‚ÄúWe need the people who remember 2020, who were not like me, 14 in 2020, to be loud about the world that we were promised at the onset of the pandemic ‚Ä¶ And we need the people who are born now, we owe it to the people who are born now, that they take that world for granted.‚Äù

Her remarks quickly drew strong responses online.

‚ÄúThe U.N. is an increasingly unserious place. Why are they just letting rich nepo babies get up there and rant with masks on?‚Äù influencer Link Lauren asked.

‚ÄúWhat the hell did those two do to their daughter,‚Äù Newsmax host Rob Schmitt said on X.

‚ÄúBen Affleck's daughter needs an immediate Psychiatric Evaluation. She has been wearing a mask for 5 YEARS,‚Äù another user claimed.

‚ÄúCan celebrities have normal children?‚Äù one commenter asked.

‚ÄúWhy is an Affleck child speaking at the UN? Why would she get to speak anywhere??‚Äù Jennifer Sey, former Levi's executive and gymnast, asked on X.

‚ÄúHey @BenAffleck, come get your kid,‚Äù another person posted.

‚ÄúHer speech just gave me the strength to keep the work going,‚Äù an X user cheered her on.

This is not Violet Affleck's first time making headlines with her activism. In 2023, she was spotted wearing a watermelon ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù sweatshirt, widely recognized as a pro-Palestinian symbol. Wear The Peace sells the garment, and the proceeds go to Gaza aid efforts.

In 2024, she testified before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, demanding expanded access to masks, ventilation improvements in government buildings, and opposition to mask bans.

Her mother, actress Jennifer Garner, has also waded into politics and activism. She campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race and supported Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Garner has also publicly celebrated Pride Month, wrapping rainbow-colored decorations around her yard trees, and was photographed in June 2024 drumming alongside activists wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh.

A vision of public schools by conservatives, for conservatives. The second episode in a two-part series.

For a guy in charge of local schools, Oklahoma State Superintendent Ryan Walters generates an unusual amount of national news. This week, Walters announced a plan to create chapters of Turning Point USA, the conservative organization co-founded by Charlie Kirk, at every Oklahoma high school. Earlier this month, Walters had ordered a moment of silence in honor of the death of Kirk at all Oklahoma public schools, and now the State Department of Education says it's investigating claims that some districts did not comply. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who had previously appointed Walters as his secretary of education, once accused Walters of ‚Äúusing kids as political pawns.‚Äù State Democrats have called for an impeachment probe, and some Republicans have signed their own letter asking for an investigation of Walters. Parents, teachers, and religious leaders have sued Walters, the State Department of Education, and the State Board of Education for injecting religion into schools. And this past summer, two school-board members reported that they saw nude women on a television in his office during a board meeting. (Investigators concluded that the incident merely involved an R-rated movie randomly playing on a preprogrammed channel.) In the meantime, Oklahoma schools are ranked near the bottom for reading and math scores on the Nation's Report Card.

In the second episode of a two-part series on Oklahoma schools, we talk to Walters about what he's trying to accomplish in Oklahoma schools. We ask about the ideological purity test he's announced for teachers coming from ‚Äúplaces like California and New York.‚Äù We ask about his push for changes to the curriculum, including a requirement that high-school history students ‚Äúidentify discrepancies in 2020 elections results.‚Äù We ask about the television incident. And we hear from two Oklahoma teachers who have taken very different paths in the face of changes under way in their state. You can listen to Episode 1 of the series here.

Note: Hours before this audio episode was published, Ryan Walters announced live on Fox News that he would resign as state superintendent with more than a year left in his term. Walters said he would be taking a position in the private sector as CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance (TFA), a nonprofit that describes itself as an alternative to teachers' unions. TFA is a partner organization of the Freedom Foundation, a far-right think tank. Walters's campaign manager and senior adviser told the Oklahoma Voice that Walters expects to step down in early October.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Ryan Walters (from KOKH Fox 25): Pornography. Pornography should not be in our schools. No parent should send their child to school and their child have access to graphic pornography.

[Music]

Hanna Rosin: In our first episode about Oklahoma public schools, we talked about the rise of State Superintendent Ryan Walters and all the changes he's making. In this year's new curriculum, he added dozens of references to Christianity, an instruction to high-school history students to identify discrepancies in the 2020 election‚Äîalthough those standards have just been paused for now by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Walters announced an ideological purity test for some teachers coming in from out of state. And he tried to make sure that certain books were not on the shelves.

Walters (from Fox News): Hey, when we send our kids to school, we are not expecting them to be able to check out a book from the library that's got explicit pornography in it. And unfortunately, this is a tactic we've seen of the far left.

Rosin: We also talked to a pair of former students of Coach Walters‚Äîthat's what they called him‚Äîwho described him as an exceedingly cool history teacher. A secret Democrat, one of them had guessed.

Starla Edge: His whole thing about wokeism, I truly don't understand, because he was woke. He was woke!

Rosin: So we went to Oklahoma City to interview Walters and try to square the circle.

[Music]

Rosin: I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. In this second of a two-part series about Oklahoma public education, an interview with Walters about what he's up to. Also about that weird scandal we mentioned at the end of the first episode, where two State Board of Education members said they saw naked women on a TV in Walters's office.

Turns out that it wasn't really a scandal, but the way Walters handled it revealed maybe a bigger problem for Oklahoma public schools‚Äîthe actual thing we should be calling the scandal. We'll get into it later.

Ryan Walters: How are y'all doin'?

Rosin: Hey, how are you?

Walters: Ryan Walters.

Rosin: Nice to meet you.

Walters: Nice to meet you.

Jinae West: Hi. Jinae.

Walters: Jinae, very nice to meet you.

West: Nice to meet you.

Walters: Oh, man, that's a nice-looking microphone right here. Is this my coffee‚Äî

Rosin: Arriving at Ryan Walters's office earlier this summer was not like arriving at the office of a guy who's in charge of a state school system. We were greeted by two staff members who had come from other states to work for him.

Walters has a reputation in young conservative circles as an exciting person to work for‚Äîsomeone who was going places. He'd already teased that he was considering a run for the governor of Oklahoma.

And despite being at the center of an awkward scandal at the very moment we arrived, Walters's energy when he greeted us was the opposite of awkward.

Walters: I am a, like, easily a pot and a half of coffee a day.

Rosin: Pot?

Walters: Oh, yeah. ‚ÄäI do have my‚Äî

Rosin: Pot?

Walters: ‚Äîblood pressure checked.

Rosin: (Laughs.) Pot.

Walters: That goes back to my teaching days. I would set it every morning. When I rolled in at 6:30, it was premade there, room smelled like coffee. My kids would come in for tutoring before school, and they'd go, It already smells like coffee. I'm going, It's already made, guys. It's ready to go.

Rosin: Speaking of Walters's teaching days, I started by asking about his time as a history teacher. He said he doesn't think he's changed since then, so I was trying to figure out: Did he just have different rules back then? Like, he used to not think it was ok to talk about Bibles in class, but then he changed his mind?

Rosin: Being a Christian and a teacher, how did you manage that in public school? Did you have rules for yourself? There are things I can mention and can't mention. I'm not gonna talk about the Bible. I'm not gonna talk about my own faith. What were the lines that you drew as a teacher?

Walters: Yeah, great question. So I taught history and government. So one of the things I always tried to make sure that the kids knew is, first of all, I didn't ever‚Äîmy kids, it was always an ongoing debate of: What is he? What is his political beliefs? And I would always tell 'em: I'm not gonna talk about mine here in school. I'm not gonna talk about those things. I'm gonna tell you: ‚ÄúThis is what some folks believe. Here's what other folks believe. Here's the sources. Sort through it, and figure it out for yourself.‚Äù

Now, look, hey, we had a Bible in the classroom. We talked about the role the Bible played in American history. It was always done in an academic setting. It was always done in its historical context. I wasn't pushing religion on the kids. I wasn't pushing a political belief.

And, like I said, the kids always, you know, they'd: Who'd you vote for? Who'd‚Äî And I'd go, Guys, I don't care to‚ÄîI'm not trying to keep it from you; I mean, I'll talk about it somewhere else. You'll know if your parents talk to me out at a restaurant or something. I don't mind that. But when we're here, I'm talking about academics. We're gonna talk about, ‚ÄúA lot of people believe different things,‚Äù and I want you guys to hear all of that, and you guys come to your own conclusion.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. And why? Why was it important not to talk about things in the classroom?

Walters: Well, now, I will say we talked about things, now, and I‚Äî

Rosin: Not to talk about your own personal belief?

Walters: I just felt like that was incredibly important when you're talking about: Hey, we'll talk about every political issue; we'll talk about all of it. But I wanted them to know: You're gonna get all sides. You're not gonna have a teacher that's gonna come in and go, ‚ÄúThis is the side you should believe.‚Äù My beliefs are separate from this. You're gonna come in, I'm gonna give you the best education I can, and I wanna see you come to your own conclusion.

[Music]

Rosin: ‚ÄúPeople believe different things.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're gonna get all sides.‚Äù That is a very open-minded approach‚Äîwhich does not at all square with what he's done as superintendent.

In an interview once, Walters said: ‚ÄúIf you're going to come into our state, don't come in with these blue-state values.‚Äù And then right before this school year started, he announced he would administer a kind of purity test to some new teachers coming from out of state.

‚ÄúOklahoma's schools,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwill not be a haven for woke agendas pushed in places like California and New York. If you want to teach here, you'd better know the Constitution, respect what makes America great, and understand basic biology.‚Äù

Rosin: So you recently talked about‚Äîyou called it either an ideology test or a certification test. What's the purpose of something like that?

Walters: Right, yeah, absolutely. So the purpose is‚Äîlisten, you know, it's not complicated for us here in Oklahoma. There's two genders: There's male, and there's female. There's not 27. There's not gender fluidity. That's not something that we want left-wing activists pushing on our kids.

So when I see a state like California come out and say, Now, actually, every teacher, we're gonna teach it that way. That's gonna be a demand, came from the governor himself. That's what we're gonna teach. Okay, well, our standards say otherwise.

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Walters: So if you're gonna come into our state and teach‚Äîand we are recruiting heavily. I've recruited more teachers to our state than ever before in history. We had the biggest signing bonuses in the country to bring teachers here. We put teachers on a path to merit pay, where they can make six figures in the classroom, got a thousand teachers on track for that.

So we are very excited to have the top educators in the country right here in Oklahoma, but we are absolutely not gonna take left-wing activists who have been indoctrinated themselves by a radical state like California. So, listen, you gotta know the difference between male and female. You gotta agree that you're gonna teach that in our standards. And we're just gonna make sure that we're not gonna invite that into the state of Oklahoma.

Rosin: So if Walters thought that way about gender, how was he gonna handle sexuality?

Rosin: Now, ‚ÄäI'm gonna ask in a pretty simple way: Let's say I'm a gay parent, and I don't have any particular ideology. I'm a parent. I'm married to a same-gender person.

Walters: Sure.

Rosin: I have a child in the schools. Am I welcome in Oklahoma schools?

Walters: Absolutely. Every child of every background, every parent of every background is welcome in Oklahoma schools. Our goal is to give every single child the best education possible. It doesn't matter your political leanings, doesn't matter your views on anything. It doesn't matter‚Äîwe want you to have the best education possible. That is, you know, we want every kid to feel welcome. We want every kid to be supported. We want every single child to succeed.

Rosin: But do you understand how a parent wouldn't feel that way if you, the state superintendent of education, saying, We want people with red-state values in our public schools? Do you see how a parent would feel unwelcome in a school like that?

Walters: No, I don't. We've been very clear of what the vision is. The vision is‚Äî everyone should agree on this. And I do. And I get people all across the political spectrum‚ÄîI had Democrats grabbing me all the time on the campaign trail. They may not agree with school choice. They might not agree with everything. But they go, You're a hundred percent right. We should get schools back to teaching the basics. We should all be able to agree on that.

And it is unfortunate that we've got one party that says‚Äîthe Democrats have said, Schools are a weapon to be used to push our ideology on kids. They have a political agenda. Our goal is to take that political agenda out. That is what red states, that's what red governors have been doing. And that's what we've been leading the charge on, to say, No, this is the vision. Everybody should be able to agree on this, frankly.

Rosin: So in your view, it's exclusively the left that has politicized the schools?

Walters: Absolutely. Absolutely.

Rosin: ‚ÄäInteresting. I mean, there was a whole period of when there was a Republican agenda to take over state school boards and think about schools‚Äî

Walters: Sure.

Rosin: ‚Äîbut to you, that was all responsive, the way you think of it?

Walters: Absolutely. The teachers' unions have run our schools, the federal Department of Education have run our schools since 1979. They've weaponized the federal government to push an agenda. And listen to the Republican position‚Äîit has been: Get back to the basics. Get back to teaching a love of the country's values.

It's always with a critical eye. It's always a Hey, we want you to do a deep dive into everything. Again, you notice everything‚Äîif you look through our standards, we added more about what happened to the Native Americans. We added more about the Tulsa Race Massacre. Hey, we want kids to know the times we didn't live up to our values. That's very, very important. And frankly, as a history teacher, you learn from American greatness and those exceptional times throughout our history; you also have to look at the times we didn't live up to those things, and you have to look at that with an honest eye‚Äî

Rosin: And you mean that sincerely?

Walters: Yeah, I mean, absolutely‚Äî

Rosin: That is not, to you, a kind of stain on American exceptionalism?

Walters: Well, what do you mean by that?

Rosin: I just mean, this is the heart of the controversy, sort of how you teach about America‚Äî

Walters: Yeah.

Rosin: ‚Äîwhat America's founding was.

Walters: Sure.

Rosin: It's a very varied view. It's a very varied view.

Walters: Well, yeah, let me address that. So we live in the greatest country in the history of the world.

Rosin: That's also a specific view.

Walters: It is. But, I mean, if you're‚Äî

Rosin: Like, if you're teaching world history and you're teaching many countries' perspectives‚Äî

Walters: Yeah, but if you‚ÄîI mean, look, as [Benjamin] Franklin said, This is a republic, if we can keep it. And part of the central goal of our education system is to keep the republic, keep an informed citizenry that understands American history, understands American exceptionalism, and understands that if we're not actively involved as citizens, if we don't understand our history, if we don't understand those values‚ÄîI mean, history, also, to your point, when you look at world history, we know what happens when countries don't abide by some central values, central principles: that it won't be good for the next generations. And that's part of what I believe is so important when you talk about education holistically but, specifically, history in education.

[Music]

‚ÄäRosin: So do you even think of yourself as controversial? Do you understand why people describe you that way? Because you are controversial, but you seem to‚Äî

Walters: Yeah.

Rosin: ‚Äîthink of yourself as neutral.

Walters: Look‚Äîhere's what‚ÄîI don't, you know‚Äî

Rosin: Like, a person in your position doesn't often have enemies and backers and allies and detractors. I mean, are you‚Äî

Walters: Yeah, sure.

Rosin: Yeah.

Walters: But what I will say is, look, I'm unapologetic. The teachers' unions have been one of the most negative forces in recent American history. I've never seen anything like it‚Äîthe ideology they've pushed on kids. It's unfathomable to me that they did that.

So, yeah, I went to war with a group that has an unlimited amount of money, nearly an unlimited amount of political power, that had bought off so many elected officials, that have bought off so many different interest groups. And we took on an education establishment of administrators, school-board associations, teachers' unions.

I mean, it doesn't surprise me. I think it's unfortunate that the left has become so radicalized, but it doesn't surprise me.

Rosin: There are a lot of parents who came to feel the same way Walters does about schools. The so-called parents' rights movement has exploded since the pandemic. Their origin story goes something like this: During the pandemic, when our kids were doing school from home, we discovered some of the stuff they were learning, and we were outraged.

Now, conservatives were talking about taking over school boards back in the '90s, but the more recent parents rights' movement rocketed their momentum. And it wasn't just Christian conservatives in red states.

In a recent Supreme Court case, the court sided with Maryland parents who wanted to opt out of LGBTQ lesson plans that included books that were similar to the ones Walters complains about: books that mention gay or trans kids. And that was led by Muslim, Catholic, Orthodox Christian, and Jewish parents in a school system with a large immigrant population about 20 minutes from where I live in D.C.

So the parents who don't want what Walters calls the ‚Äúradical gender ideology‚Äù pushed on their kids are everywhere‚Äîand they're winning. The difference is: Walters is not just a parent. He runs an entire school system. And his vision is a radical rewriting of what public school in America is and has been for decades.

Rosin: I mean, there is an idea, totally apart from this warfare that you're describing, that public schools are an engine of American democracy precisely because they are a place where people who believe wildly different things‚Äîpeople who are atheists and don't believe in God at all‚Äî

Walters: Sure, sure.

Rosin: ‚Äîand people who are evangelical Christians and go to church every day, and people who are Muslims, and people who are Jewish, and people who are gay, and all these different things‚Äîare in school together. And that is the teaching ground. Do you not believe that? I mean, is that not an important value for you?

Walters: It is. Everything‚Äîis there anything I've said today that would go counter to that? Because again‚Äî

Rosin: Oh, yeah. Yes.

Walters: ‚Äîwhat I would say is‚Äîyou think there is?

Rosin: Absolutely.

Walters: How?

Rosin: Absolutely. Absolutely. Because you define what sounds to me like a specific view as the only view, as the universal view: There's a universal view. I mean, our Founding Fathers were influenced by lots of different ideas.

Walters: Sure.

Rosin: Some of them were Christian; some of them were deist. It just seems as if you're defining a pretty specific idea as an idea for everybody‚Äîlike saying that we wanna welcome people with red-state values to our school, that seems specific. That seems exclusive.

Walters: And I've defined those values for you. The values are: We're going to teach the basics. We're gonna teach academics. We're not going to have this left-wing agenda forced on our kids. It doesn't matter what your beliefs are. You walk into a school; you teach kids this‚Äîwe should all be able to agree on that.

Rosin: ‚ÄäYou recently added‚Äîthis might be your most controversial thing‚Äîthat students should be taught about discrepancies in the 2020 election results. Why did you decide to add that?

Walters: How do you teach about the 2020 election without that? I mean, notice how the standard was written. They're gonna look at graphs, data charts, everything else, show‚Äîlook, there were discrepancies. You had more people vote in that election than ever before, and then they went away. What's the reason for that?

Kids are gonna come to their own conclusion. We're gonna talk about COVID. We're gonna talk about mail-in ballots. They're gonna look at the data. They're gonna look at the statistics. They can draw their own conclusion on what happened with that election. But you're not gonna go teach 2020, one of the most controversial, the most controversial election in American history, and pretend like, Oh, there was no controversy. There was nothing about‚Äîwe teach the 2000 election very similarly; we teach the 1824 election very similarly.

Rosin: However, you didn't say, ‚ÄúIdentify if there were discrepancies.‚Äù That seems to me like that would be open-ended questions. You said, ‚ÄúIdentify discrepancies in election results.‚Äù

Walters: Yeah.

Rosin: That is not universally agreed upon by American courts. That's a specific political position.

Walters: No, no, that's a fact. More people voted, and trends were dramatically different in that election. Now, there's a lot of explanations for that that people can give. We never had an election with dramatic changes in mail-in ballots. Okay, well, that's something to look into, right? Why were there so many mail-in ballots? COVID. Election strategies changed on that. Of course they did, right? Now you can get people to mail in their ballots, so the deep dive is into the discrepancies on the vote totals in that election. Kids are gonna come to their own conclusion. That's why we were very particular with that of: Give 'em the sources‚Äîlet them study that.

Rosin: So if a kid concludes there were no discrepancies, does that kid fail? Is that kid wrong?

Walters: (Laughs.) If a kid‚Äîokay, so kids are going to see the election totals, the vote totals. They're gonna look at the numbers. They're gonna look at the comparisons between others. That's what they're gonna be sure to study so that they understand it was a unique election. There is absolute‚Äîthat's undeniable. It was a unique election with the‚Äî

Rosin: It's denied by many, many courts.

Walters: That it was a unique election? That we've never‚Äî

Rosin: Oh, that it was unique‚Äî

Walters: Yeah.

Rosin: ‚Äîbut we could say, ‚ÄúTalk about how the 2020 election was unique.‚Äù That's different.

Walters: Well, what does that mean?

Rosin: Oh, that can mean‚Äîthat's a very open-ended question.

Walters: That's right. Our standards are there so that parents are ensured: ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What are we learning about?‚Äù They're gonna learn about the vote totals. They're gonna learn about bellwether states. They're gonna learn about the amount of people that voted. They're gonna learn about the amount of mail-in ballots. And they're gonna come to their own conclusions on that.

[Music]

Rosin: By the way, just weeks into the start of the school year, the Oklahoma Supreme Court issued a temporary stay, pausing Walters's new standards as the court considers a lawsuit challenging them.

Okay, back to the interview. When the press secretary chimed in to say we had only eight minutes left, I finally had to address the elephant in the room.

Rosin: ‚ÄäOkay, so I'm gonna ask you about the news.

Walters: Sure.

Rosin: There were board members who say they saw the nude pictures on TV during the board meeting.

Rosin: It would have been truly perfect justice: a politician who endlessly complains about porn caught up in a porn scandal. But it turned out to be trifling. After an investigation, the Oklahoma House speaker concluded that the naked women the board members said they saw were likely from a newly installed TV randomly playing a preprogrammed channel‚Äîmore specifically, the 1985 R-rated film The Protector, starring Jackie Chan, which has a 44 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Trailer (for the movie The Protector): He's a cop with his own way of enforcing the law.

Rosin: We know that now. We did not, however, know any of this at the time we were in his office. Back then, Walters could have said he himself was confused, that it was a new TV, or ‚Äúno comment.‚Äù Instead, the day we interviewed him, he chose this path.

Walters: Yeah, they're outrageous liars. ‚ÄäAnd we're about to be able to show that; we just had two independent investigations to show that. So it shows you the lengths at which they will go.

Rosin: They, meaning two board members who said they saw the naked women on the TV, both of whom were appointed by Republican Governor Kevin Stitt, who's recently been at odds with Walters. So preexisting beef.

Walters: ‚ÄäThis whole concoction was done to try to stop a board meeting where we were approving a new private school that has American values that they tried to stop in the board meeting. They then tried to hijack the board. They tried to hijack the agenda, the vote, everything else. It became this huge disruption. And then they concocted this, to come up with it the next day, to try to further disrupt the work we're doing here.

Rosin: So, wait, you're saying there was no pornography on the TV. Or just that you don't know how it got there?

Walters: It was on a cable TV channel.

Rosin: And it was just randomly‚Äî

Walters: It was on a cable TV channel, and that is verifiable.

Rosin: Now, all evidence suggests that there were actually nude women on the TV. It was a comedy of errors. But because local schools are the latest live battlefield in our ongoing civil war, we got flamer language, investigations, and a fight over nothing. And at the first state school-board meeting since all this happened, back in late July, Walters was a no-show.

But you know what? There was actually something kind of scandalous that happened on that day. And it had nothing to do with nude women.

Walters was there advocating for this private school he mentions, the one he says has ‚ÄúAmerican values‚Äù‚Äîthat, by the way, has a partnership with PragerU, the same media organization that helped develop Oklahoma's purity test for teachers.

Why is the state superintendent, who is the leader of public schools, advocating for some online private school?

[Music]

Rosin: If all this noise gets in the way of whatever is needed to make Oklahoma schools better‚Äîbecause, remember, they're still ranked near the bottom of America's schools. If it makes it harder for Oklahoma teachers to do their jobs, then that's the real scandal.

Coming up, we'll hear from one of those teachers.

Michael: Honestly, I think the debate just comes down to: Is me compromising, in my view, certain levels of my integrity a couple of times a year worth doing the job that I love?

Rosin: That's after the break.

[Break]

Rosin: Every school year, there's something new for teachers to master: new faces, new names, new textbooks. This year, perhaps the most notable were the changes in the curriculum. And in the summer, when we visited, which was before the court had issued its temporary stay, teachers were working out how exactly they would talk about them.

Michael: ‚ÄäThese are the ones that were added in by Ryan Walters, were: ‚ÄúIdentify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of ‚Äòbellwether county' trends.‚Äù

And then the other one is: ‚ÄúIdentify the source of the COVID-19 pandemic from a Chinese lab and the economic and social effects of state and local lockdowns.‚Äù

Rosin: Ooh, that's real specific, both of those.

Michael: Yeah, yeah. They are‚ÄîI mean, correct me if I'm wrong‚Äîthey are the things that the MyPillow guy talks about.

Rosin: Or at least some of the things he talks about. Anyway, this is Michael, a social-studies teacher at a public high school in Oklahoma. We're only identifying him by his first name because he loves teaching, and he wants to keep his job. And that's the problem.

Remember Summer Boismier, the teacher from Episode 1 who put up a QR code to the Brooklyn Public Library? Like Boismier, Michael was also concerned when the state started auditing books in the classroom a few years ago. But whereas Boismier resigned and ultimately had her teaching license revoked, Michael chose to bite his tongue and stay.

Michael: ‚ÄäI was definitely stressed about it. It's one of those things where I didn't wanna be sensational or overly dramatic, but the conversations I was having with certain colleagues were like, I mean, this is the first step. This is a slippery slope. We start doing things like this, then what's to stop them from pushing further?

These standards and things that we're talking about in Oklahoma, they were really worried about this ‚Äúwoke left-wing indoctrination‚Äù of America's children, and it's one of those things that it's like, okay, sure, you could maybe point to a couple of places that that might be happening. None of them are gonna be in the state of Oklahoma. Every county has voted red for every presidential election since '08. That thing's not happening here.

Rosin: In 2016, Michael was teaching at a mostly Latino school. After Donald Trump won his first presidential election, Michael says he could feel that his students were suddenly more wary of him. So Michael decided to say this: I would never vote for something that would bring harm to you. Which, he said, put them at ease.

Michael: ‚ÄäI felt okay being human in that moment, right, where these are kids who are sad and confused and angry and already don't like going to school, and the first person they see is someone who looks like me, who statistically, on paper, voted for this guy.

Rosin: Looking back, maybe it was a little risky to hint at his personal beliefs. But he did it back then because he is a real hustler when it comes to connecting with students. But given everything that's been going on in Oklahoma these days, Michael says he would never say anything like that now.

(Music plays.)

Michael: There you go. (Laughs.)

Rosin: Thanks. This is your class?

Michael: This is my classroom, yup.

Rosin: Will you give us a little tour‚Äî

Rosin: Towards the end of the summer, we meet up with Michael in his classroom, where he's busy setting up: moving around desks, putting up posters. There are flags for sports teams, flags from every nation, quotes from pop stars, drawings from former students, and right near his desk is a wall of famous figures from history, each with a quote‚Äîpretty standard fare for a high-school history class. But here? Possibly dangerous.

Michael: ‚ÄäI feel like having anybody who's too involved with the civil-rights movement right now is also something I gotta worry about, even though I shouldn't have to be, everything like that. I have a friend who gave me a framed poster of a quote from John Lewis as well, and I worry about bringing that and hanging that up, kind of a thing. I just worry about getting pegged as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù or something like that. (Laughs.)

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Michael: Just for having certain decorations and things, so.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. Is there anything that you didn't put up because you thought, Oh, don't risk it?

Michael: Not yet. Like I said, I'm still debating about bringing that John Lewis one up 'cause it's really big, and it's about, oh, you know, in times of‚ÄîIf you see something that's not right‚Äîit's actually the quote that's over there. That's a smaller version of it there.

Rosin: Oh, can we read it?

Michael: Yeah.

All right: ‚ÄúWhen you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up. You have to say something; you have to do something.‚Äù

[Music]

Rosin: ‚ÄäOkay. So let's say that you were faced with a situation where, maybe, a student brings it up‚Äîlike, COVID comes up or the 2020 election comes up. How would you actually go about this? How would you handle this as a teacher?

Michael: I would say, ‚ÄúThe state standards say that this is the case, and that's what the state standards say.‚Äù And if they‚Äî

Rosin: You would? That's how you would do it?

Michael: I feel like I would try to convey, yes, that this is what‚ÄîI would say, ‚ÄúI'm required by law to tell you that this is what this says,‚Äù and then just kind of leave it at that. 'Cause if I hesitate, if I say, at least in the point I'm in right now‚Äîlike I said, I'm still kind of probationary, so one slipup means I can lose my job. Once I get career or tenure, I'll be good. But I think this next year, if something like that comes up, that's gonna be how I have to handle it. And again, I'm being muzzled and hamstrung in kind of doing this, but‚Äîand, I mean, I'll lose sleep over it‚Äîbut this is what I gotta do to keep doing what I wanna do, even if it goes against everything I feel.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. So how does that feel?

Michael: Awful.

Rosin: Yeah.

Michael: Yeah. I mean, just really stressful. And I don't know, I pride myself on being an honest person. I pride myself on being transparent and not really lying and definitely all kinda stuff, and this feels like a cop-out. And it feels‚Äîit is. It doesn't‚Äîsorry, it doesn't feel like it; it is. And that feels bad. And, at a certain point, I'm going to have to have the conversation with myself: Is that worth it?

Rosin: ‚ÄäDo you think you have‚ÄîI mean, it sounds like you're really thinking about this, and you've made your compromise for the moment. Do you have a line or a rule for yourself where it's like, Michael, you can't do this anymore. Have you ever, in your head, played out a scenario where, like, This and no more?

Michael: I try not to 'cause I know there's going to be‚ÄîI think it's only a matter of time until there is going to be something. I genuinely think that might be, if I find myself saying this too many times, I feel like that's gotta be it for me.

Summer Boismier: Hi.

Rosin: Hi.

West: Hi.

Boismier: Come on in.

West: This is Hanna.

Boismier: Nice to meet you.

Rosin: I'm Hanna.

Boismier: Nice to meet you. Hi, Hanna.

West: Hi. Jinae.

Boismier: Hi, Jinae.

West: Nice to meet you.

Boismier: Nice to meet you as well.

Rosin: In case you missed the first episode in our Oklahoma education series, Summer Boismier was a high-school teacher who, unlike Michael, made the decision to quit rather than censor herself. And, as a result, it's a couple of weeks before school starts, and Boismier has nothing to do and nowhere to be. Summer Boismier is stuck in eternal summer.

After the State Board of Education voted to revoke her teaching license, Boismier moved back home to Oklahoma, to her mom's house‚Äîwhich is so neat. Like, even a pile of paper napkins from Jersey Mike's‚Äîtakeout a few weeks ago‚Äîis stacked on the kitchen counter with military precision. Signs, painted on wood, hang over everything: This house is a home. Bless this kitchen. Let all that you do be done in love. They are relentlessly upbeat.

Boismier is not.

Boismier: I guess the best way I would describe it is: It's a bit of a lost feeling. It's just‚ÄîI don't know. I feel like a guest kind of in someone else's space, even though this is my home. This is where I lived before I went to New York, for example. It still feels very temporary, very strange. I have not unpacked.

Rosin: Boismier says she's applied to more than 300 positions‚Äîwith zero offers. Unclear why. It could be because of the way she lost her teaching certificate, all that controversy. She calls herself ‚Äúeducational kryptonite‚Äù in the state of Oklahoma. She's asked a judge to restore her teaching certificate, but that's just more waiting.

So Boismier spends most of her days pacing around her mom's house, sleeping in the guest bedroom with a broken TV and a useless winter coat hanging on a hook. Everything else from her entire adult life is still in boxes, nearly all unopened: dishes, towels, silverware.

Boismier: ‚Äîunpacked. Everything else is still pretty solidly encased, and I'm a little scared to touch it. (Laughs.)

Rosin: Why are you afraid to open any of them?

Boismier: That's a great question. I think, for me, if I open the boxes, it means that I'm finished. And I think that scares me, that sort of voice in the back of my head of: I need this to matter. And to me, I'm at a spot where I'm not sure that it does.

Rosin: ‚ÄäWhere are all your books? 'Cause you had described having 500 books. Where are they?

Boismier: My books are currently boxed up, just as they've been since 2022, in the back of my mom's storage shed.

(People getting into a car.)

Rosin: So we go to the shed. Boismier tells us that she shares the shed with her mom, who mostly keeps holiday decorations in there, and her sister, who's also a teacher. That sister has been busy getting her school supplies out of the shed because, remember, school's about to start.

(Shed door being opened.)

Rosin: Whoa.

Boismier: All right.

Rosin: So give us the audio tour guide of what is here.

Boismier: Sure. So pretty much everything at the back of the storage shed, so all these boxes that go almost all the way up to the ceiling, that's my classroom.

Rosin: The storage unit is crammed with sparkly wreaths and smiling elves. And there's a small path to the back.

Boismier: Let's see if I can climb back in here a little bit.

(Items shift around.)

Boismier: This rocking horse is not in a great spot.

Rosin: And then, there they are: the 500 books that used to live in her classroom‚ÄîThe Fault in Our Stars,The Hate U Give, the Twilight saga‚Äîwhich might or might not be on some banned-books list that doesn't exist, or offend someone's parents.

Rosin: ‚ÄäI almost feel like there's too much symbolism in this space. There's too much symbolism.

Boismier: You unpack a lot more than boxes here.

Rosin: Yeah. This storage shed is one giant metaphor, truly.

Boismier: (Laughs.)

Rosin: Do you feel like‚ÄîI don't even know how to say it. If these books stayed in here forever, what would that mean to you?

Boismier: If the books were back in a classroom, but‚Äî

Rosin: No, no. I mean, forget the books.

Boismier: ‚Äîor if they stayed here?

Rosin: All of it.

Boismier: Oh, if it didn't change anything? So I can't undo what I did or did not do. But at the end of the day, if I'm really, truly being honest, I hope it matters. I hope it makes a difference. But I don't regret it. I just regret that I had to do it at all.

Rosin: Mm-hmm. It's interesting 'cause I feel like you‚ÄîI mean, even seeing this has brought it home for me. You keep saying, I'm suspended. I don't know where I am. I'm suspended, which suggests that you're waiting for something. And the something is, like, it could be just a job; it could be a teaching certificate. But it's gotta be something.

Boismier: Yeah.

Rosin: Something has to happen.

Boismier: I say that to myself every day when I wake up: Something has to happen.

Rosin: Uh-huh.

Boismier: I really hope it does.

(Shed door being shut.)

Boismier: All right, where did I put the‚Äîoh. All righty. (Locks door.) All right.

[Music]

Rosin: Oklahoma kids started school a few weeks ago. So far, Michael says things are going well, that his students this year are extremely polite, which he says is a nice surprise and a little weird. Boismier is still at her mom's house‚Äîno job offers.  Last week, Ryan Walters ordered that all public schools observe a moment of silence in honor of the death of Charlie Kirk. The State Department of Education says it's investigating claims that some districts did not comply. And then just a couple of days ago, Walters announced a plan to create chapters of Turning Point USA‚Äîthe conservative organization co-founded by Kirk‚Äîat every Oklahoma high school.

That ideology test for teachers that Walters promised, it came out in late August, and right at the top: ‚ÄúWhat is the fundamental biological distinction between males and females?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy is the distinction between male and female considered important in areas like sports and privacy?‚Äù

The test questions in general got a lot of press‚Äîunlike the kind of questions that Walters's opponent raised in the state-superintendent race: about teacher retention, career readiness, and food insecurity.

[Music]

Rosin: Here's a question for the purity test: Is public education guaranteed in the Constitution? The answer is ‚ÄúNo, it's not.‚Äù Schools are an example of civic institutions that evolved in a democracy over centuries, towards the consensus that they should be free, open to everyone, and secular.

But as we're learning lately about those institutions, they can be gone faster than you can fall asleep in civics class.

The tragedy of workaholism is the false belief that you can trade toil for affection. Knowing that is the first step to recovery.

Want to stay current with Arthur's writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.

Between teaching MBA students and speaking to a lot of business audiences, I'm often interacting with successful people who work extremely long hours. It's common for me to hear about 13-hour workdays and seven-day workweeks, with few or no vacations. What I see among many of those I encounter is workaholism, a pathology characterized by continuing to work during discretionary time, thinking about work all the time, and pursuing job tasks well beyond what's required to meet any need. Workaholics feel a compulsion to work even when they are already earning plenty of money and despite getting minimal enjoyment from doing so.

Does this sound familiar? If you do little else but work‚Äîand are mentally absent when not working‚Äîyou are likely to find your life feels bereft of enjoyment, satisfaction, and meaning. Worst of all, compulsive overworking is incompatible with healthy intimate relationships, which take time, energy, and effort.

As with other addictions, telling a workaholic they'd be better off not doing the destructive behavior is unhelpful‚Äîas though just suggesting ‚ÄúHey, why not work less?‚Äù will result in the person slapping their forehead and saying ‚ÄúI never thought of that!‚Äù Instead, I try to look behind the pathology to discover its origins. Typically, what I find in highly successful people is that an addiction to work is, in fact, based on an inchoate belief that love from others‚Äîincluding spouses, parents, and friends‚Äîcan be earned only through constant toil and exceptional merit. Unchecked, this mistaken belief is catastrophic. But understanding the reasons behind this delusion can lead to healing.

Life offers two kinds of reward, which social scientists define as intrinsic and extrinsic. The first kind involves immaterial things that can't be bought, such as love and happiness. The second kind involves material things that can be procured, such as money and goods. We want both kinds of reward, of course‚Äîeven though we all know what research has shown over and over again: that once we have achieved a basic standard of living, we gain much greater life satisfaction from intrinsic rewards. Compare the scenario of driving to a fancy restaurant in your new Ferrari, where you will eat alone because you have no friends or family, with that of driving to Denny's in a 1999 Corolla to hang out with people who truly love you.

Arthur C. Brooks: The hidden link between workaholism and mental health

And yet, millions of seemingly successful people act as if extrinsic rewards are all that count. Although they may not be totally bereft of loved ones, they live almost as if they were so, neglecting family and friends in favor of work, earning far more than their household needs to survive, even thrive. You can think of this as a crossed psychological circuit, resulting in a false conviction that intrinsic rewards can be bought with extrinsic currency. If I work hard enough and am sufficiently successful, thinks the workaholic, albeit unconsciously, then I will be worthy of the love I truly crave.

Why might someone fall prey to such an erroneous belief? It could be the way you were raised. Workaholic parents tend to have workaholic kids. If you grow up seeing adulthood modeled by people who work all hours and are rarely home, you can be forgiven for regarding this as appropriate behavior for a responsible spouse and parent. This is at least partly the same mechanism behind the fact that you are much likelier to become an alcoholic if you were raised by one.

Researchers have also shown that when parents express love for a child in a conditional way based on the child's behavior, that person is likely to grow up feeling that they deserve love only through good conduct and hard work. This might sound as though I'm describing terrible parents, but I don't mean to do so at all; well-intentioned parental encouragement can be heard by a child as a message about their worthiness.

In the workaholic's case, it might look like this: Your parents wanted you to succeed in school and in life, so they gave you the most love and attention when you got good report cards, won at sports, or earned the top spot in the orchestra. You were a bright kid, and put two and two together: I am extra lovable when I earn accolades. In my experience, this describes the childhood of a lot of people who strove to be special to gain their parents' attention, and who carry this behavior into adulthood by trying to earn the love of others through compulsive work.

If you're tending toward workaholism, you may very well be discovering that the returns to work are falling below the costs to your life. You are likely defensive about your heavy work habit, and confused about why such a noble virtue is earning complaints at home, instead of praise. Here are three steps you can take to resolve this issue.

1. Look at your origins and face the truth. Think back to your childhood: Did you struggle, say, to get your parents' attention and affection unless you excelled in school or outside activities? Did being a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or a ‚Äúbright‚Äù child make you feel loved? If so, don't get mad at your folks: They were probably doing their best, perhaps trying to give you a better life than they'd had; or they may have been diligently following some now-outdated parenting advice. But the result is very likely that there's a script in your head that says, You're not inherently lovable as you are, so you better win the spelling bee. You are still trying to win some grown-up version of the spelling bee, even if your parents are long dead.

2. Give what you want to receive. Benjamin Franklin wrote that ‚Äúif you would be loved, love, and be loveable.‚Äù The profound truth behind this assertion is that you should give what you want to receive. So if you want more courtesy, start by being courteous to others. And if you want true love from your beloved, give them true love, in the intrinsic currency that satisfies our deeper needs. That means giving your self, not more money or things. Try this: Take a day away from work, turn off your phone, and give the person you love the attention they crave, all day.

Derek Thompson: America's fever of workaholism is finally breaking

3. Make plans to change. One day is not enough to repair your relationships, and big changes in your habits don't take place overnight. If you were dependent on alcohol, say, I wouldn't be so naive as to imagine that not drinking for a day would fix the problem. Breaking any addiction takes a lot of planning and resolve. Own up to your workaholism, acknowledge the roots of the problem, and work with your loved ones to make a long-term plan to live differently. That might mean planning a career or job change, in six months' to a year's time; scheduling weekend trips and tech-free vacations from now until then; and asking your family to hold you accountable for making progress.

Let me close with one of my many conversations with work-addicted strivers that makes the point better perhaps than any studies can. An older, very wealthy man told me how he worked himself to a husk to earn his fortune. While he ground away at building his company over the decades, barely talking to his wife and kids, he dreamed about how marvelous it would be to be wealthy. I asked him what he imagined it would be like to be so rich. He said that he thought of the obvious stuff, such as houses and cars. ‚ÄúBut mostly,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI thought if I was rich, my wife would love me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù I asked, noting that he was not wearing a ring.

‚ÄúShe didn't.‚Äù

The surrender of America's elites

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

‚ÄúWe have to speak out against this bully,‚Äù Jimmy Kimmel said in an emotional monologue after returning to ABC on Tuesday. The network had suspended him, under pressure from the Trump administration, for remarks last week in which Kimmel appeared to inaccurately suggest that Charlie Kirk's killer was a conservative. Kimmel choked up when discussing the violence and praised Kirk's widow, Erika.

But he also warned his viewers‚Äîan audience four times larger than usual‚Äîthat Trump and his cronies are threatening free speech in all its forms: ‚ÄúOur leader celebrates Americans losing their jobs, because he can't take a joke,‚Äù Kimmel said. But ‚Äúhe's not stopping. And it's not just comedy.‚Äù True to form, Trump has since threatened to sue ABC for bringing Kimmel back, as if it were illegal not to like him.

Kimmel's refusal to capitulate stands out because so many other well-situated people‚Äîthose with the resources, platform, and power to stand up to the president, including, initially, the leaders of ABC‚Äîhave surrendered, withdrawn, or become Trump sycophants themselves. One by one, American leaders supposedly committed to principles of free speech, due process, democracy, and equality have abandoned those ideals when menaced by the Trump administration. These cascading acts of cowardice from the people best positioned to resist Trump's authoritarian power grabs have made Trump seem exponentially more powerful than he actually is, sapping strength from others who might have discovered the courage to stand up. Defending democracy requires a collective refusal to acquiesce to lawless behavior from many different sectors of society. All of these powerful people trying to save their own skin have effectively multiplied Trump's attacks on constitutional government, by enhancing a false sense of inevitability and invincibility.

ABC and its parent company, Disney, had been menaced into suspending Kimmel by Brendan Carr, the head of the Federal Communications Commission. ‚ÄúWe can do this the easy way or the hard way,‚Äù Carr said on a right-wing podcast.

He later attempted to walk back what he'd said‚Äîdespite what your lying ears may have heard, and despite his gloating on social media. As it turns out, you can't sell your soul to Trump and keep your spine; they're a package deal. Nonetheless, the bullying was effective. Kimmel may have returned to ABC, but two of the network's biggest broadcasters, Sinclair and Nexstar, are still refusing to air him on their stations.

If Trump has been right about anything, it is that there is a deep rot in the upper echelons of American society, among people who have been put in positions of power and leadership. Trump understands that many of these people are weak, that their public commitment to civic principles can crumble under sustained pressure. In many cases, those folding have had ample resources to resist Trump's shakedowns but haven't been brave enough to do so. They are, in a word, chickenshit.

I want to distinguish between chickenshit and cowardice. Fear is part of human existence. Bravery is the overcoming of fear, not its absence. Acts of cowardice can be provoked by genuine danger‚Äîthink of a deserting soldier fleeing the peril of the battlefield. When you're chickenshit, you capitulate to avoid the mere possibility of discomfort, let alone something resembling real risk. Disney is one of the largest companies in the world, with a devoted following and a market cap bigger than many countries' stock markets. It did not have to cave.

Big companies and their CEOs have cowered before Trumpist intimidation, trying to ease his temper by settling frivolous lawsuits over ‚Äúbias‚Äù or slathering the president in juche-style flattery. Media companies have settled First Amendment cases they were likely to win in order to curry favor or protect their parent company's commercial interests. Newspaper owners have compromised the integrity of their own publications. Elite academic institutions have sacrificed their independence to try to preserve their federal funding. At least one has turned the names of its own students over to the government for potential political persecution. Major law firms with deep pockets and armies of lawyers have shrunk from defending the rule of law because they fear Trump's wrath.

Promoting her book, former Vice President Kamala Harris told the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, ‚ÄúI always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions.‚Äù Now we know most titans of industry won't be fighting right-wing authoritarianism as fiercely as they would a tax hike on private equity.

For years the leaders of the Republican Party, with all its tough-guy bravado, have shrunk from standing up to Trump when it matters. But even the opposition party has been less confrontational this time around. This week, the House passed a congressional resolution honoring Kirk in part for ‚Äúrespect for his fellow Americans.‚Äù

The Congressional Black Caucus rightfully condemned his murder but also opposed the resolution, in part because of Kirk's view that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed Jim Crow, was a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù that had become an ‚Äúanti-white weapon.‚Äù Kirk also called for the most recent Democratic president to be executed, which doesn't seem very respectful, in all honesty. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voted for the resolution anyway, saying, ‚ÄúI look at it as a two-page resolution that doesn't even have the force of law.‚Äù

Everyone always has sound, rational reasons for caving to intimidation. They're protecting their reputation, their job, their family, their institution, their investments‚Äîthe number of reasons to succumb to an autocrat's whims compound until fighting back can feel like a fool's errand. Multiply that decision a thousand-fold, and you have a society in which people who could otherwise fight back collectively choose to surrender individually, thinking themselves alone. But in every case, the act of capitulation compromises the very thing those capitulating say they want to protect. Fighting doesn't always result in victory, but surrendering guarantees defeat. The only people who have preserved their dignity or their rights in dealing with Trump are those who have been willing to stand up to him.

The sheer number of American elites willing to acquiesce to the destruction of democratic institutions is demoralizing. But it's worth noting that many ordinary people seem to be made of sterner stuff. ICE detainees such as the Palestinian-rights activist Mahmoud Khalil, for example, have continued to speak publicly about the administration's abuses. These are people who stand to lose their homes, their freedom, their families, and they are showing more courage than people who have summer homes and trust funds. Protesters continue to show up in the streets, risking being brutalized by armed agents of the state. In Washington, D.C., citizens called to serve on grand juries have refused to indict people accused by the Trump administration of political crimes.

The people, it turns out, are far more courageous than their leaders.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","What Ever Happened to Getting to First Base?","https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/09/gen-z-sex-dating-language/684357/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:35:17 GMT","

Gen Z has abandoned the old dating script. In its place are more possibilities than young people sometimes know what to do with.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The prevailing American beliefs about sex, love, and commitment were, for many years, encapsulated by the 1977 Meat Loaf song ‚ÄúParadise by the Dashboard Light.‚Äù The epic Wagnerian rock duet plays out in three acts: First, a young couple hooks up in a parked car, and the guy pushes the girl for sex. Then the girl declares that, before they go further, she needs to know that the guy will love her until the end of time, which, under duress, he promises to do. Finally, from some point in the future, miserably tied together, the two sing that the end of time can't come soon enough.

The song stretches for about eight minutes, an absurd length for a single, but it managed to become such a staple of classic rock that, two decades after its release, as teenagers, my friends and I had learned the words without trying. It also contained the metaphor that we used to talk about our early sexual experiences, via an interlude in which the shortstop turned sports announcer Phil Rizzuto calls out a batter's progress as he rounds the bases: ‚ÄúFirst base,‚Äù any listener would have understood, was a kiss; a ‚Äúhome run‚Äù represented intercourse. Although my peers and I hardly required a lifetime commitment from a partner to have sex, I did take for granted that sexual encounters and relationships typically unfolded in a certain order, with clear steps.

Today, though, many young people consider the bases (and the tidy progression they offer) a relic. Sophia Choukas-Bradley, a University of Pittsburgh psychology professor who researches teens and young adults, told me that the only times she'd heard Gen Zers‚Äîalso known as Zoomers, the people born from 1997 to 2012‚Äîuse the base system was ironically, with first base referring to, say, oral sex. The way Gen Z talks about sex and dating instead involves an explosion of new language, if that's even the right way to put it. The linguistic acrobatics suggest that they haven't just come up with new slang but have also evolved a novel form of communication.

Read: Teens are forgoing a classic rite of passage

In my reporting, including in conversations with about a dozen Zoomers across the country, I learned about the terms sneaky links (people you hook up with in secret), zombies (people who come back after ghosting you), and simps (guys, usually, who try too hard to get a partner). Zoomers spoke of the dangers of ‚Äúcatching feelings‚Äù and the imperative to keep liaisons chill at all costs, or ‚Äúnonchalant,‚Äù as they put it. They discussed the numerous expressions that have arisen to describe the work that goes into maintaining simultaneous relationships, such as breadcrumbing (offering little bits of attention to keep someone interested) and cushioning (flirtations you keep on the side). I learned about so many different types of casual entanglements‚Äînot just the ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù and situationships, but also flirtationships, explorationships, and the scenario that I struggled most to understand: a situationship that is exclusive but between two people who would not, under any circumstance, describe themselves as dating.

My exchanges with Zoomers‚Äîas well as with sex educators, psychologists, researchers, and parents‚Äîmade clear that anything so simple as the base system had essentially become moot. Few of those I spoke with described a typical order to the way physical intimacy or relationships evolve. ‚ÄúFrom what I know about previous generations, in past times, you could just ask a girl to be your girlfriend, and she'd say yes or no, and that was it,‚Äù Miles Greene, an 18-year-old student at a liberal-arts college in Massachusetts whose mom I've known for years, told me in a tone of voice that I might use to discuss the baffling customs of the Pilgrims. ‚ÄúIt's so much more complicated than that now.‚Äù

As many Zoomers see sex and dating, it is fine to stay a virgin into your 20s or explore your kinks as a teen. You might have an intense online entanglement with a partner you've never met in real life or a serious, in-person relationship. A situationship can be an end in and of itself‚Äîit isn't always perceived as an unsteady state. And although none of these possibilities is new, Gen Zers seem to be more likely than people from previous generations to have metabolized the idea that everybody moves through such matters in their own way, at their own pace. Claudia Giolitti-Wright, a psychotherapist in New York whose clients are mostly young women, told me that, unlike her Millennial clients, her Gen-Z clients never talk about the pressure to hit certain sexual or relationship milestones.

The various options open to Gen Zers, many told me, left more space for them to forge paths shaped by their specific desires and inclinations, rather than external expectations. But I also heard that trying to wade through so many possibilities and timelines could be stressful. And despite how much information Zoomers have access to online, they aren't given much advice about how to figure out what they actually like, sexually or romantically, much less how to handle intimacy. Whereas there used to be a ‚Äúprepackaged menu,‚Äù Andrew Smiler, a psychologist in North Carolina who predominantly treats teen boys and men, told me, Zoomers ‚Äúhave a buffet.‚Äù The challenge, he continued, was that ‚Äúthey don't really get any guidance, to stay with the food metaphor, for how to compose a plate.‚Äù

Much of the reporting on Gen Z's sex and dating habits has focused on the fact that members of the cohort are having less sex and fewer committed relationships than previous generations did at similar ages. What these findings can obscure is that a large number of Zoomers are still getting into relationships and having sex. One 2024 survey found that about 60 percent of college students reported having had vaginal intercourse; a 2022 Pew Research survey reported that more than half of all adults under 30 were in a relationship at the time. Trying to learn how Gen Z navigates sex and romance, though, turns up a bundle of reports that seem to contradict one another. Zoomers have been framed, in various media, as the generation of incels and tradwives, ‚Äúpuriteens‚Äù and porn enthusiasts. The data are all over the place too. One recent survey found that almost 40 percent of young singles are happy being on their own. Another concluded that Gen Z is the loneliest generation: 80 percent of respondents said they had felt lonely in the past year. Some surveys suggest that Gen Z is kinkier than older people, and particularly open to polyamory. It has also been described, broadly, as sex negative, and the most likely to fantasize about monogamy.

To a certain extent, this simply reflects that any large group of same-age Americans has enormous variation. But Gen Z can seem especially heterogeneous; the internet has enabled Gen Zers, since they were old enough to forge friendships, to find like-minded communities through which to solidify their identity. When it comes to sex and dating, I realized, part of why making general observations about how they approach these realms is so difficult is that they're following so many different scripts.

From some of the Zoomers I spoke with, I heard that they and their peers tend to eschew even the most flexible relationship labels. Garrett Bemiller, a 28-year-old New York‚Äìbased publicist, told me that although he knows a number of people in ‚Äúethically nonmonogamous‚Äù relationships, they wouldn't necessarily call them that. ‚ÄúI feel like that's kind of its government name?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's just like, ‚ÄòWe're open.'‚Äù But a number of other young people told me that they and others they know were in clearly defined relationships. And some intentionally seek out conventional labels. The filmmaker Rachel Fleit, who directed the 2023 documentary Bama Rush, about young sorority hopefuls at the University of Alabama, told me that her film's subjects talked openly about their sorority sisters as their future bridesmaids, and considered having an engagement by senior year to be totally normal; they referred to it as having a ‚Äúring by spring.‚Äù

Read: Why are young people having so little sex?

Gen Zers' approach to sex was similarly hard to pin down. From various experts, I heard that, compared with older generations, Gen Z puts more value on ‚Äúenthusiastic consent,‚Äù the idea that it's not enough to just listen when someone says no‚Äîyou need to receive a fervent yes. Some said young people have an increased awareness of female pleasure as well, and are more likely than older generations to recognize that many women enjoy oral sex.

Yet I also heard that certain Gen-Z men, particularly those who spend a lot of time in the manosphere, are apt to believe that giving a woman oral sex demeans their masculinity. And slang used to denigrate women‚Äîsuch as bop or for the streets‚Äîhas proliferated. One 20-year-old in Iowa, who asked to be identified only by the name she uses online, Melody Votoire, told me that among her female friends and co-workers, ‚Äúthere is almost no slut shaming in that sense of women towards other women, which is wonderful.‚Äù When men talk about women, though, it's very different, she said. The phrase she has heard a lot is ran through, which initially was used to refer to someone who'd had a lot of sexual partners, but has become ‚Äúkind of the go-to term for anyone they want to bring down,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúeven a girl doing a dance on TikTok in a skimpier outfit or posting bikini pictures.‚Äù

That so much of Gen Zers' early education about sex came from porn and sites such as OnlyFans has brought additional paradoxes. (Only 29 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia mandate sex ed, and of those, 19 stress abstinence. According to a 2023 report by the nonprofit Common Sense Media, however, 73 percent of 13-to-17-year-olds had viewed porn online, and 54 percent had encountered it by age 13.) Some of my sources‚Äîboth Zoomers and adults who work with them‚Äîtold me that, thanks to the wide range of possibilities on display in porn, sex doesn't carry as much shame as it did for older generations. Many are also comfortable using anatomical terms such as vulva and discussing their kinks or recent sexual experiences with even casual acquaintances. (By contrast, Donna Oriowo, a sex-and-relationship therapist in the Washington, D.C., metro area, told me that some of her Millennial clients still sometimes refer to sex euphemistically as their ‚Äúspecial time.‚Äù)

But one Gen Zer also told me the breadth of options porn presents could be overwhelming. And the way it familiarizes young people with fairly extreme scenarios before they have much experience could introduce complications‚Äîand sometimes distress. A sexual encounter might start with an earnest request for consent to kiss, another told me, and then abruptly segue into choking and rough sex. ‚ÄúThere's a saying in the sex-ed world,‚Äù said Steph Zapata, a sex educator, ‚Äúthat learning sex from porn is like learning to drive from watching The Fast and the Furious.‚Äù

Amid this new landscape, multiple Zoomers told me, they sensed that some members of older generations struggled to grasp the particularities of how they navigate sex and dating. Elle Liemandt, a 17-year-old high-school senior in Austin who dispenses teen-dating advice on TikTok and has created an AI-powered dating-coach app, told me that adults seem unable to offer helpful guidance for romantic relationships. ‚ÄúThere's a huge disconnect,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúParents can't help, because they don't understand what's going on.‚Äù

When it comes to sex and relationships, many of the Zoomers I spoke with did agree on one thing: Vulnerability is agonizing. To everyone I asked about this, the idea that a person might engage in an act that they see as indicating emotional investment‚Äîsuch as hand-holding‚Äîbefore engaging in sex upended the natural order of life. Among Gen Zers ‚Äúit's almost reversed,‚Äù Greene, the 18-year-old college student, told me. ‚ÄúIf you had sex with somebody on a first date, you'd say to your friends, ‚ÄòYeah, my date was good; we had sex; it was great.' But if you went on a first date and held hands with somebody? There would be outrage. There would be uproar.‚Äù Or as Elle put it: ‚ÄúSex is easy, and emotional connection is hard.‚Äù

Sexual conversations might be easy for Zoomers to have in the abstract, Choukas-Bradley, the psychology professor, told me, but actually telling a partner one's preferences could be tough. ‚ÄúTalking openly with someone in a hookup context is not part of the script,‚Äù she said of many Gen Zers, explaining that they feel that they ‚Äúneed to perform not caring,‚Äù and being frank about their preferences wouldn't be in line with that. The desire to seem disengaged, Musa Hakim Jr., a 26-year-old entrepreneur in Ohio, told me, is why two people who like each other might refer to each other only with an endearment that was originally (and typically) used between buddies: ‚ÄúYou're my slime.‚Äù It's a way of referring to someone as just a friend, he said, even if that isn't an entirely accurate description of the relationship.

Giolitti-Wright, the therapist, described all of this as indicative of a profound shift: Older generations tended to believe that security could be found in sticking to certain sexual norms and reaching milestones at certain times, which motivated people to push new relationships toward commitment or some sort of label. Many Gen Zers think it's safer to stay autonomous and unattached. The majority of her work with Gen-Z clients, she said, involves helping people recognize and tolerate the experience of being emotionally invested.

Some of the Zoomers I spoke with suggested that this fear of being vulnerable was inevitable. Their generation came of age amid COVID, protest movements, and political polarization. And so many of them were online as kids, watching events unfold through a steady stream of videos, photos, and outraged posts. They have seen innumerable friends, strangers, and influencers get flamed on social media for what in a different time would have been minor, private missteps. It could make the world seem like a fragile, scary place‚Äîand prompt an almost paralyzing self-consciousness. Instead of caring about the person they are pursuing, ‚Äúwe care almost more about what everybody else around us is thinking,‚Äù Bemiller told me. As a result, if you did something from one of the old rom-coms, like hold a boom box outside somebody's window, ‚Äúeven if it made the person swoon,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúeverybody else would be like, That's so crazy. He's such a simp.‚Äù Better to be as cautious as possible, lest a relationship fall apart, publicly, in an explosion of cringe.

Of course, Gen Zers are, at the oldest, in their late 20s‚Äîan age when many people are still figuring out who they are. In my chats with Zoomers, it was impossible to know how much of what they were saying reflected definitive elements of their generation, and how much was just a regular part of finding one's footing in the world. Some who spoke most frankly about their generation's fears of vulnerability had already managed to overcome their own anxieties to pursue something more serious. ‚ÄúI have a girlfriend; it's labeled,‚Äù Greene told me. ‚ÄúI just ended up deciding: I like this person. I might as well just figure out what happens.‚Äù In such moments‚Äîcontradictions, confusion, and new language aside‚ÄîI was struck by how much seems the same as it ever was. Young people, by and large, desire to connect with others. They fear that pursuing closeness might get them hurt. And despite the odds, some are still willing to try.

In her new novel, the author captures the strangeness of ordinary life for the chronically ill.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

One hundred years ago, Virginia Woolf wondered why, ‚Äúconsidering how common illness is, how tremendous the spiritual change that it brings,‚Äù it had not ‚Äútaken its place with love, battle, and jealousy among the prime themes of literature.‚Äù In the century since, Woolf's provocation has been met many times over‚Äîin works as varied as Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, Audre Lorde's The Cancer Journals, and John Green's YA best seller The Fault in Our Stars. More recently, books such as Lisa Olstein's Pain Studies and Meghan O'Rourke's The Invisible Kingdom have examined the uncertainty of chronic illness. What does another entry into the canon of sickness writing have to offer readers?

Woolf wrote in ‚ÄúOn Being Ill‚Äù that ‚Äúit is to the poets that we turn‚Äù when ‚Äúillness makes us disinclined for the long campaigns that prose exacts.‚Äù But she also acknowledged that ‚Äúsome prose writers are to be read as poets.‚Äù Let me make the case for reading Patricia Lockwood's new novel, Will There Ever Be Another You, which explores the effects of long COVID on a writer, in precisely this way. Lockwood does happen to be an accomplished poet as well as a devotee of internet speak, with its oddly revealing turns of phrase. Here, her deft manipulation of form and language captures how alien‚Äîeven, perhaps, how interesting‚Äîordinary life with a chronic illness, in some cases, can be.

Read: The novel I'm searching for

Toggling between the first and third person, Will There Ever Be Another You follows a writer named Patricia, who bears a very close resemblance to Lockwood, as she contracts the coronavirus early in the pandemic and deals with COVID's lingering effects for the next four years. (Lockwood has written previously about a number of the events that appear in fictionalized form in the novel.) The narrator has published a lauded book about the internet (what she calls ‚Äúthe portal‚Äù), much like Lockwood's first novel, No One Is Talking About This. Also like Lockwood, the narrator is working with a playwright to adapt a story about her family into a television series. (Lockwood's memoir, Priestdaddy, was optioned in 2017 but has not been produced.)

In prose tinged with Woolf's influence (she and Lockwood both love to begin sentences with a conjunction, creating pattering rhythms), the novel begins with the narrator visiting the Isle of Skye, off the western coast of Scotland, with her family. She drinks from the Fairy Pools, a popular tourist attraction of natural water formations, and gets horribly sick; the narrator's sister loses her phone, which holds photos of her recently deceased daughter. These bad omens create a foreboding sense in the narrator that she has somehow misstepped by sipping the water, exacting a price that must later be paid.

To say that the narrator's descent into COVID in the next chapter is the price feels a bit too tidy. But this kind of self-interrogation, even self-mythologizing, undergirds many stories of illness: How did I get here? Did I somehow invite this upon myself? In Lockwood's book, the illness never resolves, neither through healing nor in death. Instead, she dwells in the long middle of being sick. The narrator develops a fever that lasts for 48 days, her memory is shattered, she is unable to recognize faces, and she experiences alien hand syndrome, which she describes colorfully as ‚Äúthe rough pink sensation that she was holding Rasputin's penis in her right hand.‚Äù

The narrator's experience of long COVID leaves her feeling like a different person than she was before she got sick. Along with being physically ill, she cannot think, read, or write the way she used to. She visits doctor after doctor, reads post after post on the internet, searching for clarity: ‚ÄúSometimes she sat at the foot of the illness and asked it questions. Had it stolen her old mind and given her a new one? Had she been able to start over from scratch, a chance afforded to very few people? Had it optimized her?‚Äù This deep curiosity about what is happening to her makes Lockwood's illness account feel particularly open-minded. It is also what makes a neurologist ‚Äúrecoil‚Äù from the narrator after seeing her reaction to her brain scans. ‚ÄúThis was a cardinal sin,‚Äù she reflects afterward. ‚ÄúYou could not become interested in the illness. You could not lavish on it the love and solicitation you had previously lavished on the self, even though it was the thing that the self had been replaced by.‚Äù Like a changeling‚Äîa motif that recurs throughout the novel‚Äîthe old narrator has been taken and replaced by someone new.

Part Two of the novel includes excerpts from the ‚Äúmad notebook‚Äù that the narrator keeps during the pandemic and its aftermath: ‚Äú‚ÄòSome days the delirium seems to return. It feels expansive, uncomfortable, as if pathways are trying to break past the outer walls.' ‚ÄòSolid objects seem to rain.' ‚ÄòMy reading comes and goes like a magic store.'‚Äù In one chapter called ‚ÄúMr. Tolstoy, You're Driving Me Mad,‚Äù an imagined Beatles song title, the narrator recounts her attempts ‚Äúto rewire my brain with mushrooms,‚Äù which instead result in her ‚Äúbecoming temporarily psychic and reading Anna Karenina so hard I almost died.‚Äù

Long COVID seems to defamiliarize the narrator's relationship to language in ways both fascinating and isolating. In one scene, she invents the word ranchously to describe herself scampering zestily away from a stranger. The odd, sometimes astute connections and ideas her seemingly new brain forms are not entirely unpleasant. But there is also acute loss: After the narrator contracts COVID, her photographic memory for faces disappears. She is able to distinguish faces only when she watches Korean dramas, whose characters are untethered to the English language that confounds her. ‚ÄúThe inability to process narrative, my disorientation at fast cuts, the unzipping inside my skull whenever the camera moved diagonally,‚Äù she reflects‚Äî‚Äúall of these went away.‚Äù

Read: Long COVID showed me the bottom of American health care

At the end of Part Two, the narrator and her husband travel to London for an awards ceremony. While they're watching the popular K-drama Crash Landing on You on the plane, her husband doubles over, and once they land, he is rushed from Heathrow to a hospital. He is later diagnosed with multiple hemorrhages. Part Three describes what happens after his medical emergency, and the strange new cadence of their life together. After her husband undergoes several surgeries and returns home, the narrator cares for him, tender and a little maniacal about her duty to ‚Äúthe Wound‚Äù: ‚ÄúSo that's what the inside of her husband looked like,‚Äù she thinks. ‚ÄúRed layers, a taut opening, and a sort of inner glistening. A shape like a buttonhole, and ‚ÄòYou missed one,' she might have said, had it been anything other than himself.‚Äù She closely observes the Wound's healing, finding purpose and solidity in her husband's progress.

Late in the novel, the narrator begins taking metalwork classes, hoping to make something out of the items she's always collected‚Äîstones, crystals, scraps of silver. In one scene during the early months of the pandemic, she cries while at a crystal shop, watching the clerk disinfect the stones with alcohol: ‚ÄúThey don't like that,‚Äù she pleads, feeling the sting in her own sick body. At the end of the novel, it's unclear how much of that referred sensation has disappeared: The narrator still deals with many long-COVID symptoms. But she learns to melt metal, craft settings for her stones, and enjoy an artistic process that does not demand language. Her husband, healthy again (though dealing with his own chronic symptoms), picks her up from class at night, looking over her metal creations in the way he used to review her poems after the couple had spent a day apart.

One particular challenge of an illness narrative‚Äîespecially one that's ongoing‚Äîis how to conclude. Lockwood, for one, refuses to sum her story up neatly. She doesn't need to: Her narrator's life continues. (‚ÄúThere are things that are happening in her life even now,‚Äù her TV show's co-writer says when asked about a potential second season of the show.) Lockwood is an alchemist, handling her own experiences with careful attention, ready to fashion them into something new.

Americans say they despise corruption. So why is Trump still president?

Tom Homan, the White House border czar, allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as business executives during a sting operation last year, according to MSNBC. The payment was made after Homan implied that he could help the agents secure government contracts in a second Trump administration.

In layperson's terms, this is what bribery looks like: officials promising favors in exchange for money. In this case, Homan was not a government official at the time of the sting, though he had said during the 2024 election that he would likely have a role in a second Trump term. The investigation related to Homan ‚Äî which was launched during the Biden administration and was first reported by MSNBC this past weekend ‚Äî was only recently shut down. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that prosecutors ‚Äúfound no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.‚Äù

Now, we don't know the full details of the case, and, in the absence of a full investigation or a trial, we can't know that Homan is guilty of hatching a bribery scheme. But to say this should raise eyebrows is an understatement.

The Homan story raises a question that has come up over and over again since President Donald Trump catapulted himself to the White House: Do American voters actually care about corruption? After all, Trump has so far gotten away with maintaining unprecedented conflicts of interest, accepting gifts from foreign governments, and turning the presidency into a giant cash grab. And despite his history of fraud and corruption, he still won a second term last November.

Yet polls consistently indicate that a majority of Americans think that corruption is a serious problem that plagues Congress, the presidency, and the Supreme Court. And there's evidence that corruption scandals can drag down politicians. One recent example is Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, who was indicted last year on corruption charges. An overwhelming majority of New Yorkers believe that Adams should resign, and his reelection bid seems all but doomed: Most recent polls show Adams's support is in single-digits.

So why is it that no level of corruption in the Trump administration ‚Äî no matter how brazen or how high up it goes, from Homan to other members of Trump's Cabinet to the first family and the president himself ‚Äî seems to ever stick?

Since Trump's first term, a lot has been said about his attacks on institutions and his utter disregard for the rules and norms that preserve American democracy. But one of the biggest guardrails that Trump quickly shattered isn't any kind of institution or law; it's the effectiveness of public shaming.

Public shaming can be a powerful weapon for citizens protesting their government. It creates an environment that makes the shamed person lose legitimacy, and it puts pressure on institutions or other people in power to take action. And the prospect of public shaming likely deters some politicians from taking shortcuts or engaging in petty corruption, not out of principle or ethics but out of fear of getting caught. After all, public shaming was a tool that ultimately helped push many politicians to resign in disgrace, from President Richard Nixon to former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Trump has discovered that not caving to shame eventually leads people to let go and move on. His seeming inability to feel shame has allowed him to plow through scandals ‚Äî like the Access Hollywood tape ‚Äî that would have easily ended other politicians' careers. It's also allowed him to maintain a sprawling web of conflicts of interest without feeling the need to answer to anyone. Throughout his time in politics, Trump has shown little remorse for his misdeeds, and his strategy to simply power through scandals, often with no apologies, has proven remarkably effective.

And other politicians have taken notice. For example, Cuomo, who resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct in 2021, has tried to stage a comeback by running for mayor of New York City. But that doesn't mean that shaming no longer works at all. Cuomo couldn't outrun his past as his opponents reminded voters of why he resigned in the first place, and he eventually went on to lose the Democratic primary earlier this year. And, if the polls are accurate, he is on track to lose the general election in November as well. But when it comes to Trump, Americans have yet to find the scandal that can shame his way to political irrelevance.

There are two main reasons why Trump and his administration are so often able to avoid any accountability for potential corruption, even though there is evidence that voters do care about corrupt governance, as Eric Adams's downfall shows. First, Trump's core supporters are willing to look the other way because their priority is supporting Trump's broader political project. In some cases, some of the president's supporters might not believe any of the allegations of corruption or might point to how the president's opponents are corrupt as well. In fact, many American voters believe the Democratic Party is more corrupt than the GOP.

Second, and more importantly, while the president's opponents might care about the corruption in his administration, Trump's ability to wiggle out of any consequences and ignore public shaming tactics has made people feel powerless. He won a second term, for example, despite being found liable for sexual abuse and defamation and getting convicted of crimes, including falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments. So while incidents of potential corruption might draw a lot of voters' ire, they're unlikely to break through and become full-fledged scandals because many Democratic voters seem resigned to the fact that Trump will likely get away with the story of the day, just as he has over and over again since his first campaign for president in 2016.

Part of what might be driving that general sense of apathy in the opposition is that Trump is term-limited, and unlike his first term, he can't run for reelection. That leaves many people in the mindset of waiting out Trump's second term instead of actively resisting it as they did during his first presidency. So while they know they're stuck with him for now, they also know they're not going to be stuck with him forever.

That's not to say that corruption and abuse of power won't ever galvanize resistance to Trump, especially as the midterms get underway next year. Democrats hoping to win back the House will likely highlight how a Democratic majority in at least one chamber of Congress would be a check on the president's corruption. In fact, some Democratic operatives are pushing Democrats to embrace that message and focus on Trump's ‚Äúculture of corruption‚Äù as their midterm strategy, according to a memo obtained by the Bulwark earlier this month.

Whether Democrats go with that advice will depend on whether they believe Americans care enough about Trump's corruption. And so far this year, it seems the answer to that question is no. But that might not always be the case, especially if an anti-corruption coalition finds the right messenger.

You should turn on the new scam-busting iPhone feature right now.

It's been five or six years since I stopped answering my phone. With the exception of family or work calls, most of which I'm expecting, everyone now goes straight to voicemail, where my iPhone software dutifully transcribes the messages, which are almost always robocalls or spam. And my text messages are even more of a mess than my unanswered calls.

Apple has promised to help with a couple of new features in iOS 26. You might not have noticed, even if you've updated your iPhone, because the most ambitious feature, which uses AI to screen calls, is off by default. (You'll be prompted to turn it on when you first open the Phone app after updating to iOS 26, or you can turn it on in your Phone app settings by selecting ‚ÄúAsk Reason for Calling.‚Äù) Another new feature that filters out spam texts is on by default, but it's a little bit confusing to figure out how it works. I am nevertheless down to try anything.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Some 80 percent of Americans are like me and don't answer calls from unknown numbers. That's according to a 2020 Pew Survey, and I'd guess the percentage is higher today, especially after the scam-bonanza that the pandemic launched. Meanwhile, text spam is definitely increasing, at least according to an ongoing tally from Robokiller, which makes spam-blocking software. This past August alone, Americans received a head-spinning 19.2 billion spam texts, which amounts to 63 spam texts per person that month. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that Americans lose $470 billion a year to text-based scams.

Who's to blame for this mess? The state of accountability looks like that Spider-Man meme, except everyone is pointing at the scammers and spammers. But really, carriers, regulators, and tech companies are all to blame, and the problem is getting worse.

‚ÄúThis should be a collective, societal solution, because this is such a horrible problem in this country, and it has been for years and years and years,‚Äù Teresa Murray, a consumer watchdog at the US PIRG Education Fund, told me. ‚ÄúMost people that I know, old people, young people, middle-aged people, professionals, students, no matter what they do, everybody that I talk to has a certain amount of skepticism answering their phone, and that's unfortunate.‚Äù

Apple's new features both improve and complicate the situation. Once you've turned on the iPhone's new call screening features, unknown callers are greeted by Siri instead of you or your voicemail. Siri asks them to state their name and the reason for their call before your phone even rings, their answer gets transcribed in real time, and a notification is sent to your iPhone. If you ignore it, the call goes straight to voicemail. If you tap the alert, you'll see the transcription, and from there, you can type in a response to the person calling, answer the call, or just hit stop to disconnect. If it's someone you want to talk to in the future, you can later mark them as ‚ÄúKnown‚Äù so they don't have to go through the screening process again.

This is a lot of steps, just to decide if you want to answer a phone call. It's also giving you a lot more agency over the situation, which is out of control. Caller ID is so easily spoofed that even the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recommends you don't answer calls from unknown numbers. If you do pick up, there's a chance it's a scammer using widely available AI tools to clone the voice of a loved one ‚Äî they can find their voice from video clips on social media ‚Äî and talk you into sending them money. At the very least, picking up a call will let scammers and spammers know your number is active and that you'll answer it, two pieces of information that could lead to even more scams and spam.

The new call screening feature on iPhones protects you from a couple of these problems but not all of them. By forcing the bad actor to engage with Siri and try to convince you they're legitimate, the software gives you an extra line of defense. Of course, scammers will come up with new tricks for this, too. When Siri asks them to identify themselves, the person on the other end can say whatever they want, including, ‚ÄúHey, it's me, and I'm in trouble.‚Äù There's also no option to hear that recording and confirm it's your loved one or even a human. It's also unclear if Siri answering the call will also tell the bad actors that they've reached an active phone number, setting you up for more fake calls.

Other tech companies have their own solutions to unwanted calls. A few months ago, Google released a suite of AI-powered call screening features for its Pixel phones, some of which work a lot like what Apple now has for iPhones. A similar call screening option is reportedly coming to Samsung Galaxy phones in the future, too. But regardless of what kind of phone you have, the Google Voice app has offered a dead-simple way to screen calls: It just asks unknown callers to state their names, and then it plays that recording for you when you pick up but before the call is actually connected. It's a lot like what Apple, Google, and Samsung are doing now ‚Äî but with actual human interaction instead of AI flourishes.

And then there are the unwanted text messages. You'd think that blocking unwanted texts would be as easy as sending all your spam emails to a junk folder. The text messaging infrastructure is fundamentally different than that of email, however, and it's harder to build in certain filters. The FCC did finalize its first-ever rules on scam texts last year, but as you're surely well aware, the unwanted texts keep coming.

Apple is tackling this problem with new text message screening options in iOS 26. They're confusing, so bear with me. First of all, since 2019, you've been able to toggle on the ‚ÄúFilter Unknown Senders‚Äù feature in the Messages app settings on iPhones. If you did, messages from anyone who wasn't in your contacts or whom you'd never texted would get sent to a different inbox, which was kind of hard to find.

In iOS 26, if you turn on ‚ÄúScreen Unknown Senders,‚Äù those messages are two taps away from your main inbox: Just look for the three lines in the upper right-hand corner of the Messages app. You can also manage whether you get notifications when these messages arrive, and you can mark senders as ‚ÄúKnown‚Äù if you don't want them ending up in the ‚ÄúUnknown Senders‚Äù inbox again ‚Äî or delete the whole conversation and flag it as spam.

Then there's the new ‚ÄúFilter Spam‚Äù feature, which uses constantly updated on-device spam detection software to keep junk out of your main Messages inbox. This one is on by default, and you can find the messages in a ‚ÄúSpam‚Äù folder right below the ‚ÄúUnknown Senders‚Äù folder in the menu you access by tapping the three lines (you can't reply to messages in the ‚ÄúSpam‚Äù folder and their links are disabled, unless you move them out of that folder). Additionally, you can activate even more filters by turning on Apple's standard ‚ÄúText Message Filter,‚Äù which creates folders for ‚ÄúTransactions‚Äù and ‚ÄúPromotions‚Äù and automatically sends those kinds of messages there (this option has been available in Brazil and India for a few years). You also have the option to add a third-party filter from apps, like Hiya, Nomorobo, and Robokiller, that promise to help you tame your texting chaos (they can handle spam phone calls, too).

If all these text message folders are starting to sound a lot like your email inbox, that's probably by design. Over the years, we've made progress in taming the torrent of email spam, so why not try to take text messages down a similar path? Still, once I activated all of Apple's various text message screens and filters and inboxes, I found that it was easier to miss messages I may have otherwise wanted to see, like the invitation to a party I found only after the party was over.

There is no silver bullet to eliminate all spam calls and texts. In fact, a little bit getting through is probably the best option for most people. If you see a new doctor, for instance, you'll want to know they called, even if their specific extension isn't in your contacts or recognized as a frequent contact. And even if you spend money on a sophisticated filtering app and take the time to get all the settings right, you're bound to miss something important. I talked to someone recently whose spam filter kept blocking the passport agency's phone call. She ended up having to cancel a vacation because of it.

Still, the big problem with scammers is that they scam. Over 70 percent of Americans say they know someone who's been a victim of an online scam, and 30 percent say they've fallen for one themselves, according to McAfee Labs. I almost fell for a sophisticated IRS phone scam a few years ago, and a New York Times reporter who covers scams recently wrote about coming dangerously close to falling for a Zelle scam. All scammers need to get started on you is a nugget of data, something that might get you to pick up the phone or reply to a text to get more information.

‚ÄúBy harvesting that information on the fly, they're either able to scam you on the spot, or be able to enrich their database so that the next time around they can target you in a more directed manner,‚Äù said Abhishek Karnik, director for threat research and response at McAfee.

In other words, each scam attempt feeds into the next, and the attempts are never-ending. It's nice that tech companies are giving us more tools to fight back. But it's still not enough.

Zoomers might fear cringe, but the internet embraces personal humiliation.

It's one thing to get on a plane you think is heading to France and end up bound for North Africa. It's another thing to post that big oops on the internet to millions of people ready to laugh and scrutinize your foolishness.

This is reportedly what happened earlier this month when two American women traveling from Rome told an airline representative they wanted a flight ‚Äúto Nice,‚Äù and the employee supposedly heard them say ‚ÄúTunis,‚Äù as in the capital of Tunisia. They posted the video of the sitcom-esque saga ‚Äî from the pair cracking up as a flight attendant explained the error to their journey after they elected to stay on the flight ‚Äî to TikTok, and it quickly went viral. While many laughed at the farce, some were left confused as to how the women made such a huge mistake. One would assume that there were a few indications at the airport that they were boarding a plane to Tunis ‚Äî including the fact that they were flying on Tunisair.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

The whole ‚ÄúTo Nice‚Äù versus Tunis fiasco feels emblematic of a sort of shamelessness that seems to fuel our most-watched content these days. This past year, it seems like the primary way to be online is to be kind of embarrassing, if not fully indulge in a rising subgenre of what we can only call ‚Äúembarrassment porn.‚Äù

The most obvious example is the Jet2 holiday memes where TikTok users uploaded videos of themselves getting thrown off towable tubes, surfboards, and engaging in other accidental physical comedy set to a cheery advert for the British budget airline. But that's mortification on the fun, easy, and only-physically-harmful setting. Other entries in the genre include everything from posting about the sorry state of your marriage to announcing your lack of knowledge about a sporting event you're attending (let alone at the very costly US Open). The past year has seen one viral TikToker eagerly share their disregard for the boundaries and norms of the therapist-client relationship, while another was willing to broadcast that they were kicked out of a party.

It raises some questions for a generation known for dictating the boundaries of what is awkward behavior and what isn't. What exactly counts as embarrassing nowadays? Is anything truly shameful in our ever-chaotic age?

To be clear, embarrassing content is not a new phenomenon. One of the first viral offerings of the early YouTube era was a woman standing on a table in wedge heels while belting a song, and subsequently suffering a violent fall (otherwise known as ‚ÄúScarlet Takes a Tumble‚Äù). The calamitous Jet2 Holiday memes mimic the decades-spanning clip show America's Funniest Home Videos and the popular game show Wipeout. In fact, the entire genre of reality TV, dating back to the 1940s, is built on average people being humiliated via planted microphones and later planted cameras.

Cornell University professor and social researcher Brooke Erin Duffy also connects this sort of mortifying content to a bygone paparazzi culture. She says our collective glee in watching celebrities get caught looking foolish was ‚Äúinflected with privilege‚Äù and had a ‚Äútransactional‚Äù nature but it's now trickled down to the average person.

‚ÄúThere's always been a grotesque fascination with seeing people at their worst,‚Äù says Duffy. ‚ÄúThe paparazzi industry was predicated on capturing the rawness and vulnerability of famous people, people not like us. It's interesting to see how that provided precursors for this era of vulnerability and where celebrities are managing their own social media presence.‚Äù

Still, the saturation of this content hasn't totally normalized it, as young people are simultaneously if not equally concerned with what's socially acceptable behavior and what's not. Nothing is seemingly more undignified than coming off as ‚Äúcringe.‚Äù

In her viral 2020 video essay, YouTuber Natalie Wynn (aka ContraPoints) describes cringe as ‚Äúan electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward.‚Äù Cringe notably describes secondhand embarrassment by the person observing the behavior, not the feeling of shame experienced by the person doing the action. That said, cringe is relative and dependent on your environment. According to my 17-year-old-niece, markers of cringe include being a ‚ÄúGen Z Trump supporter‚Äù or engaging in nerd cultures, like anime. If you look online, certain derided archetypes like ‚Äúpick me's‚Äù and ‚Äúperformative males‚Äù can fall under the cringe category.

When it comes to a certain age group, though, Gen Z has curated a much more specific moodboard for what's cringe. According to various social media posts, including TikTok accounts dedicated to the aesthetic of ‚Äúmillennial cringe,‚Äù practically any hallmark of the late 2000s and early 2010s carries this mortifying sheen. Skinny jeans are cringe. Avocado toast is cringe. The pause before millennials start speaking in a selfie video is cringe. The Fox show Glee is cringe. The Broadway musical Hamilton is cringe. Millennials who feel targeted by these definitions might find themselves baffled to see Zoomers eagerly posting their own Ls online.

Kaley Mullin, a youth and trends insight lead at YouTube and a contributor to the newsletter Cool Shiny Culture, says that cringe often just encompasses anything that feels outdated to Gen Z. ‚ÄúA lot of it seems like it has to do with language and affect, slang like ‚Äòpupper,' ‚Äòdoggo,' ‚Äòbut first, coffee' seems especially ripe for Zoomer ridicule. An overly effusive, quirky affect feels like it gets dinged in the same way.‚Äù

That effusiveness speaks to the most common understanding of what causes ‚Äúmillennial cringe,‚Äù or possibly just cringe writ large: anything earnest. When the 2010 Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes song ‚ÄúHome‚Äù went viral last month after an X user declared it was the worst song ever made, it seemed to highlight an extreme level of sincerity, a disregard for seeming awkward, maybe just unabashed joy.

There's an ungenerous way to read all of this: that being ignorant or clumsy has a social currency, but being enthusiastic and genuine does not. The reality isn't that simple, though. Gen Z is plenty emotional and socially uncomfortable online; in fact, the current cohort of youngsters have built a reputation for crying on camera, broadcasting their angry outbursts (labeled ‚Äúcrash outs‚Äù), and oversharing details of their personal lives and relationships. Yet, this vulnerability is often displayed with a level of social media savviness and self-awareness. Whereas millennials, as Duffy argues, ‚Äúcame of age lacking a sense of social media performativity.‚Äù

This distinction, some argue, keeps these current soul-baring users from stepping into ‚Äúcringe‚Äù territory.

‚ÄúWhat's unique and cool about Gen Z is they're more aware that embarrassment loses its power when it's owned and shared,‚Äù says Mullin. ‚ÄúBeing the one to address an embarrassing thing you did by posting about it destigmatizes that thing. It turns it into an amusing anecdote versus something that keeps you up at night.‚Äù

For some, it's even more than an amusing anecdote, it's an opening. In 2024, when a TikTok user named Reesa Teesa shared upward of 50 videos about her experience being duped by her pathological-liar husband in a series titled ‚ÄúWho TF Did I Marry?,‚Äù one can at least assume she was operating partly under an awareness that there's some sort of power, if not just attention, to be gained from publicly sharing these. For her and others, they have even resulted in career opportunities. The same can be speculated about the ‚ÄúTo Nice vs. Tunis‚Äù girls. It's probably not a coincidence that the poster was already a fairly successful influencer, seemingly with an understanding of what would grab her feed's attention.

In addition to what can be gained from these moments, Duffy says that Gen Z may also feel like they have less risk in looking silly or embarrassing, specifically on an app like TikTok where posts are largely viewed by strangers because of the algorithmic system.

‚ÄúOn TikTok, there seems to be less of a sense of fear over what we call ‚Äòimagined surveillance' because you aren't necessarily coming into contact with these people on a daily basis,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúPeople have a following on Instagram and Facebook, but it's kind of predicated on individuals who you come into contact with in your offline life.‚Äù

To form a theory of Gen Z cringe would probably just mean looking to Gen Alpha in the next few years. So far, it seems like they've mostly just accepted the trends that have been passed down to them from the past generation. A study by marketing firm Acceleration found that today's kids are similarly interested in following average people who they perceive as relatable, as opposed to traditional, lofty celebrities.

Ultimately, in a moment where Americans are purportedly more isolated than ever before, there's a level of capital in being someone people can see themselves in, even at the expense of looking embarrassing. ‚ÄúThe important thing to note about posting something cringy is that it reinforces relatability in an era where relatability is everything,‚Äù Mullin says.

‚ÄúEspecially for influencers who are making serious money and getting amazing access to exclusive events, it's less cool to flaunt an unattainable aspirational lifestyle and more cool to show off how starstruck you were when a celebrity walked past you,‚Äù she says.

Maybe the rise in mortifying videos is a natural changing of the tides following a decade of tightly curated, highly airbrushed Instagram posts and the initial perfection-obsessed wave of influencers. The most cringe thing for Gen Z might just be pretending that life isn't naturally debasing.

Larry Ellison, Oracle, and Trump's potential TikTok deal, explained.

Years of uncertainty around a possible TikTok ban in the United States may finally be coming to an end.

The Trump administration is reportedly very close to finalizing a deal with China to transfer US operations of the app to American control. Details are still murky, but right now it looks like the social media behemoth, which has around 170 million American users, will be run by a consortium of rich, right-wing investors, notably including the tech company Oracle and the Fox Corporation, which owns Fox News.

If ‚Äî and it is still an if ‚Äî this deal is finalized, it would mark the end of a five-year-plus odyssey for TikTok's American presence. President Donald Trump attempted to ban the app over concerns about its Chinese ownership during his first term, without success. Congress acted more definitively in 2024, passing a law that required TikTok to be sold to American operators or shut down. But when Trump came back into office, he had a change of heart ‚Äî young voters shifted toward Trump in 2024, and his campaign attributed some of its success to its presence on the platform. Since then, Trump has signed a series of (possibly illegal) executive orders delaying implementation of the ban.

Today, Explained co-host Noel King talked with Wall Street Journal reporter Amrith Ramkumar about this backstory, what a US version of TikTok might look like, and the low-key billionaire who stands to get the keys to the app.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

We are seeing a headline that suggests America is going to get TikTok. What is America going to get, exactly?

The biggest thing is that the app will continue operating in the US. You're going to be able to continue using it. So that's step number one, I think, and that's what the administration is focusing a lot on, that they're the ones that prevented the app from going dark and any changes there.

But if you dig a little deeper, it is also very important that a group of US investors will now gain control of TikTok's US operations. That's been something a lot of people in Washington have been pushing for over five years, and it seems like they're on the doorstep of making that happen.

What about the thing that makes TikTok TikTok, which is the algorithm? Does the US get that too?

That is the tens-of-billions-of-dollars question. Essentially the answer would be yes, based on what the administration and people around TikTok have said. There'd be a complex way of doing this where ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, would copy the algorithm it uses globally and then lease it to this new [US] entity that is being created by this transaction. The new entity would then control it and they would run it. It would be a US-specific algorithm, sort of.

President Trump says he'll sign an executive order about it later this week. What is in the deal? What do we know?

The deal's not done. That's the first thing to understand. It's a preliminary agreement, sort of a framework. This executive order that the president is going to sign is basically going to say, from what we can tell, that we have the contours of the deal and they satisfy the law and the national security conditions. That's one step in the process of finalizing things.

‚ÄúIt's not in their financial interest to come in and make a bunch of changes that overhaul things.‚Äù

Basically, under this deal, US investors and allies essentially will take control of this new entity that's created to run TikTok in the US. The understanding is that this new group of US investors, this consortium, featuring the private equity firm Silver Lake and cloud computing company Oracle, would be part of this group and they would own roughly half of this new entity. Existing ByteDance investors, which include some Trump allies, would own roughly 30 percent. That's what lets ByteDance's ownership stake drop just below the 20 percent outlined in the law. And it's also important to note that that consortium has been changing by the day.

Trump mentioned the Murdochs over the weekend. He said Lachlan [Murdoch] might be involved.

Yes. And we're told that basically means Fox would invest. He mentioned Michael Dell, who's also been reported around this. He could be involved. But Trump loves that element, right? Because now he has this framework agreement and investors are calling saying, We want to be part of this deal because we know this is a very valuable company and a lucrative opportunity. And so now he can sort of pick and choose who he lets in.

So Oracle has a significant stake. Others may join, others may drop out, but Oracle is a real player here, and we can't talk about Oracle without talking about Larry Ellison. Who is Larry Ellison?

How much time do you have? Larry Ellison is one of the richest men in the world. He co-founded Oracle. Start there. Oracle is one of the most important tech companies that most regular people have never heard about. They're experts at working with large databases, which are key to the social media industry. More importantly now, Oracle is now seen as one of the leading AI companies because they do AI infrastructure and they work with companies like OpenAI.

But Larry Ellison has also expanded in other ways. His family is now preparing a bid for Warner Bros. through their company, Paramount Skydance. He has a lot of money. He's pretty strategic with what he does with it. But yes, this TikTok deal would be his latest big win.

This has made a lot of people quite leery. You have a wealthy old man, a lot of wealthy old men involved in this consortium, Trump-aligned for the most part, controlling TikTok. Will they be able to manipulate the algorithm? Are they the ones who are going to be deciding what I see on TikTok?

That's another really good question and something that hasn't been fully addressed yet. I think priority one is showing they can run the app. They still have to prove the basic business case, the justification for doing a deal worth many billions of dollars.

It's not in their financial interest to come in and make a bunch of changes that overhaul things. These people just want this deal done. TikTok just wants to operate in the US and users just want the experience to remain the same. Making changes or doing things that would be very disruptive seems against their own interests there.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Business leaders, including Jensen Huang, Sam Altman, and Jamie Dimon, react to Trump's H-1B visa fee","https://www.businessinsider.com/business-leaders-react-trump-h-1b-visa-fee-2025-9","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 02:02:00 GMT","

Business leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix chairman Reed Hastings have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering.

On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The White House told Business Insider that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

Do you have experience with the H-1B visa program? Business Insider wants to hear from you. Please fill out this quick form.

The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. All three companies told their employees on the visa not to leave the US or to quickly return to the country if they were overseas.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday.

""We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream,"" Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

""Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making,"" Huang added.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of a $100,000 fee to the H-1B visa program was the right move.

""We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me,"" Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday.

Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a ""great solution"" compared to the existing lottery system.

Hastings said in an X post on Sunday that he has ""worked on H-1B politics for 30 years.""

""It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs,"" he wrote.

""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent.

""Apple, Oracle, Google all started in a garage. They could have not afforded to do this. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew,"" O'Leary told Fox Business's ""Varney & Co."" on Monday.

""I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries,"" he added.

O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US.

""Why train them and kick them out? And if they're available, let's take them all and not charge a 100 grand. We should give them a 100 grand to come here,"" he said.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India.

In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only ""buying massive amounts of Russian Oil"" but also ""selling it on the Open Market for big profits.""

The US and India are in the middle of trade negotiations. More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India.

""It's a negotiation with India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US,"" Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that ""caught everyone off guard.""

In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports ""merit-based immigration "" and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order.

""I would beg the president,"" he said. ""He has accomplished border control, that's great, I mean, I think all nations want real border control, that helps make a nation, but after that, we should have good immigration,"" he said.

A Business Insider analysis earlier this year showed that JPMorgan is a top user of H-1B visas. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them.

Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a ""material opportunity"" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector.

""So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America ‚Äî I'll come to Canada,'"" McKay said.

The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help ""build and drive"" technology forward.

""Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears,"" Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday.

""Some sand in the gears is acceptable. It is going to be the competitive landscape and we will comply with it,"" he said. ""But it does decelerate access to certain talents.""

In an editorial published in the Financial Times on Wednesday, Michael Moritz, a longtime partner in Sequoia Capital, criticized the H-1B visa reform and how it was announced.

""As usual with the Trump administration, the announcement was chaotic and half-baked,"" Moritz wrote. ""It was yet another distraction for the management teams of America's leading companies, already whipsawed by various other presidential edicts.""

""The large tech companies hire foreign nationals because they possess particular skills,"" he added. ""They don't do so, as Trump seems to believe, to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons.""

Moritz said that the $100,000 fee will scatter jobs to other tech hubs like Istanbul, Warsaw, or Bengaluru, where engineers are as qualified as their American counterparts.

""Like other Trump schemes, this H-1B caper will backfire,"" he wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Every company on Trump's growing list of US investments and equity stakes","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-investment-companies-us-government-equity-stake","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 10:29:00 GMT","

Thanks to President Donald Trump, Uncle Sam has a burgeoning portfolio.

Once considered rare, Trump and his team have pushed the US to consider taking stakes in private companies.

""You have stupid people say, 'That's a shame.' It's not a shame, that's called business."" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on August 25.

At the time, Trump defended his decision to take a 9.9% stake in Intel, a once-dominant chipmaker, over criticism that such industrial policy isn't how the US typically operates. He said that he wants ""to get as much as I can.""

""I hope I'm going to have many more cases like it,"" Trump said of the Intel deal.

The deals keep coming. Most recently, the Trump administration has entered talks with Lithium Americas to take a small stake in the Canadian mining company.

Here is a look at all the companies that Trump is targeting.

Under Trump's leadership, the US converted roughly $11 billion in Biden-era Chips Act grants into a 10% equity stake. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who helped lead the talks with the chipmaker, said it was a mistake to award grants without securing anything in return.

""America should get the benefit of the bargain,"" Lutnick told CNBC before the deal ultimately came together. ""I mean, that is exactly Donald Trump's perspective, which is, Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money? What is in it for the American taxpayer?' And the answer Donald Trump has is we should get an equity stake for our money.""

Intel shares have gone up over 25% in the month since the announcement. The company has also cautioned in securities filings that the US stake could pose some risks, including potentially hurting international sales.

In July, the Defense Department announced that it would become the largest shareholder in MP Materials after agreeing to buy $400 million worth of shares.

MP Materials owns the operational rare earth mine in the US. Trump administration officials have said it is a national security risk for the US to continue to rely on China and other foreign nations for the key minerals needed for everything from iPhones to military jet engines.

MP Materials CEO James Litinsky said that he views the deal as a ""public-private partnership"" that is different than the government's agreement with Intel.

""Those are scenarios where you had commitments from a past administration, where the Trump administration has come in and said, wait a second, you had no-strings attached commitments to companies, we think we should get a piece of the action,"" Litinsky told CNBC.

Shares in MP Materials have roughly doubled since the deal became public.

A Trump administration official confirmed to Business Insider that the Trump administration is asking for a small equity stake in Lithium Americas as part of a broader renegotiation of a $2.26 billion government loan.

Lithium Americas said it is in discussions with the Department of Energy and General Motors, its partner in a mining project in Thacker Pass, as first reported by Reuters. The Nevada area where the mine is located is believed to have one of the world's largest lithium deposits.

Trump approved the project during his first term, but the Energy Department loan was finalized during the Biden administration.

The administration official said the Energy Department agreed to restructure the loan by pushing out part of its repayment. In exchange, the Trump administration wanted a ""very, very small equity share"" to ""create more of a cash buffer for the project.""

Shares in Lithium Americas went up over 93% on September 24 after news of a potential stake became public.

In August, Lutnick said that the Pentagon was considering taking stakes in defense contractors. He specifically named Lockheed Martin as a potential example.

""They are essentially an arm of the US government,"" Lutnick said of Lockheed.

Asked about any possible discussions, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson praised the contractor's relationship with the Trump administration.

""As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense,"" a spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.

Starbucks on Thursday announced it would close many of its North American stores in addition to sweeping layoffs.

The closures will target locations where Starbucks has found it is ""unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect"" or where it doesn't ""see a path to financial performance,"" according to a statement published by the company.

The company said it was only closing company-operated stores, of which it had 11,453 as of June 29, 2025. While the exact number of stores to be closed remains unclear, the closures will represent about 1% of those stores.

Starbucks ended its 2024 fiscal year with 18,424 open stores in North America, including 7,281 licensed storefronts, which aren't affected by the announcement. It will end fiscal year 2025 ‚Äî which ends on September 29 ‚Äî with 18,300 open stores across the continent, per the company's announcement.

Starbucks staff in affected stores will be notified of the changes this week, with efforts made to transfer employees in closing stores to open locations nearby, the company said. Where transfers cannot be made, employees will be eligible for severance packages, the company added.

In a statement provided to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United, which represents 12,000 baristas across 45 states and Washington, DC, said the union would bargain with the company to ensure those affected are assigned to new stores in accordance with their preferences.

""Fixing what's broken at Starbucks isn't possible without centering the people who engage with the company's customers day in and day out,"" the statement said.

According to an SEC filing released Thursday, the restructuring, which was approved by the Starbucks board of directors on Tuesday, will cost the company around $1 billion.

The filing shows that roughly $150 million in expenses will be related to employee separation benefits, a further $400 million related to the disposal of store assets from closed locations, and about $450 million in costs related to early lease terminations at affected stores.

The company said that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, it will continue to grow the number of coffeehouses it operates and refurbish more than 1,000 existing locations as it continues to invest in the business.

In addition to the store closures, the company announced that about 900 non-retail employees will be laid off on Friday. It also announced it would offer severance packages in addition to benefits extensions to affected employees.

""I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve,"" CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement about the changes.

Thursday's announcement is the second round of layoffs for Starbucks employees this year. Business Insider previously reported the company laid off 1,100 corporate staffers in February.

Consulting firms may be less outspoken than tech CEOs, but they're staring down the same staffing problem as Silicon Valley after President Donald Trump introduced a $100,000 H-1B application fee last Friday.

The H-1B program temporarily allows employers to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized jobs.

The Department of Labor reports that nearly 50% of H-1B applications are related to ""professional, scientific, and technical services"" ‚Äî with professional services typically referring to the consulting and accounting work carried out by firms like Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC.

James Ransome, a partner and strategy consulting lead at Patrick Morgan ‚Äî a firm focused on executive recruitment and industry analysis ‚Äî said that Friday's executive order had raised concern over talent acquisition among consulting leaders.

""For many firms, the H-1B route has been a steady pipeline for mid-level consultants with strong technical and analytical skills, roles that are difficult to fill at scale in the US domestic market. Leaders are concerned this change adds further friction at a time when competition for talent is already high,"" said Ransome.

According to the US government's H-1B employer data hub, Deloitte, EY, and Accenture are the professional services firms that hire the most employees with H-1B visas.

In the last three years up to April 2025, Deloitte hired 7,535 workers on H-1B visas, making it the eleventh largest US employer of H-1B visa holders. The number represents roughly 1% of its most recently reported US head count.

At Accenture and EY, H-1B visa holders hired in the last three years ‚Äî 5,862 and 5,298, respectively ‚Äî represent almost 10% of each firm's last reported US headcounts of around 60,000. The data does not reflect how many remain employed by the firms.

Deloitte, EY, and Accenture did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Ransome said he expected the Big Four and top-tier firms to absorb some of the higher costs of the visas to maintain staffing continuity. But they would likely take a ""dual approach"" and shift their staffing models alongside any cost absorption, he said.

Smaller players in the consulting industry will need to up their ability to attract domestic talent, especially mid-level hires, he added.

Competition over tech talent has become a defining pressure point for consulting firms as they race to develop the strongest AI offering for clients, and the H-1B executive order will add to that pressure.

Consulting firms competing for data scientists and other highly technical specialists will feel the competition increase, Tom Rodenhauser, a consulting analyst and the managing partner at Kennedy Intelligence, told Business Insider.

The two experts told BI that Trump's executive order is also likely to make offshoring hubs more attractive to firms.

""Consulting is mobile in the sense that individuals don't need to be based in the US to serve customers,"" said Rodenhauser. Firms can simply relocate resources to bypass the disruption caused by the visa situation, he said.

For years, top firms have used labor arbitrage to bolster their revenue streams, setting up nearshore and offshore centers in countries like India, Mexico, Argentina, and the Philippines.

The reliance on foreign hubs has increased as technical capabilities within offshore centers have improved, and AI has reduced the demand for junior workers in US offices.

In August, BI obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. One of the three reasons the firm gave in the presentation was ""further AC integration,"" referring to PwC's acceleration centers, its name for its offshore hubs.

Ransome said consultancies have already been reassessing the balance between onshore client-facing teams and offshore delivery hubs, and the potential changes around H-1B visas would accelerate those strategies.

""Rather than simply paying more across the board, they'll use this moment to rethink leverage models: higher-value, client-facing work anchored onshore, with more delivery capability shifted offshore.""

Nearshore hubs, like those in Canada, would start looking more attractive. Toronto, given its proximity to New York and Chicago, would be particularly appealing, Ransome said.

For midsize firms, without the infrastructure or scale to rely on foreign hubs, the H-1B price hike will be more disruptive, he said.

In this article

Microsoft said Thursday that it has stopped providing certain services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The company did not say which specific services it had stopped providing.

The decision comes after the software company investigated an August report from The Guardian saying the Israeli Defense Forces' Unit 8200 had built a system for tracking Palestinians' phone calls.

""While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, wrote in an email to employees. ""This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services.""

Microsoft's decision to stop providing those services follows pressure from employees who have protested Israel's use of the company's company's software as part of its invasion of Gaza. Over the last few weeks, Microsoft has fired five employees who participated in protests at company headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

The move comes a week after a United Nations commission said that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians with its invasion of Gaza.

Microsoft told Israeli defense officials that it had decided to disable cloud-based storage an artificial intelligence subscriptions the agency was using, Smith wrote. He said Microsoft does not look at customer data for the type of review it conducted, and he thanked the British newspaper for its reporting on the development.

""As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust,"" Smith wrote.

On Thursday The Guardian reported that unnamed intelligence sources had said Unit 8200 was planning to migrate its supply of the phone calls to Amazon Web Services, the market-leading public cloud. AWS did not immediately comment.

In this article

Amazon will pay $2.5 billion to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that the company duped users into paying for Prime memberships, the regulatory agency announced Thursday.

The surprise settlement comes as Amazon and the FTC were just three days into the trial in a Seattle federal court. Opening arguments in the case occurred Tuesday, but the settlement allows Amazon to avoid having a jury at the trial return a verdict with potentially larger damages than the settlement with the FTC.

The lawsuit, filed by the FTC in June 2023 under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon deceived tens of millions of customers into signing up for its Prime subscription program and sabotaged their attempts to cancel it. Three senior Amazon executives were at risk of being held individually liable if the jury sided with the FTC.

Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty to the FTC and will refund $1.5 billion to an estimated 35 million customers impacted by ""unwanted Prime enrollment or deferred cancellation,"" the agency said. Under the terms of the settlement, Amazon will give $51 to eligible customers within 90 days. 

Amazon admitted no wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, the FTC said.

The agreement prohibits Amazon from misrepresenting the terms of Prime. It also requires the company to make clear and conspicuous disclosures about the terms of the program during enrollment, and says Amazon must get consumers' express consent before charging them for a subscription. Amazon also has to provide an easy way for users to cancel their subscription, the agency said.

As part of the settlement, Amazon and two of its executives, Prime boss Jamil Ghani and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in the company's health division who previously held a role in the Prime business, will be prohibited from unlawful conduct.

FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson called the penalty a ""monumental win"" for the agency under the Trump administration.

""The Trump-Vance FTC is committed to fighting back when companies try to cheat ordinary Americans out of their hard-earned pay,"" Ferguson said in a statement.

Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin said in a statement that the company and its executives ""have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers.""

The penalty is one of the largest ever imposed by the FTC. The agency in 2019 hit Facebook, now known as Meta, with a $5 billion fine for violating consumers' privacy.

Still, the $2.5 billion fine is equivalent to roughly 0.1% of Amazon's market cap, which now sits at close to $2.4 trillion. Shares of Amazon were up slightly following the announcement.

Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. Data has shown that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members.

Amazon still faces a bigger legal case with the FTC.

In 2023, the regulator accused the company of illegally stifling competition in the e-commerce market. The FTC was joined by attorneys general from 17 states, in alleging Amazon used ""monopoly power"" to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.

Amazon won partial dismissal of the case last year, but is still slated to go to trial against the FTC in 2027.Earlier this month, the U.S. district judge overseeing Google's antitrust case ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Google lost the case against the government last year, but was spared of having to divest of any key assets.

Robert Kraft, who paid $172 million for the New England Patriots in 1994, has agreed to sell 8% of the NFL team to two groups in a deal that values the franchise at $9 billion, according to two sources who have first-hand knowledge of the deal but are not authorized to speak about it publicly.

The money the team will get from selling the 8% stake is going to stay on the Patriots' balance sheet, according to one person close to the situation, meaning the post-money valuation of the Patriots is greater than $9 billion.

The sale does not include the New England Revolution, the Major League Soccer team also owned by the Kraft family, according to one source close to the deal.

The buyers are Sixth Street Capital, at about 3%, and Dean Metropoulos with about 5%, according to a person with first-hand knowledge of the deal who is not authorized to speak about it. Metropoulos is listed by Forbes as having a net worth of $4.1 billion.

The minority stake sale of the Patriots must still be approved by the NFL's finance committee.

Two other minority stake sales are slated to be voted on by the league's finance committee in October. First, a 10% sale of the New York Giants to Julia Koch, which would give the team a $10.3 billion valuation, according to an NFL owner. And Sports Business Journal reported about a vote on a 3.2% sale of the San Francisco 49ers to Fortress Investment Group Chairman Pete Briger Jr. at a $8.6 billion valuation.

Several days ago, a 2.35% stake of the Chicago Bears changed hands at a valuation of $8.9 billion.

The Patriots also own Gillette Stadium, which opened in 2002 and was renovated at a cost of $250 million in 2023. According an internal NFL document obtained by CNBC, last season the Patriots raked in $118 million in ticket receipts, 11th-highest in the league.

Earlier this month CNBC valued the Patriots at $9.25 billion, fifth-most among the league's 32 teams. The Patriots have won six Super Bowls, all under Kraft's ownership, and are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in football.

It's been a terrific year for stocks so far. Despite some turbulence in the spring, the S&P 500, a measure of the broad U.S. stock market, is up more than 12% since the year began.

It's a runup that has some market watchers wondering if investors have gotten out over their skis. In a speech in Rhode Island on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell fielded a question about how central bankers factor market prices into their decision making.

""We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we're trying to achieve,"" Powell said. ""But you're right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued."" 

Powell doesn't just mean that stock prices are flirting with record highs. He means that stocks are looking overvalued ‚Äî a sentiment that sent markets slightly lower.

""Probably the oldest tenet in investing is 'buy low, sell high,'"" Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, previously told CNBC Make It. While a long-term, diversified approach is typically recommended for everyday investors, the professionals are also attuned to the market's cycles. They typically hope to buy when stocks are cheap and sell when they're expensive.

It's impossible to know which ""measures"" Powell is looking at. But often, when experts value stocks, they generally they look at price-to-earnings ratio. The popular valuation metric, also known as P/E, currently shows that stocks are, indeed, pricey. In fact, the S&P 500 currently trades at a 41% premium to its 20-year average, according to CFRA.

To determine how attractively a stock is priced, Wall Street analysts don't just look at the share price. Instead, they compare the price with one of the company's underlying fundamentals, such as sales, cash flow or, most popularly, earnings.

Because investors reap the rewards of corporate profitability over time, they're willing to pay more than the company brings in, in order to own a piece of it, in the form of stock. This amount is expressed by dividing the share price by the company's earnings per share to get the price-to-earnings ratio.

If a stock sells for $10 and is projected to realize $2 in earnings per share over the next 12 months, it has a P/E of 5.

In a vacuum, that doesn't mean much. But it's a great way to compare one investment to another, or to compare an asset or an index to a historical average.

Looking at the S&P 500, stocks in the index currently trade at 23.8 times their projected earnings over the next 12 months. Over the past two decades, the index has an average P/E of 16.8. That means stocks are about 41% more expensive now than they have been over the past 20 years.

Applying the same logic, you could say that the S&P's P/E high ratio means that U.S. stocks are more expensive than international firms, whose S&P indexes trade at a P/E of 15.7. You could also say that a small-company index, such as the S&P SmallCap 600, with its P/E of 17.1, trades at a discount to the large-company S&P 500.

None of that is to say that the S&P will go down tomorrow or that foreign stocks or smaller-company stocks will outperform over the next year. Historically, the market operates in cycles, with different asset classes taking turns in the proverbial lead.

Over the long run, the fast-growing names that lead the market lose their luster, and prices come down, while under-loved, ""value"" stocks return to the fore, Charles Rotblut, vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors, previously told CNBC Make It.

He doesn't advise making wholesale changes to your portfolio based on short-term conditions in the market, but says it's worth paying attention to where things stand in a cyclical market and making sure you're adequately diversified.

""We know over the long term, there are periods where growth outperforms and there's periods where value outperforms, so we do see that pendulum swinging back and forth,"" Rotblut says. ""I don't think this time is any different.""

The White House warned federal agencies to prepare for mass firings if Congress does not reach a deal to fund the government before next Wednesday.

A memo released Wednesday by the Office of Management and Budget told agencies whose funding expires Oct. 1 ‚Äî and which do not have alternative funding sources and are ""not consistent with the President's priorities"" ‚Äî to consider issuing reduction-in-force notices for employees.

The warning ratchets up the pressure on Congress to strike a deal to avert a government shutdown, as thousands of government workers' jobs could be on the line.

In past shutdowns, federal workers were typically temporarily furloughed until a budget deal was reached.

In 2013, the last year that there was a full government shutdown, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

""Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown,"" OMB said in the memo, which was first reported on by Politico. CNBC separately obtained the document.

The memo is the latest attempt to pressure Congressional Democrats to agree to a deal with Republicans to avert a shutdown.

""We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary,"" the memo said.

But with just days to go until late Tuesday night, when government funding is set to expire, lawmakers are still far from striking a deal.

Democrats are holding firm on demands that any legislation must include an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits, which are currently set to expire at the end of the year.

Earlier this month, the House passed a stopgap spending measure that would have funded the government through Nov. 21.  But Senate Democrats blocked the measure.

Democrats quickly condemned the OMB memo.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it ""an attempt at intimidation.""

""Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one ‚Äî not to govern, but to scare,"" Schumer said. ""This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government,"" he said.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Trump and ""MAGA extremists"" of ""plotting mass firings of federal workers starting October 1.""

Jeffries, D-N.Y., an X post blasted OMB Director Russell Vought.

""Listen Russ, you are a malignant political hack. We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,"" Jeffries wrote. ""Get lost.""

""Their goal is to ruin your life and punish hardworking families already struggling with Trump Tariffs and inflation,"" Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote in another tweet. 

""Remember in November,"" he said, referring to next year's mid-term elections, when every House seat will be up for grabs.

Initial claims for unemployment insurance were well below expectations last week, helping to douse caution at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere that the labor market is in danger.

First-time filings for the week ended Sept. 20 totaled a seasonally adjusted 218,000, down 14,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised figure and significantly less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 235,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

Continuing claims, which run a week behind, were little changed, falling 2,000 to 1.926 million.

The release comes just a week after the Federal Reserve voted to lower its benchmark borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 4%-4.25%.

In its post-meeting statement released Sept. 17, the Federal Open Market Committee said that part of the reasoning for the easing, the first in 2025, was that ""downside risks to employment have risen."" Indeed, nonfarm payrolls growth has slowed to a crawl and the level of job openings is at a multiyear low.

However, the claims data, despite a bump earlier in the month, has shown that companies are still reluctant to part with workers even if hiring has declined considerably.

The claims data can be volatile, with Texas showing big gyrations in recent weeks. The state recorded a decline of nearly 7,000 filings last week, according to unadjusted figures.

Despite concerns rising that the economy could be slowing into the back part of the year, the economic data has remained fairly solid, and other reports Thursday confirmed underlying strength.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic growth, posted a gain of 3.8% in the second quarter, according to the last of the three estimates that the Commerce Department released Thursday. The report reflected an unusually large upward adjustment of half a percentage point, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis attributed to a revision to consumer spending. GDP declined 0.6% in Q1, a slight downshift from the prior estimate.

Personal consumption expenditures, which drive about two-thirds of the $30 trillion U.S. economy, increased 2.5%, well above the 1.6% figure in the second estimate and better than the 0.6% rate in the first quarter.

In yet another sign of strength, spending on long-lasting items such as airplanes, appliances and computers increased 2.9% in August, compared with the forecast for a decline of 0.4% and better than the July figure, which showed a drop of 2.7%.

Even excluding transportation, new orders of so-called durable goods rose 0.4% and were up 1.9% when excluding defense.

Fed officials are watching the economic data closely for clues about where they should take policy next, and recent reports have indicated a mostly upbeat picture.

Housing, which has been the weakest spot, has showed some signs of life lately, with sales of newly built homes soaring 20.5% in August, the biggest gain since January 2022. Existing home sales totaled an annualized rate of 4 million for the month, slightly better than expected.

Despite the solid data, markets still expect the Fed to cut twice more this year, at its meetings in October and December.

In a speech Tuesday, Chair Jerome Powell said the economy ""is showing resilience in the midst of substantial changes in trade and immigration policies, as well as in fiscal, regulatory and geopolitical arenas.""

Still, he left room for additional easing, noting that policy is still ""modestly restrictive"" on growth.

U.S. startup airline Breeze Airways is planning to fly internationally for the first time early next year, aiming to win over sun-seeking travelers as the carrier enters its fifth year of flying.

The airline's host of seasonal service kicks off on Jan. 10 with a Saturday-only route between Norfolk, Virginia, and Cancun, Mexico, followed by roundtrips between Charleston, South Carolina, and Cancun on Jan. 17, also only on Saturdays.

Other routes include Saturday service to Cancun starting from New Orleans on Feb. 7 and from Providence, Rhode Island, a week later. In March, Breeze is also planning to start Thursday and Saturday service between Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina and Montego Bay, Jamaica, and Wednesday and Saturday service to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Flights from Tampa, Florida, to Montego Bay start on Feb. 11.

Breeze was launched by JetBlue's founder, David Neeleman, and debuted during the pandemic, in May 2021. The airline now serves 81 cities, with 291 nonstop routes, and a spokeswoman for the carrier said Breeze is the only airline serving 83% of them.

The carrier has been working for years with the Federal Aviation Administration to win certification to fly internationally, Lukas Johnson, Breeze's chief commercial officer, said in an interview.

It's the first sizeable U.S. passenger airline to win that certification since Virgin America, which was acquired by Alaska Airlines in 2016, Johnson said.

He said Breeze is continuing its business model of flying its Airbus A220-300s between cities that have little to no competition from rivals and added that the new routes are ""an exciting starting point for us.""

""We feel really confident that it's going to be a great guest response,"" he said.

Fares for the new routes start as low as $99 one way, but Johnson said premium-class demand for its pricier, roomier seats has been strong and that there is a double-digit percentage of guests who book to a more expensive seat the second time they fly Breeze.

In this article

Starbucks announced a $1 billion restructuring plan Thursday that involves closing some of its North American coffeehouses and laying off more workers as it moves ahead with its ""Back to Starbucks"" transformation under CEO Brian Niccol.

The number of company-operated stores in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal 2025, accounting for both openings and closures, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That figure translates to roughly 500 gross closures, according to TD Cowen estimates.

Approximately 900 nonretail employees will be laid off on Friday, Starbucks said.

Starbucks estimates that 90% of the expected $1 billion restructuring cost will be attributable to the North America business. In total, the company expects to incur about $150 million in employee separation costs, plus about $850 million in restructuring charges related to the store closures, according to the filing. A significant portion of expenses will be incurred in fiscal 2025, it said.

The company plans to end its fiscal year with almost 18,300 North American locations, including both company-operated and licensed cafes. Starbucks plans to start growing its footprint again in fiscal 2026.

Starbucks said in the filing it is prioritizing investment ""closer to the coffeehouse and the customer"" as it looks to reverse a sales slump in its biggest market. The company's same-store sales have fallen for six straight quarters, hurt by increased competition and price-conscious consumers.

This is the second round of layoffs in Niccol's tenure, after 1,100 corporate workers were let go earlier this year. Starbucks ended 2024 with about 16,000 employees who work outside of store locations.

""These steps are to reinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them,"" Niccol wrote in a letter to employees Thursday. ""I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve.""

In July, the company announced its biggest investment ever into labor and operating standards, ""Green Apron Service,"" which involves a more than $500 million investment in labor hours across company-owned cafes in the next year.

In an interview earlier this month, Niccol told CNBC, ""I really hope we're moving towards being the world's greatest customer service company, [and] the world's greatest customer-centric company.""

In the message to employees Thursday, Niccol said the company had reviewed and identified stores where the company would be ""unable to to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance."" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients that the store closures are ""more than we anticipated.""

Starbucks executives had previously said that the company would be slowing new openings in favor of remodeling existing locations this year. The renovated cafes are meant to encourage customers to linger, taking the coffee chain back to its roots as a ""third place"" for consumers, outside of home and the office.

Baristas from closing locations will be transferred to nearby locations or, in some cases, receive severance packages, Niccol said in his letter to employees. Starbucks Workers United, which represents 12,000 baristas across more than 650 cafes, said in a statement to CNBC that it will be sending a formal request to the company about the closures.

""We expect to engage in effects bargaining for every impacted union store, as we have done elsewhere, so workers can be placed in another Starbucks store according to their preferences,"" the union said in the statement.

Following Thursday's announcement, share of Starbucks were down less than 1% in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen more than 8% this year.

In addition to focusing on the customer experience, Niccol has enacted additional changes to operations including a return to four days in office, beginning next month.

He's also brought on a new executive team including CFO Cathy Smith, Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman and Chief Operating Officer Mike Grams. Lieberman and Grams worked with Niccol in his previous roles at Chipotle and Yum Brands.

Read Niccol's full memo to Starbucks staff:

Partners,

I'm grateful for the work everyone is doing to put world-class customer service at the center of everything we do and focus on creating an elevated Starbucks experience for every customer, every time.

While we're making good progress, there is much more to do to build a better, stronger and more resilient Starbucks. As we approach the beginning of our new fiscal year, I'm sharing two decisions we've made in support of our Back to Starbucks plan. Both are grounded in putting our resources closest to the customer so we can create great coffeehouses, offer world-class customer service and grow the business.

Changes to some of our coffeehouses

First, I shared earlier this year that we were carefully reviewing our North America coffeehouse portfolio through the additional lens of our Back to Starbucks plan. Our goal is for every coffeehouse to deliver a warm and welcoming space with a great atmosphere and a seat for every occasion.

During the review, we identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed.

Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers. Our coffeehouses are centers of the community, and closing any location is difficult.

To put it into context: Since we've already opened numerous coffeehouses over the past year, our overall company-operated count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025 after accounting for both openings and closures.

We will end the fiscal year with nearly 18,300 total Starbucks locations ‚Äì company operated and licensed ‚Äì across the U.S. and Canada. In fiscal year 2026, we'll grow the number of coffeehouses we operate as we continue to invest in our business. Over the next 12 months, we also plan to uplift more than 1,000 locations to introduce greater texture, warmth and layered design.

Partners in coffeehouses scheduled to close will be notified this week. We're working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them.

For those we can't immediately place, we're focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages. We also hope to welcome many of these partners back to Starbucks in the future as new coffeehouses open and the number of partners in each location grows.

Reducing non-retail partner roles

Second, we're further reducing non-retail headcount and expenses. This includes the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 900 current non-retail partner roles and close many open positions.

As we build toward a better Starbucks, we're investing in green apron partner hours, more partners in stores, exceptional customer service, elevated coffeehouse designs and innovation to create the future. We will continue to carefully manage costs and stay focused on the key areas that drive long-term growth.

Non-retail partners whose roles are being eliminated will be notified tomorrow morning (Friday). We will offer generous severance and support packages including benefits extensions.

Unless your job specifically requires you to be on site in the office, we're asking you to work from home today and tomorrow.

What's next

These steps are to reinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them. Early results from coffeehouse uplifts show customers visiting more often, staying longer and sharing positive feedback. Where we've invested in more green apron partner hours so that there are more partners working at busy times, we saw improvements in transactions, sales, and service times, alongside happier, more engaged partners.

I know these decisions impact our partners and their families, and we did not make them lightly. I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers and the communities we serve.

To those partners who will be leaving, I want to say a profound thank you. To those continuing on our turnaround journey, I deeply appreciate your commitment to helping us get back to Starbucks.

Brian

In this article

The European Commission launched an antitrust probe into German software behemoth SAP on Thursday, citing concerns about the company's practices in software support services.

According to the Commission, the investigation will assess ""whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies' business operations.""

SAP, in a statement on Thursday, said it believed its policies and actions were fully compliant with EU competition rules.

""However, we take the issues raised seriously and we are working closely with the EU Commission to resolve them,"" a spokesperson said. ""We do not anticipate the engagement with the European Commission to result in material impacts on our financial performance.""

SAP is one of Europe's most valuable companies, with a market cap of almost 282 billion euros ($331 billion). Shares of the firm moved lower on Thursday, losing 2% by 12:45 p.m. in London (7:45 a.m. ET).

The EU probe relates to a piece of SAP software called Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP.

ERP is widely used by large corporations to manage their everyday finance and accounting needs. SAP is a major player in the space ‚Äî but it isn't alone. The company competes with the likes of Microsoft and Oracle, which offer their own ERP products.

Specifically, the European Commission said it was addressing the so-called ""on-prem"" version of SAP ERP. On-prem refers to software that is hosted on a company's own servers, as opposed the cloud where it can be remotely accessed via SAP data centers.

Much of SAP's business still comes from its on-prem IT services. However, the company has for years been attempting to shift more of its focus to the cloud ‚Äî particularly as it faces competition from technology giants like Microsoft and Amazon, which dominate the market for public cloud services.

The latest EU antitrust probe is noteworthy as it doesn't involve Big Tech.

Much of the bloc's work on competition policy has focused on the market power of U.S. technology giants. This has led to criticisms from both the tech sector and politicians in the U.S., who say American tech firms are being unfairly targeted. On Wednesday, Apple urged a repeal of the Digital Markets Act, the EU's landmark digital competition law, saying it was ""leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU.""

British artificial intelligence infrastructure firm Nscale is raising heaps of cash as it looks to ramp up the deployment of AI data centers across Europe.

Nscale, which is based in London, said Thursday that it has raised $1.1 billion in a bumper Series B funding round. The investment was led by Aker, the Norwegian industrial investment company, with additional participation from a raft of firms including Nvidia, Nokia and Dell.

The investment highlights continued demand for high-powered computing infrastructure, which is required to train and run powerful foundational AI models from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google.

Nscale has become a central player in Britain's ambition to become a global AI powerhouse. Last week, the likes of Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI announced multibillion-dollar projects involving Nscale to build out AI computing infrastructure across the U.K.

""We are creating one of the largest global [infrastructure] platforms of its kind ‚Äì purpose-built to meet surging demand and unlock breakthroughs at unprecedented scale,"" said Josh Payne, Nscale's CEO and co-founder, in a statement.

""This allows Nscale to provide our customers access to scarce, and highly sought after, compute capacity and rapidly accelerate the build-out of secure, compliant and energy-efficient AI infrastructure,"" he added.

Nscale was spun out from Arkon Energy, an Australian cryptocurrency mining firm, in 2023 to address soaring demand for data centers capable of handling AI workloads.

It is working with OpenAI in the U.K. and Norway to build new data centers as part of the ChatGPT maker's Stargate investment project. Nscale said that part of the Series B funding would go toward ""enabling the rapid rollout"" of the Stargate data center projects in Europe.

The company is committing $1 billion for the Norwegian project, with the goal of racking up 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) at the site before 2027. The U.K. site, meanwhile, will house 8,000 GPUs in its first phase early next year, with the option to expand capacity to around 31,000 GPUs over time.

The Swiss National Bank said Thursday that tariffs on goods to the U.S. present a ""major challenge"" for exporters, with its economy set to take a hit.

The country has swallowed some of the highest duties imposed by President Donald Trump's administration, with a 39% tariff rate implemented in August. It came after a Swiss delegation led by the country's President Karin Keller-Sutter failed to secure a trade deal after meeting with Trump in Washington D.C.

""The U.S. tariffs present a major challenge for affected companies and are likely to dampen economic activity,"" Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel said in a press conference following the central bank's latest interest rate decision.

""Against this backdrop, our monetary policy is also supporting economic development.""

The SNB held interest rates at 0% in a widely expected move on Thursday.

Schlegel told CNBC that the tariffs are expected to hit exporters, but that the impact on the economy more broadly should be muted.

""The exporters that are directly affected, for them this is very challenging, very difficult, but if you look at the economy as a whole, the impact is limited,"" he told CNBC. ""We don't see a recession in the coming quarter so for 2025, we have growth of 1 to 1.5%, in 2026 we still see growth of roughly 1% so we don't see a recession.""

Petra Schudin, a governing board member at the central bank, said in the press conference that the economic outlook for Switzerland had ""deteriorated due to significantly higher U.S. tariffs,"" which were likely to hit exports and investments.

The machinery and watchmaking industries will be most affected by the levies, according to Schudin.

""As a result of the tariffs and the high level of uncertainty, we expect growth of just under 1% for 2026,"" he added.

It marks a downgrade from the 1%-1.5% growth expectation for next year stated at the central bank's June policy meeting.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped below $112,000 on Thursday amid a broader sell-off in crypto and stocks.

While the largest cryptocurrency declined 2%, ethereum (ETH-USD), solana (SOL-USD), and other coins saw larger declines in what has been a rocky week for the crypto market.

Ether fell roughly 5% to below $4,000 before paring losses, marking its lowest level since August, as ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net outflows over the past 24 hours.

""The persistent downward pressure is rooted in the absence of sufficient buying power to defend prices following the massive wave of liquidations seen on Monday,"" wrote Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at asset brokerage platform XS.com.

Read more about today's market action

""Another round of long liquidations today further weakened sentiment, while corrections in the broader equity market amplified the cautious tone,"" he added.

More than $1.6 billion in long positions was liquidated earlier this week, spooking investors. According to CoinGlass, over the past 24 hours, $511 million across all cryptoassets was liquidated.

The action comes as stocks decline from recent records amid investor concerns of frothiness driven by AI enthusiasm and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates.

Strategists have pointed to September as a seasonally volatile month for crypto, with the last three months of the year typically ushering in tailwinds.

Crypto bulls point to another headwind stemming from the Treasury General Account, which essentially serves as the government's checking account at the Federal Reserve.

The Treasury has been refilling this account in recent weeks by issuing T-bills and bonds, serving as a type of liquidity drain for crypto. The diversion of cash into government debt can reduce demand for risk assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The rout in bitcoin and ether extended into crypto-related stocks on Thursday. Trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) each declined more than 1%.

Bitcoin holder Strategy (MSTR) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) also declined.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum's price dipped below $4,000 for the first time since early August during Thursday morning trading hours.

According to The Block's Ethereum price page, the cryptocurrency traded around $3,999 at around 1:00 a.m. on Thursday. It has since recovered to $4,037, down 2.91% in the past 24 hours.

""Ethereum's recent dip below the psychological $4K mark was triggered by a mix of technical breakdowns, macroeconomic jitters, and cascading liquidations,"" said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. ""A failure to hold the $4,200 support zone led to over US$1.7 billion in altcoin liquidations, with ETH alone accounting for US$212.9 million.""

While the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in September, the 25 basis point rate cut failed to ignite a sustained bull rally as once expected. One of the factors was Chair Jerome Powell's comment, saying that he is in no hurry to further lower rates.



On top of that, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds have seen reduced inflows this month. So far in September, ETH ETFs have collectively accumulated only $110 million in net inflows, where August's inflow amount exceeded $3.8 billion.

However, the crypto analyst said long-term holders of ETH are doubling down on the contrary ‚Äî ""On-chain data shows over 420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges this week, suggesting accumulation rather than panic.""

Nassar Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW, also pointed out that Ethereum exchange balances have fallen to lowest levels in nine years, with millions worth of ETH being withdrawn from centralized exchanges.

""[This underscores] a profound shift toward long-term holding amid growing institutional confidence,"" Achkar said. ""This sustained outflow signals a potential supply shock on the horizon, as whales and retail buyers prioritize self-custody and staking yields over short-term trading, potentially setting up ETH's next major price rally towards new all-time highs.""

Something went wrong

Ethereum treasury firm SharpLink Gaming said Thursday that it will tokenize its SEC-registered common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain, appointing financial technology firm Superstate as its digital transfer agent.

The Nasdaq-listed company will use Superstate's Opening Bell platform to enable SBET shareholders to hold shares natively on Ethereum while maintaining regulatory compliance, according to a press release shared with Decrypt.

The tokenized shares remain legally equivalent to traditional book-entry equity but can be held in self-custodied wallets and integrated with digital financial products, SharpLink Gaming said.

The company claimed it would be the first publicly traded company to tokenize its shares on Ethereum, though fellow publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BTSC announced a similar move back in 2023.

SharpLink said that its latest move aligns with the SEC's Project Crypto initiative, unveiled in July to lower regulatory burdens for the crypto industry. 

On Tuesday, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said he seeks to institute an ""innovation exemption"" for certain digital assets by year's end.

""Tokenizing SharpLink's equity directly on Ethereum is far more than a technological achievement‚Äîit is a statement about where we believe the future of the global capital markets is headed,"" SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom said.

Superstate previously teamed with firms like Galaxy Digital and Solana treasury firms Forward Industries and Upexi to tokenize shares via the Solana blockchain.

The partnership follows SharpLink's pivot from gambling marketing to a crypto treasury earlier this year, with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin joining as chairman in May during a $425 million funding round led by Consensys.

(Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

‚ÄúWe're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond,‚Äù Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said in the press release.

SharpLink and Superstate plan to explore how tokenized equities could trade on automated market makers and other DeFi protocols while remaining compliant with securities regulations.

SharpLink holds over 838,000 ETH worth approximately $3.3 billion, making it the second-largest publicly traded Ethereum holder behind BitMine Immersion Technologies, per StrategicETHReserve.xyz.

Meanwhile, users on Myriad Markets, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, give BitMine a 91.2% chance of holding more ETH than SharpLink by the last full week of 2025, despite SharpLink's continued accumulation efforts. BitMine currently holds about $9.6 billion worth of ETH.

The world's second-largest cryptocurrency is trading at $3,968, down almost 5% in the last 24 hours and 13% over the past week, according to CoinGecko.

In late August, SharpLink Gaming bought 39,008 ETH worth over $176 million, but has slowed its purchases since then, adding only 922 ETH since August 31.

SharpLink repurchased 1 million SBET shares last week at an average price of $16.67, bringing total buybacks to 1.93 million shares over two weeks using nearly $32 million of its $1.5 billion repurchase program.

SBET shares were recently trading for $16.34, down about 7% on the day.

First Public Company to Natively Issue Equity on the Ethereum Blockchain; Collaboration to Explore Regulated Trading of Tokenized Shares on Automated Market Makers

Minneapolis, MN, Sept.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) ‚Äî SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) (‚ÄúSharpLink‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), one of the world's largest corporate holders of Ether (‚ÄúETH‚Äù) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today announced its intention to tokenize its SEC-registered common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain, appointing financial technology firm Superstate as its Digital Transfer Agent.

By enabling its equity to be tokenized natively onchain, SharpLink aims to demonstrate how public companies can use blockchain infrastructure to create shareholder value, improve market efficiency and drive forward the next generation of capital markets. SharpLink intends to partner with Superstate to tokenize its equity on Ethereum through its Opening Bell platform, expanding Superstate's multichain capital markets infrastructure. 

SharpLink and Superstate also intend to closely collaborate on advancing how tokenized public equities can ultimately trade on Automated Market Makers (‚ÄúAMMs‚Äù) and other decentralized finance (‚ÄúDeFi‚Äù) protocols in a fully compliant manner. This initiative aligns with the SEC's broader Project Crypto innovation agenda aimed at modernizing U.S. securities regulation to better enable digital assets, blockchain and onchain markets. 

This work has the potential to position SharpLink's tokenized equity, along with future Opening Bell tokenizations, for secondary market trading on AMMs. Doing so would demonstrate how compliant tokenized securities can deliver broader utility, enhance liquidity and modernize capital flows for a new era of investor and issuer engagement. 

Commenting on the new partnership with Superstate, SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, stated, ‚ÄúTokenizing SharpLink's equity directly on Ethereum is far more than a technological achievement ‚Äì it is a statement about where we believe the future of the global capital markets is headed. At SharpLink, our core mission is two-fold: to build the world's most trusted digital asset treasury and to pursue initiatives that accelerate the global adoption of the Ethereum network. By working with Superstate, not only are we enabling our shareholders to hold SBET shares natively on Ethereum, but we are also embarking on entirely new frontiers for how compliant, tokenized public equities could one day trade seamlessly through AMMs ‚Äì an evolution we believe could redefine market structure itself.‚Äù

Joseph Lubin, SharpLink's Chairman of the Board, Founder and CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum, added, ‚ÄúWe're proud to have been the first public company to become a Digital Asset Treasury company on Ethereum, onboarding traditional finance to Ethereum. And now we are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum. As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink's conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built.‚Äù

Launched in 2025, Opening Bell is a regulated onchain issuance and tokenization platform that allows companies to tokenize SEC-registered equity via blockchain infrastructure. Shares tokenized with Opening Bell remain fully compliant and legally equivalent to traditional book-entry equity, but can also be held in self-custodied wallets, integrated with digital financial products and made available to global investor segments. 

‚ÄúSharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate's Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company,‚Äù said Superstate CEO Robert Leshner. ‚ÄúWe're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond.‚Äù

Following the appointment of Lubin as Chairman and the forging of its strategic partnership with Consensys, one of the most important companies in the Ethereum ecosystem, SharpLink launched its ETH treasury strategy in early June 2025. Since that time, the Company has accumulated more than 838,000 ETH and generated 3,815 ETH in native and liquid staking rewards as of late September, establishing itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum in the world.

SharpLink Gaming (SBET), the Ethereum treasury firm led by Joseph Lubin, unveiled plans on Thursday to tokenize its equity on the Ethereum blockchain as the stock tokenization trend is gaining steam.

The Minnesota-based firm said it has tapped tokenization specialist Superstate as its digital transfer agent, while its equity token will be natively issued through Superstate's Opening Bell platform, a system designed to issue SEC-registered shares directly on blockchain rails.

The move comes as tokenization of financial instruments such as equity is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A slew of tokenized equity offerings debuted in the past few months predominantly for investors outside the U.S., including by Robinhood, Gemini with Dinari, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance. However, some products drew concerns such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulation.

SharpLink's tokenized stock will be legally identical to traditional equity, while it can be stored in digital wallets and integrated with on-chain protocols, the press release said.

Beyond issuance, SharpLink and Superstate also plan to explore how such shares could eventually trade on decentralized exchanges and automated market makers (AMMs). That step, if approved, would test how tokenized securities can circulate in markets built around smart contracts while remaining compliant with U.S. securities rules.

SharpLink's initiative follows digital asset investment firm Galaxy's (GLXY) similar effort to tokenize its Class A common shares on SOL$197.03 with Opening Bell.

SBET is lower by 7% in early trading Thursday alongside a steep slide in the price of ETH to below $4,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","This Catalyst Will Set Off ‚ÄòAnother Leg Higher' for Bitcoin and Altcoins, Says Real Vision's Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/09/25/this-catalyst-will-set-off-another-leg-higher-for-bitcoin-and-altcoins-says-real-visions-chief-crypto-analyst-jamie-coutts/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 09:16:17 GMT","

The chief crypto analyst at crypto media platform Real Vision, Jamie Coutts, says Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins possess more upside potential.

Coutts tells his 45,700 followers on X that a looser monetary policy could set the conditions necessary for a Bitcoin and altcoins rally, and a bear market thereafter.

‚ÄúCentral banks, if (when) they reverse their balance sheet tightening, will set off another leg higher ‚Äî with the move likely accentuated in altcoins. With that will likely come the conditions for a peak and potentially the setup for a deeper fall than what I would expect, worst case approximately 50%. We aren't anywhere near that yet.‚Äù

According to Coutts, it is unlikely that the crypto market has reached a cycle top yet despite the recent pullback.

‚ÄúLiquidity's still supportive, but momentum refuses to deliver fireworks, frustrating everyone chasing a parabola. Looking ahead, global liquidity is lagging debt growth‚Äîcycle peak? Not likely.‚Äù

On what the lack of ‚Äúfireworks‚Äù could portend for the market, Coutts says,

‚ÄúBitcoin's so-called ‚Äòboring' climb actually echoes the slow crawl in global liquidity this cycle. Ironically, a dull cycle could mean a shallow bear drawdown, but also a longer grind down.‚Äù

Over the long term, Coutts says two factors support the bullish case for Bitcoin.

‚ÄúStill, two secular trends are bulletproof: blockchain adoption and monetary debasement. And for these reasons, it's best to zoom out and remember Bitcoin is fast becoming global collateral, it's an AI-beneficiary technology, the driver of energy grid stabilization/modernization and the anchor asset for global portfolios.‚Äù

Bitcoin is trading at $113,128 at time of writing.

The Philippines has launched a blockchain-based transparency system for its Department of Public Works and Highways after mass protests over alleged corruption in flood-control projects worth billions.

Integrity Chain, developed by BayaniChain Ventures, was unveiled on Wednesday as a platform to record DPWH contracts and project milestones on a tamper-proof ledger.

The goal is to turn ‚Äúgovernment records into digital public assets that are immutable, verifiable, and openly validated,‚Äù BayaniChain CEO and co-founder Paul Soliman told Decrypt.

Once expanded from the DPWH to other agencies, the initiative could later help ‚Äúprotect the entire annual budget of the Philippines,‚Äù estimated at roughly $98 billion, he said.

The project is part of a broader effort ‚Äúto reshape accountability across every department and every peso spent,‚Äù making accountability ‚Äúpermanent, measurable, and unavoidable,‚Äù Soliman said.

‚ÄúPublic trust will be rebuilt not on promises, but on cryptography, open validation, and a system where citizens themselves can verify outcomes,‚Äù he added.

The rollout comes in the wake of mass protests drawing an estimated 130,000 people on September 21, which marked the 53rd anniversary of martial law declared by former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., father of the current president. The declaration is remembered for widespread human rights abuses, censorship, and corruption.

Protests demanded accountability after revelations of overpriced contracts, substandard construction, and ghost projects in the country's flood-control program under the DPWH's oversight.

Over $33 billion was allocated to flood-control projects across 15 years, according to the Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Similar to an earlier implementation at the Department of Budget and Management, Integrity Chain ingests data directly from DPWH systems, minting each contract, budget release, and project milestone as a digital public asset.

Prismo, the orchestration layer, manages data handling, encryption, and validation. The platform runs on Polygon's Proof-of-Stake network, an Ethereum-compatible scaling solution that serves as its consensus and transparency layer.

The records are then cryptographically time-stamped and anchored on-chain before reaching independent validators, so that ‚Äúany attempt to withhold or manipulate information becomes visible rather than hidden,‚Äù Gelo Wong, chief growth officer and co-founder at BayaniChain, told Decrypt.

Validators include independent civic organizations, non-governmental organizations, universities, and media groups, among other sectors. These validators would review and attest to the entries, with their own actions logged as public records to maintain accountability.

Keys for validators are ‚Äúhardware-secured, rotated periodically, and assigned to reviews through randomization,‚Äù with each validator action ‚Äúrecorded on-chain as its own public asset, ensuring that misconduct or bias is transparently logged,‚Äù Wong explained.

Asked about safeguards, Wong pointed to the framework's one-organization-one-vote model, which prevents any sector from dominating the process. More than 40 non-governmental organizations participated at launch, providing a ‚Äúwide and diversified base of civic accountability,‚Äù he added.

The current trajectory of AI, with its concentration of power in the hands of a few, presents significant risks to privacy, fairness, and sustainability


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


While AI has improved our productivity and made our lives easier, its development has created a new kind of corporate monopoly with the potential to create significant societal and economic inequalities.

A few large, centralized companies control the AI landscape. Google has Gemini, OpenAI has ChatGPT, X has Grok and Anthropic has Claude. These entities control the vast majority of AI computing power, data and talent and have a large influence over the direction of the technology.

But there is one solution that is gaining increasing traction with investors and enthusiasts: decentralized AI. This would help bring the increasingly profit-focused technology of cryptography back to its original purpose: privacy.

Founder and CEO of Flock.io.

It is clear that in any area of society, a small group should not hold so much arbitrary power. Throughout history the consequences of this have been profound, and we have seen such issues with AI.

The public has little to no context on how large AI companies collect, process and profit from their personal data. Both personal and corporate data is being collected in extreme quantities without any credit, verification or oversight from the owner of this data.

Centralized AI models can have political biases. A 2025 Stanford University study found that users overwhelmingly perceive that most LLMs have a left-leaning political slant.

Grok has been even accused by some of producing anti-semitic rhetoric and ‚Äúwhite genocide"" misinformation, while Gemini once portrayed Vikings and German WW2 soldiers as people of color.

A lesser known issue is scalability bottlenecks. As the volume and complexity of tasks continue to grow, the limited processing power within centralized systems acts as a constraint. These centralized servers also create a single point of failure, making systems fragile and vulnerable to network attacks and hacks.

More and more computational power is needed for AI, which in turn increases energy usage. By 2030 data centers are projected to account for 20% of global electricity use, at a time of energy scarcity.

First discussed in the mid 2010s, decentralized AI has become increasingly popular in the last two years. One report projects the market size to grow from $550.70 million in 2024 to $4.33 billion by 2034.

Instead of data being collected and stored in a central location, the raw data stays on the local devices, with only the learned insights being shared elsewhere. These insights are stored on a blockchain, which acts as a secure, transparent and decentralized storage solution. Instead of a single entity controlling the data, control is distributed among multiple nodes or participants.

Operations are transparent and verifiable on chain, fostering open-source community-driven development and collaboration. People and entities can also be rewarded for providing their data.

This technology is expected to have monumental impact in a number of areas, including DeFi lending and credit scoring, fraud detection, healthcare, gaming, supply chain management and much more. And we are already seeing real-world use cases.

The benefits of decentralized AI are the exact opposite of the key limitations of centralized AI. The most important part is that people and entities have control over their data. They choose what information to share, rather than it being taken without consent.

Political biases are greatly mitigated. Instead of one entity facilitating its training, a decentralized network allows for a more diverse range of participants and data sources, leading to a border range of perspectives.

Computational requirements are greatly reduced. Workloads are distributed across a network of devices, leveraging their combined processing power. As more devices join the network, processing capacity increases, allowing it to handle larger and more complex tasks more efficiently.

By processing data on local devices and distributing the workload, it avoids the need for energy intensive data centers to handle every task. This can also lead to smarter energy management in other areas, such as using AI to optimize energy grids and manage renewable sources more effectively.

Security is also greatly improved. There is no single point of failure to be exploited, but rather an entire blockchain to preserve information. And much of the time, the personal data doesn't leave the user's device anyway.

The current trajectory of AI, with its concentration of power in the hands of a few, presents significant risks to privacy, fairness, and sustainability. Decentralized AI, with its use of blockchain and federated learning offers a compelling alternative.

The idea of using cryptography to protect individual liberties and privacy to preserve an open society in the electronic age was first proposed by Eric Hughes in ‚ÄòA Cypherpunk's Manifesto'. Since then crypto has become largely about making money. Maybe decentralized AI is the core use case needed to bring it back to its roots.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","AAA Partners With Legal Blockchain Pioneer Integra","https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2025/09/25/aaa-partners-with-legal-blockchain-pioneer-integra/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 11:03:32 GMT","

Just when you thought that blockchain had vanished from legal tech‚Ä¶.here comes the American Arbitration Association and a new deal with Integra Ledger to provide a ‚Äòsecure, blockchain-powered document registration and authentication service'.

And of course, if you are a long-time reader of AL, then you know of Integra already, a company that has pioneered the area of blockchain use in the legal field.

But, you may then ask: ‚ÄòWhy blockchain?' The AAA explained that using the now well-known verifiable ‚Äòtruth' aspect of blockchain means those engaged in an arbitration can ‚Äòuphold the integrity of source documents in an era of increasing AI-driven manipulation and forgery'.

I.e. AI deep fakes are so good now that those involved in a dispute may need to get some additional bona fides for any documents they are using. Blockchain, which although is perhaps not as lauded as it once was beyond the crypto world, can help with this. Hence the deal.

The move follows a series of tech-focused steps that the AAA has taken recently, which includes developing an ‚ÄòAI arbitrator' for construction disputes.

Bridget McCormack, president and CEO of the AAA, commented: ‚ÄòAs AI becomes more advanced, it's essential to preserve trust in the documents that support our legal and commercial systems. Our partnership with Integra Ledger gives parties a way to confirm the authenticity and integrity of their documents, today and in the future. By expanding access to this technology, we're democratizing the tools needed to preserve the integrity of critical information in the age of AI.'

David Fisher, CEO of Integra Ledger, added: ‚ÄòPartnering with the AAA, an organization with nearly a century of leadership in dispute resolution, allows us to bring our blockchain-based document trust technology to the global community. Working with the AAA, we're pleased to make this service available to all who can benefit from it, empowering individuals and organizations with the ability secure trust in their documents for the long term.'

In terms of how it works:

‚Äì

Is this a big deal? Well, the central point about trust is one that blockchain fans have been making now for about a decade. Even so, most blockchain use cases have tended to revolve around crypto and businesses have continued to use their DMSs or other storage systems as usual.

But‚Ä¶perhaps with the rise of deep fakes that may change? The move to use blockchain may become more attractive as the future of document verification becomes more complex. We shall see. AL has always felt that blockchain was useful ‚Äì but it needed to be applied where trust had really evaporated and/or is not present in the system, in order to really maximise the move from regular data stores to this approach. Let's see if it catches on. Maybe this time it's different for legal‚Ä¶?

Legal Innovators Conferences in London and New York ‚Äì November '25

If you'd like to stay ahead of the legal AI curve then come along to Legal Innovators New York, Nov 19 + 20 and also, Legal Innovators UK ‚Äì Nov 4 + 5 + 6, where the brightest minds will be sharing their insights on where we are now and where we are heading.

Introduction 

The digital world is changing fast, and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are at the heart of this change. Business owners, entrepreneurs, and creators are searching for ways to build platforms like OpenSea to connect with collectors and generate new revenue. The demand for NFT Marketplace Development Services is growing because such platforms allow users to trade unique digital assets with security, transparency, and speed.

Building your own NFT marketplace may seem complex, but with the right strategy, tools, and guidance, you can create a successful business in this booming industry. Let's walk through how you can design and launch an NFT marketplace like OpenSea.

Key Features of OpenSea-Style NFT Marketplaces

An NFT marketplace must be easy to use, secure, and scalable. If your platform lacks these elements, users will move elsewhere. Here are some must-have features:

User-Friendly Dashboard: Buyers and sellers should navigate with ease.

Advanced Search and Filters: Helps collectors find specific NFTs quickly.

NFT Minting Options: Artists and creators should be able to create and list NFTs easily.

Wallet Integration: Essential for secure payments and seamless transactions.

Auction and Bidding Systems: Engage users and boost sales.

Decentralized Storage: Keeps NFTs secure and tamper-proof.

Royalty Management: Supports creators with ongoing revenue.

These features are the backbone of platforms like OpenSea, ensuring trust and growth in the NFT space.

Step-by-Step Process to Build an NFT Marketplace Like OpenSea

Creating an NFT marketplace requires a structured approach. Let's explore the essential steps.

Step 1: Designing an Intuitive UI/UX for Your NFT Marketplace

A clean and intuitive design builds trust. Users should easily browse categories, search collections, and manage their profiles. Simple interfaces mean less confusion and more engagement.

Step 2: Choose the Blockchain Network 

The choice of blockchain defines your platform's speed, cost, and scalability. Ethereum is widely used, but many businesses also prefer Solana, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain. The right blockchain depends on your business goals and user base.

Step 3: Developing Smart Contracts for Secure NFT Transactions

Smart contracts automate transactions and ensure fairness. They protect users against fraud and give creators confidence that royalties will be paid on every resale.

Step 4: NFT Minting Module

Creators should be able to mint NFTs with minimal steps. An easy minting process attracts more artists and keeps your platform active with new collections.

Step 5: Implementing Wallet Integration and Payment Systems

Your NFT marketplace must support popular crypto wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. Adding payment gateways also helps users who are new to crypto.

Step 6: Building Backend Infrastructure with Decentralized Storage

NFTs are unique digital assets. Storing them securely with decentralized storage like IPFS ensures safety and transparency. This adds credibility to your marketplace.

Step 7: Testing, Deployment, and Ongoing Platform Management 

Before launch, test every feature carefully. Check the minting process, wallet connections, and transaction flows. After deployment, continuous monitoring is needed for updates, bug fixes, and smooth performance.

Monetization Strategies and Future of NFT Marketplaces

A successful NFT marketplace must generate sustainable revenue. Popular monetization strategies include:

The future of NFT marketplaces looks promising, especially with white label NFT marketplace development solutions that allow businesses to launch platforms faster. With growing adoption across industries like music, gaming, fashion, and real estate, opportunities are endless.

Why Choose a Professional Development Company

Building an NFT marketplace is not just about coding. It requires expertise in blockchain, design, and scalability. Working with an NFT Marketplace Development Company ensures your platform is secure, user-friendly, and ready to grow. Professionals handle smart contracts, wallet integrations, and testing, saving you time and costly mistakes. For business leaders, this means faster time-to-market and peace of mind.

Conclusion

NFT marketplaces are shaping the future of digital trade, and creating one like OpenSea requires planning, the right technology, and expert support. Partnering with the right team makes the journey smoother. Justtry Technologies is a leading Blockchain Development Company that provides end-to-end NFT marketplace development and white label NFT marketplace solutions. With their expertise, you can build a scalable, secure, and profitable NFT business that connects with today's digital-first audience.

Introduction

The digital economy has entered a new era with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Businesses, artists, gamers, and collectors now see NFTs not only as assets but as opportunities to create sustainable revenue. Yet many entrepreneurs face a common challenge: they want to enter the NFT world but lack clarity on how to develop a profitable strategy.

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become one of the most dynamic fundraising mechanisms in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. By issuing tokens to investors, startups and enterprises can secure capital to develop projects and scale operations. However, with thousands of ICOs launched over the past decade, competition for investor attention has become fierce. This is where ICO marketing plays a crucial role. It goes beyond basic promotion, focusing on building trust, creating awareness, and establishing a credible project identity. A strong ICO marketing strategy helps projects reach their target audience, communicate their vision, and ensure long-term sustainability in a highly competitive market.

In the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, Stablecoin Payments have emerged as a groundbreaking solution bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, euro, or commodities. This stability makes them ideal for real-world transactions, where predictability and minimal fluctuation are critical. As global adoption of digital assets accelerates, stablecoins are no longer confined to crypto exchanges‚Äîthey are becoming the backbone of payment infrastructures.

I read this a while ago and I decided I would give it another go. I had it on my phone and one thing I found is that I was just in a terrible mood when I read it, which means of course that because it is a nonfiction book, I was trying to find holes in everything. Well, now that I'm in a better mood, I'm going to go through this book properly and comment on the things I found particularly intriguing. And yes, I do actually find it intriguing.

On September 23, Seedify fell victim to a major security exploit where a developer's private key was hijacked. This key was used to manipulate the system's OFT bridge contract‚Äîa component previously cleared by numerous security audits. The breach enabled the attackers to mint vast quantities of SFUND tokens on the Avalanche chain, sidestepping the usual requirement of equivalent deposits, resulting in significant discrepancies in token balances.

Today at approximately 12:05 UTC, a DPRK state-affiliated group known for many hacks in Web3 gained access to one of our developer's private keys. Using these, they were able to mint a large amount of SFUND tokens through a bridge contract that had previously passed audit.The‚Ä¶

Following the minting, the attackers executed rapid transactions across multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base, thus draining liquidity pools. A large portion of the illicitly obtained tokens was subsequently transferred to the BNB Chain and sold off, triggering an almost 60% plummet in the token's market price. More than $1.2 million worth of value was siphoned from the system during this coordinated attack.

Seedify responded promptly to the breach by shutting down the compromised bridge and suspending token transactions on the impacted platforms to prevent further damage. Trading was also temporarily halted on centralized exchanges to manage market volatility effectively. Efforts to mitigate losses included freezing about $200,000 of the stolen funds.

The attack was attributed to a notorious North Korean hacker group, well-known within the web3 community for its previous cyber offenses. This attribution was supported by onchain analysis from security professionals such as ZachXBT and ZeroShadow, who documented the precision and rapid progression of the token movements across four different blockchains.

Meta Alchemist, the founder of Seedify, announced a remediation and improvement strategy dubbed the ‚ÄúPhoenix Raise‚Äù. This initiative is designed to address the breach's repercussions through user compensations, token buybacks, and a major overhaul of security protocols. It encompasses comprehensive contract re-audits and a new bounty program aimed at exposing security vulnerabilities.

The incident has highlighted ongoing vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridge operations and centralization risks, prompting a wider discussion on enhancing security measures. Proposals include adopting multi-signature processes and introducing execution delays for critical functions to strengthen the infrastructure against future attacks.

The breach at Seedify acts as a stark reminder of the complexities and risks associated with web3 technologies, particularly regarding the handling of private keys and security protocols. The platform's response and the execution of the ‚ÄúPhoenix Raise‚Äù initiative could potentially set a new standard in the industry for crisis management and recovery from cyber-attacks in the cryptocurrency domain.

Written by Linh B√πi

Edited by Oihyun Kim

Meteora is stirring the Solana community with a controversial proposal: to allocate 3% of the TGE fund to JUP stakers, not in regular tokens but in Liquidity Position NFTs.

This novel approach promises to bootstrap deep liquidity for MET from day one, yet it raises questions about fairness and concentration risk. Will this be a savvy move to bridge the two communities, or will it ignite a prolonged debate?

As BeInCrypto reported, Meteora is preparing for a TGE in October. The platform floated one of the community's most notable proposals ahead of MET's TGE. 

Under the plan, the project intends to allocate 3% of the TGE fund to Jupiter's JUP stakers as Liquidity Position NFTs. Specifically, Meteora would use the 3% to seed MET liquidity in a Single-Sided DAMM V2 pool, then allocate positions to Jupiter stakers based on time-weighted staking, amount, and voting activity.

The objective is to create MET/USDC liquidity at listing without immediately adding more MET to the circulating supply. The proposal also emphasizes that ‚Äúno additional tokens circulating will be added due to this proposal.‚Äù This is a ‚Äúliquidity-first‚Äù approach rather than a direct token payout.

Meteora's Co-Lead, Soju, published a public calculation to visualize scale. According to Soju, roughly 600 million JUP are currently staked. A 3% allocation would equal 30 million MET tokens. That works out to about 0.05 MET per staked JUP.

‚ÄúI think its reasonable,‚Äù Soju shared.

A user on X ran some napkin math and produced a similar figure of ~0.05035 MET/JUP depending on FDV assumptions. The per-JUP reward is small but aggregated at scale, so it can serve as a meaningful incentive to convert users into MET liquidity providers.

Meteora's proposal has clear upsides compared to other projects that reward users via airdrops. It explicitly recognizes Jupiter's role in the Solana ecosystem, helps bootstrap MET/USDC liquidity at TGE, and reduces the immediate sell pressure because the initial reward is a liquidity position rather than freely tradable tokens. With careful engineering (time-weighted distribution, vesting attached to NFTs, withdrawal restrictions), this could be an effective bridge between the two communities.

However, significant risks remain. The community has raised fairness concerns: why should JUP stakers receive a large share? Could an ‚ÄúLP Army‚Äù or large wallets capture a disproportionate share of the rewards? What will the circulating supply be at TGE immediately? Earlier allocation drafts mentioned up to 25% reserved for liquidity/TGE reserve, so the total initial circulating supply remains a material transparency question.

‚ÄúDifficult to debate on ‚Äòfairness' when JUP gave up 5% for Meteora (via mercurial stakeholders). LP army deserves more -> LP Army will capture a significant chunk of all future emissions (ongoing LM rewards), and still possess 20% (8% + 5% + 2% + 3% + 2%) of total supply at TGE,‚Äù Soju noted.

From past airdrop events, Meteora's team must be transparent about tokenomics, clearly disclose the LP NFT redeem/vest mechanics, set per-address caps, and consider additional incentives for MET holders. If executed poorly, concentrated distribution and subsequent sell pressure could erode TGE's value.

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become one of the most dynamic fundraising mechanisms in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. By issuing tokens to investors, startups and enterprises can secure capital to develop projects and scale operations. However, with thousands of ICOs launched over the past decade, competition for investor attention has become fierce. This is where ICO marketing plays a crucial role. It goes beyond basic promotion, focusing on building trust, creating awareness, and establishing a credible project identity. A strong ICO marketing strategy helps projects reach their target audience, communicate their vision, and ensure long-term sustainability in a highly competitive market.

Launching a successful ICO requires more than just an innovative idea it demands a carefully structured foundation that instills confidence among investors. Core marketing components act as the backbone of any ICO strategy, ensuring that every touchpoint reflects professionalism, credibility, and transparency. From detailed whitepapers and roadmaps to polished branding and a credible team presence, these elements build the narrative around the project. Investors need clarity on not just what the project does, but also how it plans to achieve its vision. Without these essentials, even the most promising ideas risk fading into obscurity.

Every successful ICO begins with a deep understanding of its target audience and the market it operates in. Without knowing who the project is meant for, even the most innovative solution can miss its mark. An experienced ICO Marketing Agency can provide in-depth investor research, helping identify whether the token offering appeals more to institutional investors, retail traders, or crypto enthusiasts. Market analysis further uncovers trends, opportunities, and gaps within the industry. Competitor benchmarking and regulatory awareness refine positioning, ensuring that messaging resonates with investors while staying compliant in a complex and evolving blockchain landscape.

A thriving community is one of the most powerful assets an ICO can have. In the decentralized world of blockchain, community members aren't just spectators they are advocates, investors, and contributors who help spread awareness and drive growth. Active engagement fosters loyalty, while open communication channels create trust between project teams and supporters. Hosting discussions, answering questions, and providing updates ensures that investors feel valued and informed. Strong communities are also resilient, helping projects withstand challenges and build long-term momentum. Ultimately, an engaged community turns an ICO from just another token sale into a movement that investors want to back.

Content is the bridge that connects complex blockchain ideas to investors in a clear and compelling way. A well-designed content strategy helps projects simplify technical details, showcase their expertise, and establish authority within the crypto ecosystem. Educational resources such as whitepapers, blog posts, and case studies offer transparency, while visually engaging formats like videos and infographics make information accessible to a broader audience. Beyond attracting investors, consistent content builds long-term trust and enhances search visibility. In a market flooded with hype, authentic and informative content ensures that projects stand out for the right reasons.

In today's digital ecosystem, credibility is often amplified by voices of influence. Strategic partnerships with influencers, industry leaders, and media outlets can significantly boost an ICO's visibility and reputation. Influencers serve as trusted intermediaries, helping projects reach audiences that already value their opinion. Media partnerships and interviews further validate the project's credibility, placing it on reputable platforms. By leveraging these collaborations, ICOs can tap into established communities, generate buzz, and foster trust at scale. When executed effectively, social and influencer partnerships create powerful endorsements that can make the difference between a successful and overlooked ICO.

While organic growth and community building form the backbone of long-term success, paid marketing accelerates reach and ensures visibility in competitive markets. Paid advertising channels allow projects to precisely target investors who are actively seeking blockchain opportunities. From crypto-friendly networks to search engine marketing, paid campaigns put the project directly in front of potential backers. Banner ads, display marketing, and retargeting campaigns ensure consistent visibility, driving traffic and conversions. When integrated with organic efforts, paid advertising provides a balanced approach, ensuring both immediate traction and sustainable growth for an ICO launch.

The real measure of ICO success isn't just in the funds raised but in the trust sustained afterward. Investors want assurance that the project will continue delivering value long after the token sale ends. This is why transparency, consistent communication, and post-ICO support are essential. Verified audits, performance monitoring, and milestone reporting reinforce credibility. Regular updates and responsive support foster loyalty and community strength. Additionally, analyzing campaign performance helps improve future strategies. By focusing on long-term growth and investor trust, projects transform their ICO from a one-time event into a lasting ecosystem.

Public relations (PR) and media exposure play a crucial role in building awareness and credibility for ICO projects. Unlike paid ads, PR is often perceived as more authentic because it comes from third-party publications or journalists. Strong media coverage can amplify a project's reach, attract attention from investors, and position the team as innovators in the blockchain space. By sharing updates, press releases, and thought leadership pieces, projects can gain authority in both crypto-specific and mainstream financial publications. PR acts as a bridge between technical innovation and public perception, making it a vital component of ICO marketing.

A successful ICO launch requires far more than innovative technology or token economics it depends on the strength of the marketing strategy. From building strong communities and crafting compelling content to leveraging influencers and ensuring transparency, each element plays a vital role. Projects that partner with the right experts, such as a reputable ICO Marketing Agency, gain the advantage of experience and strategic insight. By focusing on trust, engagement, and credibility, ICOs can not only achieve a successful launch but also build a sustainable future in the competitive blockchain ecosystem.

Decentralized applications (dApps) have transformed digital ecosystems by providing transparency, security, and direct user control. However, scaling these applications on traditional blockchain networks presents significant challenges. High transaction costs, slow confirmation times, and limited throughput hinder the ability to serve large user bases effectively. Layer 2 blockchain solutions are designed to overcome these limitations by offloading operations from the main chain while maintaining security through cryptographic proofs. Leveraging these solutions allows developers to build high-performance, cost-effective, and scalable dApps capable of handling increasing user demands without compromising decentralization or application reliability.

That we lived in the house so long after what happened is something I'll never understand. We sealed up her room but the house itself was an altar to her presence.

UK consumers are being warned to be on their guard over a new spate of so-called ‚Äúrobo calls‚Äù after two energy companies have been fined a total of ¬£550,000 for unlawful automated marketing.‚ÄØ
Home Improvement Marketing (HIM), based in Pembrokeshire, has been whacked with a ¬£300,000 penalty for automated calls and issued with an enforcement notice ordering it to stop its unlawful practices.
From May 31 2023 to August 31 2023, it was found that HIM used an overseas call centre that made 2.4 million automated calls on behalf of the company, resulting in 274 complaints to the ICO and the TPS.
Meanwhile, Green Spark Energy (GSE), based in Durham, has been hit with a ¬£250,000 fine for making 9.5 million automated marketing calls. GSE has also been issued with an enforcement notice.
The 497 complainants about the GSE calls to the ICO and TPS included cancer patients and elderly people.
Both firms used an avatar software, which gave the call recipients the impression they were talking to ‚ÄúJo, Helen or Ian‚Äù from the UK ‚Äì but were in fact scripted lines recorded by voice actors and played by call agents abroad.‚ÄØ This is a contravention of the Privacy & Electronic Communication Regulations (PECR).
The companies previously shared a common director, Mathew Terry, who is currently the director of HIM and, until March 2024, was a director of GSE.
ICO head of investigations Andy Curry said the robo call technology ‚Äì which is widely used in the US ‚Äì is making it harder for the public to spot automated calls and report them to the regulator.
He added: ‚ÄúWe've heard disturbing reports of how unscrupulous companies are using robo technology to fool elderly and vulnerable people. We understand how distressing these calls can be and will work on the public's behalf to catch those responsible.
‚ÄúWe urge the public to take note of our tips to spot these robo calls so they can tell us when they've received one. This will help us investigate and take enforcement action.‚Äù

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","ING, UniCredit join banks developing euro stablecoin under MiCA","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:ae01f2aad094b:0-ing-unicredit-join-banks-developing-euro-stablecoin-under-mica/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 08:04:34 GMT","

A group of major European banks has joined forces to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin in compliance with Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework.

Dutch lender ING and Italy's UniCredit are among nine banks participating in the development of a euro-denominated stablecoin, according to a joint statement published by ING on Thursday.

Built in compliance with Europe's MiCA regulation, the stablecoin is expected to be issued in the second half of 2026, with a mission of becoming a trusted European payment standard in the digital ecosystem.

The announcement noted that the initiative aligns with Europe's plans to provide a local alternative to the US-dominated stablecoin market and to contribute to the EU's strategic autonomy in payments.

Banks from eight EU member states initially involved

Alongside ING and UniCredit, the European stablecoin initiative also includes Spain's CaixaBank, Denmark's Danske Bank, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International, Belgium's KBC, Sweden's SEB, Germany's DekaBank and another Italian lender, Banca Sella.

The founding members have also established a new company headquartered in the Netherlands, ING's home country, to oversee the development and management of the stablecoin.

The banking consortium said in the joint announcement that it remains open to other banks joining the stablecoin project.

24/7 access to cross-border payments

According to the statement by ING, the projected euro stablecoin is expected to provide ‚Äúnear-instant, low-cost payments and settlements,‚Äù enabling 24/7 access to cross-border payments.

The stablecoin is also set to offer programmable payments and improvements to supply chain management and digital asset settlements, which can vary from securities to cryptocurrencies.

‚ÄúDigital payments are key for new euro-denominated payments and financial market infrastructure,‚Äù said Floris Lugt, ING's digital asset lead and joint public representative for the project.

‚ÄúWe believe this development requires an industry-wide approach, and it's imperative that banks adopt the same standards,‚Äù he added.

Digital euro delayed to 2029

The announcement of a joint stablecoin project by leading European banks came shortly after European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone estimated that the EU's digital euro could become a reality in 2029.

Cipollone, who also serves as deputy governor of the Bank of Italy, noted that the European Parliament is widely expected to outline a general framework for the EU's proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) by May 2026.

Given the prolonged development of Europe's potential CBDC ‚Äî which has been under consideration since 2020 ‚Äî some online commentators described the new stablecoin launch as a ‚Äúdigital euro's obituary notice.‚Äù

Others have speculated that the upcoming stablecoin could serve as a ‚Äúbackdoor CBDC,‚Äù although, by definition, a CBDC is issued directly by a central bank.

The preference for stablecoins over CBDCs is not unprecedented. In early 2025, the Trump administration made a historic decision to ban CBDC development in the US, while simultaneously committing to promoting US dollar-backed stablecoins as a key component of its financial strategy.

Ohio has taken a decisive leap into the digital economy, formally approving a vendor to process cryptocurrency payments, including Bitcoin, for various state fees and services. This landmark decision, finalized on September 25, 2025, marks a significant re-engagement by the state with digital assets, building on previous efforts and positioning Ohio at the forefront of governmental crypto adoption. The move reflects a broader initiative to modernize public finance, respond to growing demand for digital payment alternatives, and foster an environment conducive to blockchain innovation.

This renewed commitment to integrating cryptocurrencies into state operations is a clear signal of Ohio's progressive stance on emerging financial technologies. By allowing citizens and businesses to pay state obligations with digital currencies, Ohio aims to enhance convenience, streamline transactions, and attract tech-savvy enterprises. The state's approach, which involves a third-party processor immediately converting crypto payments into U.S. dollars, safeguards against market volatility while leveraging the efficiency of digital transactions.

The unanimous approval by the Ohio State Board of Deposit on September 25, 2025, signifies the culmination of months of legislative and administrative efforts. The chosen third-party vendor will now facilitate the acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for a range of state fees, ensuring immediate conversion to U.S. dollars before funds are deposited into state accounts. This strategy shields the state from direct exposure to crypto market fluctuations. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose confirmed that his office, responsible for nearly half a million transactions annually, is poised to be among the first agencies to implement this new payment method. Complementing this, the recently advanced Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) further solidifies the state's crypto-friendly environment by exempting cryptocurrency transactions under $200 from capital gains taxes, a measure designed to encourage everyday crypto usage.

Ohio's journey into cryptocurrency payments has been a dynamic one. The state first made headlines in 2018 under then-Treasurer Josh Mandel, becoming the first U.S. state to accept Bitcoin for business taxes via OhioCrypto.com, with BitPay as the processor. However, this initial program was suspended in 2019 due to legal and procedural concerns. The current initiative, championed by Secretary LaRose and Treasurer Robert Sprague, began gaining traction in April 2025 with a formal request to the State Board of Deposit to re-authorize cryptocurrency payments, citing updated legal guidance. This proposal received unanimous approval in May 2025, paving the way for the vendor selection finalized this September. The Ohio House of Representatives further bolstered these efforts by passing the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) in June 2025, signaling strong legislative support for broader digital asset integration.

Key players instrumental in this development include the Ohio State Board of Deposit, which granted the final approval; Frank LaRose, Ohio Secretary of State, a vocal proponent of the initiative; Robert Sprague, Ohio Treasurer of State, who supported the modernization of state financial practices; and Representative Steve Demetriou, the primary sponsor of the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. Industry leaders like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter have publicly praised Ohio's forward-thinking approach, recognizing its potential to set a national precedent.

Initial reactions from the cryptocurrency industry have been overwhelmingly positive. The approval is widely seen as a validation of digital assets' growing legitimacy and utility. Proponents within Ohio and the broader tech community view it as a strategic move that positions the state as a leader in the digital economy. Ohio now joins a select group of U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana, that have formally embraced cryptocurrency for government payments, with its progress expected to serve as a significant ""test case"" for other states considering similar integrations.

Ohio's progressive stance on cryptocurrency payments creates a new landscape of opportunities and challenges for various public and private companies, particularly those in the crypto payment processing, blockchain technology, and financial services sectors. While the specific name of the newly approved vendor has not been publicly disclosed, the broader implications are clear.

Potential Winners:

Crypto Payment Processors: Companies specializing in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions are direct beneficiaries. While the current vendor is unnamed, BitPay, which processed Ohio's initial 2018 Bitcoin tax payments, could regain or strengthen its position in the government sector. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), a major publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange and infrastructure provider, stands to gain significantly. Its Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has been a vocal supporter, and Coinbase's role as a licensed money transmitter in Ohio positions it well to either be the chosen vendor, a partner, or simply benefit from increased crypto adoption that drives users to its platform. Similarly, Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), through its Square and Cash App ecosystems, offers crypto buying and selling, and could see indirect benefits as more Ohioans engage with crypto for payments. Increased government acceptance of crypto payment rails will likely lead to higher transaction volumes and greater institutional trust for these and other crypto payment gateway providers.

Blockchain Technology Providers: Companies that provide the underlying blockchain infrastructure, security, and consulting services to payment processors or directly to state governments could see increased demand. This includes firms offering enterprise blockchain solutions, distributed ledger technology (DLT) services, and secure digital identity solutions that complement crypto payment systems. The overall trend towards integrating blockchain technology into public finance opens new avenues for these companies.

Companies with Crypto Exposure and Traditional Payment Networks: Public companies that have already invested in cryptocurrencies or offer crypto-related investment products may see a positive impact as mainstream adoption increases the perceived stability and utility of digital assets. Furthermore, traditional payment networks like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which have been actively exploring and partnering with blockchain and crypto companies, could integrate crypto payment rails into their existing systems or partner with approved processors. This ensures their continued relevance in an evolving payment landscape.

Potential Losers (or those facing pressure to adapt):

Traditional Payment Processors and Banks: Companies primarily focused on fiat-based payment processing for government fees might experience a marginal decrease in transaction volume if a significant portion shifts to crypto. However, the immediate financial impact is likely minimal given the nascent stage of crypto adoption for state fees. The larger risk for traditional banks and payment processors is failing to innovate and integrate crypto solutions. Many major banks are already exploring blockchain and crypto services, aiming to integrate rather than compete directly. Since Ohio's system converts crypto to USD, funds will still flow into the traditional banking system, mitigating direct losses but increasing the pressure for adaptation.

Companies Resistant to Crypto Innovation: Any public company in the financial services or technology sector that entirely dismisses or is slow to adapt to the growing demand for and regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency payments could lose market share or relevance in the long run. Ohio's approval signals a broader governmental acceptance, which could accelerate consumer and business adoption of digital assets, leaving laggards behind.

In essence, Ohio's move provides a significant boost to the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as a payment method, potentially leading to new revenue streams and enhanced market positioning for proactive crypto and blockchain companies. Conversely, traditional financial entities will face increased pressure to evolve their offerings to remain competitive.

Ohio's renewed commitment to accepting crypto payments for state fees is far more than an isolated local event; it's a potent indicator of the mainstreaming of digital assets and reflects profound shifts in broader industry trends. As of September 25, 2025, this initiative fits squarely into a national movement towards the institutionalization and regulated utility of cryptocurrencies, promising ripple effects across various sectors and setting important regulatory precedents.

The state's current efforts build upon its pioneering but ultimately suspended 2018 OhioCrypto.com initiative. This time, however, the approach is more robust, underpinned by unanimous approval from the Ohio State Board of Deposit and supported by comprehensive legislation like the ""Ohio Blockchain Basics Act."" By formally authorizing a vendor to process crypto payments, Ohio joins a growing cohort of U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana, that are actively integrating digital assets into their financial infrastructure. This collective state-level innovation signals a bottom-up pressure for federal clarity and further legitimate crypto's role in public finance.

This development aligns with several key industry trends. Firstly, there's an undeniable increase in government and institutional adoption of digital assets. Beyond Ohio, states like Arizona, Colorado, and Florida are exploring or implementing crypto for taxes, fees, and even state reserve funds. Approximately 40 states have introduced or are considering crypto-related legislation in the 2025 session, with 47 states exploring ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" bills. This growing governmental embrace signifies a maturation of the asset class, moving beyond speculative trading to practical utility. Secondly, cryptocurrencies are increasingly recognized as a maturing asset class. Regulatory clarity, such as the SEC's settlement with Ripple and anticipated XRP ETF approvals, is boosting institutional confidence. Stablecoins are gaining traction as mediums of exchange, integrated by major players like Visa (NYSE: V) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), underscoring their growing utility for payments and settlements.

The technological advancements in payments are also a crucial backdrop. Innovations in blockchain scalability, AI, and Web3 are enhancing transaction speed, security, and efficiency, making crypto payments a more viable option for large-scale operations like state governments. Furthermore, the evolving regulatory landscape in 2025 is pivotal. The U.S. is witnessing a shift towards clearer, more supportive crypto regulations, exemplified by the ""GENIUS Act"" signed by President Trump in July 2025, which provides a federal framework for stablecoins. This move away from ""regulation by enforcement"" to a more defined legal structure is expected to drive greater institutional engagement. While states like Ohio lead, federal efforts to clarify oversight and establish consistent rules (e.g., for the SEC and CFTC) will ultimately shape the national environment. The IRS's introduction of Form 1099-DA in 2025, requiring crypto exchanges to report customer transactions, also highlights the increasing focus on tax enforcement for digital assets.

The ripple effects of Ohio's decision are substantial. It will intensify competition among payment processors, encouraging both traditional and crypto-native providers to innovate for government use cases. It will also serve as a magnet for blockchain and fintech firms, with Ohio's supportive legislation aiming to attract talent and investment. For traditional financial institutions, while not directly losing out (as crypto is converted to fiat), there's increased pressure to offer crypto-related services or partner with crypto firms to remain competitive. The recent rescission of SAB 121 by the SEC, making it easier for banks to provide crypto custody, further encourages this collaboration.

Historically, the adoption of cryptocurrency by a state government mirrors past shifts in payment technologies, from the gradual acceptance of credit cards to electronic funds transfers. Each new technology necessitates addressing concerns about security, reliability, and regulatory frameworks. Ohio's repeated foray into crypto payments, learning from its 2018 experience, demonstrates a persistent willingness among states to explore digital asset utility. This state-level experimentation, alongside the global discussion around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), underscores a fundamental evolution in how money and value are exchanged, blurring the lines between private and public monetary systems. Ohio is effectively serving as a crucial laboratory for this ongoing financial transformation.

Ohio's recent approval of a crypto payment processor for state fees sets the stage for a dynamic period of implementation, observation, and potential expansion. The immediate and long-term implications will be closely watched by other states, federal regulators, and the broader financial industry.

In the short term, the focus will be on the seamless rollout of the new payment system. The selected third-party processor will begin integrating its services with various state agencies, with the Secretary of State's office leading the charge. Initial offerings are confirmed to include Bitcoin, with the potential for additional cryptocurrencies to be supported based on demand and technical feasibility. The state will meticulously monitor public and business adoption rates, using this data to refine and expand the program. Crucially, the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) will advance to the Senate for a vote. Its passage would cement a favorable legal framework, clarifying regulations for crypto users and businesses within the state. Ohio's progress will undoubtedly serve as a benchmark for Colorado, Utah, Louisiana, and other states exploring similar initiatives.

Looking to the long term, Ohio's vision extends beyond mere payment acceptance. A successful implementation could pave the way for widespread government adoption of crypto, potentially encompassing a broader range of services and even individual income tax payments. The state aims to cultivate a thriving blockchain ecosystem, attracting businesses and talent to establish Ohio as a ""Silicon Heartland"" for digital innovation. Discussions around establishing an ""Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve"" (HB 18/SB 57) are ongoing, which could see a portion of state funds allocated to digital assets, aligning with trends in nearly 50 other states. This could enhance financial efficiency and transparency for the state, leveraging blockchain's inherent capabilities. Ultimately, Ohio's successful integration could influence federal lawmakers, pushing for clearer and more supportive national regulations for digital assets.

However, this journey will require strategic pivots and adaptations. Scalability and user experience will be paramount as adoption grows, demanding efficient transaction handling and intuitive interfaces. The state must remain agile in response to the constantly evolving federal and state regulatory landscape for crypto. Robust cybersecurity and risk management protocols will be critical, especially if a crypto reserve is established. Expanding supported cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin will likely be necessary to meet diverse user needs. Perhaps most importantly, sustained public education campaigns will be crucial to overcome skepticism and ensure broad understanding and adoption, learning from the lower-than-anticipated uptake of the 2018 program.

Market opportunities are significant. Ohio's crypto-friendly environment could attract a wave of blockchain businesses, fostering job creation and economic growth. Clear regulatory frameworks often boost investor confidence, drawing more capital into Ohio's digital asset market. Conversely, challenges include the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies (though mitigated by immediate fiat conversion), the potential for conflicting or unclear federal regulations, and the ongoing need for robust technological infrastructure. Adoption barriers, such as unfamiliarity or perceived complexity, could also slow uptake.

Potential scenarios and outcomes range from Ohio becoming a leading crypto hub, with high adoption rates and significant blockchain investment, to a more moderate integration where crypto payments become a viable but niche option. A less favorable outcome could see limited impact due to technical glitches, user hesitancy, or new regulatory hurdles, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of ambitions. The most impactful scenario might involve federal preemption or harmonization of crypto regulations, which would require Ohio to adapt its policies to a new national standard, potentially streamlining some aspects while introducing new constraints. Ohio's commitment in 2025 positions it at a pivotal juncture, with its success offering a blueprint for the future of digital assets in public finance.

Ohio's recent approval of a vendor to process cryptocurrency payments for state fees, effective September 25, 2025, represents a significant and well-considered advancement in the state's digital economic strategy. This move, building upon previous exploratory efforts, firmly establishes Ohio as a leader in governmental crypto adoption, alongside states like Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana. It's a clear signal that digital assets are moving beyond niche speculation into the realm of practical, everyday utility within public finance.

Key Takeaways: The core of this initiative is the modernization of state payment systems, driven by a growing demand for diverse payment options. By leveraging a third-party processor to instantly convert cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into U.S. dollars, Ohio effectively mitigates volatility risks while offering cutting-edge payment flexibility. This strategy is complemented by robust legislative efforts, including the ""Ohio Blockchain Basics Act"" (HB 116) and discussions around an ""Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve,"" which collectively aim to create a comprehensive, crypto-friendly ecosystem within the state. This holistic approach distinguishes Ohio's current endeavor from its earlier, more limited foray into crypto payments.

Assessment of the Market Moving Forward: The market is clearly moving towards greater institutional and governmental acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Ohio's actions align perfectly with broader national trends, where numerous states are exploring or implementing similar digital asset initiatives. The federal regulatory environment, particularly under the current administration, is showing a distinct shift towards clarity and support for cryptocurrencies, exemplified by the ""GENIUS Act"" for stablecoins. This evolving landscape fosters greater investor confidence and encourages broader market participation. Globally, crypto adoption continues to accelerate, with Bitcoin remaining a dominant force, increasingly accepted by traditional financial institutions and governments alike.

Significance and Lasting Impact: Ohio's proactive stance in 2025 holds profound significance. It not only legitimizes cryptocurrencies as a viable payment method but also sets a crucial precedent for other states and potentially influences federal policy. By demonstrating a successful model for integrating digital assets into government services, Ohio contributes to the normalization of crypto and accelerates its mainstream adoption. The lasting impact will likely be seen in a more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial system for citizens and businesses interacting with state governments. Furthermore, Ohio's efforts to cultivate a thriving blockchain ecosystem aim to attract innovation, talent, and investment, positioning the state as a vital hub in the emerging digital economy.

What Investors Should Watch For: In the coming months, investors should closely monitor several key indicators. Firstly, observe the actual implementation and usage rates of crypto payments for state fees in Ohio. High adoption would validate the initiative's practical utility. Secondly, track the progress of Ohio's supportive legislation, particularly the ""Ohio Blockchain Basics Act"" in the Senate and any further developments regarding the ""Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve."" These legislative outcomes will shape the long-term regulatory environment. Thirdly, keep an eye on other states' follow-through on their crypto initiatives, as broader governmental adoption across the U.S. could create significant market opportunities. Fourthly, watch for further federal regulatory harmonization, especially from the SEC and CFTC, as clearer national guidelines will reduce uncertainty and boost institutional engagement. Finally, monitor technological advancements in crypto payment processors and general market sentiment and volatility. While regulatory clarity is a strong tailwind, the inherent fluctuations of crypto markets will continue to influence adoption and investment decisions. The journey ahead for Ohio and the broader crypto market promises to be dynamic and transformative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Stablecoins are everywhere, but one expert argues that the ultimate winner might not even exist yet","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/25/stablecoins-experts-tether-circle-mastercard-visa-stripe/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 14:05:00 GMT","

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

The hottest technology in crypto right now is the stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. While Tether and Circle's USDC are the clear leaders right now, it's very possible a yet-to-be-released stablecoin could emerge as the long-term winner. That's according to Austin Campbell, a professor and former executive at stablecoin firm Paxos, who shared his thoughts on the latest edition of Fortune's Crypto Playbook (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube).

Stablecoins such as Circle's USDC and Tether have long been popular among crypto traders as a form of settlement, but a series of high-profile acquisitions and IPOs‚Äîas well as Congress passing comprehensive legislation this summer to regulate the technology‚Äîhave catapulted them into the mainstream. Now, big tech firms and banks alike are exploring integration, while new challengers are entering the market every week.





According to Campbell, there is fierce competition between entrenched stablecoins like Tether and new entrants like Agora‚Äîwhose appeal lies in the fact that their value doesn't fluctuate like Bitcoin or Ethereum‚Äîbut that doesn't mean a new contender can't take the throne.





On the latest episode of Fortune's Crypto Playbook podcast, Campbell compared the current moment in stablecoins to the 1990s for the internet, when services like AOL and Netscape were just getting started. ‚ÄúThe stablecoin that will probably dominate the future has not been created yet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's my prediction.‚Äù 





While many crypto proponents make a similar argument for blockchain technology as a whole, Campbell has more claim to the potential growth for stablecoins. Congress's passage of the Genius Act in July is one catalyst, along with their clear use case over traditional payment rails, with stablecoins touting lower fees and faster transaction speeds. ‚ÄúThe lesson of the internet has been ‚Ä¶ consumers writ large win, and intermediaries just get destroyed.‚Äù 




He pointed to payment firms from Mastercard and Visa to Stripe embracing stablecoins, even though their adoption might upend existing business models. But unlike other corners of the crypto industry, from NFTs to decentralized finance, the presence of established firms might make stablecoins more appealing to companies that would otherwise shy away from the volatile industry. ‚ÄúIt does seem like a chicken-and-egg problem to some degree, where you have to convince people to come on board,‚Äù Campbell said. ‚ÄúBut if you have a major company like Stripe putting so many resources into it, obviously that could create demand.‚Äù





Still, Campbell said, the biggest barrier for the technology is the poor design around user experience, which is why existing players might not have the advantage. ‚ÄúIf I'm betting on horses, it's probably the outsiders laying siege to the current thing,‚Äù he said.

PayPal and decentralized finance platform Spark have teamed up to grow liquidity for PYUSD$0.9996 onchain, aiming to scale deposits from $100 million today to $1 billion in the weeks ahead.

PYUSD, issued by Paxos and pegged to the U.S. dollar, was recently onboarded to SparkLend, Spark's lending marketplace. The integration gives users the ability to supply and borrow PYUSD, with liquidity supported by Spark's $8 billion stablecoin reserve pool. 

This approach contrasts with traditional liquidity programs that rely on expensive market-maker incentives, instead offering predictable depth at set borrowing costs.

‚ÄúPredictable access to deep liquidity is what allows stablecoins like PYUSD to scale quickly,‚Äù said Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs, a Spark contributor. He framed the initiative as a blueprint for how fintech firms can use DeFi to bootstrap adoption of new stablecoins.

The partnership comes as stablecoins see renewed momentum, with global supply climbing nearly $30 billion in three months to $263 billion and daily transaction volumes topping $100 billion. 

Spark previously deployed $630 million in on-chain Bitcoin-backed loans to Coinbase.

‚ÄúWith total DeFi value approaching $150 billion, platforms like Spark are crucial to advancing PYUSD as a cornerstone for defi with deep liquidity,‚Äù said David Weber, Head of PYUSD Ecosystem, PayPal in a press release.

Nine major european banks have joined forces to launch a euro-denominated stablecoin regulated under the trading block's Markets in Crypto Assets regime (MiCA). 

The banking giants involved are: ING, Banca Sella, KBC, Danske Bank, DekaBank, UniCredit, SEB, CaixaBank and Raiffeisen Bank International.

Earlier this year, CoinDesk reported that Dutch bank ING was working on a stablecoin project with some other financial institutions.

The nine bank-backed digital payment instrument, leveraging blockchain technology, aims to become a trusted European payment standard in the digital ecosystem, according to a press release on Thursday.

The initiative will provide a real European alternative to the US-dominated stablecoin market, contributing to Europe's strategic autonomy in payments, the banks said.

The stablecoin will provide near-instant, low-cost transactions and enable 24/7 access to efficient cross-border payments, programmable payments, and improvements in supply chain management and digital asset settlements, the banks said in a joint statement.

The MiCA-regulated stablecoin is expected to be first issued in the second half of 2026. 

The stablecoin consortium, with the aforementioned banks as founding members, has formed a new company in the Netherlands, aiming to be licensed and supervised by the Dutch Central Bank as an e-money institution. The consortium is open to additional banks joining. A CEO is expected to be appointed in the near future, subject to regulatory approval.

Individual banks will be able to provide value added services, such as a stablecoin wallet and custody.

""Digital payments are key for new euro-denominated payments and financial market infrastructure. They offer significant efficiency and transparency, thanks to blockchain technology's programmability features and 24/7 instant cross-currency settlement. We believe this development requires an industry-wide approach, and it's imperative that banks adopt the same standards,"" said Floris Lugt, digital assets lead at ING and joint public representative of the initiative.

Earlier this week, French bank SocGen's Forge subsidiary, which was the first big bank to launch a euro stablecoin under MiCA, announced that its USD-denominated stablecoin USDCV had chosen Bullish Europe as the first venue to list the token.

ETH$4,005.03 led major cryptocurrencies lower during Thursday's Asian trading hours, as odds of a U.S. government shutdown hit record highs on the decentralized betting platform Polymarket.

The price of Yes-side shares for the betting contract ""U.S. government shutdown in 2025?"" rose to 77%, the highest since the contract's launch in January. Traders are essentially pricing a 77% probability that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management will announce a shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations by Dec. 31. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a shutdown by Oct. 1 stood at 63%.

According to media reports, the White House is preparing for large-scale job cuts in the event of a shutdown. On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo asking agencies to prepare plans for staff reductions and furloughs if a spending bill is not passed next week.

The government is reportedly expected to run out of money by the end of September. To prevent the resulting shutdown, Congress must either approve a short-term funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, or pass 12 full-year funding bills. Since lawmakers won't finish the full-year bills before the deadline, a temporary funding stopgap is needed.

More importantly, to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass funding bills, support from both parties is usually necessary.

Ether fell over 3% in Asia, almost testing $4,000 for the first time Aug. 8, with BTC$109,751.25 falling over 1% to under $112,000. Other major tokens such as XRP$2.7748, SOL$201.48 and DOGE$0.2316 fell by 2.6% to 3%. Solana's SOL appeared set to break below $200. 

The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 2% at 3,940 points. Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, traded flat to positive. 

Although the exact cause of the cautious crypto market sentiment was not clear at the time of writing, growing concerns about a potential government shutdown may have contributed to the risk-averse mood among investors.

Furthermore, overnight comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly reiterated her support for further rate cuts, but declined to provide a timeline, instead stressing data dependence, which may have hurt sentiment.

The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Sept. 17 while hinting at two more rate cuts by the year's end. Since then, policymakers, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have signaled a cautious approach to future rate cuts.

Seven Fed officials, including the New York Fed's Williams, are scheduled to speak on Thursday. Meanwhile, traders are awaiting Friday's PCE data, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation.

""If inflation pressures appear contained, markets may interpret this as room for further Fed cuts, providing liquidity tailwinds into Q4. That could be the catalyst for BTC to attempt a long-anticipated breakout,"" the market insights team at Singapore-based QCP Capital said.

It's a new day, but the same story: BTC$109,751.25 is struggling and ETH$4,005.03 is trying to hold the $4,000 range. Crypto bulls can take some comfort in the fact that there is only one week left in September, a historically bearish month, and what's usually the strongest quarter is just around the corner.

Sentiment within the industry remains subdued. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits at 45, which is neutral, but leaning slightly closer toward fear than greed. Part of the reason is bitcoin's underperformance compared with traditional assets. In the past three months, bitcoin has added 7%, while the S&P 500 gained 9% and gold 12%.

Looking ahead, $17 billion worth of bitcoin options expire tomorrow, with a max pain price (the level at which option holders would experience the most financial loss) of $110,000. That is slightly below the current spot price of $112,000 and could provide short-term gravitational pull. For now, bitcoin is expected to consolidate between $110,000 and $116,000 until October.

Meanwhile, the most notable action continues to be in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing stocks such as IREN (IREN). Bitcoin treasury companies, however, remain under pressure. KindlyMD (NAKA) is struggling at $1.17, just above its Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) pricing, and Metaplanet (3350) fell another 4% in Tokyo. The stock has dropped more than 70% from its all-time high, leaving it trading at a 1.24 multiple to net asset value (mNAV). This decline highlights how mNAVs have compressed across the broader market. Stay alert!

 Bitcoin and altcoins failed to follow gold and stocks to all-time highs this month, partly because of a lack of stablecoin liquidity on cryptocurrency exchanges. 

Key points:

Bitcoin and altcoins are lagging gold and stocks when it comes to new all-time highs.

Research suggests that liquidity patterns are partly to blame as traders withdraw stablecoins.

History shows that traditional risk assets need to ‚Äúcool‚Äù before crypto surges.

Bitcoin (BTC) is dropping as crypto markets fail to copy gold and stocks. Is the bull market over?

New research from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant shares four key reasons why Bitcoin and altcoins are ‚Äúred‚Äù ‚Äî Fed rate cuts, stablecoin reserves, leveraged traders and historical norms.

Bitcoin has become stuck recently as liquidity games keep bulls away from challenging all-time highs.

At the same time, both gold and US stock markets continue to post repeated all-time highs, leading to concerns that crypto has failed to become a mainstream asset class. 

CryptoQuant contributor XWIN Research Japan has other ideas. Crypto, they argue, is simply repeating historical patterns.

‚ÄúIn the early phase of rate cuts, institutional capital tends to move first into high-liquidity assets like equities and gold,‚Äù they wrote in one of their Quicktake blog posts, referring to interest-rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. 

XWIN compared the current market setup on Bitcoin and largest altcoin Ether (ETH) to that from a year ago, and found key similarities.

‚ÄúThe pattern mirrors 2024: a front-run rally after the Fed's rate cut, followed by a correction as liquidity failed to fully rotate into crypto. Only after traditional assets cooled did BTC and ETH outperform,‚Äù they added.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin in particular has long been known to follow gold higher after a delay of several months.

Continuing, XWIN flagged stablecoin reserves as another factor creating a delayed reaction to the risk-asset moonshot.

The overall stablecoin supply hit a record $308 billion this month. Still, at the same time, more stablecoins are leaving exchanges than entering, showing a risk-off or profit-taking mentality among traders.

‚ÄúLiquidity is parked off-exchange‚Äîbridged, sidelined, or used in private markets‚Äîrather than actively deployed to buy BTC or ETH,‚Äù they said.

Similar issues impact accumulation, as data from derivatives platforms showed a trader preference for ‚Äúhedging and leverage strategies,‚Äù a classic response to sideways market action.

‚ÄúHistory suggests Bitcoin tends to ‚Äúlag, then leap,‚Äù XWIN concluded.

As Cointelegraph reported, this Friday's $22.6 billion options expiry is significant, potentially impacting prices moving forward.

 Naver is often called the ‚ÄúGoogle of South Korea,‚Äù and is the top search engine in the country. Upbit Korea is the largest crypto exchange in South Korea. 

Naver Financial, the fintech arm of South Korean tech conglomerate Naver, is reportedly forging ahead with a plan to acquire Dunamu, which operates the country's largest crypto exchange, Upbit, amid plans for a stablecoin project and expansion into the digital finance sector.

Naver will acquire Dunamu by making it a subsidiary via a share exchange, and board meetings to approve the stock swap will happen soon, South Korean news agencies Yonhap News and Chosun reported on Thursday, citing industry sources. 

Naver and Dunamu didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Naver is often called the ‚ÄúGoogle of South Korea,‚Äù and is the top search engine in the country. The company also has an email hosting service, blogs, maps and a mobile payment processor through its subsidiaries. 

Upbit Korea is the largest crypto exchange in South Korea in terms of trading volume and customer base, according to CoinMarketCap.

Following the acquisition, Naver Financial will reportedly launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin project, along with other digital finance initiatives, as part of its bid to actively explore overseas expansion.

Chosun, citing an industry source, reported that the ‚Äúcollaboration will serve as a stepping stone‚Äù for Naver ‚Äúto become a global fintech company.‚Äù

Eight major South Korean banks already announced plans in June to launch a stablecoin pegged to the country's won currency in late 2025 or early 2026, while Bank of Korea deputy governor Ryoo Sangdai has voiced support for banks being the primary issuers of stablecoins in the country before gradually expanding to other sectors.

The crypto industry in South Korea has benefited from a friendlier environment after the election of President Lee Jae-myung in June, who has since pushed forward with various crypto-related laws, including a bill to legalize stablecoins.

This isn't the internet giant's first foray into the crypto space; it launched a crypto wallet, Naver Pay Wallet, in partnership with the sport-focused blockchain Chiliz in August 2024.

Naver's stock (KRW) has also reacted positively to reports of its latest crypto venture, jumping over 11.4% to trade at 254,00 Korean won ($181).

In the second quarter, the conglomerate reported a revenue of over $2 billion and net profit of more than $355 million, compared to industry leader Google's revenue of $96 billion in the same time frame.

Dunamu is not publicly traded, but CoinMarketCap data lists its exchange Upbit as the largest in South Korea and the fourth largest globally, with $2.9 billion in 24-hour spot trading volume. While the largest, Binance, has a volume of $23.8 billion.

Crypto exchange users in South Korea surpassed 16 million in February after receiving a boost from US President Donald Trump's election win last November, and are speculated to possibly hit 20 million by the end of the year, out of the country's 51 million people.

Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market in South Korea is projected to reach a revenue of $1.1 billion in 2025, according to online data platform Statista, and grow to $1.3 billion by 2026.

 Transaction reversibility may help stablecoins become an intrinsic part of the legacy financial system, according to the president of Circle. 

Update, Sept. 25, 9:52 am UTC: This article has been updated to include comments from Andrei Grachev, founding partner at synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance.

Circle, the world's second-largest stablecoin issuer, is reportedly examining reversible transactions to help recover funds from fraud and hacks, which appears to counter one of crypto's founding principles: That transactions are final and beyond centralized control.

Circle president Heath Tarbert told the Financial Times on Thursday that the company is examining mechanisms that could allow transactions to be rolled back in cases of fraud or hacks, while still maintaining settlement finality.

‚ÄúWe are thinking through‚Äâ[.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.]‚Äâwhether or not there's the possibility of reversibility of transactions, right, but at the same time, we want settlement finality,‚Äù Tarbert told the FT. ‚ÄúSo there's an inherent tension there between being able to transfer something immediately, but having it be irrevocable [...].‚Äù

Supporters of reversibility argue it could help scam victims and bolster mainstream trust in stablecoins. Still, the idea challenges the decentralized model that underpins crypto, where transactions are permanent and immune from unilateral changes by issuers or validators.

Cointelegraph has asked Circle for comment on the details of transaction reversibility and the parameters that would be used to decide on reversals.

Related: Ethereum bulls tout supercycle, but Wall Street is skeptical

Despite the centralization risks, transaction reversibility proved useful when decentralized exchange Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22, of which validators managed to freeze $162 million.

A week later, Sui validators approved a governance proposal to return the frozen $162 million to Cetus.

While some decentralization advocates criticized validators' ability to freeze the funds, other industry watchers praised the rapid response as a step forward against crypto industry hacks.

While the blockchain industry is often touted as the future of finance, it may benefit from adopting certain features from the traditional finance (TradFi) industry, according to Tarbert.

But there are some benefits of the current system that aren't necessarily currently present,‚Äù he said, adding that some developers see the need for ‚Äúsome degree of reversibility for fraud,‚Äù provided that all parties agree.

The comments come amid a broader push into institutional-grade infrastructure by Circle.

At the beginning of August, Circle announced the launch of its layer-1 (L1) blockchain, Arc, a new network designed to offer an ‚Äúenterprise-grade foundation‚Äù for stablecoin payments, foreign exchange and capital markets applications.

Arc will leverage Circle's USDC (USDC) as its native gas token for blockchain transactions.

Circle plans to roll out Arc as a public testnet this fall, ahead of a full launch by the end of 2025, after integrating with Fireblocks' digital asset custody and tokenization platform for its custody and compliance support solutions, Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 18.

Arc's debut with Fireblocks will give banks and asset managers access to the blockchain from day one, as Fireblocks is serving over 2,400 banks.

While immutability is ‚Äúcentral‚Äù to blockchain design, the idea of every transaction being ‚Äúirreversible under all conditions‚Äù has only served the ethos of the early crypto industry. 

But this ‚Äúcertainly does not reflect how financial systems operate at an institutional scale,‚Äù Andrei Grachev, founding partner at synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIn that context, reversibility is not a flaw. Instead, it can be a functional feature when designed with clear rules, user consent and onchain enforcement.‚Äù

He added that this could involve smart contracts capable of issuing refunds in fraud cases, or permission-based stablecoins that allow temporary settlement changes without depending on opaque intermediaries.

Cow Udders Could Brew Up Dangerous New Bird Flu Strains

Cells in cow udders could act as a site for human flu and bird flu viruses to swap genes and generate dangerous novel strains

By Chris Simms edited by Tanya Lewis

Cow udders may provide a hotspot for bird flu and human flu viruses to mingle.

The prospect of an outbreak of avian influenza among dairy cattle triggering a pandemic in humans is one step closer than scientists thought. New research shows that cow udder cells can be infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time, which means the viruses could exchange genes and generate novel strains that would be better adapted to infecting people. The risk of this happening is low, but if it does, the consequences could be severe, experts say.

H5N1 avian influenza is widespread in wild birds, and there have been many outbreaks in poultry since 2020. In the U.S., a highly infectious form of the virus has also spread through dairy cattle herds, and 70 cases in people have been detected since February 2024. One of those human cases was fatal.

Virologists have been concerned about bird flu for decades because it has such a high mortality rate in humans. Globally, between 2003 and May 2025, there have been 976 reported cases in humans, almost half of which were fatal.

Fortunately, H5N1 hasn't historically spread easily between people. But many researchers are concerned that if it keeps circulating in cattle, it might adapt to better infect mammals in general.

‚ÄúIt's really important to stop the virus being able to spread from cow to cow because, as it does this, it adapts to be better at infecting cows,‚Äù says Eleanor Gaunt, a virologist at the University of Edinburgh. ‚ÄúIf the virus is adapting to replicate in cows, it's probably also improving its ability to replicate in humans and therefore increasing pandemic risk.‚Äù

Although the recent spread of bird flu in cattle confirmed that the animals can catch that virus, it wasn't clear whether they could catch human versions of influenza. Through tests with cells in a lab, Gaunt and her colleagues have now shown that not only can cows' mammary glands can be infected with a human flu virus but also that many different types of influenza are able to replicate in the cow cells and that a single udder cell can be infected with human and avian flu viruses at the same time.

The researchers have concluded that cow udders are a site where viruses could swap genetic material‚Äîa process known as reassortment‚Äîand generate new flu viruses that could potentially spread more easily or cause worse illness. Their work has been posted as a preprint paper on bioRxiv and hasn't yet been peer-reviewed.

Richard Webby, an expert in animal and human viruses at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who was not involved in the research, agrees the findings suggest that cow udders could be infected with both forms of virus. ‚ÄúThe concern with that is that we could get a reassortment event generating a virus that maybe has more of an ability to infect and transmit between humans,‚Äù he says.

It is hard to predict the properties of any novel virus, Webby notes. ‚ÄúThere's a good chance it wouldn't be any worse than the H5 virus that's out there. But it might just increase the replication in the human respiratory tract, giving it a little bit more opportunity for further adaptation, so it's a concern.‚Äù

If a new virus emerges that is like nothing humans have encountered before, people won't have immunity to it, Gaunt says.

Gaunt and her colleagues studied cells in a lab, so they haven't seen co-infection happening in a cow on a farm. And infecting a living cow is harder, says Robert de Vries, a virologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who was also not involved in the study. But he says cow udders could be a potential viral mixing pot.

Many researchers suspect human flu viruses may infect cows. No one has yet detected this, but that doesn't mean such infections don't happen, de Vries says. ‚ÄúPeople haven't been testing for it because we considered this species as a nonhost,‚Äù he adds. Nevertheless, ‚Äúif you set up surveillance for this, you will find it.‚Äù There is evidence that some cows have antibodies to human flu viruses, which suggests the animals have been infected by these pathogens even if the viruses themselves haven't been detected, Gaunt says.

How U.S. cows initially caught bird flu isn't known. Scientists suspect contact with infected wild birds seeded the initial infections, but the virus seems to have spread among cows via contaminated milking equipment, Gaunt says.

She suggests a cow could be infected with human flu if an ill farmworker wasn't wearing personal protective equipment (if they had access to any) and if the milking equipment wasn't disinfected between uses. Thoroughly cleaning milking equipment could help stop the spread, she says.

Just because co-infection with avian and human influenza is possible doesn't mean it is likely, however, Webby says. Bird flu jumping into cattle in the first place is a relatively rare occurrence‚Äîas a human virus infecting the animals most likely would be, he says. ‚ÄúIt would require a couple of rare events occurring at the same time,‚Äù he says.

But with bird flu circulating widely in U.S. herds, one of the two types of virus is already present in some cattle, which boosts the likelihood of co-infection, Gaunt says. The risk is likely to be low. Still, the more cattle that contract bird flu, the higher the chances of co-infection, so it is a risk that should be taken seriously, she says. ‚ÄúWhen we're talking about a pandemic emergency,‚Äù Gaunt adds, ‚Äúthen it is generally an incredibly unlikely set of circumstances that bring it about, regardless of what virus we're talking about.‚Äù

Good Conversations Don't Require Everybody to Agree, Neuroscience Shows

Brain imaging is illuminating the patterns linked to productive, positive dialogue, and those insights could help people connect with others

With each turn of the news cycle, you may wonder how anyone in their right mind, seeing what they're seeing, could still hold differing political views from your own. I wrestle with some of these feelings myself. When I talk with people on the other side of a debate, I'm often tempted to push them to see things how I do. Or I may stay close to issues where I know we agree so we can have a conversation that feels safe and easy.

But there is a third option for navigating these conversations: curious exploration. My and my colleagues' research into the ways brain activity across people aligns or diverges as they converse suggests that seeking to persuade may not be the most fruitful way to approach a conversation. Instead an open attitude, allowing ourselves to traverse a range of ideas and to learn from other people's experiences, may be both more enjoyable and productive.

In recent years, neuroscientists have identified an important phenomenon: brain synchrony, in which brain activation in two or more people increases and decreases in similar regions at similar times. When people's brain activity is in sync, it seems to indicate a common interpretation and understanding of what they are experiencing. For example, when one person tells a story, and another understands it in the same way, the listener's brain aligns with the speaker's and even begins to anticipate what will come next. On the other hand, when people interpret the same story in markedly different ways, perhaps because they've been given different background information, their brain activity is less synchronized than people who are given the same background facts and therefore share the same assumptions coming in.

These insights apply not only to hearing stories or watching movies but also to responding to news media and political content. Strong political speeches can bring people's brains into sync with one another, for instance. But people get their news from politically polarized sources, which means that they encounter news coverage of different events and receive diverging analyses of the same events. This shapes their views of those issues and creates conflicting background assumptions when they encounter new political stories. In parallel, studies show divergence in brain responses when people with different political views engage with the news, as though they were making sense of different stories altogether. In research initiated by the late Emile Bruneau at the University of Pennsylvania, who died in 2020, and carried forward by Nir Jacoby, now at Dartmouth College, our team scanned the brains of participants who identified as Democrats or Republicans while they watched video clips of people talking about policies. We found that participants' brain activation in social and emotional processing systems was more aligned with people from their own party than it was with those from the opposing party.

All of this work hints that our interactions might be more harmonious if we were more in sync with one another. But evidence from a new technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hyperscanning, which can track brain activity during real conversations, complicates that idea. This method is exciting because it allows researchers to observe two brains in action at the same time. With hyperscanning, we can see how people's brains respond to one another during real-time conversation. My collaborators and I have been using it to understand the dynamics of good conversations‚Äîexchanges where people enjoy themselves, reach consensus on how to solve hard problems or help each other navigate emotional challenges. We've discovered that even if one's goal is to simply enjoy the conversation, sticking to safe topics where everyone is on the same page might not be the best solution. In a hyperscanning study, our team, including psychologists Lily Tsoi of Caldwell University, Shannon Burns of Pomona College, Sebastian Speer and Diana Tamir, both at Princeton University, gave friends and strangers instructionsto get to know each other better. We found that the conversations participants enjoyed the most were not those where their brain activity stayed perfectly in sync the whole time.

Strangers, on average, gradually increased their neural synchony over the course of a conversation, whereas friends typically started out more in sync with one another early on. Then something interesting happened: after starting off more in sync, friends' patterns of brain activity in regions that process social interactions began to diverge. They covered more topics and explored wider ground than strangers and, on average, enjoyed the conversations more. Strangers explored fewer topics and had less enjoyable conversations. But some pairs of strangers showed a pattern more like friends. These pairs seemed to use synchrony as a jumping-off point for exploring more ideas rather than an end. In turn, these pairs of strangers, whose brain activity diverged as the discussion unfolded, also rated their conversations as more enjoyable.

And in conversations where people needed to discuss their differences of opinion, we encountered a similarly intriguing finding. In still unpublished work, our team studied what happened as people discussed policy issues, such as the future of higher education and environmental concerns. We coached these participants to enter these conversations in one of two ways: with a goal to compromise or a goal to persuade. When people came into the conversation looking to compromise, we found, this led to more expansive exploration (for example, covering more topics, mental states and brain patterns). Ultimately, this more expansive exploration led to greater consensus about how to solve large societal problems. On the other hand, the people who came in trying to persuade their partner explored less in their conversations and were ultimately less successful in achieving a shared vision for a path forward.

Recently I tried to put these findings into practice while speaking with a colleague who held different views than I did and learned how events that had unfolded in his job and community had shaped his opinions and decisions. Although the conversation was tiring and did not end in complete agreement, it renewed our connection to each other and left me open to talking more.

To be sure, individual conversations in isolation can't fix society's polarization. Institutions‚Äîincluding media, industry and government‚Äîplay a major role in shaping culture, assumptions and divides. Still, these institutions are also composed of people, and conversations are a key tool for reimagining the world we want together. Our findings suggest one set of possibilities for people navigating conversations with those across divides. We can be more open, curious and exploratory when speaking with others rather than avoid controversies or start off pushing our viewpoint.

According to experts, the building may have once been a royal ‚Äúwater palace.‚Äù

The Konbaung Dynasty (1752 to 1885)‚Äîalso known as the Third Burmese Empire‚Äîwas the last dynasty to rule Burma (now Myanmar), eventually toppled by the British. A recent natural disaster may give researchers a rare look into remnants of the empire, or at least one remnant in particular. 

Back in March, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake revealed an ancient structure in Tada-U Township, Myanmar. According to a translated report from the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, some believe the remains could have been part of a royal ‚Äúwater palace‚Äù from the Konbaung era. 

Part of the archaeological site‚Äîa set of stairs‚Äîwas originally uncovered in 2009 while locals were baking bricks. But the recent earthquake caused a fissure that revealed more parts of the structure that were previously hidden beneath layers of soil. Exploratory excavations began on April 9, led by the Mandalay branch of the Department of Archaeology. Researchers say that additional ruins, including a handrail, brick platforms, and an 18-inch riser step, are now visible. According to the report, some of these features resemble sketches from ancient palm-leaf manuscripts called ‚ÄúPura-pike.‚Äù 

Historically, water has been a religious symbol in Myanmar culture, so water palaces served as important places for rituals, the Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports. The water palace described in the palm-leaf manuscript‚Äîsupposedly penned by Minister Letwe Nawrahta (a prominent minister during the Burmese Kingdom)‚Äîhas five grand staircases and 18 to 20 dormitories shaded by mango trees. 

Though the prospect of finding a royal water palace is exciting, it's much more likely the structure is something simpler. Researchers suggest the building may have been a wooden residence, spanning about 200-250 feet long and 200 feet wide. According to experts, the structure resembles the Inwa Varkara Wooden Monastery and the Shwenandaw (Golden Palace) Monastery in Mandalay. 

Some commenters are critical of researchers not unearthing the structure when it was initially discovered in 2009. Because of the possible religious significance of the site and how little is currently known, Myanmar's Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports that further research will continue and, in the future, the structure will be preserved for public education.

A drug that regrows hair and a switch that restores eyesight could soon change medicine forever.

Some animals in the world have a pretty cool superpower: the ability to regenerate. Salamanders can regrow lost tails, for example, while zebrafish can regenerate fins, damaged heart tissue, and even spinal cords. Unfortunately, while humans can heal wounds and fractures, we can't regenerate major limbs and organs ‚Ä¶ yet. 

That hasn't stopped scientists from chasing the incredible idea, using regeneration as a potential tool to treat human disease and injury. And this quest to hack biology is exactly the kind of breakthrough story Pop Mech readers can't get enough of, from reversing hair loss to restoring eyesight. The treatments may sound like sci-fi now, but with continued testing, they could soon move from the lab to your medicine cabinet. 

Scientists at UCLA created a new topical drug, PP405, that stimulates new hair growth. PP405 regrows hair by reactivating dormant hair follicle cells, unlike the other common hair-loss treatments (finasteride, minoxidil) that merely delay hair loss.

So, how did scientists ‚Äúwake up‚Äù dormant stem cells? Since active hair follicle cells contain more lactate, which helps them create energy without oxygen, researchers determined they needed to increase cell lactate in these dormant cells. Enter PP405, which inhibits the protein that moves pyruvate into mitochondria, and therefore yields more lactate. When tested on mice, sure enough, they began regrowing hair.

PP405 has undergone two safety clinical trials so far, and will go into testing for its effectiveness next year. 

A research team at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology may have discovered a new way to regrow retinal cells, and it comes with incredible implications for treating blindness.

By blocking PROX1, a protein that inhibits retinal cell development in mammals, the researchers saw retinal regeneration in a group of mice suffering from a disease that results in photoreceptor deterioration. And the regeneration stuck around: Scientists observed the effects from the regeneration in the mice for six months, making it the first successful ‚Äúinduction of long-term neural regeneration‚Äù in the retinas of mammals.

To study how dialects change over time, you need a single speaker who's lived in different regions and has been recorded a lot. Taylor Swift fits the bill.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the winter of 2000, researchers from Macquarie University in New South Wales wondered exactly how regional dialect changes over time, and specifically, how younger speakers can impact a well-established dialect. To explore this idea, they needed a single person who'd given many public, recorded speeches over the span of decades. Being residents of a Commonwealth nation, they chose to analyze the speeches of Queen Elizabeth II, and eventually found that the she no longer spoke the ‚ÄúQueen's English‚Äù of the 1950s. The study proved that attempts to preserve a specific pronunciation couldn't withstand social pressures over time. 

Fast-forward 25 years, and researchers at the University of Minnesota pondered a similar question: How exactly does dialect ebb and flow over the course of one's life? Similar to the previous research, the scientists needed someone with lots of recordings of their speech (a significantly more common phenomenon in the 21st century) and, ideally, someone who'd been exposed to various regional dialects. The scientists this time around also opted for royalty‚Äîpop royalty, that is. 

‚ÄúTaylor Swift is perfect for this type of longitudinal analysis because she has been interviewed and recorded many times over the years and had motivations for changing her accent at specific times,‚Äù Matthew Winn, a researcher from the University of Minnesota and co-author of a new paper in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA)  said in a press statement.

The team collected recordings and interviews of Swift from when she was living in Nashville, Tennessee, her home state of Pennsylvania, and New York City. From this audio, the team compiled 1,400 vowel sounds and used software to specifically measure vocal resonances. 

‚ÄúThe key thing about analyzing dialects is measuring the movement of the vowel through the mouth from the start to the end of the vowel‚Äîthat's what makes it distinct across dialects,‚Äù Winn said in a press statement. ‚ÄúWe made ten measurements per vowel to show this movement, which was key to showing how her articulation changed in the different cities.‚Äù

One change highlighted by the researchers‚Äîspecifically present while Swift lived in Nashville‚Äîwas the monophthongization (diphthong migrates into a monophthong) of the /a…™/ vowel, so ‚Äúride‚Äù becomes more like ‚Äúrod.‚Äù They also mentioned the fronting the u vowel, so that words like ‚Äútwo‚Äù were now pronounced more toward the front of the mouth, sounding like ‚Äútee-you.‚Äù The authors also mentioned that Swift lowered her voice while living in New York City, possibly (they theorize) to project a sense of authority. 

Of course, dialect changes are not exclusive to Taylor Swift‚Äîor even to people who live in different areas of the country. Social status, for instance, can impact how one person talks to another, and even the difference between talking to a stranger and talking to a friend or a lover can be perceptible in our speech. Additionally, dialects themselves are constantly changing, in part through a process known as ‚Äúdialect leveling‚Äù where regional dialect differences are lost over time through social (or even economic) pressure to pronounce certain words a certain way. Whether the person speaking it or the dialect itself is changing, the way we talk is far from static over the course of our lives. 

‚ÄúDialects are a key component of communities that can be defined by geographic region, social characteristics, and shared interests,‚Äù the authors wrote. ‚Äú[Swift's] adaptive use of these dialect features builds on foundational work to demonstrate how the ways that talkers use their spoken language to convey identity and community belonging are malleable across the lifespan.‚Äù

New research presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, Austria (Sept 15-19) and simultaneously published in NEJM shows that daily treatment with the new once-daily GLP-1 agonist orforglipron results in substantial weight loss in people living with obesity that do not have type 2 diabetes. The study is by Dr Sean Wharton, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada and Wharton Weight Management Clinic, Burlington, ON, Canada, and colleagues. The study is sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of orforglipron. 

Orforglipron is a small-molecule, oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. In this phase 3, multinational, randomised, double-blind trial, the authors examined the safety and efficacy of once-daily orforglipron at doses of 6 mg, 12 mg, or 36 mg, as compared with placebo (assigned in a 3:3:3:4 ratio) as an adjunct to healthy diet and physical activity for 72 weeks. All the patients had obesity but not diabetes. The primary end point was the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 72.

A total of 3127 patients in 9 countries / jurisdictions (USA, China, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Slovakia and Taiwan) underwent randomisation. The mean relative change in body weight from baseline to week 72 was ‚àí7.5% with 6 mg of orforglipron, ‚àí8.4% with 12 mg of orforglipron, and ‚àí11.2% with 36 mg of orforglipron, as compared with ‚àí2.1% with placebo.

Among the patients in the orforglipron 36 mg group, 54.6% had reduction of 10% or more of body weight, 36.0% had a reduction of 15% or more, and 18.4% had a reduction of 20% or more, as compared with 12.9%, 5.9%, and 2.8% of the patients, respectively, in the placebo group.

Other outcomes such as waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and non-HDL cholesterol levels significantly improved with orforglipron treatment (see table 3 full paper). Adverse events (see table 4) resulted in treatment discontinuation in 5.3% to 10.3% of the patients in the orforglipron groups and in 2.7% of those in the placebo group. The most common adverse events with orforglipron were gastrointestinal effects, which were mostly mild to moderate, consistent with the GLP-1 class of medications.

The authors note that the use of medications such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide) are reported to result in mean weight reductions of approximately 15% to above 20% and have shown additional health benefits, including decreased cardiovascular risk. However, most available GLP-1 based medications are administered as a subcutaneous injection, which may limit treatment initiation and adherence.

The authors say: ‚ÄúAfter 72 weeks of treatment, all the patients in the three orforglipron groups had a significant and clinically meaningful dose-dependent reduction in body weight. The patients who received the highest dose of orforglipron had an average 11.2% weight reduction; more than one third had a reduction of at least 15%, and nearly one fifth had a reduction of at least 20%. All measured cardiometabolic levels improved with orforglipron treatment as compared with placebo‚Ä¶ A weight reduction of 10% or more is a recognised therapeutic threshold, one that has been linked to meaningful cardiometabolic benefits. In our current trial, patients who received orforglipron had a mean weight reduction of as much as 11.2%, and such reductions were associated with improvements in levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as blood fats, blood sugar profiles, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ‚Äì a marker of systemic inflammation.‚Äù

The authors note the trial's limitations include the lack of comparison with currently approved obesity-management medications, the use of cutoffs for BMI inclusion criteria that have been developed in White populations and that exclude patients with lower BMI values who may also have adiposity-related risks, and the increasing availability of obesity-management medications, which could have an effect on treatment adherence and efficacy results. The strengths of the trial include a highly diverse, large population from nine countries and jurisdictions on four continents - including more than 35% enrolment of men.

They conclude: ‚ÄúIn patients with obesity, the use of orforglipron resulted in statistically and clinically significant weight reductions and an adverse-event profile that was consistent with findings regarding other GLP-1 receptor agonists.‚Äù

Dr Wharton adds: ‚ÄúThis could mean an expansion of obesity interventions to groups who are currently excluded due to the cost of and lack of access to injectable medications.‚Äù

Orforglipron is not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other similar agencies worldwide.

Widespread, persistent and toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a major threat to water systems and human health. Current detection methods are relatively expensive, slow and complex, underscoring the need for more accessible alternatives to meet increasingly stringent PFAS regulations. Here we present an ultrasensitive sensing platform for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid detection in tap water with a reporting limit (‚Äâ~‚Äâ250 parts per quadrillion) lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory standard (4‚Äâparts per trillion), using a remote gate field-effect transistor featuring Œ≤-cyclodextrin (Œ≤-CD)-modified reduced graphene oxide as the sensing membrane. The sensor exhibits excellent selectivity against common inorganic ions, natural organic matter and select organic pollutants in tap water. The reversible and rapid response (‚Äâ<‚Äâ2‚Äâmin) indicates the potential of remote gate field-effect transistor for continuous in-line monitoring. Mechanistic studies using quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulations reveal key roles of analyte adsorption and charge properties in sensing performance and offer insights for designing more selective PFAS capture probes.

A judge in New York rejected a request on 23 September to disqualify the use of cutting-edge DNA sequencing as evidence in a case against an alleged serial killer. The ruling paves the way for a type of DNA analysis known as whole-genome sequencing ‚Äî used to decipher ancient DNA in fossilized remains, for example ‚Äî to be admitted as evidence in US criminal trials.

‚ÄúThis is a big step forward for the use of DNA evidence, because it will allow comparisons and matches with evidence that was previously considered too minuscule, too old or too badly degraded to be considered useful,‚Äù says Nathan Lents, a biologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. ‚ÄúYou can bet that cold-case units all over the country are going back through their evidence lockers to see if there are samples that can now be tested with a reasonable chance of success.‚Äù

The Gilgo Beach killings were a series of murders that occurred in Suffolk County, New York, between 1993 and 2011. Many of the victims were sex workers, and the bodies of some of them were found near the eponymous beach. New York architect Rex Heuermann was charged with seven of the murders in 2023 and 2024 partially on the basis of hairs found on the victims.

In 2010, investigators concluded that there wasn't enough genetic material in the hairs for conventional forensic technology to identify whose they were. But since then, genomic technology has matured at a fast pace.

Forensic scientists still identify suspects from hair and other samples using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which can amplify snippets of DNA called short tandem repeats (STRs). Today, however, scientists can also sequence whole genomes and look at single-letter variations in the DNA to zero in on a person of interest. This technology has the added benefit of being able to analyse severely degraded samples ‚Äî from Neanderthal remains to hairs in the Gilgo Beach case. But it has typically been used only during investigations, and the results have not been widely presented as evidence before juries.

The prosecution in the Gilgo Beach case contracted the company Astrea Forensics in Santa Cruz, California, to analyse the hairs found on the victims. Because they were rootless, they hadn't yielded enough DNA for conventional STR profiling. (Rootless hairs are mostly made of keratin and don't contain much genetic material, Lents says.)

But Astrea was able to sequence the small amount of genetic material in the hairs and then use statistical-analysis software to scan the DNA for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ‚Äî single-letter differences in people's genetic codes. Even in a degraded sample, whole-genome sequencing followed by this statistical analysis can spot thousands of SNPs: enough to pinpoint an individual's unique pattern, Lents says.

Next, scientists at Astrea compared the SNP profiles they obtained with profiles stored in genealogy databases and looked for matches. People submit their DNA to genealogy services, such as 23andMe and Ancestry, and these companies return SNP profiles that people can then upload to websites such as GEDMatch to locate potential relatives. Users have the option to make the data available to forensic genealogists ‚Äî and these data are what Astrea used to zero in on Heuermann and his family.

The defence team in the Gilgo Beach case initially challenged the validity of Astrea's DNA-analysis methods ‚Äî which were developed by palaeogenomics researcher Richard ‚ÄòEd' Green at the University of California, Santa Cruz. (Green declined to comment for this article, given the ongoing prosecution.) The defence argued that the statistical methods used by Astrea were unique, and questioned whether they had been sufficiently validated.

Climate change and increasing availability of resources such as carbon dioxide are modifying forest functioning worldwide, but the effects of these changes on forest structure are unclear. As additional resources become available, for example, through CO2 fertilization or nitrogen deposition, large trees, with greater access to light, may be expected to gain further advantages. Conversely, smaller light-suppressed trees might benefit more if their light compensation point changes, while bigger trees may be the most negatively impacted by increasing heat and drought. We assessed recent changes in the structure of Earth's largest tropical forest by analysing 30‚Äâyears of Amazonian tree records across 188 mature forest plots. We find that, at a stand level, trees have become larger over time, with mean tree basal area increasing by 3.3% per decade (95% CI 2.4; 4.1). Larger trees have increased in both number and size, yet we observed similar rates of relative size gain in large and small trees. This evidence is consistent with a resource-driven boost for larger trees but also a reduction in suppression among smaller trees. These results, especially the persistence and consistency of tree size increases across Amazonian forest plots, communities and regions, indicate that any negative impacts of climate change on forests and large trees here have so far been mitigated by the positive effects of increased resources.

Forests worldwide are a key component of terrestrial carbon dynamics. While land-use change in the tropics has driven a large net carbon flux to the atmosphere1, research in remaining mature tropical forests has revealed substantial and persistent increases in biomass and an associated carbon sink2,3,4. Widespread changes in biomass productivity and mortality are also occurring across tropical forests, with at least some of these changes likely driven by increased resource availability from elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations or nitrogen deposition, and climatic stress with hotter temperatures and more intense and frequent drought and storms2,5,6,7. These drivers can be at times opposing forces, as while greater resource availability stimulates plant growth8,9, climate stressors can lead to lower productivity and increase tree mortality rates10. The relative contribution of each of these drivers and their net impact on forest structure is poorly understood. To date, the aggregate changes in mature tropical forest biomass have not been interrogated in terms of shifts within forests in size-class dominance and biomass contributions.

The effects of higher resources‚Äîeither via CO2 fertilization or nitrogen deposition‚Äîon forest structure are unclear. Some ecological theory predicts a winners-take-all response to the increase in resources, where larger trees obtain disproportionate amounts of resources, outcompeting smaller trees11,12,13. Large trees are‚Äîalmost by definition‚Äîstronger competitors in forests12,13. Tree size provides such an advantage that, to reach the canopy, trees invest large amounts of carbon in vertical growth14. Greater access to light allows large trees to dominate light capture and thus accumulate more biomass15. This boosts their relative fitness by making light unavailable to small trees12. As a result, competition between trees is mostly size asymmetric16, with larger trees able to exploit greater amounts of resources. Larger trees are also expected to dominate below-ground as investments in foliage reflect larger investments in roots17. The more resource-rich the area, the greater the advantage of large trees, either due to size scaling with the capacity to use resources18 or because when other resources are not limiting, competition for light becomes even more important11,19,20. Following this logic, at higher resource levels we would anticipate a winners-take-all response, where the largest trees are able to acquire a disproportionate amount of the increase in resources. As large trees have high maintenance costs, an increase in resource availability would offer substantial growth advantages. This would further increase light suppression in the understory causing a reduction in growth and potentially an increase in mortality of small trees14. Consequently, the structure of the size-class distribution is expected to shift, with more trees observed within the largest size classes and an increase in mean tree size across the forest (Fig. 1).

a, Expected change in tree size distribution under different hypotheses. D, diameter at breast height. b, Direction of anticipated changes in key tree size descriptors compared to the original forest. Winners-take-all hypothesis: If increase in resources benefits the largest trees, asymmetric competition for light will increase, leading to greater light suppression in the understorey. This will increase the mean tree size but will not affect the median size, potentially decrease stem numbers (N), increase the scale parameter (scale) and raise the Gini coefficient. Carbon-limited benefit hypothesis: If CO2 stimulates growth in understorey trees, improving their carbon balance, smaller trees will grow more, increasing recruitment in smaller size classes. This will raise stem numbers, decrease median tree size (with little effect on the mean), increase the Gini coefficient and decrease the scale parameter. Shared benefits hypothesis: If increase in resources benefits all trees equally, we expect an increase in mean and median tree sizes and number of stems, a larger scale parameter and no change in the Gini coefficient. Large trees lose hypothesis: If increasing heat, drought, lightning or wind disproportionately impact the mortality of large trees, the mean tree size would decrease, median size would remain unchanged, stem numbers would decline and the scale parameter would lower, with lower inequality (greater Gini coefficient).

Alternatively, additional resources could favour the most suppressed trees, facilitating increased growth and survival rates in smaller size classes8,21,22. In tropical forests light limitation in the understorey is so strong that understorey trees live close to their light compensation point, that is, on the edge between positive and negative carbon balance23,24,25. Therefore, a small increase in CO2 may make a large relative difference to net carbon balance by reducing photorespiration and stimulating photosynthesis, so that the growth of understorey trees increases and, potentially, some trees that would otherwise have died survive21,26. If these effects are important, higher CO2 levels would weaken the effects of asymmetric competition for light leading to a carbon-limited benefit response (Fig. 1). If this is the case, we expect a greater number of trees within smaller size classes and changes in size on a relative basis to be greater in smaller stems. These potential responses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Through a combination of the above processes, an increase in resources can have similar impacts across trees regardless of their size leading to a benefits-shared response (Fig. 1).

In parallel to the increase in resource availability, climate-related drivers of change, such as drought, lightning, fire and windthrow are increasing in frequency27. Overall, these changes are expected to decrease productivity and increase tree mortality rates, in contrast to the effects of increased resources5,27,28. These impacts are expected to be greatest for large trees, which tend to be most vulnerable to these climate drivers29,30, and may result in declines in the size and frequency of large trees. Under this scenario, where large trees lose, we expect a redistribution of basal area (BA) towards smaller-size classes, resulting in biomass stocks being increasingly concentrated in small- and medium-sized trees. Whether the structure of natural tree communities in Amazonia has been responding to increase in resources and changing climate in accordance with any of these expectations remains untested.

In this Article, we assess the changes in tree size structure in the Amazon over three decades. A widespread, long-term dataset of mature tropical forest plots is interrogated for structural change, and this information is used to help understand the potential influence of ongoing environmental change on forest structure. Specifically, we test the winners-take-all, carbon-limited-benefit, benefits-shared and large-trees-lose hypotheses by analysing changes in simple size structure parameters (Fig. 1) including mean and median tree size, the size frequency distribution of trees within plots and the distribution of area occupied by individual trees in a plot measured by the Gini coefficient.

At the stand level, mean tree size has increased across the whole domain of Amazon forests (Figs. 2a, 3 and 4). Mean tree BA increased at a rate of 1.45‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4‚Äâm2‚Äâyr‚àí1, a 3.3% gain per decade compared to initial sizes of average 4.78‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí2‚Äâm2. Median tree BA increased by 1.9% per decade, while maximum tree size increased by 5.8% per decade (Table 1 and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2).

a,b, Distribution of annual trends of mean tree BA (a) and scale parameter (b) per inventory plot across Amazonia. Trends represent the slope of a linear regression fit to mean tree size and scale parameter within each inventory plot. These vary from ‚àí7.1‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4 to 2.2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí3‚Äâm2‚Äâyr‚àí1 and ‚àí1.1 to 3.7‚Äâyr‚àí1 for mean tree size and scale parameter, respectively. Mean tree size changed on average by 1.45‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí4‚Äâm2‚Äâyr‚àí1 across all plots, 3.3% gain per decade compared to initial mean size of 4.78‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí2 m2. The average change in scale parameter was 0.4‚Äâyr‚àí1, 3.8% per decade compared to initial mean scale parameter of 103. Arrows show the magnitude and direction of trends at each plot location, with blue arrows showing increasing trends and red arrows showing declining trends.

Data are plotted for 30‚Äâha of forest across 22 plots, all censused before 1990 and after 2010, and illustrate an increase in the frequencies and size (shown by the stem BA) of the largest stems.

Left: individual plot-level linear trends in size structure parameters across the full interval each plot was censused for. For visualization purposes, only 92 of the 188 plots are included, with the most strongly weighted plots based on area and monitoring period length included. Positive trend lines are coloured blue, and negative trend lines are coloured red. Right: annual rate of change of size structure parameters. Red vertical lines show the overall bootstrapped mean (solid lines) and 95% CI (dashed lines). Blue lines are positioned at 0, that is, no change.

Larger trees gained more in absolute, but not relative, terms. The rate of change in mean tree size was three times greater than the increase in the median tree size (Table 1). This resulted in a greater inequality in the area occupied by each tree shown by a significant increase of 1% per decade in the Gini coefficient (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2).

The scale parameter of the Weibull distribution increased by 3% per decade (Figs. 2b, 3 and 4) suggesting an increase in the proportion of large stems relative to small stems and an increase in the spread of stem diameters across the distribution. This trend was widespread across the Amazon basin (Fig. 2b) and observed across all four biogeographic regions (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 1). We further observed a significant increase of 1% per decade in the shape parameter suggesting a decline in the frequencies of the smallest stems and a shift towards a less right-skewed distribution (Table 1).

We found no evidence of change in total stem numbers (Fig. 4 and Table 1), but the numbers of small stems (D‚Äâ<‚Äâ200‚Äâmm, D‚Äâ=‚Äâdiameter) and understorey stems have both declined at rates of 1.2% and 3.6% per decade, respectively (Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2). In parallel, the number of large stems (D‚Äâ>‚Äâ400‚Äâmm) has increased at a rate of 6.6% per decade (Table 1). This is consistent with the observed changes in the Weibull distribution parameters. The number of medium-sized stems (D‚Äâ=‚Äâ200‚Äì299‚Äâmm) has not changed.

The increase in tree size was observed across the whole community. Mean tree BA increased for both the smallest (D‚Äâ<‚Äâ200‚Äâmm) and largest (D‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ400‚Äâmm) size classes (Table 1), as well as for understorey and overstorey trees (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Extended Data Table 2). In absolute terms, increases in BA are greater for larger size classes and canopy trees. However, in relative terms, the increase in size is not notably different when comparing large and small trees (Table 1 and Fig. 5).

Comparison between trends in tree size within different size classes (D‚Äâ<‚Äâ200‚Äâmm, D‚Äâ=‚Äâ200‚Äì399‚Äâmm and D‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ400‚Äâmm). Red solid line and dashed lines represent bootstrapped mean and 95% CI, zero is shown by the red line. To help visualize trends in absolute terms, plots that show annual rates of change‚Äâ<‚Äâ‚àí0.002‚Äâm2‚Äâyr‚àí1 or‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.002‚Äâm2‚Äâyr‚àí1 are omitted from the graph (59 plots, D‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ400‚Äâmm; 1 plot, D‚Äâ=‚Äâ200‚Äì399‚Äâmm). Note that although the increase in tree size is more evident within large trees (D‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ400‚Äâmm) in absolute terms, the trends in size are similar in relative terms regardless of the size class.

Smaller stems increased in mean stem BA, with a positive trend for relative tree size, but no change was observed in their total BA, likely due to a reduction in the frequency of smaller stems (Table 1). By contrast, the larger stems increased in size and in frequency. Thus, total BA also increased by 8.4% per decade for stems in the largest size class and by 2.8% per decade for overstorey stems (Table 1 and Extended Data Table 2). We found no evidence of a directional trend in plot-level wood density (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Our results show clear and pervasive changes in the structure of Amazonian forests over the recent decades. We find that tree size has been increasing across all size classes in the tree community and across different canopy strata, although in absolute terms this change has been greatest for the largest stems. As a result, we observe directional changes in the overall size distributions of Amazonian forests, with distributions becoming increasingly left-skewed, reflecting an increasing dominance and abundance of large stems. Concurrently, stem frequencies in the smallest size classes have declined. Overall, our findings suggest that the consistent increases in BA‚Äîand, by extension, biomass‚Äîacross Amazonian forests is increasingly concentrated in the largest trees.

The observed increases in tree size and BA are consistent with previous studies reporting a carbon sink across tropical forests stimulated particularly by CO2 fertilization1. Given the increases in tree size observed across the community, our findings offer support for a combination of a resource-driven boost for canopy trees (winners take all), and a reduction in growth suppression among understorey trees (carbon-limited benefit). It is worth noting that we find no evidence for declines in tree size or BA, suggesting that any negative climate-driven impacts on larger trees have so far been outweighed by the effects of increase in resources.

Our results are not consistent with trends that would be expected if late successional recovery from past disturbance‚Äîdue to occupation of these forests by early Amazonian peoples31,32,33 or natural disturbances34,35‚Äîwas the dominant driver of change. As succession advances, self-thinning takes place and the number of trees drops as space is occupied by fewer larger trees, leading to an increase in mean tree size36. Simultaneously, there is floristic turnover from lighter-wooded pioneers to denser-wooded late successional species36. If our results were primarily driven by recovery from disturbance, we would expect the increase in size to be more pronounced in forests at earlier stages of succession with smaller initial mean tree size, and to observe floristic compositional shifts towards lighter wooded species. However, we find no relationship between the change in tree size and floristic turnover towards denser-wooded trees (Extended Data Fig. 5), consistent with a previous analysis of compositional change across mature Amazonian forests37, and the increase in tree size was independent of the initial mean tree size (Extended Data fig. 6). Overall, our analyses indicate that the pervasive increase in tree size observed here is unlikely to be driven by an Amazon-wide recovery from previous disturbances.

The observed patterns match the expectations from increase in resources either by CO2 fertilization or by nitrogen deposition. Although atmospheric nitrogen deposition is a major driver of change in forests of temperate regions38, there is weaker evidence of its impact on tropical mature forests, particularly in remote regions39. First, mature Amazonian forests tend to be phosphorus and not nitrogen limited40, meaning that increases in nitrogen would not necessarily translate into greater productivity39,41. Second, although nitrogen deposition rates are expected to increase, they remain quite low7,42 and concentrated across the fragmented southern border of Amazonia43. On the contrary, atmospheric CO2 has progressively increased year after year globally and across all tropical forests, consistent with the Amazonian-wide tree size increase9 (Fig. 2). Thus, we conclude that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is the most likely, although potentially not only, driver of the observed increase in tree size.

The winners-take-all hypothesis predicts that under greater resource availability, the asymmetric competition for light intensifies and the competitive advantage for large canopy trees increases11. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe an increase in the dominance of large canopy trees across multiple metrics, including maximum stem size and total BA. This indicates that asymmetric growth responses are causing biomass to become increasingly concentrated in the largest stems. However, an increase in asymmetric competition alone is insufficient to explain all the observed trends. Although large trees increased the most in absolute terms, relative changes in size were approximately equal across size classes and strata (Fig. 5, Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 4). Size increases in smaller and understorey trees are consistent with experimental studies in which additional atmospheric CO2 alleviated suppression of understorey trees, including releasing them from negative carbon balance at low light levels26,44,45. We demonstrate this for forest trees in a non-experimental setting, and our findings add to evidence suggesting an important role for smaller and understorey trees as a long-term component of the forest carbon sink46,47.

The increasing dominance of large trees is consistent with the evidence of a substantial carbon sink in many forests2,3 and runs counter to the large-trees-lose hypothesis that larger trees should be decreasing in abundance because of their greater susceptibility to climate-related drivers of mortality, such as drought and windthrow29,30,48. Across Amazonia, we find no evidence for declines in the abundance or size of the largest trees. This suggests that, while mortality risks for large trees may be increasing29, the impact of this on forest structure has been outweighed by forest responses to increased CO2.

While the increase in tree size was observed for different size classes, we find diverging trends in stem frequencies among size classes. The per-area density of large stems has increased, but the numbers of smaller stems have declined. This may be related to the stabilization of recruitment rates across Amazonia3, meaning that increases in growth rates are not being matched by ingrowth from recruitment. However, declines in stem numbers may also be linked to rising mortality rates, with increasing in growth rates expected to accelerate tree life cycles leading to rise in mortality rates49,50. Similar changes in stand structure have been observed in temperate forests and are thought to be related to changes in competitive self-thinning relationships51. Regardless of the cause, declines in stem frequencies at smaller sizes have implications for the permanence of the observed trends and for the resilience of the overall ecosystem.

Our findings offer an important benchmark for understanding historic and future dynamics of the Amazonian carbon sink. Over recent decades, both growth rates and mortality rates have increased in Amazonian forests, with the increases in mortality lagging the increases in growth3. Our results are consistent with these changes. However, the increases in tree size may diminish and cease in coming decades, consistent with recent projections indicating future declines in the tropical forest carbon sink, if carbon losses increase2. Our findings provide a reference point for developing projections further, for example, by revealing that biomass is increasingly concentrated in the largest trees. The future growth and mortality dynamics of large trees will therefore be increasingly critical for the trajectory of the net carbon balance52.

We show that the structure of Amazonian forests is changing, with important consequences for the functioning and resilience of this system. Our results can be understood as a sign of the resilience of Amazonian forests, showing that any impacts of climate change on larger trees have been more than alleviated by the effects of CO2 fertilization. Whether these benefits are sufficient to counteract expected future increases in climate-related risks for the largest trees‚Äîwhich are more susceptible to heat, drought, lightning and windthrow‚Äîremains to be seen.

To describe temporal trends of forest stand structure across lowland (<1,000‚Äâm above sea level) tropical South American moist terra firme forests, we selected all long-term permanent tree monitoring plots meeting these criteria from the Amazon Forest Inventory Network (RAINFOR), an international collaboration conducting long-term monitoring of forest inventory plots53. Plot data were accessed via the ForestPlots.net repository54,55. These 188 plots had an average size of 1.2‚Äâha (ranging 0.4 to 12‚Äâha). Plots were monitored on average for 13‚Äâyears (ranging 2 to 30‚Äâyears), and the mean census interval length was 2.98‚Äâyears. The monitoring period varied between 1971 and 2015 among plots; the mean date of the first and last census was 1996 and 2010, respectively. The plots used in this study have no sign of substantial human disturbance and show no detectable legacy effect of past fire disturbance on tree composition56. Plots with known anthropogenic disturbances such as selective logging and fire were excluded from the analyses. All trees ‚â•10‚Äâcm diameter were marked, had their diameter (D) measured at 1.3‚Äâm from the ground when no trunk deformities are present, and mapped following a standardized protocol57. Lianas and coarse herbs (Phenakospermum) were excluded from the analyses. Palms were included in the analysis. As palms do not have radial growth, variation in the abundance of palms within plots may influence the magnitude of trends in structural parameters; we tested for this potential influence in Appendix 1 in the Supplementary Information. Further methodological details have been published elsewhere3.

One complexity when monitoring tropical trees is that they may have buttresses or deformities that can extend above the standard point of measurement (POM, 1.3‚Äâm) during the monitoring period. When there is any deformity compromising the cylindrical shape of the trunk at 1.3‚Äâm, such as buttresses, the POM is placed at higher parts of the trunk, above any deformities where the trunk is cylindrical57,58. Over time if buttresses or deformities occasionally further develop, the POM must be raised so that diameter measurements are not erroneously inflated. Such changes lead to discontinuities in growth data for individual trees. To deal with this, we use a sequence of the mean D estimated between the first and last POMs across the monitoring period, a solution reported in several previous studies3,59,60. We tested for any effect of the non-continuity of some POMs, and of the procedure to correct for it, on our results (Appendix 2 in the Supplementary Information).

To investigate trends in tree size across Amazon basin forests, we characterize the size structure of each census by (1) the mean, median and maximum stem BA; (2) total stand BA per hectare; (3) the Gini coefficient of inequality; (4) the stem diameter frequency distribution described by the shape (Œ≥) and scale (Œ≤) parameters of a two-parameter Weibull distribution; (5) the mean stem BA in each of three size classes, D‚Äâ<‚Äâ200‚Äâmm, D‚Äâ=‚Äâ200‚Äì399‚Äâmm and D‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ400‚Äâmm; (6) the mean stem BA of overstorey and understorey trees (see Appendix 3 in the Supplementary Information for methods to classify canopy status); (7) the mean number of stems per hectare; (8) the mean number of stems per hectare in each of three size classes, D‚Äâ<‚Äâ200‚Äâmm, D‚Äâ=‚Äâ200‚Äì399‚Äâmm and D‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ400‚Äâmm; and (9) mean stand-level wood density.

The Gini coefficient, used to quantify inequality, is derived from the Lorenz curve61, which in forest ecology is used to describe the distribution of the total area of a plot occupied by trees62. It represents the area between a hypothetical line where all individuals occupy the same area in a plot and the Lorenz curve, which is the cumulative proportion of area occupied by each tree as a function of the cumulative proportion of the number of trees. Thereby, if all individuals occupy the same area, Gini is equal to 0, while a completely unequal situation will be represented by Gini‚Äâ=‚Äâ1 (ref. 62). We calculated the Gini coefficient in each census using the ineq R package version 0.2-13 (ref. 63).

A two-parameter Weibull distribution was fitted to stem D frequency distributions, with the equation

where Œ≥ is the shape parameter and Œ≤ is the scale parameter. The Weibull distribution is well suited to describing stem D frequency distributions, as it fits a wide range of distribution shapes19,64. The scale parameter Œ≤ controls the spread of the distribution; higher scale parameter values indicate stem D distributions with a larger spread of stem D values and a higher proportion of large stems relative to small stems. The shape parameter Œ≥ controls the shape of the distribution. Shape parameter values <1 result in a right-skewed ‚Äòreverse-J' distribution with steadily decreasing stem frequencies. As shape parameter values increase, the distribution becomes less right-skewed, and the distribution approximates a normal distribution where shape parameter values are ~3.

If large trees are gaining as predicted by the winners-take-all hypothesis, we expect the scale parameter Œ≤ to increase, with stem D distributions showing an increase in the spread of stem sizes and a higher proportion of larger stems relative to small stems. We would also expect an increase in the shape parameter Œ≥ indicating a decline in the frequency of smaller stem sizes and a shift towards a less right-skewed distribution.

To assess whether any observed trends are primarily driven by recovery from disturbance, we also analyse trends in mean stand-level wood density. As forests recover from disturbance, there is floristic turnover from lighter-wooded pioneers to denser-wooded late successional species36, so if Amazonian forests are recovering from disturbance, we would expect to observe a change in floristic composition towards heavier wooded species. Wood density data were extracted from the Global Wood Density database65,66. Wood density values were obtained at species level, where possible, and otherwise at the level of genus or family. Stems which could not be assigned a wood density value at these levels were removed from this particular analysis (2.9% of total stems).

We investigated mean linear trends of each of the above stand structure parameters across the whole dataset. First, the linear trends for the individual plots were calculated as the linear slope of an ordinary least-squares regression of the size‚Äìstructure parameters as a function of time (the date when the census took place). Then, to test whether the overall response across the Amazon basin differed from 0, bootstrapped mean and 95% CI were obtained by randomly resampling values of plot-level trends, with replacement, across all plots 10,000 times67,68. For the mean, median and maximum tree BA, total BA, Gini coefficient, shape parameter (Œ≥), scale parameter (Œ≤) and stem density (stems per hectare), we also analysed trends by biogeographic region (Appendix 4 in the Supplementary Information). These analyses were repeated in relative terms, where size parameters where relativized by the size parameter in the first census. We weighted plots by the square root of plot area times the monitoring period to reduce the influence of potential stochastic changes, which are most likely to affect small plots and plots monitored over short monitoring periods3,60.

Distribution of mean (a) and median tree size (b), measured in basal area terms, and scale parameter (c) calculated per inventory plot across Amazonia.

Left: individual plot-level linear trends in size structure parameters across the full interval each plot was censused for. For visualisation purposes, only 92 of the 188 plots are included, with the most strongly weighted plots based on area and monitoring period length included. Positive trends lines are coloured blue, and negative trend lines are colored red. Right: Annual rate of change of size structure parameters. Red vertical lines show the overall bootstrapped mean (solid lines) and 95% CI (dashed lines). Blue lines are positioned at zero, that is no change.

Histograms of change in mean stem BA, the scale parameter, and stem numbers per ha by biogeographic region, showing consistent directional change in size distribution parameters across all four regions. Red vertical lines show the overall bootstrapped mean (solid lines) and 95% CI (dashed lines). Blue lines are positioned at zero, that is no change.

Red solid line and dashed lines represent bootstrapped mean and 95% CI, while the blue line shows 0. Canopy stratum was defined using the Ideal Tree Distribution (ITD) model (5). Note that trends in tree size for overstorey and understorey differ in absolute but not in relative terms.

(a) Histogram showing the distribution of rates of change in plot-level mean wood density. Overall trends in wood density are not significantly different from zero (mean = 1.51 √ó10‚àí5, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ-7.28 x 10‚àí5; 1.01 x 10‚àí4). (b) Relationship between trend in mean tree size and trend in mean wood density (two-sided t-test, t‚Äâ=‚Äâ7.32, p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.16, R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005). If forests were under late successional recovery, an increase in mean tree size would be associated with an increase in wood density.

(a) Relationship between initial mean tree size and rate of change in mean tree size (two-sided t-test, t‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.8, p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.89, R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0) (b) Relationship between initial scale parameter and rate of change in scale parameter (two-sided t-test, t‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.7, p-value‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.21, R2‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003). If forests were under successional recovery, we would expect the increase in size to be more pronounced in forests with smaller initial mean tree size and lower scale parameter values.

Colossal Biosciences as a company name was picked to engage children, says chief executive Ben Lamm.Credit: Colossal Biosciences

Colossal Biosciences, in Dallas, Texas, describes itself as the world's first de-extinction company. It aims to revive lost species using CRISPR gene-editing technology, including the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.). It attracted controversy when it announced it has ‚Äòde-extincted' the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago. Its co-founders are technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm, Colossal's chief executive, and George Church, the company's genetics adviser, who also holds academic research positions at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. 

In the third article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Lamm describes how the name ‚ÄòColossal Biosciences' came about. 

The fact that the world will lose up to 25% of all biodiversity between now and 2050 is a huge problem. At my company, we asked ourselves, how do we come up with a name that encompasses three elements: the problem, the solution and our flagship species, the mammoth? 

Climate change, biodiversity, CRISPR and gene editing, artificial intelligence, computational analysis and advanced embryology can be difficult concepts for the public to fully grasp. We came up with ‚ÄòColossal Biosciences' because losing species is a colossal problem, our solution is colossal and the mammoth is a colossal animal.

We felt that our brand and name should not only reflect the problem and solution, but also be approachable to children, including some who will grow up to read Cell, Nature and Science. Every week, we get little pictures of dodos and baby mammoths that kids draw, and their parents mail us physical letters, saying things such as: ‚ÄòThank you so much for doing what you're doing. My kid is excited about science. You're making science cool.' 

To come up with Colossal, I worked with Chris Klee, executive vice-president of design at the company, and Chris Stevens, co-founder of Maven Creative, our branding agency, in Orlando, Florida.

We've worked together for the past 20 years. We had a list of seven or eight potential names ‚Äî including ‚ÄòHuge', ‚ÄòMacedon' (an ancient kingdom) and ‚ÄòFootprint' (because every species has a unique one). Everything was centred around the concept of ‚Äòbig and awesome'. Obviously, ‚ÄòMammoth' was on the list because the world is facing a mammoth challenge, but we felt that calling it that would have pigeonholed us to one species. 

We also liked ‚ÄòColossus', and the idea of using ‚Äòus' to signify a team effort. But Colossus is a character in the Marvel Universe media franchise, and we didn't want to be too Hollywood. We also considered names linked to evolution, and thought ‚ÄòDarwin' could be a cool one. But when we said ‚ÄòColossal' out loud, we were like, ‚ÄòThat's it!' 

Alongside the name, there's the brand ‚Äî so before we decided on Colossal, we underwent a process to come up with a brand that encapsulated ‚ÄòHarvard University meets 1980's MTV'.

In August, months after Elon Musk left the federal government, the director of the Office of Personnel Management offered the first hard estimate of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency's impact on the civil service. The government would likely end 2025 with about 300,000 fewer employees than it had at the start of the year, he told reporters. Most resignations were attributable to the incentives DOGE had offered the federal workforce to resign their positions. The total figure amounted to one in eight workers.

Well, almost. In recent weeks, hundreds of the employees DOGE pushed out have reportedly been offered reinstatement.

The true scope of DOGE's attack on the federal government remains unknown. While there is no reason to think it achieved meaningful cost savings or operational efficiencies, the ramifications of building a master database to track and surveil immigrants are just beginning to be felt, and its cadre of Musk prot√©g√©s and tech entrepreneurs remain embedded in agencies throughout the executive branch. The possibilities this opens up‚Äîof private takeovers of government operations, of the government embracing Silicon Valley's ethos of moving fast and breaking things‚Äîremain open.

WIRED spoke with more than 200 federal workers across dozens of agencies to gather the most comprehensive picture yet of how the American government got to this point, and where it may go from here. Many sources requested anonymity because they fear retaliation. They told WIRED not just what has been going on inside the federal government at a time of unprecedented change‚Äîbut what it's been like to experience those changes firsthand.

The following is the story, in their words, of what happened when the world's most powerful man unleashed the world's richest one on the world's most complex institution.

‚ÄúI kept comparing it to a natural disaster,‚Äù one worker at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told WIRED. ‚ÄúBut it wasn't natural. Just a stampede of wide-eyed, confused government employees moving files around and looking over their shoulders because they think maybe Elon was creeping behind them with a chain saw.‚Äù

Donald Trump established DOGE within hours of taking office on January 20, assigning it the task of ‚Äúmodernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.‚Äù Within days, Musk's allies and their coterie of young, inexperienced technologists were appearing in the offices of relatively unknown agencies like the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management‚Äîobtaining unprecedented access to government systems and personnel files in the process. The DOGE operatives included young men like Edward ‚ÄúBig Balls‚Äù Coristine, Kyle Schutt, and Ethan Shaotran, all of whom would go on to work at a number of government agencies, from the Department of Education to the Social Security Administration.

‚ÄúI met Kyle and Ethan on January 23, and I very briefly bumped into Coristine before anyone was talking about him. I would describe them all as giddy, excited, curious, passionate, and super interested in learning about and jumping in on this new thing. I was super excited too at first.

‚ÄúThen the next week it felt like everything shifted and suddenly they were no longer curious or asking questions or on an adventure and instead they were just frantically running around trying to do impossible shit with no context and no flexibility and no ability to push back.

‚ÄúI thought maybe it would turn around. But it never did.‚Äù ‚ÄîGeneral Services Administration (GSA) worker

‚ÄúThe first meeting with DOGE‚Äîreally the only meeting with DOGE, if I'm going to be honest‚Äîwas ‚Ä¶ a virtual meeting that was 30 minutes long. In typical DOGE fashion, the government organization that we were promised unbelievable transparency on, they don't turn the cameras on, they don't tell you who they are, they don't tell you if anybody else is in the room, so you have no idea who you're talking to.‚Äù ‚ÄîColin O'Brien, former head of security at the United States Institute of Peace

‚ÄúWe saw them immediately. They acted like new hires but a bit furtive since they were actually instructed not to share their full names with us at first.‚Äù ‚ÄîTechnology Transformation Services worker

‚ÄúMy big aha moment came late, because for so long I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. These guys were young, and they had a job to do, and yes, they were doing it aggressively‚Äîbut again, I assumed the best. But then Ethan Shaotran went on Fox News, on Jesse Watters. He just trash-talked us pretty bad, conflating things they'd found at other agencies, basically implying we were misappropriating grant money. It made my blood boil. Ethan had to know that wasn't true. That was it for me‚Äîthere is no good faith at all.‚Äù ‚ÄîFederal worker

‚ÄúThe vibe they gave was ‚ÄòSo, what is it that you do here?' and ‚ÄòWhy can't AI do that?'‚Äù ‚ÄîTechnology Transformation Services worker

During the early weeks of the administration, emails from DOGE started showing up in federal workers' inboxes‚Äîor at least in their spam folders.

‚ÄúI logged on to find several emails tagged ‚ÄòExternal,' because DOGE just brought in their own servers and plugged them into the network. Then there were several subsequent emails from different leaders saying things like, ‚ÄòThank you for all the phishing reports, but the emails are real and need to be followed. But also please keep reporting things that look like phishing. Except from DOGE ‚Ä¶ but probably even then. And this is totally fine and normal.'‚Äù ‚ÄîContractor for the Veterans Administration

Among the emails was the now infamous ‚ÄúFork in the Road,‚Äù encouraging workers to be loyal or quit. It closely tracked the language of an email sent to Twitter employees not long after Musk's takeover of that company. A subsequent follow-up was even more insulting.

‚ÄúIt was truly so idiotic and looked like it was written by a disturbed child.‚Äù ‚ÄîCDC employee

‚ÄúWe're used to every little thing done by regulation, and now we're just getting crazy emails ‚Ä¶ This is a 5-alarm fire. This is a constitutional crisis.‚Äù ‚ÄîDepartment of Labor employee

‚ÄúThat response shocked me. We knew that this administration had little regard for professionals who choose to work for the federal government, but to state it so publicly, dripping with contempt, was truly unbelievable to me.‚Äù ‚ÄîGSA employee

Federal employees who remained were forced back to the office. Many found their workplaces increasingly hostile.

‚ÄúA woman I did not know in the cubicle next to me broke down. She was literally wailing, inconsolable, because she could not get into a childcare facility she could afford on such short notice. She literally had to choose between her little child and working. Her explaining to her manager the way her child cried and begged Mommy to stay home broke me. Then, as if on cue, an email from a person whose account said they were the acting IRS commissioner arrived in our inboxes, reminding us that it was ‚ÄúMental Health Awareness‚Äù month and that we can do such helpful things as ‚Äúpracticing gratitude‚Äù and breathing techniques to deal with stress. It also reminded us we can take time off to seek professional help ‚Ä¶ I never saw her again, and her cube is now empty.‚Äù ‚ÄîInternal Revenue Service employee

‚ÄúBecause we are part of Homeland Security, there's always an armed guard at FEMA facilities. That's a very standard thing. But the guys we're used to seeing are like the contracted-out, office patrol guys‚Äîthey're mall cops, to be polite about it. They sit at the desk and make sure you have ID, and that's the extent of their policing. We have a pretty good relationship with our local guy at the front desk of our building. He's a nice guy; he'll walk around our office sometimes. We share our snacks with him.

‚ÄúOne day he comes in to walk the office, like he does occasionally, and a few minutes after he passes by, another officer walks through. This time, it's somebody we've never seen before, and he's like, kitted out. He's dressed in all black from head to toe; he's got body armor on. He's wearing a tactical helmet. He's got a big gun on him, like a rifle, not like a handgun in a side pouch. He did not have a visible name tag, which is not standard at all‚Äîeverybody in a federal facility is required to identify themselves at all times, and he had no individual identifying markings. The only writing on his uniform was the big yellow text on his back that said HOMELAND SECURITY.

‚ÄúHe was walking through the office as slowly as he could. He would pause behind you and watch what you were doing for five to 20 seconds and then move on. His entire demeanor, it was very obvious he wanted us to see him, and he wanted to see us watching him. These are fucking office workers working on laptops. We're doing spreadsheets and PowerPoints. Like, chill out, dude.

‚ÄúMy coworker went over [to the guard] and was like ‚ÄòHey, welcome, can I help you with something, are we in danger? What's the problem? The officer announces‚Äînot just to my coworker but to as many people as can hear him‚Äî‚ÄòNo, I don't want your help. I'm just here to patrol you and to desensitize you to my presence.' Then he just keeps on walking. That's the only thing he's said to us. He's been through a couple times now and never gives anyone the time of day‚Äînever smiles, never says good morning, just walks through, dresses us all down for a few minutes, and leaves.‚Äù ‚ÄîFEMA employee

The offices were also quite literally gross‚Äîbecause DOGE had put a $1 spending limit on most government credit cards and didn't make exceptions for basic necessities.

‚ÄúThe women's restroom was out of toilet paper within a week or so of us coming back to the office. I brought this up to Facilities, like, ‚ÄòHey, this is kind of a sanitation and dignity issue, can you hook us up with more toilet paper?' They were like, ‚ÄòWe'd love to, but we can't purchase anything until they unfreeze the cards, and we don't even know what the process is, because they have them sort of indefinitely frozen.'

‚ÄúFor five months we were instructed to bring in our own toilet paper. I literally kept two rolls at my desk. I wish I were joking.‚Äù ‚ÄîFEMA employee

Musk and Trump were eagerly filling government agencies with their allies. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Trump installed Scott Turner, a former NFL cornerback.

‚Äú[Turner] has two primary sources of anecdotes I keep hearing: his time in the NFL‚Äîspecifically that he was drafted in the last round‚Äîand his father's time working as a shelf stocker at Safeway and how he is doing the same thing at HUD by ‚Äòtaking inventory and restocking the shelves.' For a motivational speaker and pastor he is neither motivational nor inspirational.‚Äù ‚ÄîHUD employee

Immigration was a major pillar of the second Trump administration. While the government made crystal clear it did not want foreigners in the country, it carved out an exception for a minority group of white South Africans in an executive order in February‚Äîa topic near and dear to Musk's heart, as a white immigrant from South Africa.

‚ÄúThis administration has made a complete mockery of the humanitarian side of immigration. I have interviewed parents who saw their children beheaded in front of them. I have interviewed children who saw their parents killed in front of them. I have interviewed women who have been sexually assaulted. I have interviewed children who have been sexually assaulted. I have interviewed teenagers who were beaten and threatened by their own family because they were part of the LGBTQI+ community. What has happened to these people in South Africa that warrants refugee status in the US? Nothing.‚Äù ‚ÄîDepartment of Homeland Security employee

Musk said he wanted to downsize the federal workforce. What was the right size, exactly? As lean as possible. Entire agencies were gutted as tens of thousands of federal employees were subjected to reductions in force, or RIFs. Some of these actions have been challenged in court, but the Supreme Court recently ruled that the Trump administration could continue its proposals to potentially lay off federal workers en masse.

‚ÄúThe moment everything crystallized for me was the day they came for a respected career deputy. Someone who embodied integrity and competence. His ‚Äòcrime'? Having the guts to challenge DOGE's reckless RIF plans. One afternoon, he returned from lunch to find security waiting at his desk. No explanation, no warning‚Äîjust a quiet escort out of the building while stunned colleagues looked on. Years of dedicated service reduced to a public humiliation.‚Äù ‚ÄîDepartment of Labor employee

‚ÄúI knew what the powers that be were doing wasn't legal. So either they were incompetent and didn't know it was illegal, or they knew it was illegal and didn't care. Which one is scarier?‚Äù ‚ÄîCDC employee

‚ÄúWhat stands out to me is how disorganized and unprofessional the GSA reduction in force was. Staff were instructed to return government IDs ASAP. We lost Google Drive access immediately, and the agency put resources about our RIF on there. We were blocked from sending emails to non-GSA addresses. Even trying to email career documents to your private email address became a huge issue.‚Äù ‚ÄîGSA employee

‚ÄúWhen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was first gutted, one person left their blazer in the office and was unable to get back into the building to get it. It was the only blazer they owned: They were broke, applying for jobs, and had nothing to wear to interviews because of this.‚Äù ‚ÄîCFPB employee

On February 14, tens of thousands of federal workers lost their jobs in an event that would become known to those impacted as the Valentine's Day Massacre. Other workers were told they were going to receive firing letters imminently‚Äîonly to wait days with no news.

‚ÄúMy fianc√©e and I had just come back from dinner. We're getting ready to go to bed. I decide I'm just going to disconnect from social media and my email. I'm just going to turn it off ‚Ä¶ I saw I had an unread message. I was fired at 11, 11:30 pm. [My fianc√©e] looks at me, and she sees my demeanor change. [She says,] ‚ÄòThat was the email, wasn't it?'‚Äù ‚ÄîFired Federal Aviation Administration aeronautical information specialist

‚ÄúIt was Valentine's Day, and my partner planned a romantic dinner for us that I ate in a catatonic state, in my sweatpants, covered in tears.‚Äù ‚ÄîCDC employee

On February 22, in another echo of his Twitter takeover, Musk warned that the entire federal workforce needed to write an email explaining what they'd gotten done the previous week.

‚ÄúIt was so humiliating to have to prove, ostensibly to Elon Musk‚Äîsomeone not in my chain of command or even a government employee‚Äîwhat I was doing. Not only is it none of their business what I was up to (they are not my supervisor), but they wouldn't even understand anything I put in there anyway since it's far too technical. I put read receipts on my first submission, and after I hadn't gotten pinged that it had been read after two subsequent submissions, I just stopped sending them. It made me so mad that not only are they passive-aggressively insinuating I'm doing nothing, but they're wasting tons of federal workers' time (and taxpayer money) doing this exercise, and they aren't even opening the emails. Infuriating.‚Äù ‚ÄîDepartment of Defense employee

‚Äú[Employees were responding with] emails in different languages ‚Ä¶ responding with the Constitution, and (for someone coming right back from maternity leave) responding with things such as: ‚Äòbreastfed a newborn for X number of hours, changed Y number of diapers with Z throughput, managed stakeholder input from my in-laws on best ways to burp a child.'‚Äù ‚ÄîVA IT worker

‚ÄúI actually laughed pretty hard [at Musk's email]. It's just so ridiculous ‚Ä¶ It's either [that or] be mad 24/7 (which some of my compatriots have decided to do), and I just don't have the energy anymore.‚Äù ‚ÄîFAA air traffic controller

On March 14, 2025, Colin O'Brien, then the head of security for the United States Institute of Peace, learned that the agency's board had purportedly been fired. DOGE associates, including one named Nate Cavanaugh, arrived at USIP headquarters in Washington, DC.

‚ÄúThe on-duty security lieutenant called me and said, ‚ÄòHey, DOGE is here.' The instructions we had given were that any visit by DOGE that was unscheduled, they were not to be permitted entry. If they had a scheduled appointment, absolutely, we'd have let them in. They stayed outside for a little bit less than 30 minutes and then left.‚Äù

Later, O'Brien got another call from the front security desk.

‚ÄúThey're like, ‚ÄòHey, the FBI is here with DOGE.' So we step outside. It was two FBI agents to our right and then four DOGE people to the left, sort of standing in a semicircle. They're dressed like college kids‚Äîsneakers and jeans that are too tight‚Äîcertainly not business attire.

‚ÄúOur attorney asked the FBI: Why are you guys here? Do you have a court order, a warrant, anything? And they said no, and they said, ‚ÄòWe're here to facilitate a cordial conversation.' They looked embarrassed to be there, being just very honest.

‚ÄúThe conversation lasts maybe five minutes, then the DOGE people leave with the FBI agents. I didn't realize at the time that one of the women in the DOGE SUV had run around to the side of the building and was trying to convince one of the guards to let her in through a side door, claiming at first that it was cold and she had to go to the bathroom. Then that changed, when she was told no, to: ‚ÄòI have every right to be in a government building.' So on one hand you have the intimidation factor of federal agents plus DOGE at your front door. And then you have this juvenile covert attempt in the back door. If she'd gotten in the door she would've probably called 911 and claimed false imprisonment or something.‚Äù

DOGE ultimately got into the building (estimated value: $500 million; DOGE attempted to gift GSA the space but was blocked by a federal judge) and fired nearly every employee. On March 28, as staff were receiving termination notices‚Äîand finding out their health care would be cut the same day‚Äîone of O'Brien's colleagues spied a salad in the office refrigerator with the name ‚ÄúNate C‚Äù on it and promptly threw it in the trash.

Elsewhere, DOGE was entering more agencies for the first time. Departments that rarely faced political strain, such as those that support arts and culture programs, were put under a microscope. Others, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were put on ice.

‚ÄúNo one has ever been against museums and libraries before. It seems like a really nonpolitical issue, and here we are facing a hostile takeover in real time ‚Ä¶ We were put on leave on March 31. By April 3, we were already starting to hear about grants being terminated. They were done through email, very generically, not through the official recordkeeping system, saying that they no longer met the priorities of the agencies. We initially heard about it from grantees. They were posting things publicly. On LinkedIn. On social media.‚Äù ‚ÄîInstitute of Museum and Library Services employee

‚ÄúPeople's livelihoods were gone, wiped out and thoroughly decimated. So many of these grantees work their entire lives to see a project, book, or exhibit come to fruition. These dreams came to a crashing and fiery end in the single hit of a button by someone who likely would never understand the true devastating impact.‚Äù ‚ÄîNational Endowment for the Humanities employee

‚ÄúI like to think of it as I am being slightly defiant. I'll say, ‚ÄòAlthough I was hired to do [certain duties] under the law, I have not been permitted to do work, so my accomplishments are limited to submitting a timesheet.'‚Äù ‚ÄîCFPB employee

After an initial flurry of lawsuits related to DOGE access to sensitive networks, the president decided to unilaterally declare on March 20 that they could go, essentially, wherever they wanted.

‚ÄúLearning about that was like getting punched in the stomach. It goes against everything our agency stands for, our mission. I have personally encouraged immigrant parents to file for benefits for their American children because those children needed it, and have promised all of them that they were safe and that we didn't share their information, and they trusted me. And now this administration has made a liar out of me.‚Äù ‚ÄîSocial Security Administration employee

At some agencies, that access extended to taking control of official social media accounts.

‚ÄúI had to turn over access to our website and social media accounts. Ethan Shaotran asked me to turn over the login info to the website, to Facebook, Instagram, and X. I gave the passwords and usernames for those accounts. He came back later and asked for the address to log in to the WordPress account. I tried to just give the exact information they asked for because I wanted to passively resist. That's why DOGE didn't get access to our LinkedIn‚Äîthey didn't ask for it. The public considers these guys to be tech geniuses, but I'd say WordPress is pretty intuitive. It took them two days to take the website down.‚Äù ‚ÄîFederal worker

In March, the Social Security Administration readied a plan ostensibly to combat identity theft. Under the plan, beneficiaries would not be able to verify their identity on the phone as they had in the past. Instead they'd have to use an online portal or show up in person. (About a week later, the SSA relented and began allowing the phone again.)

‚ÄúSome elderly beneficiaries were crying on the phone, terrified that they would lose their benefits if they couldn't figure out how to travel to an office and show us their ID. One woman was in her nineties. Another elderly couple showed up at an SSA office to prove they were alive, but it was never clear that this was necessary‚Äîno policy guidance had been issued.

‚ÄúWe were told to be patient and wait until guidance could be provided. At one point, we were told that we would receive instructions a week AFTER the policy implementation day.

‚ÄúIn the end, the administration discovered that there wasn't a problem with fraud in our teleclaims, something that frontline staff could've told them from the beginning. Less than 1 percent of claims were even flagged for further investigation. If our leaders would take the time to learn how to read the records, they might know this too.‚Äù ‚ÄîSSA employee

The concern for security apparently did not extend to DOGE affiliates themselves.

‚ÄúIn April, I happened to come across a partial list of employees and contractors who had not completed some of their mandatory security training. I wasn't surprised to see that DOGE-affiliated names made up more than a quarter of the list. It included [Technology Transformation Services director] Thomas Shedd, [Federal Acquisition Service head] Josh Gruenbaum, Ed Coristine, Luke Farritor, and Steven Davis. ‚ÄîCurrent GSA IT contractor

At AmeriCorps, DOGE called home thousands of young volunteers working on infrastructure projects or disaster relief around the country. It was chaos‚Äîa kind of chaos repeated across many agencies as spring wore on.

‚ÄúDOGE arrived at our agency in early April. About a week later, on Tuesday, they shut down the National Civilian Community Corps. They wanted to bring all the members home. Members were in the literal field though, like they were in forests and on trails.

‚ÄúThe next day, 85 percent of us were placed on administrative leave. They had people booking flights for members to get home, and their computers were cut off while they were booking. It was chaos. People were just disappearing. On April 24, people started receiving RIF notices, except a bunch of them were addressed to the wrong person.‚Äù ‚ÄîCurrent AmeriCorp employee

By June, Musk appeared to officially leave DOGE. With him went some key lieutenants: Steve Davis, Musk's right-hand man during the Twitter takeover and DOGE's de facto leader; Nicole Hollander, Davis' partner, who played a key role at the GSA; and Katie Miller, communications lead for DOGE and the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. Musk's send-off had included a friendly press conference with Trump, but that fragile peace was shattered a few days later, when Musk went to war with Trump on X. It seemed like Musk's ouster from government‚Äîand breakup with the president‚Äîwas complete.

‚ÄúFor all the talk that Trump likes teams of rivals, he doesn't respect people who are nasty, interpersonally ‚Ä¶ I thought the cabinet secretary fights would be the end. The president was not going to tolerate him going after his cabinet secretaries, publicly or privately ‚Ä¶ The president just didn't want that. He's not going to tolerate that negativity. He likes all these people. These are his people. Marco's a decade-old friend, at least, and a former competitor [with whom] he has a special comradery who he almost picked as his vice president. Peter Navarro went to jail for the guy. Took a federal charge, was found guilty, and ate it. Scott Bessent is his treasury secretary. Stuff like that was not gonna fly for very long.‚Äù ‚ÄîSenior Trump official

The era of Musk's DOGE, the flashy, so-called agency that garnered Fox News specials and had orchestrated the biggest upheaval the modern US government has ever faced, appeared to be over. But the next phase was just beginning, with DOGE's operatives and its ethos occupying every corner of government. And the toll on federal employees still hasn't stopped.

‚ÄúWe are in purgatory‚Äînot having enough resources to do our jobs and not knowing what the vision is for the agency moving forward. Leadership by utter neglect.‚Äù ‚ÄîGSA employee

‚ÄúI am a clinical psychologist with plenty of lifetime trauma myself, but I had never actually attended therapy or seen a psychiatrist until after the inauguration. I was so upset when I first spoke to the telehealth psychiatrist that I couldn't even speak and almost had to hang up. They said that I was not the first federal employee that they'd talked to.

‚ÄúThis was the trauma that they wanted, that they planned, that they promised us. And, for once, they did a great job of delivering.‚Äù ‚ÄîCDC employee

‚ÄúI'm terrified for our country and what all this means for the future. I need medication to help regulate me, because [Trump is] not going away anytime soon. And since I'm in HR, I can't get away from it. I live and breathe this during all my awake hours. If I'm not at work fielding questions from terrified employees or working with another team to terminate tons of people, family and friends are calling to see if I have any inside scoop or to check on the status of my own job.‚Äù ‚ÄîFederal HR employee

‚ÄúI'm the type of person where, like, if you push me I'll push back. I don't like to live in a mindset of despair and negativity. When these people do this shit, it just lights my fire. It makes me more fucking mad. This used to be the best job I've ever had, the best environment I've ever had, the best culture I've ever had‚Äîand they fucking ruined it. I will never ever forget how much they ruined it. I'm like, fuck these people. They can't get me scared. I will not give them what they want. I will not just leave. I'm going to make it as difficult as possible for these fuckheads.‚Äù ‚ÄîFEMA employee

In a world where hallowed news organizations transform into conservative mouthpieces and ‚Äãmilquetoast late-night jokes are grounds for suspension, satirical headlines from the Onion can feel closer to real life than parody.

Now the site is taking on one of the most taboo subjects of all‚Äîdisgraced sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein‚Äîin mockumentary form.

Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile is a 20-minute satire that's half biopic, half true crime, and 100 percent dumb (complimentary). It launches in theaters in New York City, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and San Francisco for one day only on October 2; after that it will be available online. You can watch the trailer right here.

Onion CEO Ben Collins says his writers decided to go big on Epstein once Donald Trump started acting ‚Äúdodgy‚Äù when fielding questions about Epstein this summer. They pulled it together in six weeks.

‚ÄúThere's this big gap where information should be,‚Äù Collins says. They thought ‚Äúit would be very funny to fill it with complete fucking nonsense.‚Äù

The mockumentary fills much of that gap with Trump himself. It opens with a fake voicemail from Epstein to Trump that heavily implies the president arranged his death. (Epstein died in prison in 2019; it was officially ruled a suicide.) ‚ÄúI just wanted to remind you that we're best friends, and tomorrow I'm going to tell the whole world that you're a pedophile, just like me,‚Äù the voice actor says over drone shots of the Manhattan skyline, Washington, DC, and the island where Epstein allegedly sex-trafficked minors. ‚ÄúUnless, of course, something bad happens to me tonight. But I'll probably be fine.‚Äù

From there, Bad Pedophile skewers all the standard true-crime tropes. Talking heads ask hard-hitting questions like, ‚ÄúWas he ever even alive to begin with?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWas Jeffrey his first name, or was Epstein his last name?‚Äù In addition to the portrayals of journalists, lawyers, and former associates, they throw in a priest whose title is ‚Äúpedophile expert.‚Äù To give you a hint of what satirical tack the Onion is taking, this is a world in which Epstein is described as an ‚Äúall-American molester‚Äù whose accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell first met him through a classified ad seeking a ‚Äúgross pervert assistant.‚Äù

About a third of the way in, we hear another fake audioclip, this time portraying a Department of Justice official telling Maxwell in a 2025 interview, ‚ÄúWe need you to help us cover up some of Donald Trump's crimes.‚Äù (The Justice Department released redacted transcripts of the actual Maxwell interview last month.) This is when Bad Pedophile takes a sharp turn to chronicle the relationship between Trump and Epstein. It would be a shame to spoil a sequence this ridiculous and sublime, so I'll leave it at that.

Like any good satire, the mockumentary's sharpest moments are flecked with bits of truth. While it has Epstein working at a fictional Deep State, it also calls out his allegedly real relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world, including Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton‚Äîthrowing in a few extra ‚Äúallegedlies‚Äù in the process. And of course it claims that Epstein, ‚Äúa pedophile in the prime of his life, with decades of molesting still in front of him,‚Äù didn't end his own life but was killed in a ‚Äúbotched government-sanctioned assassination,‚Äù complete with ‚Äúover 34,689,652 minutes‚Äù of missing surveillance footage from his jail cell. The latter is a nod to the footage that was cut from the ‚Äúfull raw‚Äù surveillance video from the only working camera near Epstein's Manhattan jail cell on the night before he was found dead in August 2019.

The release of Bad Pedophile will be more limited than was originally planned. Collins says a movie theater company was set to launch the mockumentary nationally but pulled out in the wake of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's death. The publication had to scramble to find an alternative.

‚ÄúIt does show you, this moment, if you are trying to get a merger through or something, or some sort of business from the government, or if you're just afraid of the ire of the president, the only real way to get stuff out there is independently,‚Äù says Collins. ‚ÄúIf you see Jeffrey Epstein's name and your immediate thought process is, ‚ÄòOh, this might offend the president,' that's not the problem of people making a joke. It's the problem of a broken and insanely failing society.‚Äù

Despite promising to be more transparent about releasing the so-called ‚ÄúEpstein files‚Äù during the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has since done an about-face. According to The Wall Street Journal, he was told he was named in the files, although it's unknown in what context. In a Truth Social post in September he described the case as the ‚ÄúDemocrat Epstein Hoax.‚Äù

As the Epstein saga continues to unfold, there's no telling when the public will have access to all of the pertinent information. In the meantime, at least there's the Onion.

‚ÄúIn the last year, we've been able to say a lot of stuff that other places are afraid to say,‚Äù says Collins. ‚ÄúWe're going to keep doing it.‚Äù

From lava worlds to gas giants, NASA says the variety of these worlds is staggering‚Äîand that signs of a further 8,000 distant planets are awaiting confirmation.

The number of confirmed planets outside of our solar system‚Äîknown as exoplanets‚Äîhas risen to 6,000, NASA has said. There is huge variety across these distant worlds, the space agency says, with discoveries including rocky planets, lava worlds, and gas giants enveloping their stars.

Plenty more discoveries are likely on the way. As a result of continued monitoring by NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI), there are more than 8,000 potential planets that have been identified and are awaiting confirmation. With future missions it has planned, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the Habitable Worlds Observatory, the US space agency hopes to discover more Earth-like planets and worlds with possible signs of life.

This 6,000-planet milestone comes 30 years after the first exoplanet was discovered orbiting a star similar to our sun. ‚ÄúThis milestone represents decades of cosmic exploration driven by NASA space telescopes‚Äîexploration that has completely changed the way humanity views the night sky,‚Äù said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters, in a statement. ‚ÄúStep by step, from discovery to characterization, NASA missions have built the foundation to answering a fundamental question: Are we alone?‚Äù

As the number of confirmed exoplanets has increased, the scientific community has been able to build a picture of the planet population across the universe. Researchers estimate that rocky planets appear to be most common in the universe. They've also discovered planets the size of Jupiter that orbit closer to their star than Mercury does to our sun, or planets that have two stars. Some discovered worlds are covered in lava; others are surrounded by clouds of precious stones.

‚ÄúEach of the different types of planets we discover gives us information about the conditions under which planets can form and, ultimately, how common planets like Earth might be and where we should be looking for them,‚Äù said Dawn Gelino, head of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program in a statement. ‚ÄúIf we want to find out if we're alone in the universe, all of this knowledge is essential.‚Äù

Although the number of confirmed exoplanets has reached 6,000, there are only about 100 that scientists have been able to observe directly. This is because light from faraway worlds is often so faint that it blends into the light emitted by the parent star. Detection methods therefore tend to be indirect; among the most common is the transit method, which involves detecting a planet by observing the star it orbits, which dims slightly for a brief time as the planet passes in front of it from our perspective.

The rate of exoplanet discoveries has greatly accelerated in recent years‚Äîthe 5,000-planet milestone was passed just three years ago. But for some researchers, the process of discovering potential candidates to confirming them as exoplanets isn't moving quickly enough. Once a possible planetary signal is detected, time-consuming follow-up observations then have to happen to rule out other possible explanations for the signal.

‚ÄúWe really need the whole community working together if we want to maximize our investments in these missions that are churning out exoplanets candidates,‚Äù said Aurora Kesseli, the deputy science lead for the NASA Exoplanet Archive, in a statement. ‚ÄúA big part of what we do at NExScI is build tools that help the community go out and turn candidate planets into confirmed planets.‚Äù

Future research at NASA will focus on Earth-like rocky planets, and in particular on studying their atmospheres to look for biological signatures: any features, elements, molecules, or substances that could be evidence of life being there, past or present. Both of its forthcoming missions‚Äîthe Roman Space Telescope and the Habitable Worlds Observatory‚Äîwill be equipped with tools to block out starlight, with the aim of making even the faintest Earth-like planets like Earth visible. Their findings will hopefully reveal new details about the diversity of planetary systems, as well as show how common solar systems like ours may be throughout the galaxy.

From its inception, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) operated as a rogue entity within the US government, slashing staff and funding, gaining access to government systems, and overriding agency decisionmaking‚Äîall without oversight from officials who have little understanding of its reach and methods.

A report issued by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) on Thursday adds new insight on how this incursion happened, while raising grave concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic data breach that would affect all Americans and serious questions about who DOGE operatives answer to.

Oversight staff detail how DOGE gained control over federal agencies, focusing their probe on three of DOGE's primary targets: the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Social Security Administration (SSA).

‚ÄúA clear pattern emerged across agencies‚Äîofficials who questioned DOGE were pushed out, and DOGE-affiliated personnel were installed in key positions such as Chief Information Officer,‚Äù the report finds. ‚ÄúThe DOGE associates were then able to grant approval to other DOGE employees to work with sensitive data without restrictions.‚Äù

Throughout the report, committee investigators describe DOGE representatives as working clandestinely within the agencies they were sent to serve and in spaces kept under armed guard, seemingly not beholden to government officials.

‚ÄúAt one point, GSA officials said they did not have the key to open a locked room that had windows covered with black paper, trash bags, and tape,‚Äù the report says, describing HSGAC staffers' attempts to inspect the agency's offices. ‚ÄúWhen staff asked why the most senior officials in offices charged with building management and security could not open an office door, GSA could not provide an answer.‚Äù

According to the report, investigators were forbidden from taking photos of where DOGE worked at GSA, which they noted appeared to be the group's ‚Äúprimary technical hub.‚Äù It was also clearly a living space: GSA officials told Senate staffers they'd purchased furniture to outfit seven bedrooms for ‚Äúintermittent sleeping;‚Äù there was even a ‚Äúmakeshift bedroom‚Äù next to the administrator's suite, which one official was surprised to find. The GSA administrator's dining room had unmade beds and a hot plate, while an office labeled ‚Äúchief of staff‚Äù had a Ping Pong table and a nearby kitchen had ‚Äúa dedicated fridge stocked with Celsius energy drinks and Muscle Milk.‚Äù

The administrator's office was filled with 10 work stations, stacks of laptops (8 to 10 per person), and ""multiple cellphones.‚Äù The GSA officials could not confirm that the devices were provided by GSA or who the DOGE reps working there reported to, simply calling them ‚ÄúGSA employees.‚Äù DOGE associates at the SSA were also allowed to telework, even as all other staffers were called back to the office. Many DOGE members were detailed to several agencies simultaneously, in a move that several experts have noted is unprecedented.

‚ÄúSenior officials at SSA, GSA, and OPM all failed to provide information about who was in charge; what conduct DOGE teams were engaged in; and what data those teams had been given access to, including the authorities and restrictions guiding their access,‚Äù the report says. ‚ÄúNone of the agencies could answer simple questions about organizational charts and employee roles.‚Äù

In response to a request for comment, an OPM spokesperson who did not give their name denied that OPM had any ‚Äú‚ÄòDOGE' employees‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúThis is absurd. OPM was clear the acting director, chosen by President Trump, oversaw OPM's activities. There were no DOGE teams.‚Äù

Who was‚Äîand is‚Äîin charge of all this is unclear to the investigators. Under the terms of the executive order establishing DOGE, that should be Amy Gleason, the administrator of the US DOGE Service. ‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù the report says, ‚Äúwhistleblowers told staff that Ms. Gleason is just a figurehead with no real power over DOGE staff at agencies and that most DOGE staff actually function outside of the US DOGE Service.‚Äù (Gleason did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

DOGE affiliates in the SSA had access to personal data belonging to all Americans, the report claims, citing interviews with whistleblowers from the agency‚Äîincluding Social Security numbers, birthplace, date of birth, and work permit status, and placed the information in an unsecured cloud environment established by DOGE. Earlier this year, SSA chief data officer Chuck Borges filed a whistleblower complaint accusing the agency of mishandling data and creating an unsecure server to hold it. DOGE operatives could edit and delete data in this system and potentially share it with private entities or foreign actors, the report finds. It's unclear if data was manipulated or shared outside of government.

The committee notes that it's ‚Äúvery likely‚Äù that US adversarial nations, including Russia, China, and Iran are aware of the cloud system DOGE set up at SSA.

One whistleblower who spoke to committee investigators alleged that data from SSA's NUMIDENT database showed up in Department of Homeland Security ‚Äúin an unusual format, suggesting that the data was not shared via a normal interagency data sharing agreement.‚Äù In April, WIRED reported that DOGE had uploaded SSA data to a DHS data lake that could be used to track and surveil migrants.

Prior to establishing the cloud environment, SSA conducted a risk assessment that found the possibility of a data breach with ‚Äúcatastrophic adverse effect‚Äù was between 35 and 65 percent, the committee's report says.

‚ÄúIn a worst-case scenario, one whistleblower noted the possibility that the agency may need to re-issue SSNs to all who possess one,‚Äù the report says.

‚ÄúIt is unclear why such a high-risk project is needed, or why DOGE personnel require the use of live data free from the supervision of agency officials,‚Äù the report says. ‚ÄúOne whistleblower told staff that the purpose of the database might be to provide free SSN verification for other federal agencies, but circumventing basic safeguards suggests that project may have other purposes.‚Äù

In response to questions, an unnamed SSA spokesperson referred WIRED to a September 16 letter from Commissioner Frank Bisignano to Senator Michael Crapo, and says, ‚Äúbased on the agency's thorough review, the Numident data and database‚Äìstored in a longstanding secure environment used by SSA‚Äìhave not been accessed, leaked, hacked, or shared in any unauthorized fashion.‚Äù The spokesperson also asserted that ‚Äúthere are no DOGE employees at SSA, only SSA employees.‚Äù

‚ÄúDOGE isn't making government more efficient‚Äîit's putting Americans' sensitive information in the hands of completely unqualified and untrustworthy individuals,‚Äù said Gary Peters, a Democratic US senator from Michigan and ranking member of HSGAC, in a statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúThey are bypassing cybersecurity protections, evading oversight, and putting Americans' personal data at risk. We cannot allow this shadow operation to continue operating unchecked while millions of people face the threat of identity theft, economic disruption, and permanent harm. The Trump Administration and agency leadership must immediately put a stop to these reckless actions that risk causing unprecedented chaos in Americans' daily lives.‚Äù

When visiting the GSA offices, committee investigators saw ‚Äúcloud infrastructure and enterprise network infrastructure diagrams‚Äù drawn on a whiteboard, but GSA officials blocked their view ‚Äúwith their bodies,‚Äù the report says.

The report also claims that GSA officials ‚Äúrefused to show staff Starlink infrastructure,‚Äù telling them to schedule a follow-up visit and then denying the request to do so. The GSA installed terminals from Starlink, the satellite company Musk owns, about a month after inauguration. At the time, GSA staff warned that this posed a significant security risk and voiced concern that the terminals could allow DOGE to siphon data out of the agency. According to the report, GSA officials ‚Äúcould not even confirm that the Starlink terminal was configured with basic security settings recommended by Starlink itself,‚Äù making staffers ‚Äúconcerned that any data sent or received over the Starlink device at GSA and other locations could be an easy target for foreign adversaries.""

Starlink terminals have also been installed at the White House.

This was not the only apparent effort to circumvent government policies and protections around data. One former OPM employee alleged in an interview with investigators that ‚Äúeven before the inauguration, the incoming administration expressed a ‚Äòstrong interest' in government-wide email servers and centralizing communications.‚Äù According to the employee, Greg Hogan, the incoming CIO, ‚Äúhad asked OPM staff whether they could deploy an AI system in an off-cloud environment, an environment that would allow for less agency oversight and fewer safeguards.‚Äù (The anonymous OPM spokesperson declined to comment on anything that happened before the inauguration. ‚ÄúThe CIO asked many technical questions as part of his role,‚Äù they said in response to a question about Hogan. ‚ÄúAll his work at OPM complied with the agency's security and regulatory requirements.‚Äù)

At the SSA, investigators found that access to the areas DOGE worked out of were controlled by armed guards. It was a measure taken, according to Dan Callahan, assistant commissioner for building and facilities management, because the DOGE members were ‚Äúconcerned for their safety.‚Äù Upon further inquiry, investigators found that this concern stemmed from ‚Äúcommunication with an SSA employee that ‚Äòincluded cursing.'‚Äù

At the GSA, ‚Äúarmed guards controlled access to work and living spaces [and] rooms were locked,‚Äù the report says, while the investigators' visit to OPM was carried out under armed guard. (‚ÄúThe ‚Äòarmed guards' were the normal security teams that provide security for the OPM office,‚Äù said the anonymous OPM spokesperson, citing purported ‚Äúmisbehavior‚Äù by the investigators as they visited other agencies. ‚ÄúThey accompanied the visit when entering secure areas with sensitive information.‚Äù)

As a result of the investigation, the report calls on the Trump administration to end all DOGE activities, revoke all access its representatives maintain over personally identifiable information, and require agencies to provide evidence that the access is compliant with existing privacy regulations. The investigators also demand that SSA shut down the cloud environment to which DOGE uploaded NUMIDENT data.

The White House and GSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Meta Poaches OpenAI Scientist to Help Lead AI Lab","https://www.wired.com/story/meta-poaches-openai-researcher-yang-song/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:26:00 GMT","

Mark Zuckerberg has poached a high-ranking OpenAI researcher to be the research principal of Meta Superintelligence Labs. Yang Song, who previously led the strategic explorations team at OpenAI, is now reporting to Shengjia Zhao, another OpenAI alum who has overseen the buzzy AI effort since July, according to multiple sources. He started earlier this month.

The move comes after Zuckerberg went on a hiring blitz earlier this summer, bringing in at least 11 top researchers from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

Song had been at OpenAI since 2022. His research there focused on improving models' ability to process large, complex datasets across different modalities. While still a graduate student at Stanford University, he developed a breakthrough technique that helped inform the development of OpenAI's Dall-E 2 image-generation model. Both he and Zhao attended Tsinghua University in Beijing as undergraduates and worked under the same adviser, Stefano Ermon, while pursuing PhDs at Stanford.

In a staff-wide memo sent this summer, Zuckerberg touted Zhao's impressive r√©sum√© as the cocreator of ChatGPT, GPT-4, all mini models, 4.1, and o3 at OpenAI‚Äîbut he did not specify Zhao's new role at Meta. In July, Zuckerberg wrote in a Threads post that while Zhao had ‚Äúcofounded the lab‚Äù and ‚Äúbeen our lead scientist from day one,‚Äù Meta had decided to ‚Äúformalize his leadership role‚Äù as the lab's chief scientist. The move came after Zhao threatened to return to OpenAI, even going as far as to sign employment documents, WIRED previously reported.

A small number of researchers have left Meta Superintelligence Labs since the initiative was first announced in June. Two staffers have returned to OpenAI, WIRED previously reported. One of these researchers went through onboarding but never showed up for their first day of work at Meta.

Another AI researcher, Aurko Roy, also left Meta in July, WIRED has learned. He'd worked at the tech giant for just five months, according to his personal website, which also says he now works on Microsoft AI. Roy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Yang Song, OpenAI, and Meta also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

Song joins an already crowded field of big-name AI talent within Meta's increasingly complicated AI division. When Zhao was hired in July, some speculated that he had replaced Yann LeCun, Meta's long-standing chief AI scientist. In a LinkedIn post, LeCun clarified that he remained chief AI scientist for Facebook AI Research, the company's longstanding foundational AI research lab.

Starbucks closed its flagship Reserve Roastery in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, nearly 11 years after the location opened as an especially technical and geeky ode to the coffee-making process.

Windows at the large facility at 1124 Pike St. were already boarded up on Thursday morning, following news of the Seattle-based coffee giant's major restructuring, announced by CEO Brian Niccol in a blog post. The company plans to lay off approximately 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada.

The $20 million Roastery, housed in a 1920s-era building which was once home to an auto showroom, opened in December 2014, just minutes from Starbucks' corporate headquarters south of downtown Seattle. Then-CEO Howard Schultz referred to it at the time as the ‚ÄúWilly Wonka of coffee.‚Äù

GeekWire toured the facility just before it opened to see how Starbucks planned to give customers a better understanding of the roasting process. For a city and a company steeped in coffee tradition and appreciation, the Reserve was a chance to experiment. Drinks at the mixology bar were created via processes such as Clover, pour-over, coffee press, Chemex, siphon or cold brew.

Technology was packed into the space, from sensors that prevented cross contamination of coffee beans to a 4K projector that showed footage of Starbucks' coffee farms on a smart glass window display. The two roasters were programmed to heat different types of beans at optimal amounts of time and temperature to ensure peak aroma, acidity, body, and flavor.

A company sign posted at the location on Thursday, captured by KIRO7, was addressed to ‚ÄúCap Hill neighbors and friends‚Äù and called the Reserve a ‚Äúdestination of coffee lovers from down the block and around the world.‚Äù

Workers at the Roastery voted to unionize in April 2022.

Niccol, who joined Starbucks after six years in the top job at Chipotle, has been charged with turning around the struggling company, which is dealing with slumping sales and criticism over everything from its complicated menu to wait times, prices, and more.

In his post Thursday, Niccol said Starbucks will end fiscal year 2025 with nearly 18,300 total Starbucks locations ‚Äì company operated and licensed. He said non-retail employees whose roles are being eliminated will be notified on Friday morning.

Starbucks has previously leaned heavily into its technology as a competitive advantage. It was early to mobile ordering, but this summer announced it was shuttering smaller-format tech-driven pickup only stores. Niccol called them ‚Äúoverly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.‚Äù

Starbucks cut 1,100 corporate workers in February in one of the largest layoffs ever at the company.

‚Äî Andy Larson, a longtime financial leader for Seattle startups, has joined Yoodli as CFO. 

Larson previously served as CFO for freight industry company Logixboard, recruiting startup Jobalign, and others. He joined financial company Remitly as CFO shortly after it launched, and later established its London operations.

Larson more recently co-founded MIH Group, which helps entrepreneurs develop their business ideas. 

‚ÄúYoodli is growing quickly, and bringing on an experienced CFO reinforces that we're building for the long term,‚Äù said Varun Puri, CEO and co-founder of Yoodli, who added that Larson ‚Äúknows how to scale companies responsibly while keeping the customer experience front and center.‚Äù

Yoodli uses generative AI to analyze speech and offer tips for improving communication skills. The startup launched in 2021 at the AI2 incubator in Seattle and raised $13.7 million in new funding in May. 

‚Äî A-Alpha Bio appointed Troy Lionberger as its new chief business officer. Lionberger was previously CBO for Abbratech and held leadership roles for biotech company Berkeley Lights.

A-Alpha Bio is a Seattle-based spinout of the UW's Institute for Protein Design using machine learning to create new antibodies for treating diseases. The company launched in 2017 and has raised a total of $65.5 million, including investments, grants and government contracts. 

‚Äî Siddhartha (Sidd) Srinivasa joined Seattle's Madrona Venture Group as a venture partner. Srinivasa is a professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and lead of the UW's Personal Robotics Lab.

He joined the UW in 2017 after nearly two decades at Carnegie Mellon University. Srinivasa has collaborated with industry while working in academia, including work on robotics engineering for Amazon fulfillment centers. Early in his career, Srinivasa co-founded the robotics company Berkshire Grey. 

‚Äî Attorney Pallavi Mehta Wahi recently opened and now leads a new Arnold & Porter office in Seattle, while also serving as the firm's chair of Western U.S. Strategic Growth. Arnold & Porter is a national regulatory firm providing legal counsel to the Seattle area's business community. 

Wahi was with K&L Gates for nearly two decades, leaving the position of managing partner at the Seattle-based international law firm.

She is also on the board of directors for the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. 

‚Äî Seattle-area tech leader Sonu Aggarwal is now president of TiE Seattle, a global nonprofit that supports entrepreneurs. He succeeds Prashant Mishra, CEO and founder of Click2Cloud who served as TiE Seattle president for more than two years.

Sonu was founder and chief technologist at the Bellevue, Wash., enterprise communications startup Unify Square, which was acquired by Unisys for more than $152 million in 2021.

Earlier in his career, Sonu was a manager at Microsoft across two stints and previously launched two additional startups.

‚Äî MoxiWorks named Kim Koraca as chief marketing officer of the Seattle-based real estate platform. MoxiWorks was formerly a customer of Koraca's marketing consulting firm. 

Koraca, who lives in Ottawa, has held marketing leadership roles at companies including eZsign, eZmax and Constellation1. 

In May, MoxiWorks sold MoxiBalance, its back-office accounting product, in order to focus on its sales and marketing solutions.

‚Äî Abdurazak Mudesir joined T-Mobile's board of directors. Mudesir is the group CTO of Deutsche Telekom AG, the majority owner of T-Mobile, and in his role is responsible for overseeing the building, maintenance and security of its network.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Kurt Schlosser on Sep 25, 2025 at 10:02 amSeptember 25, 2025 at 10:02 am

Microsoft has blocked an Israeli military unit from using some of its technology services after the company found evidence supporting a report that the tech was being used for surveillance of  Palestinian civilians.

The move by the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant is in response to an Aug. 6 report by The Guardian, which revealed how Microsoft Azure was being used to store and process millions of Palestinian civilian phone calls made each day in Gaza and the West Bank.

Microsoft President Brad Smith announced in a note to employees on Thursday the decision to cease and disable services being used by Unit 8200, an Israeli military spy agency. He said an ongoing review by Microsoft had found ‚Äúevidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,‚Äù Smith wrote. ‚ÄúWe have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.‚Äù

He also noted that Microsoft's respect for the privacy rights of its customers ‚Äî in this case, the Israeli military ‚Äî meant that among other things, it could not access customer content. The company previously acknowledged limits as to what it could verify, citing a lack of visibility into use of its technology on private servers outside its cloud.

The Guardian report and Microsoft's dealings with Israel during the ongoing war in Gaza have been the basis for repeated protests against the company on its headquarters campus and elsewhere in recent months.

Members of the group No Azure for Apartheid have been calling on Microsoft to cut all ties to the Israeli military and government. Demonstrations in Redmond in August grew increasingly confrontational. Twenty people, including some current and former employees, were arrested during a protest on campus on Aug. 20. A week later, several protesters made their way into and occupied Smith's office in Building 34.

At the time, Smith said Microsoft was committed to upholding its human rights principles and was actively investigating The Guardian report.

The Guardian reported that the massive repository of intercepted Palestinian calls ‚Äî which amounted to as much as 8,000 terabytes of data ‚Äî was held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands. The newspaper said that within days of publishing its investigation, ‚ÄúUnit 8200 appears to have swiftly moved the surveillance data out of the country.‚Äù

On Thursday, The Guardian cited sources familiar with the data transfer, which occurred in early August, and said Unit 8200 ‚Äúplanned to transfer the data to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform.‚Äù Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor Amazon responded to The Guardian's request for comment, and GeekWire has reached out to Amazon as well.

In his memo to employees, Smith said that the company will continue providing cybersecurity services to Israel and other countries in the Middle East.

Read Brad Smith's full letter to employees:

I want to let you know that Microsoft has ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD). I know many of you care about this topic, and I share more about this decision below.

Let me first provide some context. As I've said to you in recent weeks, Microsoft is not a government or a country. We are a company. Like every company, we decide what products and services to offer to our customers.

As we publicly announced on August 15, we decided to undertake a review of allegations that appeared in an article published on August 6 by The Guardian about a unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As we explained at that time, The Guardian article reported that ‚Äúmultiple individuals have asserted that the IDF is using Azure for the storage of data files of phone calls obtained through broad or mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank.‚Äù

We have reviewed The Guardian's allegations based on two principles, both grounded in Microsoft's longstanding protection of privacy as a fundamental right. As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust.

First, we do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft's standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians.

Second, we respect and protect the privacy rights of our customers. This means, among other things, that we do not access our customers' content in this type of investigation.

Since August 15, we have pursued this review by respecting both these principles, as well as the company's policies, contracts, and customer commitments. At no point has Microsoft accessed IMOD's customer content. Rather, the review has focused on Microsoft's own business records, including financial statements, internal documents, and email and messaging communications, among other records.

While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services.

We therefore have informed IMOD of Microsoft's decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies. We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians.

As I said at our recent employee townhall, this does not impact the important work that Microsoft continues to do to protect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East, including under the Abraham Accords.

I want to note our appreciation for the reporting of The Guardian. Its reports were based in part on sources outside Microsoft that had information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments. This helped inform our review.

I appreciate that many of you will have additional questions. Our review is ongoing. I'll share more information in the coming days and weeks, when it's appropriate to do so, including lessons learned from this review and how we will apply those lessons as we go forward.

Microsoft will continue to be a company guided by principles and ethics. We will hold every decision, statement, and action to this standard. This is non-negotiable.

Brad

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

The Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday a landmark settlement with Amazon over allegations that the company enrolled millions of consumers into Prime memberships without clear consent and intentionally made the cancellation process difficult. 

The deal includes a $1 billion civil penalty ‚Äî the largest ever in an FTC case involving a rule violation ‚Äî and $1.5 billion in refunds for consumers who the agency says were harmed by deceptive Prime enrollment and cancellation practices. Amazon will also be required to overhaul its Prime sign-up and cancellation processes and submit to independent compliance monitoring.

‚ÄúThe evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,‚Äù FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. ‚ÄúToday, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.‚Äù

The case stems from a 2023 FTC complaint against Amazon. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Seattle ruled that Amazon violated online shopper protection law by collecting payment information before disclosing full Prime terms, a setback that loomed over the company as the trial began this week.

‚ÄúAmazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,‚Äù Amazon said as part of a statement. ‚ÄúWe work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.‚Äù

The Seattle-based tech giant did not admit wrongdoing under the settlement. It previously argued Prime's terms were clear and cancellations were accessible.

According to the FTC, Amazon employed confusing checkout flows and deceptive user interfaces ‚Äî commonly described as ‚Äúdark patterns‚Äù ‚Äî to nudge shoppers into Prime sign-ups they didn't expect. In parallel, the FTC alleged that Amazon created a complex cancellation process.

The settlement forces Amazon to redesign Prime's enrollment interface ‚Äî requiring clearer disclosures and a ‚Äúclear and conspicuous button‚Äù to decline Prime. Amazon cannot have a button that says, ‚ÄúNo, I don't want Free Shipping.‚Äù

The FTC estimates 35 million consumers will be eligible for refunds.

Amazon Prime memberships cost $139/year or $15/month. Subscribers get discounts on shipping, video and music streaming, and other benefits.

Amazon doesn't disclose specific Prime membership data. There were an estimated 197 million Amazon customers who had a Prime membership as of March 2025, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners ‚Äî up about 7% from the June 2024 quarter.

Subscription services revenue, which includes Prime memberships, came in at $12.2 billion in the company's most recent quarter, up 12% year-over-year. That accounted for about 7% of Amazon's overall revenue in the quarter.

Amazon shares were down slightly on Thursday. The company has a market capitalization of nearly $2.4 trillion.

Elon Musk's xAI has reached an agreement with the U.S. government's purchasing arm to sell its AI chatbot Grok to the federal government for under a dollar, pitting it against OpenAI and Anthropic. 

Under the agreement between xAI and the General Services Administration (GSA), federal agencies will be charged 42 cents to use xAI's chatbot Grok for a year and a half. OpenAI and Anthropic are offering their enterprise and government versions of ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, for $1 for a year.  

The steep discount for federal agencies includes access to xAI engineers to help integrate the technology.

The price point is either part of a running joke Musk has of using variations of 420, a marijuana reference, or a nod to one of Musk's favorite books, ‚ÄúThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,‚Äù which references the number 42 as the answer to the meaning of life and the universe.  

Earlier this year, xAI had been close to being approved as a GSA vendor, but after Grok began generating antisemitic posts and calling itself ‚ÄúMechaHitler‚Äù on X, the planned partnership reportedly fell through. In late August, internal emails obtained by Wired revealed the White House had instructed the GSA to add xAI's Grok to the approved vendor list ‚ÄúASAP.‚Äù 

The company was also one of several AI firms, including Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, to be selected for a $200 million contract with the Pentagon. 

After President Donald Trump's inauguration, Musk formed and led the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in a rampant cost-cutting spree that has seen mixed results. During that time, Musk placed several aides at the GSA and other government agencies responsible for regulating or awarding government contracts in industries in which Musk has business.

Databricks said on Thursday that it is incorporating OpenAI's models, including GPT-5, into its data platform as well as its AI product, Agent Bricks, as part of a $100 million multi-year deal that bets on the AI company's ability to bring in enterprise customers.

The deal highlights the accelerating race to bring generative AI into the enterprise stack, as companies foresee demand for AI tools that can tap into corporate data securely.

Agent Bricks lets organizations build AI apps and agents on top of their enterprise data using a range of AI models. OpenAI's latest models are now part of that menu ‚Äî accessible in SQL or via API ‚Äî and GPT-5 is being offered as a flagship model for Databricks customers.  

The news comes nearly two months after Databricks added OpenAI's open-weight models, gpt-oss 20B and gpt-oss 120B, to the platform. Agent Bricks can now measure how accurately the different models perform on specific tasks and fine-tunes accordingly to produce more tailored results.

‚ÄúOur partnership with Databricks brings our most advanced models to where secure enterprise data already lives, making it easier for businesses to experiment, deploy, and scale AI agents with real impact,‚Äù Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer of OpenAI, said in a statement.  

With this deal, Databricks is betting that enterprise customers will flock to OpenAI's models. Under the terms, the company is on the hook to pay a minimum of $100 million to OpenAI whether or not the AI firm's models generate that much in revenue over the life of the deal. 

Neither company disclosed how long the agreement will run. If revenue ends up exceeding $100 million, OpenAI will earn more, but if it falls short, Databricks will have to pay the full amount anyway. For Databricks, it means potential downside risk; for OpenAI, it means predictable income at a time when the company is trying to rapidly build out more data centers.  

The deal is similar to the one Databricks reached with Anthropic earlier this year, setting a revenue target of $100 million over five years.

A Databricks spokesperson told TechCrunch that the firm has already seen overwhelming demand from customers, including Mastercard, for native access to OpenAI's models on the platform.

Meta announced on Thursday that its Teen Accounts are now being expanded to teens on Facebook and Messenger globally, after initially only being available to users in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada. The accounts, which feature built-in protections and parental controls for younger users, first launched on Instagram last fall.  

Teen Accounts were originally launched shortly after Meta and other popular social networks were grilled by U.S. lawmakers for not doing enough to protect teens on their services.

With the global expansion on Facebook and Messenger, teens will now automatically be placed into an experience that is designed to limit inappropriate content and unwanted contact. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents' permission to change any of the settings.

Additionally, teens will only receive messages from people they follow or have messaged before. Only teens' friends can see and reply to their stories. Plus, tags, Mentions, and comments will also be limited to people they follow or who are their friends.

Teens will also receive reminders to leave the social networks after using them for an hour a day, and they'll be enrolled in ‚ÄúQuiet mode‚Äù overnight.

The expansion of Teen Accounts comes as research led by a Meta whistleblower recently found that children and teens are still at risk from online harm on Instagram, even after the company has rolled out protections. The study found that despite being placed into Teen Accounts, young users can still come across suicide and self-harm posts, along with posts describing demeaning sexual acts. Meta has disputed the claims and said its protections have led to teens seeing less harmful content.

Meta also announced on Thursday that it's officially launching the School Partnership Program, which allows educators to report safety concerns, like bullying, directly to Instagram for quicker review and removal.

The company says it piloted the program earlier this year and heard positive feedback from participating schools. Now, all middle and high schools in the U.S. can sign up for the program to receive prioritized reporting and education resources. Schools that are part of the program will receive a banner on their Instagram program to notify parents and students that they are an official Instagram partner.

Thursday's announcement marks Meta's latest step toward addressing teen mental health concerns tied to social media. These concerns have been raised by the U.S. surgeon general and several states, some of which have even started restricting teens from using social media without a parent's consent.

Spotify on Thursday announced a series of updates to its AI policy, designed to better indicate when AI is being used to make music, to cut down on spam, and to make it clearer that unauthorized voice clones are not permitted on its service.

The company says it will adopt an upcoming industry standard for identifying and labeling AI music in credits, known as DDEX, and will soon roll out a new music spam filter to catch more bad actors.

Under the DDEX system, labels, distributors, and music partners submit standardized AI disclosures in music credits. This solution offers detailed information about the use of AI ‚Äî like whether it was used for AI-generated vocals, instrumentation, or post-production, for example.

‚ÄúWe know the use of AI is going to be a spectrum, with artists and producers incorporating AI in various parts of their creative workflow,‚Äù said Sam Duboff, Spotify's Global Head of Marketing and Policy, in a press briefing on Wednesday. ‚ÄúThis industry standard will allow for more accurate, nuanced disclosures. It won't force tracks into a false binary where a song either has to be categorically AI or not AI at all,‚Äù he noted. 

As part of the same announcement, Spotify clarified its polices around AI-enabled personalization, stating directly thatunauthorized AI voice clones, deepfakes, and any other form of vocal replicas or impersonation are not allowed and will be removed from the platform.

While the DDEX standard is developing, Spotify says it's received commitments from 15 labels and distributors who plan to adopt the technology, and sees its move as one that could signal to others it's time to adopt the technology.

Because AI tools make it easier for anyone to release music, Spotify also has a new plan to cut down on the potential spam that results. This fall, the company will roll out a new music spam filter that will attempt to address spam tactics, tag them, and then stop recommending those tracks to users.

‚ÄúWe know AI has made it easier than ever for bad actors to mass upload content, create duplicates, use SEO tricks to manipulate search or recommendation systems‚Ä¶we've been fighting these kinds of tactics for years,‚Äù Duboff said. ‚ÄúBut AI is accelerating these issues with more sophistication, and we know that requires new types of mitigations.‚Äù

The company said it would roll out the filter gradually to make sure it's targeting the right signals, then add more signals over time as the market evolves. 

Related to this, Spotify will also work with distributors to address something called ‚Äúprofile mismatches,‚Äù a scheme where someone fraudulently uploads music to another artist's profile across streaming services. The company said it hopes to prevent more of these before the music ever goes live. 

Despite the changes, Spotify executives emphasized that they still support use of AI provided it's used in a non-fraudulent way. ‚ÄúWe're not here to punish artists for using AI authentically and responsibly. We hope that artists' use of AI production tools will enable them to be more creative than ever,‚Äù noted Spotify VP and Global Head of Music, Charlie Hellman. ‚ÄúBut we are here to stop the bad actors who are gaming the system, and we can only benefit from all that good side of AI if we aggressively protect against the downside,‚Äù he said.

Spotify's updates follow a rapid increase in AI-generated music across the industry. This summer, an AI-generated band called Velvet Sundown went viral on its service, leading users to complain that the company isn't transparent about labeling its AI tracks. Meanwhile, streaming rival Deezer recently shared that about 18% of the music uploaded each day to its service ‚Äî or more than 20,000 tracks ‚Äî is now fully AI-generated. 

Spotify wouldn't share its own metrics on the matter directly ‚Äî but Duboff told reporters that ‚Äúthe reality is, all streaming services have almost exactly the same catalog.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople tend to deliver the music to all services,‚Äù he explained, adding that uploading tracks doesn't mean anyone's listening or that the AI music makes money. ‚ÄúWe know AI usage is increasingly not a binary, but kind of a spectrum of how artists and producers are using it.‚Äù

Ask Starpath CEO Saurav Shroff his thoughts on America's space priorities and he'll say we're ‚Äúone order of magnitude high on cost and one order of magnitude low on ambition.‚Äù 

Starpath's answer, at least to part of the problem, is ultra-low-cost space power, which is generated by solar panels.

Starpath's new space-rated solar panel business kicked off sales in the U.S. on September 25 with an eyebrow-raising pitch. The company says its solar panels, called ‚ÄúStarlight,‚Äù are priced around 10 times cheaper than typical industry pricing of $75-250 per watt, roughly a 90% cost reduction versus the status quo.

There will be two product tiers at launch, an ‚Äúengineering model‚Äù and a ‚Äúflight model.‚Äù The engineering model is priced at $9.81 per watt, with shipping beginning the second week of October. This model goes through a streamlined testing process, but is not flight-rated, making it suited for prototyping, lab use, and building a satellite ahead of launch, a Starpath representative said.

The flight model, designed for in-space use, is $11.20 per watt and is slated to ship in the fourth quarter of this year.

The startup says the steep cost reduction comes in part from building its own automated production line.

That production process ‚Äî details of which Starpath is largely keeping private ‚Äî is designed to dramatically increase throughput. By next year, the startup claims its line could produce more than the rest of the world's supply of space-rated solar power combined, with enough capacity to service every satellite made on Earth.

‚ÄúIt's a win for humanity if our solar panels are available commercially for the entire space industry at a price that is 90% cheaper than what you can get today,‚Äù Shroff said. Panels ‚Äúwon't be made to order ‚Ä¶ they'll be stocked.‚Äù Shipping times will be as short as three weeks to the customer's door initially, and just three days from December onward. It's a dramatic reduction from today's five- to 14-month lead times, Starpath says.

The new product line grew out of Starpath's broader ambition: to terraform the solar system, starting with the moon and Mars. When the team priced power for a serious lunar base, ‚Äúthe current solar solutions were not economically viable,‚Äù Shroff said. ‚ÄúYou'd literally be looking at spending more than the GDP of the entire world on solar power‚Äù to scale today's satellite-supply-chain economics.

‚ÄúThe economics sort of kind of work for the satellite industry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey're very expensive, but they do not work for building a city on Mars.‚Äù

That prompted Starpath to design its own product and process. Shroff says the low prices mean ‚Äúfor a multimillion-dollar satellite ‚Ä¶ it will only cost you $100,000 to get the power system.‚Äù

Starpath's roadmap is aggressive. Shroff said the underlying production system is designed to rapidly scale. ‚ÄúIf demand called for it,‚Äù the company could scale to upwards of 40 megawatts ‚Äúwithin a year,‚Äù he said.

Without naming names, Shroff said companies are interested in building applications for low Earth orbit that require a lot of power.

Selling panels, he argued, doesn't distract from Starpath's core mission. Instead, it monetizes a capability the company had to build anyway. Shroff pointed out that Starpath will be the consumer of around 98% of its own output, using the vast majority of its own panels for its off-world infrastructure.

‚ÄúWe think that people should dream bigger,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEverybody should take a careful look, particularly NASA, at their goals, and ask themselves if they're dreaming big enough.‚Äù

The story has been updated to reflect that the system could scale to 40 megawatts.

On Thursday, the AI platform Clarifai announced a new reasoning engine that it claims will make running AI models twice as fast and 40% less expensive. Designed to be adaptable to a variety of models and cloud hosts, the system employs a range of optimizations to get more inference power out of the same hardware.

‚ÄúIt's a variety of different types of optimizations, all the way down to CUDA kernels to advanced speculative decoding techniques,‚Äù said CEO Matthew Zeiler. ‚ÄúYou can get more out of the same cards, basically.‚Äù

The results were verified by a string of benchmark tests by the third-party firm Artificial Analysis, which recorded industry-best records for both throughput and latency.

The process focuses specifically on inference, the computing demands of operating an AI model that has already been trained. That computing load has grown particularly intense with the rise of agentic and reasoning models, which require multiple steps in response to a single command.

First launched as a computer vision service, Clarifai has grown increasingly focused on compute orchestration as the AI boom has drastically increased demand for both GPUs and the data centers that house them. The company first announced its compute platform at AWS re:Invent in December, but the new reasoning engine is the first product specifically tailored for multi-step agentic models.

The product comes amid intense pressure on AI infrastructure, which has spurred a string of billion-dollar deals. OpenAI has laid out plans for as much as $1 trillion in new data center spending, projecting nearly limitless future demand for compute. But while the hardware buildout has been intense, Clarifai's CEO believes there is more to be done in optimizing the infrastructure we already have.

‚ÄúThere's software tricks that take a good model like this further, like the Clarifai reasoning engine,‚Äù Zeiler says, ‚Äúbut there's also algorithm improvements that can help combat the need for gigawatt data centers. And I don't think we're at the end of the algorithm innovations.‚Äù

This comes with negative side effects for website owners (costs, downtime, etc.), as repeatedly reported here on HN (and experienced myself).Does Webhound respect robots.txt directives and do you disclose the identity of your crawlers via user-agent header?

Does Webhound respect robots.txt directives and do you disclose the identity of your crawlers via user-agent header?

reply

This is definitely something we need to address on our end. Site owners should have clear ways to opt out, and crawlers should be identifiable. We're looking into either working with Firecrawl to improve this or potentially switching to a solution that gives us more control over respecting these standards.Appreciate you bringing this up.

Appreciate you bringing this up.

Great decision to make it without a login so people can test.Here is what I liked:- The agent told me exactly what's happening, which sources it is checking, and the schema.- The agent correctly identified where to look at, and how to obtain the data.- Managing expectations: Webhound is extracting data
Extraction can take multiple hours. We'll send you an email when it's complete.Minor point:- There is no pricing on the main domain, just the HN one https://hn.webhound.ai/pricingGood luck!

We were heavily inspired by tools like Cursor - basically tried to prioritize user control and visibility above everything else.What we discovered during iteration was that our users are usually domain experts who know exactly what they want. The more we showed them what was happening under the hood and gave them control over the process, the better their results got.

If it isn't doing that in your session, you can usually just step in and tell it to and it will follow your instructions.

Can you tell us more about this. How does it work?

A few design decisions we made that turned out pretty interesting:1. We gave it an analyze results function. When the agent is on a search results page, instead of visiting each page one by one, it can just ask ""What are the pricing models?"" and get answers from all search results in parallel.2. Long web pages get broken into chunks with navigation hints so the agent always knows where it is and can jump around without overloading its context (""continue reading"", ""jump to middle"", etc.).3. For sites that are commonly visited but have messy layouts or spread out information, we built custom tool calls that let the agent request specific info that might be scattered on different pages and consolidates it all into one clean text response.4. We're adding DOM interaction via text in the next couple of days, so the agent can click buttons, fill forms, enter keys, but everything still comes back as structured text instead of screenshots.

Instead of just search query ‚Üí final result (though you can do that too), you can step in and guide it. Tell it exactly where to look, what sources to check, how to dig deeper, how to use its notepad.We've found this gets you way better results that actually match what you're looking for, as well as being a more satisfying user experience for people who already know how they would do the job themselves. Plus it lets you tap into niche datasets that wouldn't show up with just generic search queries.

I am concerned about your pricing, as ""unlimited"" anything seems to be fading away from most LLM providers. Also, I don't think it makes sense for B2B clients who have no problem paying per usage. You are going to find customers that want to use this to poll for updates daily, for example.Are you using proxies for your text-based browser?

We've been having similar thoughts about pricing and offering unlimited, but since it is feasible for us in the short term due to credits we enjoy offering that option to early users, even if it may be a bit naive.Having said that, we are currently working on a pilot with a company whom we are offering live updates, and they are paying per usage since they don't want to have to set it up themselves, so we can definitely see the demand there. We also offer an API for companies that want to reliably query the same thing at a preset cadence, which is also usage based.For crawling we use Firecrawl. They handle most of the blocking issues and proxies.

When I worked for Accenture, I got benched for an entire summer. It was great. At the time the only resource to find a new project was this spreadsheet uploaded to Sharepoint, and there was 0 pressure from my HR rep to actually look for a new role.I eventually found a new job and quit, but I always wondered what would have happened if I just stayed on the bench while working at the 2nd job.

But the bench also provided great opportunities to do actual good trainings, certifications and upskilling of all kinds. But the company stopped investing into its future long ago. It's just about short term gains for those on top.

Don't they pair juniors up with seniors in existing projects? Before I'd ""bench"" anyone, I'd do that without charging for them, so they learn and can do realised billable hours later down the line. I'd feel so weird getting benched. I didn't know that was a thing anyone did frankly.

reply

It does seem weird from the outside I agree.  It can also depend on the person, skillset, etc.  Some people will never get benched just because they don't have any or enough other people with equivalent skills, so there's constant demand.(edit: skillset, not skillet, obviously your bench rate does not depend on your cookware)

The only reason the current management is still in place is because the CEO's husband is in politics and institutional investors want to keep their allies in place. In turn, Accenture keeps their friends happy by syphoning money from the bottom to the top, at the cost of their own consultancy and delivery capabilities. Meanwhile, the C-suit cashes out big-time.The CEO is fundamentally incapable of changing even a light bulb, let alone address strategic problems. As a lawyer and Harvard MBA, she provided ""growth"" by buying shitty IT-companies where key-experts left the company immediately. She doesn't have the knowledge or intellectual capability or create ""value"" or ""operational efficiency"". Instead, they chase trends and make one terrible decision after another. This burns money faster than a conveyor belt can transport into a furnace (like selling off most offices during covid at low prices and having to buy new ones when prices are up).

Unlike a partnerships model, Accenture taps the public markets for financing to do M&A  and pays its star salespeople with stock. Declining revenue growth rerates the stock price lower, which then makes the market more competitive (can't buyout others) and acts as a disincentive to the salespeople, which then lowers the stock price further. This alone may be survivable, but at the same time, the company has more than half a million staff (!) employed in India/Philippines/etc at exactly the time when the market wants SOTA-level AI work instead of legacy ‚Äòmanaged services', and the federal government is cutting many $B of ACN contractsTl;dr: these guys aren't getting IBM'd, they're getting Xerox'd

That's fine. But then the xray tech becomes the radiologist, and that becomes the point in the workflow that the insurer digs out the malpractice premiums.In essence, your xray techs would become remarkably expensive. Someone is talking to the clinicians about the results. That person, whatever you call them, is going to be paying the premiums.

Similar to how a model that can do ""PhD-level research"" is of little use to me if I don't have my own PhD in the topic area it's researching for me, because how am I supposed to analyze a 20 page research report and figure out if it's credible or not?

AI is going to augment radiologists first, and eventually, it will start to replace them. And existing radiologists will transition into stuff like interventional radiology or whatever new areas will come into the picture in the future.

A) The night before, a woman in her 40's came in to the ER suffering a major psychological breakdown of some kind (she was vague to protect patient privacy). The Dr prescribed a major sedative, and the software alerted that they didn't have a negative pregnancy test because this drug is not approved for pregnant women and so should not be given. However, in my wife's clinical judgement- honed by years of training, reading papers, going to conferences, actual work experience and just talking to colleagues- the risk to a (potential) fetus from the drug was less than the risk to a (potential) fetus from mom going through an untreated mental health episode and so she approved the drug and overrode the alert.B) A prescriber had earlier in that week written a script for Tylenol to be administered ""PR"" (per-rectum) rather than PRN (per requisite need). PR Tylenol is a perfectly valid thing that is sometimes the correct choice, and was stocked by the hospital for that reason. But my wife recognized that this wasn't one of the cases where that was necessary, and called the nurse to call the prescriber to get that changed so the nurse wouldn't have to give them a Tylenol suppository. This time there were no alerts, no flags from the software, it was just her looking at it and saying ""in my clinical judgement, this isn't the right administration for this situation, and will make things worse"".So someone- with expensively trained (and probably licensed) judgement- will still need to look over the results of this AI pharmacist and have the power to override its decisions. And that means that they will need to have enough time per case to build a mental model of the situation in their brain, figure out what is happening, and override if necessary. And it needs to be someone different from the person filling out the Rx, for Swiss cheese model of safety reasons.Congratulations, we've just described a pharmacist.

This is something I question. If you go to a specialist, and the specialist judges that you need surgery, he can just schedule and perform the surgery himself. There's no other medical professional whose sole job is to second-guess his clinical judgment. If you want that, you can always get a second opinion. I have a hard time buying the argument that prescription drugs always need that second level of gatekeeping when surgery doesn't.

IDK, these are just limitations - people that really believe in AI will tell you there is basically nothing it can't do... eventually. I guess it's just a matter of how long you want to wait for eventually to come.

If every doctor agreed to electronically prescribe (instead of calling it in, or writing it down) using one single standard / platform / vendor, and all pharmacy software also used the same platform / standard, then our jobs are definitely redundant.I worked at a hospital where basically doctors and pharmacists and nurses all use the same software and most of the time we click approve approve approve without data entry.Of course we also make IVs and compounds by hand, but that's a small part of our job.

The kiosk is placed inside of a clinic/hospital setting, and rather than driving to the pharmacy, you pick up your medications at the kiosk.Pharmacists are currently still very involved in the process, but it's not necessarily for any technical reason. For example, new prescriptions are (by most states' boards of pharmacies) required to have a consultation between a pharmacist and a patient. So the kiosk has to facilitate a video call with a pharmacist using our portal. Mind you, this means the pharmacist could work from home, or could queue up tons of consultations back to back in a way that would allow one pharmacist to do the work of 5-10 working at a pharmacy, but they're still required in the mix.Another thing we need to do for regulatory purposes is when we're indexing the medication in the kiosk, the kiosk has to capture images of the bottles as they're stocked. After the kiosk applies a patient label, we then have to take another round of images. Once this happens, this will populate in the pharmacist portal, and a pharmacist is required to take a look at both sets of images and approve or reject the container. Again, they're able to do this all very quickly and remotely, but they're still required by law to do this.TL;DR I make an automated dispensing kiosk that could ""replace"" pharmacists, but for the time being, they're legally required to be involved at multiple steps in the process. To what degree this is a transitory period while technology establishes a reputation for itself as reliable, and to what degree this is simply a persistent fixture of ""cover your ass"" that will continue indefinitely, I cannot say.

I think the part that says models will reduce time to complete tasks and allow providers to focus on other tasks is on point in particular. For one CV task, we're only saving on average <30min of work per study, so it isn't massive savings from a provider's perspective. But scaled across the whole hospital, it's huge savings

Are there systematic reasons why radiologists in hospitals are inaccurately assessing the AI's output? If the AI models are better than humans in testing novel data then, well, the thing that has changed in a hospital situation compared to the AI-Human testing environment is not the AI, it is the human, under less controlled constraints, additional pressures, workloads, etc. Perhaps the AI's aren't performing as poorly as thought. Perhaps this is why they performed better to begin with. Otherwise, production ML systems are generally not as highly regarded as these models when they perform as significantly below test data sets in production.

Clinical AI also has to balance accuracy with workflow efficiency. It may be technically most accurate for a model to report every potential abnormality with associated level of certainty, but this may inundate the radiologist with spurious findings that must be reviewed and rejected, slowing her down without adding clinical value. More data is not always better.In order for the model to have high enough certainty to get the right balance of sensitivity and specificity to be useful, many many examples are needed for training, and with some rarer entities, that is difficult. It also inherently reduces the value of the model it is only expected to identify its target disease 3 times/year.That's not to say advances in AI won't overcome these problems, just that they haven't, yet.

At the end of the day if the radiologist makes an error the radiologist gets sued.If AI replaces the radiologist then it is OpenAI or some other AI company that will get sued each and every time the AI model makes a mistake. No AI company wants to be on the hook for that.So what will happen? Simple. AI will always remain just a tool to assist doctors. But there will always be a disclaimer attached to the output saying that ultimately the radiologist should use his or her judgement. And then the liability would remain with the human not the AI company.Maybe AI will ""replace"" radiologists in very poor countries where people may not have had access to radiologists in the first place. In some places in the world it is cheap to get an xray but still can be expensive to pay someone to interpret it. But in the United States the fear of malpractice will mean radiologists never go away.EDIT: I know the article mentions liability but it mentions it as just one reason among many. My contention is that liability will be the fundamental reason radiologists are never replaced regardless of how good the AI systems get. This applies to other specialities too.

""Human radiologists spend a minority of their time on diagnostics and the majority on other activities, like talking to patients and fellow clinicians""I've had the misfortune of dealing with a radiologist or two this year.

I've used ChatGPT's information on the rare occasions when doctors deign to speak with me and it's always been right.  Me, repeating conclusions and observations ChatGPT made, to my doctors, has twice changed the course of my treatment this year, and the doctors have never said anything I've learned from ChatGPT is wrong.  By contrast, my doctors are often wrong, forgetful, or mistaken.  I trust ChatGPT way more than them.Good image recognition models probably are much better than human radiologists already and certainly could be vastly better.  One obstacle this post mentions - AI models ""struggle to replicate this performance in hospital conditions"", is purely a choice.  If HMOs trained models on real data then this would no longer be the case, if it is now, which I doubt.I think it's pretty clearly doctors, and their various bureaucratic and legal allies, defending their legal monopoly so they can provide worse and slower healthcare at higher prices, so they continue to make money, at the small cost of the sick getting worse and dying.

  In particular, doctors appear to defer excessively to assistive AI tools in clinical settings in a way that they do not in lab settings. They did this even with much more primitive tools than we have today... The gap was largest when computer aids failed to recognize the malignancy itself; many doctors seemed to treat an absence of prompts as reassurance that a film was clean

Reminds me of the ""slop"" discussions happening right now. When the tools seem good, but aren't, we develop a reliance to false negatives, e.g. text that clearly ""feels"" written by a GPT model.

AI art is getting better but still it's very easy for me to quickly distinguish AI result from everything else, because I can visually inspect the artifacts and it's usually not very subtle.I'm not a radiologist, but I would imagine AI is doing the same thing here, making up things that are cancer, missing things that aren't cancer, and it takes an expert to distinguish the false positives from true. So we're back at square one, except the expertise has shifted from interpreting the image to interpreting the image and also interpreting the AI.

I actually disagree in that it's not easy for me at all to quickly distinguish AI images from everything else. But I think we might differ what we mean by ""quickly"". I can quickly distinguish AI if I am looking. But if I'm mindlessly doomscrolling I cannot always distinguish 'random art of an attractive busty woman in generic fantasy armor that a streamer I follow shared' as AI. I cannot always distinguish 'reply-guy profile picture that's like a couple dozen pixels in dimensions' as AI. I also cannot always tell if someone is using a filter if I'm looking for maybe 5 seconds tops while I scroll.

The industry is getting billions, but it's way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand.

This week, Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced it has another customer for its first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. Eni, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, signed a billion-dollar deal to buy electricity from the facility.

The power purchase agreement makes Eni the second major customer for Commonwealth's first commercial fusion power plant.

One small detail? That reactor doesn't exist yet. Neither does the smaller reactor Commonwealth is building first to demonstrate that its tokamak design will work as intended.

This is a weird moment in fusion. Investors are pouring billions into the field to build power plants, and some companies are even signing huge agreements to purchase power from those still-nonexistent plants. All this comes before companies have actually completed a working reactor that can produce electricity. It takes money to develop a new technology, but all this funding could lead to some twisted expectations. 

Nearly three years ago, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hit a major milestone for fusion power. With the help of the world's most powerful lasers, scientists heated a pellet of fuel to 100 million ¬∞C. Hydrogen atoms in that fuel fused together, releasing more energy than the lasers put in.

It was a game changer for the vibes in fusion. The NIF experiment finally showed that a fusion reactor could yield net energy. Plasma physicists' models had certainly suggested that it should be true, but it was another thing to see it demonstrated in real life.

But in some ways, the NIF results didn't really change much for commercial fusion. That site's lasers used a bonkers amount of energy, the setup was wildly complicated, and the whole thing lasted a fraction of a second. To operate a fusion power plant, not only do you have to achieve net energy, but you also need to do that on a somewhat constant basis and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîdo it economically.

So in the wake of the NIF news, all eyes went to companies like Commonwealth, Helion, and Zap Energy. Who would be the first to demonstrate this milestone in a more commercially feasible reactor? Or better yet, who would be the first to get a power plant up and running?

So far, the answer is none of them.

The lack of essential supply chains and process technologies necessary to commercialize fusion energy could doom the US and European countries in capturing the critical geopolitical prize.

To be fair, many fusion companies have made technical progress. Commonwealth has built and tested its high-temperature superconducting magnets and published research about that work. Zap Energy demonstrated three hours of continuous operation in its test system, a milestone validated by the US Department of Energy. Helion started construction of its power plant in Washington in July. (And that's not to mention a thriving, publicly funded fusion industry in China.)  

These are all important milestones, and these and other companies have seen many more. But as Ed Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at Berkeley, summed it up to me: ‚ÄúThey don't have a reactor.‚Äù (He was speaking specifically about Commonwealth, but really, the same goes for the others.)

And yet, the money pours in. Commonwealth raised over $800 million in funding earlier this year. And now it's got two big customers signed on to buy electricity from this future power plant.

Why buy electricity from a reactor that's currently little more than ideas on paper? From the perspective of these particular potential buyers, such agreements can be something of a win-win, says Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute.

By putting a vote of confidence behind Commonwealth, Eni could help the fusion startup get the capital it needs to actually build its plant. The company also directly invests in Commonwealth, so it stands to benefit from success. Getting a good rate on the capital needed to build the plant could also mean the electricity is ultimately cheaper for Eni, Stein says. 

Ultimately, fusion needs a lot of money. If fossil-fuel companies and tech giants want to provide it, all the better. One concern I have, though, is how outside observers are interpreting these big commitments. 

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been loud about his support for fusion and his expectations of the technology. Earlier this month, he told the BBC that it will soon power the world.

He's certainly not the first to have big dreams for fusion, and it is an exciting technology. But despite the jaw-dropping financial milestones, this industry is still very much in development. 

And while Wright praises fusion, the Trump administration is slashing support for other energy technologies, including wind and solar power, and spreading disinformation about their safety, cost, and effectiveness. 

To meet the growing electricity demand and cut emissions from the power sector, we'll need a whole range of technologies. It's a risk and a distraction to put all our hopes on an unproven energy tech when there are plenty of options that actually exist.

Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

When Kenneth Wehr started managing the Greenlandic-language version of Wikipedia four years ago, his first act was to delete almost everything. It had to go, he thought, if it had any chance of surviving.

Wehr, who's 26, isn't from Greenland‚Äîhe grew up in Germany‚Äîbut he had become obsessed with the island, an autonomous Danish territory, after visiting as a teenager. He'd spent years writing obscure Wikipedia articles in his native tongue on virtually everything to do with it. He even ended up moving to Copenhagen to study Greenlandic, a language spoken by some 57,000 mostly Indigenous Inuit people scattered across dozens of far-flung Arctic villages. 

The Greenlandic-language edition was added to Wikipedia around 2003, just a few years after the site launched in English. By the time Wehr took its helm nearly 20 years later, hundreds of Wikipedians had contributed to it and had collectively written some 1,500 articles totaling over tens of thousands of words. It seemed to be an impressive vindication of the crowdsourcing approach that has made Wikipedia the go-to source for information online, demonstrating that it could work even in the unlikeliest places. 

There was only one problem: The Greenlandic Wikipedia was a mirage. 

Machine learning is bringing us closer to a Babel-fish-style universal translation device.

Virtually every single article had been published by people who did not actually speak the language. Wehr, who now teaches Greenlandic in Denmark, speculates that perhaps only one or two Greenlanders had ever contributed. But what worried him most was something else: Over time, he had noticed that a growing number of articles appeared to be copy-pasted into Wikipedia by people using machine translators. They were riddled with elementary mistakes‚Äîfrom grammatical blunders to meaningless words to more significant inaccuracies, like an entry that claimed Canada had only 41 inhabitants. Other pages sometimes contained random strings of letters spat out by machines that were unable to find suitable Greenlandic words to express themselves. 

‚ÄúIt might have looked Greenlandic to [the authors], but they had no way of knowing,‚Äù complains Wehr. 

‚ÄúSentences wouldn't make sense at all, or they would have obvious errors,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúAI translators are really bad at Greenlandic.‚Äù  

What Wehr describes is not unique to the Greenlandic edition. 

Wikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed and tested. Many of these smaller editions have been swamped with automatically translated content as AI has become increasingly accessible. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations. And after auditing the Wikipedia edition in Inuktitut, an Indigenous language close to Greenlandic that's spoken in Canada, MIT Technology Review estimates that more than two-thirds of pages containing more than several sentences feature portions created this way. 

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems, from Google Translate to ChatGPT, learn to ‚Äúspeak‚Äù new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers‚Äîso any errors on those pages, grammatical or otherwise, can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. That can make the models' translation of these languages particularly error-prone, which creates a sort of linguistic doom loop as people continue to add more and more poorly translated Wikipedia pages using those tools, and AI models continue to train from poorly translated pages. It's a complicated problem, but it boils down to a simple concept: Garbage in, garbage out. 

‚ÄúThese models are built on raw data,‚Äù says Kevin Scannell, a former professor of computer science at Saint Louis University who now builds computer software tailored for endangered languages. ‚ÄúThey will try and learn everything about a language from scratch. There is no other input. There are no grammar books. There are no dictionaries. There is nothing other than the text that is inputted.‚Äù

There isn't perfect data on the scale of this problem, particularly because a lot of AI training data is kept confidential and the field continues to evolve rapidly. But back in 2020, Wikipedia was estimated to make up more than half the training data that was fed into AI models translating some languages spoken by millions across Africa, including Malagasy, Yoruba, and Shona. In 2022, a research team from Germany that looked into what data could be obtained by online scraping even found that Wikipedia was the sole easily accessible source of online linguistic data for 27 under-resourced languages. 

This could have significant repercussions in cases where Wikipedia is poorly written‚Äîpotentially pushing the most vulnerable languages on Earth toward the precipice as future generations begin to turn away from them. 

‚ÄúWikipedia will be reflected in the AI models for these languages,‚Äù says Trond Trosterud, a computational linguist at the University of Troms√∏ in Norway, who has been raising the alarm about the potentially harmful outcomes of badly run Wikipedia editions for years. ‚ÄúI find it hard to imagine it will not have consequences. And, of course, the more dominant position that Wikipedia has, the worse it will be.‚Äù 

Automation has been built into Wikipedia since the very earliest days. Bots keep the platform operational: They repair broken links, fix bad formatting, and even correct spelling mistakes. These repetitive and mundane tasks can be automated away with little problem. There is even an army of bots that scurry around generating short articles about rivers, cities, or animals by slotting their names into formulaic phrases. They have generally made the platform better. 

But AI is different. Anybody can use it to cause massive damage with a few clicks. 

Wikipedia has managed the onset of the AI era better than many other websites. It has not been flooded with AI bots or disinformation, as social media has been. It largely retains the innocence that characterized the earlier internet age. Wikipedia is open and free for anyone to use, edit, and pull from, and it's run by the very same community it serves. It is transparent and easy to use. But community-run platforms live and die on the size of their communities. English has triumphed, while Greenlandic has sunk. 

‚ÄúWe need good Wikipedians. This is something that people take for granted. It is not magic,‚Äù says Amir Aharoni, a member of the volunteer Language Committee, which oversees requests to open or close Wikipedia editions. ‚ÄúIf you use machine translation responsibly, it can be efficient and useful. Unfortunately, you cannot trust all people to use it responsibly.‚Äù 

Trosterud has studied the behavior of users on small Wikipedia editions and says AI has empowered a subset that he terms ‚ÄúWikipedia hijackers.‚Äù These users can range widely‚Äîfrom naive teenagers creating pages about their hometowns or their favorite YouTubers to well-meaning Wikipedians who think that by creating articles in minority languages they are in some way ‚Äúhelping‚Äù those communities. 

‚ÄúThe problem with them nowadays is that they are armed with Google Translate,‚Äù Trosterud says, adding that this is allowing them to produce much longer and more plausible-looking content than they ever could before: ‚ÄúEarlier they were armed only with dictionaries.‚Äù 

This has effectively industrialized the acts of destruction‚Äîwhich affect vulnerable languages most, since AI translations are typically far less reliable for them. There can be lots of different reasons for this, but a meaningful part of the issue is the relatively small amount of source text that is available online. And sometimes models struggle to identify a language because it is similar to others, or because some, including Greenlandic and most Native American languages, have structures that make them badly suited to the way most machine translation systems work. (Wehr notes that in Greenlandic most words are agglutinative, meaning they are built by attaching prefixes and suffixes to stems. As a result, many words are extremely context specific and can express ideas that in other languages would take a full sentence.) 

Research produced by Google before a major expansion of Google Translate rolled out three years ago found that translation systems for lower-resourced languages were generally of a lower quality than those for better-resourced ones. Researchers found, for example, that their model would often mistranslate basic nouns across languages, including the names of animals and colors. (In a statement to MIT Technology Review, Google wrote that it is ‚Äúcommitted to meeting a high standard of quality for all 249 languages‚Äù it supports ‚Äúby rigorously testing and improving [its] systems, particularly for languages that may have limited public text resources on the web.‚Äù) 

Wikipedia itself offers a built-in editing tool called Content Translate, which allows users to automatically translate articles from one language to another‚Äîthe idea being that this will save time by preserving the references and fiddly formatting of the originals. But it piggybacks on external machine translation systems, so it's largely plagued by the same weaknesses as other machine translators‚Äîa problem that the Wikimedia Foundation says is hard to solve. It's up to each edition's community to decide whether this tool is allowed, and some have decided against it. (Notably, English-language Wikipedia has largely banned its use, claiming that some 95% of articles created using Content Translate failed to meet an acceptable standard without significant additional work.) But it's at least easy to tell when the program has been used; Content Translate adds a tag on the Wikipedia back end. 

Other AI programs can be harder to monitor. Still, many Wikipedia editors I spoke with said that once their languages were added to major online translation tools, they noticed a corresponding spike in the frequency with which poor, likely machine-translated pages were created. 

Some Wikipedians using AI to translate content do occasionally admit that they do not speak the target languages. They may see themselves as providing smaller communities with rough-cut articles that speakers can then fix‚Äîessentially following the same model that has worked well for more active Wikipedia editions.  

But once error-filled pages are produced in small languages, there is usually not an army of knowledgeable people who speak those languages standing ready to improve them. There are few readers of these editions, and sometimes not a single regular editor. 

Yuet Man Lee, a Canadian teacher in his 20s, says that he used a mix of Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate a handful of articles that he had written for the English Wikipedia into Inuktitut, thinking it'd be nice to pitch in and help a smaller Wikipedia community. He says he added a note to one saying that it was only a rough translation. ‚ÄúI did not think that anybody would notice [the article],‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIf you put something out there on the smaller Wikipedias‚Äîmost of the time nobody does.‚Äù 

But at the same time, he says, he still thought ‚Äúsomeone might see it and fix it up‚Äù‚Äîadding that he had wondered whether the Inuktitut translation that the AI systems generated was grammatically correct. Nobody has touched the article since he created it.

Lee, who teaches social sciences in Vancouver and first started editing entries in the English Wikipedia a decade ago, says that users familiar with more active Wikipedias can fall victim to this mindset, which he terms a ‚Äúbigger-Wikipedia arrogance‚Äù: When they try to contribute to smaller Wikipedia editions, they assume that others will come along to fix their mistakes. It can sometimes work. Lee says he had previously contributed several articles to Wikipedia in Tatar, a language spoken by several million people mainly in Russia, and at least one of those was eventually corrected. But the Inuktitut Wikipedia is, by comparison, a ‚Äúbarren wasteland.‚Äù 

He emphasizes that his intentions had been good: He wanted to add more articles to an Indigenous Canadian Wikipedia. ‚ÄúI am now thinking that it may have been a bad idea. I did not consider that I could be contributing to a recursive loop,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was about trying to get content out there, out of curiosity and for fun, without properly thinking about the consequences.‚Äù 

Wikipedia is a project that is driven by wide-eyed optimism. Editing can be a thankless task, involving weeks spent bickering with faceless, pseudonymous people, but devotees put in hours of unpaid labor because of a commitment to a higher cause. It is this commitment that drives many of the regular small-language editors I spoke with. They all feared what would happen if garbage continued to appear on their pages.

Abdulkadir Abdulkadir, a 26-year-old agricultural planner who spoke with me over a crackling phone call from a busy roadside in northern Nigeria, said that he spends three hours every day fiddling with entries in his native Fulfulde, a language used mainly by pastoralists and farmers across the Sahel. ‚ÄúBut the work is too much,‚Äù he said. 

Abdulkadir sees an urgent need for the Fulfulde Wikipedia to work properly. He has been suggesting it as one of the few online resources for farmers in remote villages, potentially offering information on which seeds or crops might work best for their fields in a language they can understand. If you give them a machine-translated article, Abdulkadir told me, then it could ‚Äúeasily harm them,‚Äù as the information will probably not be translated correctly into Fulfulde. 

Google Translate, for instance, says the Fulfulde word for January means June, while ChatGPT says it's August or September. The programs also suggest the Fulfulde word for ‚Äúharvest‚Äù means ‚Äúfever‚Äù or ‚Äúwell-being,‚Äù among other possibilities.  

Abdulkadir said he had recently been forced to correct an article about cowpeas, a foundational cash crop across much of Africa, after discovering that it was largely illegible. 

If someone wants to create pages on the Fulfulde Wikipedia, Abdulkadir said, they should be translated manually. Otherwise, ‚Äúwhoever will read your articles will [not] be able to get even basic knowledge,‚Äù he tells these Wikipedians. Nevertheless, he estimates that some 60% of articles are still uncorrected machine translations. Abdulkadir told me that unless something important changes with how AI systems learn and are deployed, then the outlook for Fulfulde looks bleak. ‚ÄúIt is going to be terrible, honestly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTotally, completely no future.‚Äù 

Across the country from Abdulkadir, Lucy Iwuala contributes to Wikipedia in Igbo, a language spoken by several million people in southeastern Nigeria. ‚ÄúThe harm has already been done,‚Äù she told me, opening the two most recently created articles. Both had been automatically translated via Wikipedia's Content Translate and contained so many mistakes that she said it would have given her a headache to continue reading them. ‚ÄúThere are some terms that have not even been translated. They are still in English,‚Äù she pointed out. She recognized the username that had created the pages as a serial offender. ‚ÄúThis one even includes letters that are not used in the Igbo language,‚Äù she said. 

Iwuala began regularly contributing to Wikipedia three years ago out of concern that Igbo was being displaced by English. It is a worry that is common to many who are active on smaller Wikipedia editions. ‚ÄúThis is my culture. This is who I am,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúThat is the essence of it all: to ensure that you are not erased.‚Äù 

Iwuala, who now works as a professional translator between English and Igbo, said the users doing the most damage are inexperienced and see AI translations as a way to quickly increase the profile of the Igbo Wikipedia. She often finds herself having to explain at online edit-a-thons she organizes, or over email to various error-prone editors, that the results can be the exact opposite, pushing users away: ‚ÄúYou will be discouraged and you will no longer want to visit this place. You will just abandon it and go back to the English Wikipedia.‚Äù  

These fears are echoed by Noah Ha‚Äòalilio Solomon, an assistant professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawai‚Äòi. He reports that some 35% of words on some pages in the Hawaiian Wikipedia are incomprehensible. ‚ÄúIf this is the Hawaiian that is going to exist online, then it will do more harm than anything else,‚Äù he says. 

Hawaiian, which was teetering on the verge of extinction several decades ago, has been undergoing a recovery effort led by Indigenous activists and academics. Seeing such poor Hawaiian on such a widely used platform as Wikipedia is upsetting to Ha‚Äòalilio Solomon. 

‚ÄúIt is painful, because it reminds us of all the times that our culture and language has been appropriated,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe have been fighting tooth and nail in an uphill climb for language revitalization. There is nothing easy about that, and this can add extra impediments. People are going to think that this is an accurate representation of the Hawaiian language.‚Äù 

The consequences of all these Wikipedia errors can quickly become clear. AI translators that have undoubtedly ingested these pages in their training data are now assisting in the production, for instance, of error-strewn AI-generated books aimed at learners of languages as diverse as Inuktitut and Cree, Indigenous languages spoken in Canada, and Manx, a small Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Many of these have been popping up for sale on Amazon. ‚ÄúIt was just complete nonsense,‚Äù says Richard Compton, a linguist at the University of Quebec in Montreal, of a volume he reviewed that had purported to be an introductory phrasebook for Inuktitut. 

Rather than making minority languages more accessible, AI is now creating an ever expanding minefield for students and speakers of those languages to navigate. ‚ÄúIt is a slap in the face,‚Äù Compton says. He worries that younger generations in Canada, hoping to learn languages in communities that have fought uphill battles against discrimination to pass on their heritage, might turn to online tools such as ChatGPT or phrasebooks on Amazon and simply make matters worse. ‚ÄúIt is fraud,‚Äù he says.

According to UNESCO, a language is declared extinct every two weeks. But whether the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, has an obligation to the languages used on its platform is an open question. When I spoke to Runa Bhattacharjee, a senior director at the foundation, she said that it was up to the individual communities to make decisions about what content they wanted to exist on their Wikipedia. ‚ÄúUltimately, the responsibility really lies with the community to see that there is no vandalism or unwanted activity, whether through machine translation or other means,‚Äù she said. Usually, Bhattacharjee added, editions were considered for closure only if a specific complaint was raised about them. 

But if there is no active community, how can an edition be fixed or even have a complaint raised? 

Bhattacharjee explained that the Wikimedia Foundation sees its role in such cases as about maintaining the Wikipedia platform in case someone comes along to revive it: ‚ÄúIt is the space that we provide for them to grow and develop. That is where we are at.‚Äù   

Inari Saami, spoken in a single remote community in northern Finland, is a poster child for how people can take good advantage of Wikipedia. The language was headed toward extinction four decades ago; there were only four children who spoke it. Their parents created the Inari Saami Language Association in a last-ditch bid to keep it going. The efforts worked. There are now several hundred speakers, schools that use Inari Saami as a medium of instruction, and 6,400 Wikipedia articles in the language, each one copy-edited by a fluent speaker. 

This success highlights how Wikipedia can indeed provide small and determined communities with a unique vehicle to promote their languages' preservation. ‚ÄúWe don't care about quantity. We care about quality,‚Äù says Fabrizio Brecciaroli, a member of the Inari Saami Language Association. ‚ÄúWe are planning to use Wikipedia as a repository for the written language. We need to provide tools that can be used by the younger generations. It is important for them to be able to use Inari Saami digitally.‚Äù 

Spatial Speech Translation addresses one of automatic translation's biggest challenges: lots of people speaking at the same time.

This has been such a success that Wikipedia has been integrated into the curriculum at the Inari Saami‚Äìspeaking schools, Brecciaroli adds. He fields phone calls from teachers asking him to write up simple pages on topics from tornadoes to Saami folklore. Wikipedia has even offered a way to introduce words into Inari Saami. ‚ÄúWe have to make up new words all the time,‚Äù Brecciaroli says. ‚ÄúYoung people need them to speak about sports, politics, and video games. If they are unsure how to say something, they now check Wikipedia.‚Äù

Wikipedia is a monumental intellectual experiment. What's happening with Inari Saami suggests that with maximum care, it can work in smaller languages. ‚ÄúThe ultimate goal is to make sure that Inari Saami survives,‚Äù Brecciaroli says. ‚ÄúIt might be a good thing that there isn't a Google Translate in Inari Saami.‚Äù 

That may be true‚Äîthough large language models like ChatGPT can be made to translate phrases into languages that more traditional machine translation tools do not offer. Brecciaroli told me that ChatGPT isn't great in Inari Saami but that the quality varies significantly depending on what you ask it to do; if you ask it a question in the language, then the answer will be filled with words from Finnish and even words it invents. But if you ask it something in English, Finnish, or Italian and then ask it to reply in Inari Saami, it will perform better. 

In light of all this, creating as much high-quality content online as can possibly be written becomes a race against time. ‚ÄúChatGPT only needs a lot of words,‚Äù Brecciaroli says. ‚ÄúIf we keep putting good material in, then sooner or later, we will get something out. That is the hope.‚Äù This is an idea supported by multiple linguists I spoke with‚Äîthat it may be possible to end the ‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù cycle. (OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, did not respond to a request for comment.)

Still, the overall problem is likely to grow and grow, since many languages are not as lucky as Inari Saami‚Äîand their AI translators will most likely be trained on more and more AI slop. Wehr, unfortunately, seems far less optimistic about the future of his beloved Greenlandic. 

Since deleting much of the Greenlandic-language Wikipedia, he has spent years trying to recruit speakers to help him revive it. He has appeared in Greenlandic media and made social media appeals. But he hasn't gotten much of a response; he says it has been demoralizing. 

‚ÄúThere is nobody in Greenland who is interested in this, or who wants to contribute,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere is completely no point in it, and that is why it should be closed.‚Äù 

Late last year, he began a process requesting that the Wikipedia Language Committee shut down the Greenlandic-language edition. Months of bitter debate followed between dozens of Wikipedia bureaucrats; some seemed to be surprised that a superficially healthy-seeming edition could be gripped by so many problems. 

Then, earlier this month, Wehr's proposal was accepted: Greenlandic Wikipedia is set to be shuttered, and any articles that remain will be moved into the Wikipedia Incubator, where new language editions are tested and built. Among the reasons cited by the Language Committee is the use of AI tools, which have ‚Äúfrequently produced nonsense that could misrepresent the language.‚Äù   

Nevertheless, it may be too late‚Äîmistakes in Greenlandic already seem to have become embedded in machine translators. If you prompt either Google Translate or ChatGPT to do something as simple as count to 10 in proper Greenlandic, neither program can deliver.

Today we're launching a better reading experience for you. Gizmodo is now cleaner, faster, and will work much better on your phone. We've also improved our commenting system to allow you to more easily join the conversation with us and with each other.

Since Gizmodo's launch more than two decades ago, our editorial values have remained unchanged. We strive to hold power to account and to embrace curiosity about the underpinnings of the world we live in. Over the years, we've taken big swings at the major players in technology, run honest reviews of the devices in your pocket, and brought you the human impact of even the most technical advances in the science world.

And through io9, we've become a place where genre lovers can find unmatched, in-depth coverage of the shows, films, and characters they love. (And argue about them all in the comments.)

Now this redesign makes it easier for you to jump into the conversation. Stories are better framed for discovery, so you can more easily find the topics that matter to you. Commenting, sharing, and engaging are all smoother.

The Gizmodo and io9 comments have always been clever, boisterous, and sometimes brutal. We know that your engagement with our work makes Gizmodo more accountable and more interesting, and the new site's design choices reflect that.

That emphasis on community and accountability is crucial to our work.

It's a time of technological and political upheaval. New forms of digital power are reshaping how we live, work, and exist in our communities. Online misinformation was already spreading faster than research to debunk it was funded. Now, much of that essential scientific funding is itself under threat.

The stakes continue to rise for honest, rigorous, and independent coverage. And we're here to meet that challenge. The impact of technology is never neutral, and neither are we.

Thanks for joining us. And welcome to the new site.

There was a moment early on in Ghost of Yotei where I knew it'd won me over. As Atsu, I wasn't hunting down the Yotei Six who killed my family and left me for dead back in my youth; I was taking on a simple bounty who'd managed to get the better of me. I was all set to watch him plunge his katana in my back and restart the swordfight. Instead, a wolf jumped in out of nowhere, biting him and granting me full health so I could get back up and resume the fight and get my bounty. 

I wouldn't really see that wolf again until later on when I was led to one of its many dens around the land, but that last-minute save has come to define my experience with Sucker Punch's first outing exclusive to the PlayStation 5. Yotei brings over many of the same elements as its 2020 predecessor Ghost of Tsushima while channeling similar vibes that made the studio's Sly Cooper and Infamous franchises so appealing. Acclaimed as Tsushima was, it could feel like it was trying too hard to look like it was successfully mimicking the Japanese films that inspired it. But Yotei continually showed Sucker Punch's greater sense of confidence in itself to make its own spin on Japanese action stories rather than just emulating the movies that inspired it. 

That's most apparent in its combat, which retains Tsushima's core mechanics while carving its own distinct path. Stances are out, replaced with different weapons intended for specific enemies, like the dual katanas for spearmen and the odachi for massive brutes. The rock-paper-scissors dynamic against multiple enemies makes fights fun as Atsu's arsenal grows to include ranged weapons and quickfire tools, and disarming enemies (or being disarmed by them) can further change things up at a moment's notice. (Picking up fallen weapons to chuck at enemies? Never gets old.)

Atsu's most significant additions come via story or side missions that pair her with an expert in that particular armament. The melee weapons see her train with a local master who gives her a quick rundown of their base moves, followed by a chain of side quests that culminate in learning a new combat technique. While the masters don't play any real narrative role after the initial training, their individual stories and the additional context make acquiring these weapons feel special, and some of the introductory quests have neat gimmicks, like using one side of the controller to train Atsu's weak hand. And she can only learn new weapon skills at altars strewn around Ezo or at enemy strongholds that need clearing out.

While the combat remains strong, stealth still hasn't risen to the occasion. Sucker Punch tries to change things up by not giving Atsu the listening ability that lets her track enemies until well into the story. Until then, she can use her spyglass to observe the area and spot points of interest. In practice, the spyglass doesn't add anything substantial that can't already be gleaned when the game tells her to look at her surroundings, and it's effectively useless once her listen power eventually comes into play. It's still satisfying to clear an area without being spotted, but going quiet doesn't feel as strong as it could. The story scenarios around the stealth sections can be creative, but they themselves are not, and they don't endeavor to push you to employ new tactics as you would in other stealth-focused games.

Like Tsushima before it, Ghost of Yotei wants to draw the player into its digital recreation of 1603 Ezo. Using wind and animals to naturally guide players around still works on a navigation and immersive level, and the art direction is as striking as ever. As with Tsushima, Ezo has plenty of areas that exist to let the player take in the scenery and snap photos, and the screen adding black bars during horse rides further helps with the absorption. Where Tsushima was split across three zones in a video game-y way, Ezo feels more like a real place with less defined borders. The inns and communities Atsu travels to feel shaped by the presence of the Yotei Six or the samurai clan warring against their leader, Lord Saito, who in turn reacts to Atsu's actions throughout the story. 

Yotei doesn't offer a fully reactive world shaped by what Atsu does, but it properly meets Atsu's growing power. Whenever a member of the Six has fallen, her bounty increases and her wanted poster changes to make her look increasingly menacing, making it fun to overhear travelers and ronin discuss what she's done. I once fast traveled to an inn at the start of the game, where higher-ranking samurai were demanding to know where I was; another encounter with a similar group much later on led to my defeat, only to turn out to be a kidnapping I could escape from and kill my captors. Combined with the different tactics and weapons they deploy‚Äîspoiler, it turns out guns are their friends much more than yours‚Äîvictories over these growing escalations continually feel earned in missions or exploring Ezo.

Not everyone is hostile to Atsu's presence; wives of slain samurai will commend her for bringing the Six to justice and hub areas have gift altars with notes encouraging her to continue her revenge quest. A handful of times while doing a bamboo strike minigame, a crowd would excitedly gather around me as I sliced through poles, reacting to my successful or failed cuts. There are several bounties Atsu can take on to earn some extra money and even incorporate side activities like gambling dens and her shamisen in interesting ways.

These moments went a long way toward encouraging exploration and imbued the sequel with greater charm and personality, which many felt was lacking from Ghost of Tsushima. While it's still generally running the playbook of somberness as Tsushima, it has less of a stick up its ass and lets itself have some fun. Enough humor is doled out without undermining the tone and several missions carry a spark that's defined some of the studio's best work. 

Further helping Ghost of Yotei is its cast and Atsu in particular. She feels like a character more in tune with the developer's narrative strengths, and in turn, it leads to a compelling performance from Erika Ishii. Where Tsushima protagonist Jin Sakai came off too emotionally detached, Atsu is easier to connect with and gets plenty of moments to let her walls down as she crosses paths with several key allies in her journey. The ‚ÄúWolf Pack‚Äù tab that keeps track of these supporting players is more of a lore guide than a relationship tracker, but it further helps get into Atsu's headspace as the story progresses. 

Narratively, Ghost of Yotei contains few surprises, but it's balanced out by how well it's told and the performances of its cast. In the Yotei Six, Sucker Punch dips back into familiar villainous territory‚Äîthe original Sly Cooper was also a revenge quest, albeit a more kid-friendly one‚Äîand paints each member with some character to be more than one note. Most of them are a sad lot in some fashion, but none of them are ever let off the hook for that night at Atsu's home, and the gradual reveal of why they targeted her family and their relationships with one another all come together well. None of them also overstay their welcome, and Atsu is within their proximity long enough to make you understand why she and the rest of Ezo hold them in such contempt. 

Enough goodwill is built up throughout the story that it's a shame when it can't avoid slipping up. Yotei plays its thematic hand a bit too early, causing several beats in the back half to feel like they should go the opposite of how they normally play out in stories like these. That the game keeps such focus on Atsu's personal journey also inevitably leaves a plot thread involving an ally samurai clan feeling somewhat abandoned. At first, Yotei takes its time dulling the shine off the warrior class as a means of addressing criticisms toward Ghost of Tsushima for being overly fawning towards them. There's an undercurrent of class that persists throughout several story beats, giving Atsu's interactions with samurai and the common folk a distinct edge that Jin's story did not for most of its runtime.

While these moments of samurai slander are heavy-handed, they're not unwelcome, and they're eventually complicated by interesting narrative wrinkles. As such, it's all the stranger when this samurai thread doesn't get any closure en route to the finale, even when they're forced into Atsu's orbit as part of its ongoing escalation. Yotei is often enthusiastically in conversation with Tsushima, so this oversight feels like a punch pulled to avoid coming off as overly mean toward its predecessor, despite that first game laying the foundation for the sequel to even hit these criticisms at all, albeit unintentionally. 

That Ghost of Yotei can't entirely seal the deal narratively isn't the worst black mark against it, and where the story eventually goes lands so well this might not even matter for some. But for a game so strong in nearly every other area, it shows Sucker Punch still has areas to improve as it strives to create the perfect samurai and shinobi simulator. Not too much, though‚Äîthe studio is already on the right path, as made clear by my 40-hour playthrough with one of its strongest titles to date.

Ghost of Yotei releases October 2 on PlayStation 5.

Our first major look at Avatar: Fire & Ash a few months ago focused a lot on the kind of things James Cameron's sci-fi saga does very well: very pretty celebrations of the natural world of Pandora. Our latest look puts all that under threat, as enemies old and new rise up to not just give the Sully family a hard time but threaten to consume all of Pandora itself in a devastating new war.

The latest trailer for Fire & Ash dives much more into the story that we can expect from Cameron's third return to the world of Avatar (with plenty more still on the way over the next few years). We get a bit more about the background of the mysterious new fire tribe known as the Mangkwan clan and their leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), and why they've turned their back on wider Na'vi society in the wake of a cataclysmic inferno that ravaged their lands. That isolation and aggression, naturally, leads to them running into the arms of the devious Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who coaxes Varang into leading an all-out war on her fellow Na'vi.

But there's a lot more than just the inter-Na'vi conflict going on in this trailer, which once again sets the stage for a broader conflict between Pandora and Earth: namely that, after a close encounter with the Mangkwan, young human adoptee Spider (Jack Champion) suddenly becomes the first human to be able to exist on Pandora without having to use an oxygen mask. That very quickly becomes a problem if the other humans suddenly learn there's a way they can breathe in Pandora's atmosphere without having to use the Avatar system to take on Na'vi form‚Ä¶ and no doubt any fighting between the Na'vi themselves will dissipate very quickly when they realize who the real threat is going to be.

All that means, of course, there's going to be lots of action as the various conflicts break out, and there's lots of very fun visuals here, like Na'vi riding ginormous sea creatures to attack the human flotilla, or the Mangkwan's aerial assault. You can count on these films to look very pretty and have a ton of fun action in them, if nothing else!

Avatar: Fire & Ash hits theaters December 19.

The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged this week that Retail Ecommerce Ventures, the company that bought RadioShack out of bankruptcy in 2020, ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of $112 million.

REV was founded by Taino Lopez and Alexander Mehr and spent recent years buying up distressed retail ventures including Dress Barn, Franklin Mint, Linens ‚ÄòN Things, Modell's Sporting Goods, Pier 1 Imports, RadioShack, and Stein Mart.

Lopez and Mehr allegedly promised investors in their company annualized returns of 25%, along with equity and a monthly preferential dividend as high as 2.083%. They are also accused of assuring investors that funds raised would be for one specific portfolio company, and REV had never failed to pay a single investor. But that wasn't true, according to the SEC.

According to the court filing on Monday:

Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits. Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations. At least $5.9 million of the returns distributed to investors were, in reality, Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors.

The SEC alleges that about $16.1 million in investor funds were diverted for personal use by Lopez and Mehr. The 49-year-old Lopez and 46-year-old Mehr both lived in Puerto Rico, according to the court filing, though their company was registered in Delaware and their primary place of business was Miami, Florida.

The filing includes dollar amounts raised by REV in the name of each company:

Lopez appeared on CNBC in Aug. 2020 to talk about the acquisition of Modell's Sporting Goods. The focus was on the uncertainty of the pandemic, which had started earlier that year, and what that meant for brick-and-mortar stores. REV was focused on going online-only, but Lopez mentioned that there would be possibilities to open up physical stores in the future.

The SEC says REV raised more than $230 million from at least 660 investors nationwide. The federal agency alleges $112 million was acquired through fraudulent securities offerings in the eight REV retail brands. Most of the money raised was collected online through the company's website, as well as on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, according to the SEC.

The agency also outlines instances where it claims Lopez and Mehr made false statements to investors about the company's health. In one example from 2021 provided by the SEC, the company founders allegedly misrepresented how well everything was going.

Following the Zoom calls, Defendant Lopez and Mehr sent email updates to all existing investors recapping the calls. In one email recap Defendant Lopez sent to investors on February 18, 2021, he claimed that Dress Barn and Stein Mart were ‚Äúon fire‚Äù and ‚Äúcash flow is strong,‚Äù that ‚Äúthere are plenty of public companies operating at heavy losses‚Äù but that's ‚Äúnot us,‚Äù and that REV had ‚Äúbrands with a positive EBITDA.‚Äù

In reality, Dress Barn was not going strong, and the retailer experienced losses of nearly $13.7 million in 2020 and $10.7 million in 2021, according to the court filing.

Aside from Lopez and Mehr, REV's chief operating officer, Maya Rose Burkenroad, is also named as a defendant in the court filing on fraud charges for soliciting investment in the company.

Lopez, Mehr, and Burkenroad didn't respond to emailed questions on Wednesday. Lopez, who has quite a presence on YouTube as an influencer and gives advice on everything from investing to dating, posted a new video on Wednesday but didn't seem to address the SEC charges. Instead, the video just talks about the importance of self-education. It's possible the video was filmed before the allegations became public.

Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back.

Money seems to endlessly flow in the AI space, whether it's Nvidia announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI or OpenAI planning to build more massive data centers before the first $500 billion project is even completed. Eventually, some of the folks who have poured money into these ventures are going to expect to see some return on investment. According to a research note from Deutsche Bank, it's getting harder and harder to see how that is going to happen.

Fortune reports that a note written by George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank warned that spending in the AI sector is ‚Äúparabolic.‚Äù In fact, it is so vast, the researcher said, that it might single-handedly be propping up the American economy. ‚ÄúAI machines‚Äîin quite a literal sense‚Äîappear to be saving the U.S. economy right now,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn the absence of tech-related spending, the U.S. would be close to, or in, recession this year.‚Äù That checks out: earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported capital expenditure spending for AI contributed more to growth in the US economy than all consumer spending combined has so far this year.

If you want to narrow it down even further, you can. Saravelos pointed to chipmaker Nvidia specifically and says the company is ‚Äúcurrently carrying the weight of U.S. economic growth.‚Äù All that has to happen for the company to continue shouldering the entirety of the economy on its back is for its growth to be endlessly exponential. No problem, right? ‚ÄúThe bad news is that in order for the tech cycle to continue contributing to GDP growth, capital investment needs to remain parabolic. This is highly unlikely,‚Äù Saravelos warned.

Shoot.

Now, you don't really have to be an economist to know that it's usually a bad idea to have all your eggs in one basket. But just in case, here is one to tell us: Torsten Sl√∏k, the chief economist at asset management firm Apollo, wrote last week that ‚ÄúThe bottom line is once again that there is an extreme degree of concentration in the S&P 500, and equity investors are dramatically overexposed to AI.‚Äù

To put some numbers to it, here's some math from a recent report published by consulting company Bain & Company. The firm says that ‚ÄúAI's compute demand grows at more than twice the rate of Moore's Law,‚Äù and by 2030, the computing power needed to satisfy AI demand would come at a cost of two trillion dollars per year. ‚ÄúThe world is still $800 billion short to keep pace with demand,‚Äù Bain & Co writes. 

Pair that with the report that came out of MIT earlier this year, which found that just 5% of businesses that have adopted generative AI tools have managed to achieve ‚Äúrapid revenue acceleration,‚Äù while the rest have largely fallen flat, and it becomes a little hard to see the case for profitability being just around the corner. But hey, who knows, maybe we're just another small $500 billion investment away from making it all click. Any takers?

Doubling the RAM of the Raspberry Pi 500, now with added NVMe storage, the Raspberry Pi 500+ offers a great experience, but the upfront cost is hard to swallow.

Awesome thermal performance

Convenient form factor

Keyboard is great

Better power efficiency

Easy access to NVMe storage

Essentially $200 for a 16GB Raspberry Pi 5

RGB is beautiful but redundant

GPIO access is awkward

No camera or Touch Display connections

Raspberry Pi has been a bit quiet after a packed 2024, which saw multiple products and SKUs released on a weekly basis. The Raspberry Pi 500 was one of those products, and it received an Editor's Choice award despite the omission of a PCIe-based storage. Yes, there was space, and yes, the silkscreen had the layout for it, but it was never added to the 500. This led to other Pi community members and me theorizing that a future model would feature PCIe-based storage. It turns out that we were correct, and here we have the Raspberry Pi 500+.

Straight off the mark, the price is $200 (approximately ¬£180). The price of a low-spec laptop, essentially. For the price, we get the same System on Chip (SoC) as the Raspberry Pi 500 and Pi 5, but we also get 16GB of RAM and a 256GB NVMe SSD, not to mention a mechanical keyboard. If you want the Raspberry Pi 500+ as part of a getting started kit, then for $220 (¬£200) you can pick up the Raspberry Pi 500+ Desktop Kit which comes with a branded mouse, USB-C power supply, official HDMI cable and the Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide. For the review, I have just the Raspberry Pi 500+.

Is the Raspberry Pi 500+ worth $200, and does it warrant an upgrade over the original Pi 500? Let's find out!

The dominant aesthetic of the Raspberry Pi 500+ is the keyboard. It looks stunning, and the layout is similar to my daily driver, a Keychron K2. Under the keycaps, we have Gateron Blue KS-33 low-profile switches, and as a lover of clicky keys, they please me greatly. This is a keyboard that I could use as a daily driver. Perhaps Raspberry Pi will release the keyboard as a replacement for the official keyboard? Aside from the keyboard, the ports on the rear of the 500+ are identical to those on the 500.

The Pi 500+ and the 500 before it sport the same all-white color scheme, which is boring, but functional. It looks great on your desk, but I loved the Raspberry Pi 400's ""raspberry and white"" aesthetic.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ is larger than the Pi 500, both in length and height. The bottom part of the chassis is deeper, and the keyboard is longer. The height is most likely to accommodate space for the NVMe SSD, as the key switches are all located in the top section of the chassis. The length difference will be for the standard keycaps used. Yes, you can replace the keycaps if you wish. Using the included key puller, I pulled a few keys off to take a look underneath, then I threw some spare keys from my Keychron spares box on there to prove that they fit.

My pre-release unit has a quirk with the ENTER key, and Raspberry Pi assures me that this issue is not present in mass-produced units. Did I mention that the keys are RGB? Oh yes, a rainbow at your fingertips. Just press the FN and the light key to change the sequence. There are static colors (white and red), animated rainbow effects, reactive keys that shine blue or red, and an off option. The power button, a dedicated soft key introduced on the Raspberry Pi 5 and Pi 500 (the secondary function of F10 for the Pi 400), shines green when the Pi is on and red when in standby. To control the RGB LEDs, Raspberry Pi has released a config tool in the form of a Debian package, which handles all installation tasks for demos and the all-important udev rules.

The package is both a command-line tool and a Python module, which means that we can write our own code to control the LEDs. So I did, and made my usual ‚ÄúDisco‚Äù demo.

After a few bouts of trial and error, I managed my goal and I had something like a 1970s disco on my keyboard.

 




The keen-eyed amongst you will note that, because the Pi 500+ uses the same keyboard wedge design as its predecessors, there is no access to the CSI (Camera) / DSI (Display) connector. Looking at the PCB, there are no connections on the board. If you really need a camera, grab a USB webcam. For displays, there are two micro HDMI ports that support 4K60, so you are well catered to.

All of the previous Raspberry Pi 00 series machines have been easy to tear down, and the Pi 500+ is no exception. It has to be because we need access to the NVMe SSD. You may never upgrade the drive, but the 500+ introduces Phillips screws that secure the bottom chassis to the keyboard. The final retail kit that I received came with a spudger to leverage the plastic chassis apart. Starting at the opening just below the space bar, I slid the spudger around the seam and the clips popped open.

Initially, I could see two sections of the chassis. The bottom part contained the mainboard, which is covered by a large aluminum heatsink, with only a cutout for the NVMe SSD (note that my pre-release model has a smaller 2230 SSD than what will be included in the retail units). The other part is the custom keyboard plate, which is powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico's RP2 (RP2040) and not the newer RP2350. There is no need for the newer board, after all, the RP2040 is merely acting as a USB interface.

Also present on the mainboard is a battery connector for a real-time clock, which can be purchased separately.

 




On the left side of the mainboard is a large unpopulated area, the same as on the Pi 500. This would've been for a PoE circuit to power the Pi 500+ over an Ethernet connection, but, just like the Pi 500, it was likely cut as a trade off for cost/capability.

At a glance, the Raspberry Pi 500+ and 500 look identical; in fact, the silkscreen version numbers are the same. The only key differences on the Pi 500+ are the NVMe and moving the keyboard connector from a larger flat flex cable (FFC) to a smaller one. The RP2 is not next to the keyboard connector; instead, it is located on the keyboard PCB, which leads me to believe that RP2 performs keyboard and RGB light control.

The change from a larger to smaller FFC between these versions means that while the mainboard has the same cut-outs and screw holes, you couldn't transplant the Pi 500+ into a 500 chassis (and vice versa) without some FFC connector and RP2040 desoldering. Of course, the Internet will prove me wrong, and some enterprising maker will do this just for the heck of it. If so, hit me up!

 




Like its predecessors, the Pi 500+ has a huge aluminum heatsink to passively cool the ARM-powered SoC. This means we are almost guaranteed that the unit will run much cooler than the original Raspberry Pi 5. But we must still check. So I ran my usual test script, which records the resting temperature for one minute, then runs a stress test across all cores for five minutes before recording the resting temperature as the system calms down.

 




The Pi 500+ runs a little warmer than the Pi 500, especially at idle, where it is almost 4C warmer. Under stress, the 500+ is only 1.7C warmer than the 500. The temperature difference can be attributed to the NVMe SSD, which will generate a little more heat inside the case.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ uses a fraction less power than the Pi 500, which is interesting considering that it has an NVMe SSD inside. The reason for the lower power consumption is that the chip uses the D0 stepping, which removes ‚Äúall the non-Raspberry Pi specific logic from the chip,‚Äù according to Raspberry Pi co-founder Eben Upton, while leaving it functionally identical to the previous chip.

 




The removal of non-Pi logic sees a 33% reduction in die space and was achieved by removing Ethernet and USB logic; instead, these functions are handled by the RP1 ‚ÄúSouthbridge‚Äù instead. This is identical to the Raspberry Pi 5 2GB and 16GB models.

 




Yes, but I could only manage 2.95GHz. I say ‚Äúonly‚Äù because for the Pi 500, I managed 3GHz! This time, the overclock took a little more work, requiring me to tweak the voltage delta to give the CPU a little more juice. But I got there.

The overclock saw the Raspberry Pi 500+ idle at 38.9C, and then under stress, this went up to 67C. This was still way under the thermal throttle trigger point of 82C. Power consumption at idle was still 2.64 Watts, and under stress, this jumped to 9.65W.

In fact, my log showed 0x50000, which refers to under-voltage, and this was using the official Raspberry Pi 27W power supply. If you plan to overclock, grab the official 45W power supply or source a compatible GaN charger.

I tested using the included 256GB NVMe SSD, which, according to lshw, is a Samsung PM991a PCIe Gen 3 NVMe SSD. Performance was to be expected; we get extra performance when compared to the official Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT on a Raspberry Pi 5.

An additional 56MB/s when reading the contents of the SSD to /dev/null means that, in general use, we should see a slight performance improvement, but don't expect high-performance NVMe. The same is true for write speeds. We get an extra 54.95 MB/s of throughput when writing data to the drive, as per the Raspberry Pi diagnostics tool. Again, not super speedy, but for an SBC (Single Board Computer), we will take every extra we can get.

For all of you eager to know how fast the Raspberry Pi 500+ boots, well, the results are a little disappointing because booting from NVMe took 22.62 seconds, but a Raspberry Pi 500, booting from an A2/SDR104 compatible micro SD card, took just 16.36 seconds. Both Pis are running the latest firmware and bootloader. I also set the Pi 500+ to boot from NVMe first. But the Pi 500's micro SD card boot won this race!

The Pi 500+ also has a micro SD card slot, compatible with SDR104 and all previous classes of micro SD cards. In fact, it is the same unit as on the Raspberry Pi 500, but the key selling point of the Pi 500+ is NVMe storage. You could feasibly remove the NVMe SSD and replace it with an AI processing unit, booting the OS from micro SD instead. Obviously, without a dedicated camera interface, you will need to get creative and use a USB camera or video source, but it can be done.

So, how well does the micro SD card perform on the Raspberry Pi 500+? Well, it came last in my tests at 26.55 seconds, and the culprit is the new bootloader splash screen, which, despite being set to boot from micro SD, hung around far too long. In the grand scheme of things, 26 seconds is no time at all, but we have to test!

I also tested micro SD read and write using my usual tests. Reading the contents of the micro SD card to /dev/null using dd, and using the built-in Raspberry Pi diagnostics test for sequential write speeds. The results are close enough to call it even. So the earlier boot speed difference is clearly down to the bootloader screen.

 




The Pi 500+ has the same GPIO as has been standard on all models of Raspberry Pi since the B+ back in 2014. But for the 00 series units, the GPIO is horizontal, and that means to use a HAT, or for a clearer view of the GPIO, you will need a right-angled breakout board. There are boards such as Pimoroni's Flat HAT Hacker, which are cheap and easy to use. If you want to use the GPIO in a project, you will need a breakout. However, in truth, the 00 series of Raspberry Pi is not really for hardware hackers. If you want to build a project around a Pi, go for the ‚Äútypical‚Äù Raspberry Pi form factor found in the Pi 4 / 5.

I did a test with my own Flat HAT Hacker board, and I can confirm that you can use the GPIO quite easily for basic electronics. If you want to use a HAT, then it may or may not work, as with the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 5, there were changes to how the GPIO is accessed. Now it is accessed via the RP1 ‚ÄúSouthbridge‚Äù chip instead of the older means of directly accessing it via the CPU and some hacky (but ultimately working) code modules.

I then broke out a Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro, the same board that I used to teach robotics with at Picademy. This still doesn't work with the Raspberry Pi 5 series of boards, well, unless you go through multiple hoops and spend an afternoon trying to install it. This aspect of the Raspberry Pi experience still makes me sad, and I long for the days when I could just buy a HAT, drop it on my Pi, and start hacking.

 




The Raspberry Pi 500+ is basically the same as the Pi 500 but with more RAM and NVMe storage, which is great, but it comes at a cost. Who would use the Pi 500+? I can see it being a viable home PC for those that don't need an ultra-powerful PC, or as a child's first PC. In business, it could be a viable thin client. For educational purposes, it would make a suitable classroom PC.

I was eager to compare the price of a similar Raspberry Pi 5 16GB, the new M.2 compact HAT and the same 256GB NVMe SSD, so I went over to Adafruit and priced it all up.

Before shipping and taxes, the cost came to $229, and we still have a keyboard to purchase. Interestingly, a 256GB NVMe SSD is $20 more expensive than the 512GB version, so save $20, get double the storage and use that $20 to buy a keyboard!So what does this prove? Well, it shows that in both cases, going the official Raspberry Pi route will cost largely the same, but with the Pi 500+ we have it all contained in a gorgeous looking keyboard. What we lose in function (camera and display access, awkward GPIO) we gain in the form of a singular unit with a great keyboard. But, the Raspberry Pi 500+, like the 500 and 400 before it, is not a platform for electronics / robotics tinkerers. For those enthusiasts, you will need the original form factor Raspberry Pi.

For those of us that grew up during the home computer boom of the 1970s and 1980s, of which I am one, the form factor is nostalgic, and I can see some enthusiasts building their own home computer emulation systems using the Pi 500+, but, they could also do that with the $90 Raspberry Pi 500, or even the older Raspberry Pi 400. A few years ago, I managed to build a competent Commodore Amiga 1200 using my Raspberry Pi 400.

 




At $200, the Raspberry Pi 500+ is a considered purchase, which may lead some to consider buying a cheap laptop instead. You could argue that you get a computer and an electronics education platform in one package, but a cheap laptop or an Intel N100 / N150 mini PC and a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W will offer the same experience for a very similar price.

I really like the Pi 500+, the keyboard is great and it is the pinnacle of the Raspberry Pi 5 series, but the price is hard to swallow as the Raspberry Pi moves from being a cheap single board computer, into an Arm-based desktop computer.

Intel is in preliminary discussions with Apple regarding a potential investment, according to Bloomberg, which cites sources familiar with the matter. The two companies are also reportedly exploring ways to work more closely together, although it remains to be seen whether any potential deals can be reached, as negotiations are in the early stages and may not come to fruition.

The reported talks with Apple follow a string of recent deals, including major funding from Nvidia and SoftBank, and conversion of CHIPS Act funding from the U.S. government to equity. These moves are believed to be a part of the company's revival strategy that not only includes securing money, but also securing commitments to use the company's products and services going forward to justify developing Intel's next-generation 14A process technology and building production capacities that will support the node.

Apple used Intel's CPUs inside its PCs from 2005 to 2020, but it never used the company's low-power processors for its iPhones or iPads. Instead, it switched its Macs to Arm-based SoCs in 2020. Apple's current computers do not use any hardware from Intel, even though these systems use technologies originally developed by Intel or co-developed with Intel, including DisplayPort, NVMe, PCIe, Thunderbolt, and USB. Even Thunderbolt 5 controllers/retimers found in the latest MacBook Pro come from Apple, yet are certified by Intel. It is unknown how Apple and Intel could collaborate going forward, though the high-tech world is very convoluted.

Intel's timing to enter negotiations with Apple seems favourable as the high-tech giant has just received investments from Nvidia, SoftBank, and the U.S. government. Such high-profile backers reflect a growing belief in Intel's comeback, so it should be easier for the company to persuade Apple and other potential investors to buy Intel stock. Also, Apple has prioritized expanding its investments within the U.S., even though much of its supply chain remains abroad. In August, it pledged $600 billion toward domestic initiatives, an increase from a previous $500 billion commitment.

Obviously, a deal with Apple would further underscore confidence in Intel's direction, which would carry symbolic weight and bolster Intel's public image. However, if the rumored deal does not yield any agreement, this might harm Intel's position.

Sony took the wraps off its Pulse Elevate wireless speakers during its State of Play event a few hours ago. With this 2.0 speaker system, the firm says it will be introducing its ‚Äúfirst wireless speakers for desktop gaming.‚Äù Obviously, Sony has a long legacy of wired speakers for PCs, dating back to its VAIO multimedia PC days.

The new PC, Mac, and PS5-compatible Sony Pulse Elevate speakers use PlayStation Link wireless connectivity, which promises lossless audio with ultra-low latency. Other key features are the inclusion of a microphone with AI noise cancellation, an easy-access volume knob, and battery power for portability.

This launch will expand the Pulse audio family, which Sony already established with the Pulse Elite wireless headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds.

In terms of audio performance, a technology highlight of the Pulse Elevate speakers is the use of Planar magnetic speaker drivers. In each speaker, these are situated above woofers, which extend the bass response so you can ‚Äúfeel every impact‚Äù when gaming.

 




Tempest 3D AudioTech is supported on the PS5 platform, in compatible titles, for positioning audio. Both PS5 and PC have software controls that allow for adjustments of the speaker EQ, sidetone volume, and mic mute settings. It seems like Mac users will miss out on this extra configurability.

The speakers are easy to position and detach from their charging docks, upon which they sit on your desk. The PlayStation Link USB-C wireless dongle and associated software are also said to make it easy to switch input sources. That may be welcome if you have multiple systems sharing a desk space, for example.

We also note that the Pulse Elevate works with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player, if you are one of the ~2 million people who own one of these handhelds. The design offers ‚Äúsimultaneous Bluetooth and PlayStation Link connectivity.‚Äù And thanks to Bluetooth, you will also be able to pair them with your smartphone.

Sony says the speakers ‚Äúwill launch in 2026‚Äù and be available in black or white colors. The moderately distant launch date seems to have made it too early for a pricing reveal ‚Äì a very important factor in whether these will be popular. The PC market is particularly price sensitive, as we are spoiled for choice with many great audio products to choose from.

Check out our Best PC Speakers 2025 feature, covering budget and audiophile categories, and everything in between, for an overview of the state of the market. Will the Sony Pulse Elevate speakers be able to earn a place in our Best 2.0 Gaming category?

Buyers seemingly don't care for NPUs.

A new report claims that Intel is set to increase the price of its older Raptor Lake chips by as much as 10% in the face of the continued popularity of the lineup and customers shunning AI-equipped Lunar Lake models, according to Digitimes. While the report doesn't specify which models are set for an increase, it specifically highlights that chips launched in October 2022 (13th-gen chips), noting that prices will increase from $150-160 to $170-$180. This could encompass some popular i3 or i5 models, depending on the region and availability.

This increase will occur despite the company announcing that the integrated GPU drivers for these processors will be placed on legacy software support, effectively putting them on the back burner, despite some having launched as recently as 2023. Digitimes cites industry insiders who say ""lukewarm"" consumer response to AI PCs as a factor.

Intel's current crop of processors hasn't performed well in the market, with CEO Lip-Bu Tan commenting frankly that the chips aren't competitive in the market. That, coupled with customers seeking value options, has led many to opt for lower-cost previous-generation models instead.

The Raptor-Lake price jump aligns with the soaring costs of DDR4 memory chips, meaning PC makers will be hard-pressed to keep their prices low by opting to use the older memory in lieu of newer, faster DDR5, thereby squeezing the budget end of the PC building market. According to the report, some brands are even experiencing supply shortages, especially as the volatility of chip pricing is making them reluctant to place long-term orders. Due to this, PC and component prices may increase slightly as we approach the end of 2025.

Windows 10's end-of-life this coming October might result in some corporate sales, especially for companies unwilling to pay for extended support. However, this is less of a concern for consumers, meaning it's unlikely that retail sales will increase as a result. The upcoming holiday season may drive some sales figures, especially if companies release great deals.

We've pinged Intel for comment and will update as neccesary.

Marijke Vroomen Durning

 September 25, 2025  

The Canadian Minister of Health recently announced an investment of almost $17 million to improve healthcare access for Francophones in Western Canada. The funds will go to increasing the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students in various healthcare fields (eg, medicine, nursing, social work, speech therapy, and personal support) at five postsecondary training institutions.

Approximately 188,392 Francophones live in Western Canada (ie, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia). This population represents about 2.3% of Canadians whose first language is French. While French is one of the two official languages in Canada, Francophones outside Qu√©bec, specifically in Western Canada, often have difficulty accessing healthcare professionals who can communicate effectively in their language.

According to a survey published in 2016 by the Soci√©t√© Sant√© en fran√ßais, Ottawa, and Universit√© de Saint-Boniface, Winnipeg, 74.5% of Francophones in Western Canada said that the lack of bilingual providers was a barrier to obtaining healthcare; 59% didn't know which services were available in French.

Where healthcare in French is accessible, patients need to know how to go about finding it, which can be hard, particularly for newcomers to Canada, Sabrina Lee, MD, an ob/gyn at H√¥pital de Gatineau in Gatineau, Qu√©bec, told Medscape Medical News. There isn't a formal process for Francophones to access care in French, she explained. ‚ÄúPatients would get whoever was on duty when accessing emergency services.‚Äù Lee practiced in Manitoba (mostly in Winnipeg) for 8 years and recently completed a fellowship in Vancouver.

‚ÄúGetting care in French is almost impossible,‚Äù Nour Enayeh, executive director of R√©soSant√©, a provincial nonprofit health network in British Columbia, told Medscape Medical News. R√©soSant√© now has an online directory to help patients find professionals who can speak French. ‚ÄúBut even with that guide, it doesn't mean that everyone has that access. It doesn't mean that the person who answers the phone can speak French, for example, or will be able to direct them to someone who speaks French. So, the access is very limited,‚Äù she explained.

Patients don't need to speak only French to want or need healthcare in their first language. In times of stress or emergency, it's often safer for a patient to communicate in their mother tongue to ensure that everything is understood on both sides. As they age, become frail, or develop dementia, patients may forget their second language and only retain the ability to communicate in their first language.

Many Francophones who move west understand that it might be difficult to get healthcare in French, Karl-St√©phane Coyault, coordinator for Francophone Services and Special Initiatives for the Provincial Health Services Authority in British Columbia, told Medscape Medical News. But these patients don't see it as an immediate concern and believe that they have time to find a physician. After a while, however, they stop looking for Francophone physicians because they can't find any.

‚ÄúWhen they arrive, they do not realize what impact that [not finding a doctor] would have on them, that the main impact is the prevention. They tend to let things go,‚Äù said Coyault. ‚ÄúThey realize it when it's too late. Then they have a pathology that is much more difficult to handle because it wasn't taken care of earlier.‚Äù This situation burdens the system overall, Coyault added.

Solutions to the lack of Francophone healthcare providers in majority Anglophone provinces have been proposed and, in some cases, enacted. Many Canadian children in western provinces attend French immersion schools and graduate with proficiency or fluency in French, said Coyault. But these students stop using the language if they have nowhere to practice. Consequently, they may become shy when opportunities to speak French arise. Encouraging people to use their French skills should be easy, said Coyault.

This is one of the objectives of the Caf√©s de Paris program, which was launched in collaboration with R√©soSant√©, he explained. The program provides informal settings in which healthcare providers can speak French, practicing in a low-stress environment so they can be more confident speaking it at work. ‚ÄúIt is a successful program,‚Äù Coyault said. ‚ÄúHere in British Columbia, it has a waiting list of 200 people. We don't advertise at all.‚Äù

Advertising for Francophone professionals is not necessarily a straightforward approach. If a province were to advertise for physicians from Qu√©bec, then the latter province would lose them. ‚ÄúWe don't want to take away,‚Äù Enayeh said. ‚ÄúWe just want to find the ones who want to leave anyway. We know that there are many professionals who go to the United States. Those are the ones that I want to find. Instead of leaving Qu√©bec to go to the US, I want them to come to British Columbia.‚Äù

Pan-Canadian licensing, which would allow physicians to practice in other provinces, could help alleviate issues for patients outside Qu√©bec, New Brunswick, and Ontario, which have larger Francophone populations. Telemedicine services, while not possible for all medical problems, could be helpful for many. A Francophone in British Columbia could use a telemedicine service from another province to manage simple health issues or follow-ups. For example, a service could provide a Francophone professional to explain what a patient can expect at an upcoming in-person visit with a doctor who doesn't speak their language.

Some physicians argue that provincial licensing bodies need to make licensing more accessible to immigrants. Getting accredited to practice in Canada can take years regardless of education and experience. ‚ÄúThis is the field where we should spend the most energy because there is no point in attracting those doctors if we're not able to do anything for them,‚Äù said Coyault.

Overall, $17 million represents less than 0.2% of Health Canada's annual planned spending of $9.3 billion. But it means that the government is listening, Coyault said. ‚ÄúIt creates a positive dynamic.‚Äù

Lee, Enayeh, and Coyault reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A 1-L increase in alcohol consumption per capita was associated with a 3.59% rise in suicide mortality rates, with no sex-specific differences observed.

‚ÄúThis agreement with individual-level findings suggests that alcohol consumption per capita, a proxy measure of consumption, could be a useful metric to consider within national suicide prevention strategies,‚Äù the authors wrote.

The study was led by Katherine Guo, BMSc, Institute for Mental Health Policy Research, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on September 22, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

Most studies did not account for confounding factors, which may have affected the observed associations. High heterogeneity was observed, and data on sex-specific alcohol consumption per capita were not utilized, limiting the interpretation of sex-specific results.

No funding or relevant conflicts of interest were declared by the authors.

John Mascarenhas, MD, describes how the SOHO 2025 MPN session highlighted the four approved JAK inhibitors ‚Äî ruxolitinib, momelotinib, pacritinib, and fedratinib ‚Äî allowing for personalized treatment of myelofibrosis. He notes that ruxolitinib remains the mainstay in first-line therapy, while fedratinib is notable for its efficacy in spleen volume reduction, especially in the second-line setting. Momelotinib is beneficial for those with significant anemia, and pacritinib is used for patients with marked thrombocytopenia due to its dosing flexibility. 

Experimental advances focus on combination therapies and novel agents such as navtemadlin, selinexor, pelabresib, and a new type II JAK inhibitor (AJ1-11095) and JAK2 V617F selective inhibitor (INCB160058), which may provide deeper and more durable responses in the future. Additionally, the development of targeted therapies such as the mutant CALR antibody INCA033989 holds promise for transforming care for patients with CALR‚Äëmutant myelofibrosis.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) plus routine care was linked to a 19% improvement in treatment effectiveness and significantly improved neurologic recovery, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life compared with routine postoperative care alone in patients who underwent intracranial aneurysm surgery, a new meta-analysis showed.

‚ÄúThese findings provide a strong rationale for integrating HBOT into perioperative care protocols, although further high-quality studies are needed to confirm and extend these results,‚Äù the investigators wrote.

This study was led by Yue Gao, Civil Aviation General Hospital, Beijing, China. It was published online on September 11 in Frontiers in Neurology.

The included trials were conducted exclusively in China, with some having small sample sizes and most reporting only short-term outcomes, limiting generalizability. Variation in assessments tools may have introduced reporting variability, and insufficient reporting on allocation concealment and blinding raised concerns of selection and performance bias. Additionally, the long-term safety and effectiveness of HBOT remained unestablished.

The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management ‚Äî these are well-established factors that promote weight control. But emerging evidence suggests that sleep also plays a powerful role in obesity and related conditions, which is one reason the American Heart Association added sleep to its list of ‚Äúlife's essentials,‚Äù and most recently published a scientific statement on sleep health and its implications for cardiometabolic health.

Getting insufficient sleep, in particular, has been associated with obesity in epidemiological studies for more than two decades. The connection was highlighted in an article several years ago that noted, ‚ÄúThe detrimental effects of inadequate sleep on health and public safety drive an explosion of sleep research.‚Äù That research has confirmed the relationship between inadequate sleep and obesity, as well as a range of related disorders including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.

In addition, a recent cross-sectional study found a sleep duration of less than 7‚Äâhours increased the overweight and obesity rate nearly twofold compared with sleeping 7-9‚Äâhours, while a recent randomized controlled trial found that insufficient sleep predicted poor weight-loss maintenance with liraglutide.

‚ÄúI strongly believe that getting enough sleep could help tackle our society's obesity epidemic,‚Äù Esra Tasali, MD, director, UChicago Sleep Center, Chicago, told Medscape Medical News. ‚ÄúRemarkably more than one third of US adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis, which strongly increases their risk for chronic conditions,‚Äù including obesity.

A strong link exists between sleep and obesity, and it seems to be a bidirectional association, Christopher E. Kline, PhD, coordinator, Exercise Physiology PhD program and faculty member of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Science at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, told Medscape Medical News. ‚ÄúPoor sleep predisposes one to obesity and weight gain, while obesity promotes poor sleep.‚Äù

Poor sleep may cause obesity via several pathways, he explained. ‚ÄúPoor sleep could lead to altered substrate utilization ‚Äî for instance, it's well documented that poor sleep reduces insulin sensitivity.‚Äù

Appetite regulation is another possible pathway. ‚ÄúThere's some evidence (though not as compelling as initially thought) that poor sleep causes increases in ghrelin and decreases in leptin, two potent appetite-regulating hormones,‚Äù he said.

In addition, people with overweight/obesity and poor sleep often have a reduced inability to resist calorie-dense foods ‚Äî findings showed in both feeding and brain imaging studies. For example, a study by Kline and colleagues showed that poor sleep leads to lower adherence to lifestyle modifications during attempted weight loss ‚Äî specifically, lower adherence to caloric intake goals and physical activity.

Less physical activity means more sedentary behavior, ‚Äúwhich results in reduced energy expenditure and, if caloric intake stays the same, altered energy balance,‚Äù Kline said.

Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea can also sabotage weight-loss efforts, he added. His group found that in the context of a 12-month behavioral weight-loss intervention focusing on dietary modification and physical activity, adults with sleep apnea lost less weight than those who didn't have sleep apnea.

‚ÄúCurtailed sleep also significantly slows resting metabolic rate and increases risk of sarcopenic obesity,‚Äù noted Janelle Wilder Coughlin, PhD, director of the Obesity Behavioral Medicine Program and associate director of the Center for Behavior and Health at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.

‚ÄúFurthermore,‚Äù she told Medscape Medical News, ‚Äústudies conducted in experimental laboratories found that sleep restriction results in increased hunger, calorie consumption, snacking, and loss of control eating in comparison to individuals with normal sleep.‚Äù

Right now, there is little evidence to show that improving sleep will boost weight loss, according to Kline. For example, studies that treat patients with sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure have not shown better weight loss.

Nevertheless, emerging evidence suggests that some interventions might be helpful. For example, Tasali led a single-center randomized controlled study on the effect of sleep extension on energy intake among adults with overweight. Participants were randomly assigned to an individualized sleep hygiene counseling session that aimed to extend their bedtime to about 8.5 hours or to continuation of habitual sleep pattern. They did not change their diet or physical activity regimen.

The intervention increased sleep duration by approximately 1.2 hours per night, and the sleep-extension group had a significant decrease (-270 calories) in energy intake and weight reduction compared with the control group, with no effect on energy expenditure.

More recent research suggests that additional dimensions of sleep ‚Äî beyond insufficient time ‚Äî can interfere with weight loss, Kline said. In an analysis of data from adults participating in a year-long behavioral weight-loss intervention, ‚Äúwe documented that individuals with poor ‚Äòsleep health' ‚Äî eg, those with significant variability in their sleep, poor satisfaction, late timing, and/or low efficiency ‚Äî lost less weight.‚Äù

Coughlin added, ‚ÄúSeveral studies have shown that poor baseline sleep predicts a less favorable response to weight-loss treatment, including less fat mass loss and less weight-loss maintenance. While randomized trials are limited,‚Äù she told Medscape Medical News, ‚Äúthese data suggest that addressing patients' sleep disturbances before or during a weight-loss attempt may be important.‚Äù

While research continues to emerge, clinicians can take steps now to help their patients sleep better, the experts agreed. ‚ÄúThe general ‚Äòsleep hygiene' tips are a great start,‚Äù Kline said. ‚ÄúThis includes keeping a consistent sleep schedule, keeping the bedroom dark and cool, having a wind-down routine in the evening leading to bed, prioritizing light exposure during the day (especially upon awakening) and minimizing light exposure in the hours leading to bedtime, and exercising and being active during the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than anything, though, individuals need to prioritize getting sufficient sleep on a nightly basis and should not rely on daytime naps or sleeping in on the weekend,‚Äù he cautioned. ‚ÄúWhile those can help minimize sleep loss, it's ideal to get sufficient sleep on a consistent basis.‚Äù

Tasali noted that blue light exposure from electronic devices can reduce the hormone melatonin, which helps to initiate and maintain sleep, so electronics use should be limited close to bedtime. This means avoiding excessive use of social media, phone scrolling, texting, gaming, and binge-watching shows on television.

In contrast, a good sleep routine ‚Äî including a warm bath, reading, or listening to soft music ‚Äî can be helpful, she said.

While getting up in the middle of the night to eat should be discouraged, ‚ÄúWaking up hungry may drive early-day overeating, often with high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, reinforcing metabolic dysfunction and weight gain,‚Äù said Peter Goulden, MD, chief, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Diseases, at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West in New York City. ‚ÄúIt may also reflect poor sleep quality, which is independently associated with cardiometabolic risk.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook for signs of nocturnal eating or nighttime hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes,‚Äù he told Medscape Medical News. ‚ÄúAlso, assess for mood or stress-related eating patterns, which often manifest during the night or early morning hours.‚Äù

Tasali pointed out that despite the growing interest in the positive effects of weight-loss medications, ‚Äúthere is still a lot of uncertainty about their long-term biological effects and how they will ultimately change people's eating habits and lifestyle behaviors. We also know that when you stop these drugs, you rapidly regain weight.‚Äù

In light of this, she said, ‚Äúclinicians should consider ‚Äòadequate sleep' as a third pillar of healthy lifestyle behavior alongside diet and exercise for healthy weight maintenance and prevention of weight gain. Healthier sleep can help people eat healthier food ‚Äî among many other benefits to overall health and well-being ‚Äî and therefore help reduce weight gain and other cardio-metabolic conditions.‚Äù

Kline added, ‚ÄúIt's important to ask patients about their sleep ‚Äî especially if the clinician wants the patient to alter their lifestyle habits. For some individuals, poor sleep could be an important factor that gets in the way of attempted behavior modification!‚Äù

Kline, Coughlin, Tasali, and Goulden reported no conflicts of interest.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) uses Data Analysis and Real-World Interrogation Network (DARWIN EU), a data network that became fully operational in 2024, to generate real-world evidence on medicines and vaccines.

The system provides regulators with access to health data across Europe to assess the use, safety, and effectiveness of these products.

DARWIN EU links health databases from multiple European countries and delivers real-world evidence from across Europe on diseases, populations, and the uses and performance of medicines. This has enabled the EMA and national regulators to make evidence-based decisions regarding the development and use of medicines. 

Launched by the EMA and the European Medicines Regulatory Network, this initiative provides timely and reliable real-world evidence on medicines for human use, including vaccines, across the EU.

Since its award in 2022 to the Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the DARWIN EU project has made substantial progress. Governance structures and operational processes are now in place, and pilot studies have been completed to provide evidence for EMA's scientific committees.

Currently, the DARWIN EU Coordination Centre serves the EMA and national competent authorities in the member states, managing study requests on behalf of these organisations. 

With the expansion of the network, DARWIN EU will also be able to conduct studies for other European agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, health technology assessment bodies, and funding bodies.

Studies are classified by complexity ‚Äî ready to use, complex, very complex, and routine ‚Äî and are published in the EU electronic register of Post-Authorisation Studies.

According to the DARWIN EU, by 2025, data from 181,128,000 patients across Europe will contribute to approximately 100 studies per year involving approximately 40 partners. Working with the EMA and its Scientific Technical Committee, the coordination centre continues to expand the network by adding new partners and data sources while integrating advanced infrastructure and techniques.

Beyond its regulatory role, DARWIN EU contributes to the development of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) and the joint initiative Towards the European Health Data Space which aims to establish common principles for the secondary use of health data.

As a flagship project within the EHDS, DARWIN EU enables the secure exchange of health data to strengthen healthcare, guide policymaking, and advance research across Europe while fully complying with data protection requirements.

A lack of willing participants has forced a delay in the release of an important national population health survey expected to shed new light on food allergies.

The 2025-2026 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) will be extended to include data from 2027, according to a CDC spokesperson, who said the results would be published in 2028.

‚ÄúWe are currently planning the extra year, pending Ethics Review Board and Office of Management and Budget approval, to assure that we have enough participants to make nationally representative estimates,‚Äù Paul Prince, CDC spokesman, told Medscape Medical News. ‚ÄúThe reasons for nonparticipation are likely multifactorial, and we cannot be certain that it is any single factor.‚Äù

Prince added that the CDC hopes to ‚Äúreach the same amount of data in 3 years that we previously collected in a 2-year cycle.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds like things are a little off-track,‚Äù Corinne Keet, MD, PhD, professor of pediatrics at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Medscape Medical News in an interview. ‚ÄúNormally it just goes from one cycle to the next, every 2 years, without a pause.‚Äù

Keet, who is an allergy and immunology specialist, said that the NHANES, because it is a thorough, nationally representative survey, is an important tool not just for understanding health behaviors but also for tracking health trends. On average, Keet said, there are 10,000 respondents to the survey, half of them children.

‚ÄúIt's one of the things used for making public health policy,‚Äù she said, adding that she and her colleagues have also used the data in their research into food allergies.

To that end, Prince confirmed that the current NHANES cycle is focused on improving understanding of allergies overall.

‚ÄúFor this current cycle, three NIH Institutes collaborated with the National Center for Health Statistics to include respiratory health and allergy content including questions, allergy testing, and lung function testing. Allergy questions and testing were last included in the 2005-2006 cycle and lung function in the 2007-2012 cycles,‚Äù Prince noted.

Clinical data such as blood draws and spirometry, when combined with self-reported food intake data, should help to clarify associations between self-reported allergy and respiratory health conditions, allergic sensitivity, and lung function, according to Prince.

This cycle will also include data on the alpha-gal syndrome, ie, allergy to animal products such as meat and dairy that begins with a tick bite, according to Prince. Other food allergy assays, he said, will be used for the nine foods already identified by public health officials as allergens: milk, eggs, tree nuts, soybeans, wheat, peanuts, sesame, fish, and shellfish.

‚ÄúI'm glad to hear it's still happening,‚Äù Keet said. ‚ÄúNHANES is an amazing amount of work because of the level of data collection,‚Äù Keet said. ‚ÄúThe questionnaire is super long, they do all these biosamples, [and] they do all these exams. It's really a lot of dedication from the people who are doing the sample collections and then those who are analyzing everything.‚Äù

Keet disclosed holding a noncommercial patent for a sublingual form of immunotherapy and receiving grant, research, and clinical trial support from Genentech, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. She has received an honorarium from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.

A new study involving the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) provides strong evidence that sugary drinks affect not only metabolic but also mental health ‚Äì especially in women. This effect is probably mediated by the sensitive microbiome of the intestine.

As is well known, people who regularly consume sugary drinks not only have an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an increasing number of studies that are now showing that soft drinks can also affect mental health. So far, however, it was unclear whether there is a direct relation to major depressive disorder (MDD) and which biological processes might be involved. 

To answer these questions, researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Marburg-M√ºnster Affective Cohort (MACS). The study examined adults between the ages of 18 and 65 who were recruited from the general population and primary care between 2014 and 2018. The researchers included a total of 932 people, 405 of whom were patients with major depression disorder and 527 were healthy controls. 

The analyses showed a correlation between soft drink consumption and both the diagnosis of depression and the severity of the symptoms. This correlation was particularly pronounced in women: Among them, high consumption was associated with a 17% higher probability of depression (odds ratio 1.167) and more severe symptoms. 

But how could the effect be conveyed? Here, too, the study provides a possible explanation: In women who regularly drank sugary soft drinks, the researchers found a significantly increased number of bacteria of the Eggerthella genus in the intestine. Earlier studies had shown that Eggerthella is more common in people with depression. The current study now provides the first convincing evidence that this bacterium possibly plays a mediating role ‚Äì as a biological link between the consumption of soft drinks and the development of depressive symptoms. 

""Our data suggests that the relation between soft drinks and depressive symptoms arises via the influence of the microbiome,"" says study leader Dr. Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah from the University Hospital Frankfurt and the MPI for Metabolism Research Cologne, an associated partner of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD).

Sugary drinks such as cola or lemonade not only contain glucose and fructose, but also numerous additives ‚Äì including preservatives and artificial sweeteners. This combination can disturb the delicate balance in the intestinal microbiome. Inflammation-promoting bacteria are favored, while the production of protective short-chain fatty acids decreases. Animal studies show that such changes can trigger inflammatory processes in the nervous system and thus increase depressive behavior. 

It is striking that this correlation appears to be sex-related. In men who regularly consumed soft drinks, the researchers found neither an increase in Eggerthella nor a correlation with depressive symptoms. It is still unclear why this effect only occurs in women. Hormonal differences or sex-related reactions of the immune system possibly play a role. 

""The study results open up new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders,"" comments DZD researcher Rachel Lippert from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbr√ºcke (DIfE). ""Microbiome-based approaches ‚Äì such as targeted nutritional therapies or probiotic strategies ‚Äì might help to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in the future."" 

The researchers therefore argue that the influence of nutrition on mental health should be more strongly integrated into educational campaigns, care concepts and prevention programs. 

Changes in the microbiome can be influenced by diet ‚Äì and are therefore a potential therapeutic target."" 

Dr. Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah, University Hospital Frankfurt 

""Even small adjustments in consumer behavior might have a big impact ‚Äì especially when considering the widespread consumption of soft drinks.""

A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on September 15, 2025, titled ""When strokes reveal a hidden malignancy: An atypical case of metastatic colorectal cancer with extensive thromboembolism.""

In this case report, Md Tanzim Ahsan from Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh (WWL) Teaching Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust and Sultana Azreen from Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, describe how a series of unexplained strokes led to the diagnosis of advanced colorectal cancer. The report shows that hidden cancers can sometimes first present through blood clots and strokes, well before any typical cancer symptoms appear. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating cancer as a possible cause of unexplained embolic events, particularly in the absence of traditional stroke risk factors. 

""Although symptoms raised initial suspicion for vasculitis or autoimmune etiologies due to limb swelling and headache, he did not report associated visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, or neurological deficits.""

The patient, a 71-year-old man, was admitted to the hospital with swelling in his left arm, headache, and non-specific neurological symptoms. Over the following weeks, he suffered multiple strokes affecting different areas of the brain, as well as blood clots in his veins, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Clinicians initially suspected autoimmune conditions or infection. However, imaging and blood exams revealed signs of cancer. A biopsy of an enlarged lymph node confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer that had silently spread throughout the body.

The patient had no typical symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as weight loss, digestive issues, or changes in appetite. Because of this, the cancer remained undetected until widespread blood clot complications appeared. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the care team transitioned the patient to palliative care, as the disease was too advanced for curative treatment.

This case illustrates a serious but often underrecognized condition known as Trousseau's syndrome, or cancer-associated stroke. It occurs when cancer causes abnormal blood clotting, leading to clots throughout the body. Unlike strokes caused by heart conditions, cancer-related strokes often involve multiple brain regions and lack clear cardiac causes. Elevated blood clotting markers, such as D-dimer, can serve as potential indicators of hidden malignancy in such patients.

The findings underscore the growing awareness that cancer may present in subtle, non-specific ways, sometimes through neurological or vascular symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to maintain a high level of suspicion when evaluating patients with unexplained strokes, especially when imaging reveals multiple infarcts or embolic patterns without an identifiable source.

The authors call for the development of clearer clinical guidelines to help healthcare providers recognize and screen for underlying cancers in stroke patients without obvious risk factors. As cancer rates continue to rise worldwide, early recognition of indirect warning signs, such as abnormal clotting, may allow earlier detection and improve patient outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Medical imaging radiation linked to small cancer risk in children","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250925/Medical-imaging-radiation-linked-to-small-cancer-risk-in-children.aspx","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:37:00 GMT","

A recent study links exposure to radiation from medical imaging to a small-but-significant risk of blood cancers among children and adolescents. 

But do not panic. The study concludes the benefits of medical imaging outweigh the minimal risks. 

Funded by the National Cancer Institute, the study will help medical personnel make informed decisions about using imaging on children. The study concluded that while ionizing radiation is a carcinogen, the benefit-to-risk ratio favors CT imaging of children when imaging is justified and the technique minimizes adverse effects. 

The paper, ""Medical Imaging and Pediatric and Adolescent Hematologic Cancer Risk,"" was published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. For his part of the study, Bolch used virtual patient anatomic models to reconstruct bone marrow doses in more than 3.7 million children who underwent CT imaging between 1996 to 2016. 

""We used a library of 3D anatomic whole-body computerized patient models developed in the early 2010s under a contract with the National Cancer Institute,"" said Wesley Bolch, Ph.D., a distinguished professor in biomedical and radiological engineering with the University of Florida's J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering. 

In Bolch's Advanced Laboratory for Radiation Dosimetry Studies, researchers developed hundreds of models representative of U.S. adults and children across all combinations of ages, heights and weights. 

""We call this an organ dose reconstruction,"" said Bolch, who is also a member of the UF Health Cancer Center. 

The study is unique because it directly measures leukemia risks in these pediatric patients. Previously, researchers used established cancer-risk models, many of which were based on data from the atomic bomb survivors in 1945 Japan. Needless to say, Bolch noted, diagnostic X-ray exposures are vastly different from atomic weapon radiation fields. 

This is the very first study of its kind in the U.S. and Canada, and the very first study of cancer risks in children undergoing medical imaging where each patient was considered in a unique manner regarding their sex, body size and medical imaging exposure technique factors.""

Wesley Bolch, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor, Biomedical and Radiological Engineering, University of Florida 

While CT imaging contributes a greater fraction of total radiation, doses from nuclear medicine, radiography and fluoroscopy were also included for bone marrow-dose calculations. 

""Dr. Bolch's role in this landmark study highlights UF BME's leadership in making medical imaging safer for children. It demonstrates UF's dedication to research that safeguards patients and informs global healthcare practices,"" said BME chair Cherie Stabler, Ph.D. 

In the study, the highest CT doses to bone marrow were seen in head-and-neck imaging, where the average dose was 30.8 milligray (a unit measuring ionizing radiation deposited in tissue). CT imaging of the head ‚Äì one of the more common pediatric CT scans ‚Äì showed an average dose of 13.7 milligray. 

The incidence of hematologic cancers by age 21 years was 0.3% among those children exposed to bone marrow doses more than 30 milligray. However, fewer than 1% of the 3.7 million children in this study had cumulative doses exceeding 30 milligray. 

Plus, CT imaging doses today are much lower, and imaging systems are much faster than in the late-1990s and early-2000s. 

This research comes 25 years after a Columbia University research paper made the link between leukemia and some radiology scans, thus scaring ""every mother in this country,"" Bolch said. 

The key issue in that study showed imaging technologists and radiologists were not making adjustments to X-ray techniques that explicitly considered the size of the patient. 

""Consider that you've just imaged an obese a male with a high-intensity and high energy X-ray beam, and now a petite 7-year-old girl becomes the next patient to be imaged. In the late 1990s, very few clinics would adjust the X-ray energies and intensities from the previous adult patient. In this case, the girl received a much larger amount of imaging than was really needed to form a diagnostic-quality image,"" Bolch said. ""This paper scared a lot of people, but it really was a great service because it says, 'Oh, we're doing this wrong.'"" 

Starting in the early 2000s, physicians adjusted the energy and intensities of the X-ray beam based on the size of the patient. CT system manufacturers, Bolch said, also made technological improvements to lower patient CT doses. 

The paper's lead authors are radiologist and epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman, M.D., from the University of California, San Francisco, and biostatistician Diana Miglioretti, Ph.D., from UC, Davis. 

""Their work involved collecting and organizing the medical records that showed what imaging exams were performed on the children, when they occurred, how they were acquired and what modality was used ‚Äì CT, radiography, nuclear medicine or fluoroscopy,"" Bolch said. 

They also led the team that linked these patients to cancer registries that indicated which patients later developed bone marrow cancers. 

""This is where my laboratory came in,"" Bolch said. ""We ran computer simulations of these imaging procedures to provide estimates of bone marrow radiation doses for each child, for each form of medical imaging and for each imaging examination. 

""Everybody went into action to figure out what is the appropriate lowest dose of radiation that would give us a good image. These risks are low, and when justified by the imaging physician, patient benefits, such as disease detection, will greatly outweigh these very small risks.""

Scientists reveal that shifting mealtimes, without any workouts, can help reshape the body as early eaters lost more weight, but late eaters boost their anerobic power.

Study: Time-Restricted Eating Without Exercise Enhances Anaerobic Power and Reduces Body Weight: A Randomized Crossover Trial in Untrained Adults. Image credit: DenisProduction.com/Shutterstock.com

Time-restricted eating (TRE) and physical exercise could enhance physical performance. A recent study in Nutrients examined the impact of TRE on endurance parameters and body weight in healthy adults without any specific exercise intervention. This is the first time a human study has directly compared delayed and early TRE in an untrained healthy group without formal exercise interventions.

TRE refers to a pattern of eating in which the day's food is consumed within a specific window. TRE, by itself, often reduces caloric intake by around 20%. Animal experiments suggest that TRE improves certain aspects of physical performance even without exercise, but human evidence remains limited and mixed.

Physical performance and metabolic fitness are typically assessed using aerobic endurance and anerobic power. These predict the general health status and the future risk of cardiometabolic disease. Anerobic power is also linked to higher odds of physical function and independence with aging.

Besides exercise strategies like aerobic or resistance exercise, or high-intensity interval training, dietary approaches like TRE also play a key role in building physical capacity. Research from both preclinical and clinical studies points to three main underlying mechanisms.

First, TRE induces regular, prolonged fasting periods, causing a metabolic shift. This forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to fatty acids and ketones, promoting metabolic flexibility. In addition, TRE has been associated with increased mitochondrial production in animal studies. Mitochondria supply more energy by breaking down fats into fatty acids and ketones. The aim is to optimize energy efficiency.

Secondly, TRE favors a synchronized biological rhythm across the body systems, since food intake is now confined to the same period across the 24-hour day. This leads to a faster response to insulin secreted after food intake. Insulin stimulates glucose removal from the blood, mainly into muscle and liver cells. Better circadian synchronization also reduces inflammation, improves skeletal muscle efficiency, and promotes cardiometabolic health, especially by avoiding late-night eating. 

Autophagy is the third pathway activated by TRE. Cell repair is prioritized instead of cell growth. This leads to removing damaged organelles, including mitochondria, and replacing them with new ones. Animal studies show this occurring in skeletal muscle (which has a high metabolic rate) in response to fasting. The outcome is improved mitochondrial quality and greater antioxidant capacity. However, the authors caution that much of this mechanistic evidence comes from animal studies, with only indirect support in humans.

TRE in overweight or obese people results in decreased body weight, improved blood cholesterol levels, and higher insulin sensitivity. However, the benefits of TRE in highly trained individuals could be modest, as they already have high metabolic fitness. It might be more helpful for untrained individuals without added exercise because they have low fitness levels. The current study used two TRE timings to understand how this affects metabolic outcomes.

The study included 28 healthy university students, on average, aged 23.4 years. Just over half were women. The participants were randomized to early vs. delayed TRE (eTRE and dTRE, respectively) for four weeks, after which there was a two-week interval. The groups were then switched for another four weeks.

The eTRE timing was between 08:00‚Äì09:00 for the first meal and 14:00‚Äì15:00 for the last meal, vs 12:00‚Äì13:00 to 18:00‚Äì19:00 for dTRE. No formal exercise routine was allowed during the study period. After each TRE phase, the body weight, aerobic endurance, and anerobic power were assessed.

Aerobic endurance refers to how long the body can sustain oxygen-fueled physical activity, typically tested by a constant-load cycling test. Anerobic peak power is the maximum force produced without oxygen in a burst of high-intensity effort, sustained for only a few seconds. It is typically tested by sprint cycling, which also allows peak power output to be measured.

The mean body weight decreased by approximately 1.6 kg after the eTRE, vs 0.61 kg in the dTRE group. Body weight decreased after both TRE phases, but by 0.95 kg more with eTRE than dTRE.

This corroborates prior research showing that early eating windows are more effective than later ones. This may be due to TRE-associated decreased calorie intake due to an absence of dinner, typically a more calorie-packed meal than breakfast. Additionally, an earlier eating window is better synchronized with the circadian rhythms of digestion and insulin sensitivity. This could reduce fat mass and lower glucose levels. However, the current study did not directly measure changes in body composition, so whether fat or lean mass contributed to the weight loss is unknown.

Aerobic endurance remained unchanged with either form of TRE, despite decreased calorie intake, and without the benefit of prior exercise training. This may reflect a more efficient utilization of energy substrates under restricted eating conditions, but with constant physical demands. This metabolic flexibility favors aerobic fitness, irrespective of the eating window.

Anerobic power increased by 21.25 W vs 35.4 W with eTRE and dTRE, respectively. Power output also increased more after dTRE than eTRE. This may be because the dTRE window correlates better with the body's neuromuscular performance rhythm, where high-intensity muscular work is best done in the afternoon or early evening.

Such gains were not previously visible in trained athletes, perhaps because they are already at the top of their form physiologically. Conversely, other research demonstrates TRE-associated metabolic adaptations that help the body regain energy after short bursts of explosive activity by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency.

The study findings demonstrate that eTRE and dTRE are associated with weight loss and increased anerobic power, while aerobic endurance was preserved rather than improved. Weight loss was greater with eTRE vs dTRE, but the opposite was true of anerobic performance gains.

Future studies should examine whether these translate into clinical gains that are sustained over the long term and are suitable for all kinds of groups.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities have successfully 3D printed lifelike human tissue structures that can be used for medical training for surgeons and doctors.

The study was recently published in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

Previous methods have made stiff, simple tissues, but this new technique can mimic the complex, directional strength and stretchiness found in real tissues like skin or other organs.

In this paper, the researchers discovered a method to control the shape and size of the tiny patterns inside the 3D-printed material, thereby imparting specific mechanical properties. Along with this, they made a mathematical formula to predict how the tissue would behave. 

To make the simulated tissues more realistic, they also developed a way to incorporate blood-like liquids in a single step. This is done by printing small microcapsules that contain the liquid, preventing it from drying out or interfering with the printing process. 

""This approach opens the door to creating more realistic training models for surgery, which could ultimately improve medical outcomes,"" said Adarsh Somayaji, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering.

While challenges remain in scaling up the process, we see strong potential for this 3D printing method in low-volume, high-complexity training scenarios.""

A preliminary study, included in the paper, found that surgeons rated the new 3D-printed tissue replicas higher for tactile feedback and response to cutting compared to previous, conventional models. The team hopes that this innovation will help to improve surgical training.

The researchers will now focus on expanding the new technology to create a variety of shapes for mimicking other organs, developing bionic organs, and incorporating more advanced materials that respond to common surgical tools like electrocautery‚Äìa surgical technique that uses a heat tool to remove small growths.

In addition to Somayaji, the University of Minnesota team included Matthew Lawler from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Zachary Fuenning and Michael McAlpine from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. This paper was a collaboration with the CREST Lab and Wang Lab at the University of Washington.

A population-based study in Northern Sweden challenges assumptions about pollution and cellular aging, uncovering an unexpected signal of longer telomeres in patients with dementia that warrants further research.

Associations between air pollution and subsequent risk of dementia are growing clinical concerns, but remain understudied. The biological underpinnings of these associations are especially unclear. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers explored one hypothesized pathway involving telomeres (that shorten with age) by analyzing data from 473 older adults from Northern Sweden who had complete information on air pollution exposure, telomere length, and covariates.

Study findings did not reveal an overall association between exposure to air pollution and telomere length. However, study analyses highlight a slight, statistically nonsignificant trend suggesting that individuals who later developed dementia had longer telomeres, despite higher exposure to pollution, a counterintuitive finding that warrants further investigation.

Telomeres are segments of DNA at the ends of our chromosomes that protect the underlying genetic material from degradation, external damage, and fusion. With each cell division, these telomeres naturally shorten, making telomeres a well-established hallmark of biological aging.

Recent research suggests that environmental factors (particularly pollutants) can accelerate this shortening process. Air pollution, a well-studied driver of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, is hypothesized as a prime suspect. Evidence is mixed on whether long-term air-pollution exposure shortens telomeres, with some studies reporting no association or even longer telomeres.

Simultaneously, decades of research have now conclusively linked telomere length (shorter is worse) to a variety of age-related chronic diseases, including dementia. Dementia is an umbrella term for several neurological conditions characterized by significant cognitive decline and memory loss, substantially hampering patients' daily lives.

In today's rapidly aging society, identifying the mechanistic underpinnings of risk factors (such as air pollution) linked to age-associated chronic disease (like dementia) prevalence and risk could help delay symptom progression in the more than 57 million patients living with the condition, and the millions more likely to develop dementia in the near future. Unfortunately, mechanistic evidence for the association between air pollution and dementia remains limited, as previous studies have failed to explicitly test the relationship between these variables.

The present study leveraged data from the Betula project, a long-running, population-based cohort focused on aging and dementia in Northern Sweden. Researchers collated two different time waves (T1 and T2 out of the seven total waves of the Betula study) collected in five-year intervals between 1988 and 1995.

Data collections at each wave comprised health-related questionnaires, cognitive evaluations, and medical examinations (including blood collections). Notably, air-quality data for the locations of study participants were also available.

Blood samples were used for relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) measurements via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Air pollution exposure was assessed using a high-resolution dispersion model to estimate the annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ) and black carbon (BC) at each participant's home address in 1990, including source-specific estimates for vehicle exhaust and residential wood burning.

Analysis further included linear regression models to investigate the association between these pollution levels and telomere length, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, lymphocyte proportion, and education. Subgroup analysis tested whether the relationship differed in the 74 participants who were later diagnosed with dementia.

Linear regression analyses failed to demonstrate any significant associations between air pollution exposure (either PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ or BC) and shorter telomeres. For total PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure, the beta coefficient (Œ≤, measure of relative leukocyte telomere length) was recorded at 0.01 (95% CI: -0.011, 0.024), indicating a negligible effect. Total BC was similarly negligible at 0.03 (95% CI: ‚àí0.046, 0.114).

However, subgroup analyses revealed a more complex, unexpected, and currently unexplained trend: a slight positive association between pollution exposure and telomere length.

While not statistically significant, these findings mean that among future dementia patients, those exposed to higher levels of air pollution tended to have longer, not shorter, telomeres. For example, this subgroup's beta coefficient for total PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ exposure was 0.03 (p-value = 0.12), and for total BC, it was 0.11 (p-value = 0.17). Effect-modification interaction terms were not significant.

This study, conducted in a low-pollution region of Northern Sweden, failed to validate the prevailing hypothesis that links air pollution to shorter telomere length (accelerated cellular aging) and, in turn, higher dementia risk. Instead, an unexpected and counterintuitive trend was observed in the dementia subgroup: higher air pollution exposure was linked to longer telomeres in participants who later developed dementia. These exploratory signals were imprecise and not statistically significant, necessitating further research to explain this observation.

A study from the Medical University of South Carolina, published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, reveals that shorter storage durations of donor human milk are linked to reduced gastrointestinal complicatoins in premature infants, including necrotizing enterocolitis. These findings suggestt that minimizing milk storage time may help to preserve protective properties crucial for preterm gut health, offering new insights into neonatal nutrition practices and improving outcomes for vulnerable newborns.

Odds are that when you go to the supermarket, you check each product you pick up for its ""best by"" date, ensuring that you have the freshest, healthiest food to bring home for you and your family. An MUSC study published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition has found that those little best by dates for a particularly precious resource ‚Äì donor human milk ‚Äì have huge implications for the gastrointestinal health of very premature infants.

""Our results showed that babies weren't as protected with the use of donor milk that was stored for a longer time as with donor milk that was stored for shorter periods of time,"" said physician-scientist Katherine E. Chetta, M.D., who led the study. Chetta's research program is focused on the science of breast milk, nutrition and intestinal rehabilitation.

Donor human milk is a vital substance, given to almost all preterm babies, especially if their own mother's milk is unavailable, in short supply or otherwise unsafe. It can also reduce complications associated with formula, while supporting immune function, digestion and infants with specific medical conditions, such as low blood sugar, congenital heart disease and immunologic deficiencies.

Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of using donor milk is to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, as it's often referred to in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), where most pre-term babies are cared for. NEC is a very serious inflammatory disease that affects mostly preemies and can lead to bowel tissue dying. It requires medication and often surgery and can lead to lifelong complications.

Although doctors and scientists have not yet identified the sole cause of NEC, they do have some ideas about several factors that, together, can cause injury to the premature gut, allowing bacteria in and creating inflammation.

As a neonatologist at the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital, Chetta has long dealt with the devastating effects of NEC in her patients. ""It's one of those key benchmark diseases that all NICUs are constantly trying to decrease,"" she said.

As a physician-scientist, Chetta collaborates closely with the nutrition management center or ""milk room,"" where the donor milk is stored. Based on previous studies and detailed analysis of the milk, Chetta and her team knew that longer storage times mean a breakdown in the action and efficacy of specific milk components. Chetta wondered whether aging milk is less protective against the development of NEC than fresher milk.

To determine the answer, she reviewed the medical records of 262 very-low-birth-weight, less than 3.3 pounds, infants who were provided donor milk in the NICU at the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital between February 2022 and January 2024. Of those premature babies, 226 remained free of disease while 36 developed NEC or another gut disease called spontaneous perforation, which also causes tremendous damage to intestinal tissue. The South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute, a Clinical and Translational Science Awards hub with an academic home at MUSC, provided statistical support for the .

Chetta's findings revealed that every additional day of storage increased the risk of NEC in very-low-birth-weight preemies by 3.7%. The sweet spot for frozen milk storage was approximately 240 days for the tiniest infants. Laboratory results showed that, over time, certain milk components degrade even while in frozen storage.

When preemies are on the edge of viability, and extremely low birth weight, that's when they seem to be the most susceptible to the effects of storage and can be most protected by having fresher milk. In short, for preemies: ""Fresh milk is the best.""

Katherine E. Chetta, M.D., physician-scientist 

Currently, the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both advise that frozen milk can be stored safely for up to a year for all babies. Based on this study, Chetta and her team believe that these guidelines need to be reevaluated, especially regarding critically ill babies. Still, this laboratory finding has already influenced clinical practice in Chetta's NICU.

""We're so convinced that we need a little bit fresher that we're already doing it just to be on the safer side,"" said Chetta, of feeding high-risk, premature infants the freshest milk possible based on the study results. ""That's how much we believe in it.""

The practical application of this finding doesn't mean discarding or wasting milk that is considered not quite as fresh but, rather, using fresh milk more quickly and optimizing freezing and storage procedures so that the sickest and youngest babies can have the freshest milk. To achieve these goals, Chetta worked closely with the Mother's Milk Bank of South Carolina and others involved in the handling of human milk.

Based on her experience, she can offer some simple, easy-to-follow advice: ""Other NICUs could talk to their own milk banks about bringing this milk in a little bit quicker from donor depot sites, as we did."" Chetta said it really is as simple as that. ""We didn't have to change much. We were just refocused on trying to get it under that threshold of 240 days.""

While this is still very new information, Chetta and her team have high hopes for its impact in the not-so-distant future. ""I think improving outcomes can be expanded very rapidly once people start verifying some of the findings we have,"" she said. ""From a policy standpoint, it could be a quick change. I hope the use of fresher milk will make a difference in the lives of the youngest babies. I think it will.""

Every new life begins after a genetic shuffle. When organisms make eggs or sperm, maternal and paternal chromosomes pair up and swap pieces of DNA in a process called crossing over. This exchange is essential: without at least one swap per chromosome pair, fertility and healthy chromosome numbers are at risk. At the same time, too many swaps‚Äîor too many DNA breaks that initiate them‚Äîcan harm the genome. How do cells make sure the balance is just right? A team of researchers around Joao Matos of the Max Perutz Labs publishes the answers in Nature.

The team discovered that tiny DNA structures called Holliday junctions are not just stepping-stones on the way to crossovers, as scientists long believed. Instead, they also help stabilize a zipper-like structure known as the synaptonemal complex, which holds paired chromosomes together. This stability, in turn, tells the cell to stop making further DNA breaks, protecting the genome from damage.

Our hypothesis was that Holliday junctions are more than passive DNA links. They are essential for building and maintaining the synaptonemal complex, ensuring that chromosomes stay paired until crossovers are ready to form.""

To test this idea, first author Adrian Henggeler turned to baker's yeast, a simple organism that scientists often use as a stand-in for human cells because it goes through meiosis in a similar way. He was able to ""freeze"" millions of yeast cells at the exact moment when the DNA junctions and the chromosome zipper were present, but before the swaps had taken place. By then cutting the DNA junctions using a unique molecular tool developed in the lab, he could see right away what happened next.

""One of our eureka moments was seeing the synaptonemal complex collapse in real time the instant the junctions were removed,"" says Adrian. ""It was exactly what we had hypothesized, suddenly unfolding in front of our eyes."" Without Holliday junctions, the chromosome zipper fell apart, new DNA breaks re-started forming, and meiosis could no longer proceed correctly.

""This study uncovers a simple but elegant feedback loop,"" says Joao. ""Once crossovers and the chromosome zipper are stabilized, the cell 'knows' it can stop making breaks and move forward safely with meiosis.""

The next challenge is to find out whether the same principle holds true in mammals. If it does, it could shed light on fundamental mechanisms that safeguard fertility and maintain genome stability across species.

A new study from Finland shows that low labor market participation for non-retirement related reasons may be an early indicator of dementia already years before the first evident symptoms occur. The study also identified other social markers that may be indicative of dementia up to ten years before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia or vascular dementia.

Employing extensive nationwide registers, researchers at the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Oulu analyzed data on more than 2,200 patients as part the DEGE-RWD project coordinated by Neurocenter Finland. The patients were compared to controls of the same age, sex and area of residence.

We found that low labor market participation without the presence of a clear medical reason may be the first sign of dementia. Taking these social markers into consideration may enable an earlier diagnosis.""

Ave Kivisild, Doctoral Researcher, University of Eastern Finland

The study highlights the role of social markers of dementia. For example, long-term unemployment or living alone may be early markers of onsetting dementia.

""We know that pathological processes in the brain start decades before the first symptoms. However, these new findings suggest that the early disease biology may cause changes in, e.g., employment, which may be indicative of dementia related brain changes long before any objectively discernible cognitive symptoms occur. Taking these markers into consideration may help to improve the timing of screening and prevention measures,"" says Principal Investigator, Associate Professor Eino Solje of the University of Eastern Finland.

The strengths of the study include the scope and robustness of the data used. Patients were diagnosed by expert neurologists working in memory clinics at university hospitals, which renders the results highly reliable.

The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. The study constitutes part of an extensive project combing extensive real-world evidence from patients with various register-based data. The project involves unique collaboration between the University of Oulu and the University of Eastern Finland, bringing together a variety of disciplines and, for example, medical scientists and scholars of law.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Will Tessmann leapfrog McKennie, Musah to start for USMNT at 2026 World Cup?","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46366779/will-lyon-tanner-tessmann-leapfrog-weston-mckennie-yunus-musah-start-world-cup","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 14:08:40 GMT","

Shaka Hislop and Steve Nicol praise Christian Pulisic after he became the top USMNT scorer in Europe's top five leagues. (2:47)

The European club season has been in full swing for over a month now, giving those U.S. men's national team players plying their trade overseas the chance to establish themselves. Some have gotten off to uneven starts, with the opening round of UEFA Champions League fixtures proving to be especially difficult. Others have hit the ground running. Those in MLS have been in rhythm for a while now.

Then there's Christian Pulisic, who has been leading the U.S. charge in Europe for nine years now and already has five goals in all competitions this season. Fortunately for the USMNT, Pulisic is one of several players who have been hitting their stride in recent weeks.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's countdown to the World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

Only 260 days to go.

Tessmann had already enjoyed a solid start to the season, but last weekend he kicked his campaign into overdrive, scoring the lone goal in Lyon's 1-0 victory over Angers, a result that put the club in a tie atop the Ligue 1 table, behind AS Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain on goal differential. Not bad for a team that was threatened with relegation due to financial irregularities before the start of the season.

As for Tessmann, the question remains: Will these performances be enough to get him back in the U.S. squad? He hasn't been called up since the Concacaf Nations League in March. To be clear, they should be, but the mind of U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino works in mysterious ways. At minimum, Tessmann should be in contention to provide cover for Tyler Adams, or even crack the starting lineup.

2025-26 minutes: 264
2025-26 FotMob rating: 7.1

Credit Tillman for showing a strong mentality, bouncing back from a dreadful match in midweek against F.C. K√∏benhavn in the Champions League to deliver a man of the match performance against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in which he scored his second league goal of the season. A tactical tweak from manager Kasper Hjulmand might have helped.

Against Copenhagen, Tillman was operating as one of the dual No. 10s and struggled mightily to get on the ball. Against Gladbach, he was deployed deeper in midfield and had a much stronger impact on the game, even beyond his 70th-minute goal. Hjulmand afterward continued to preach patience, as Tillman is one of many new arrivals to the squad, but the player's ability to shake off a poor performance will serve him well for both club and country.

2025-26 minutes: 286
2025-26 FotMob rating: 7.9

This was an impressive week for Pulisic, even by his lofty standards. After scoring two goals and helping set the table for a third in last weekend's 3-0 win over Udinese, Pulisic maintained his fine form by scoring the final goal -- on the half-volley, no less -- in a 3-0 Coppa Italia win over Lecce.

There's not much more to be said about Pulisic that hasn't been already. He remains the USMNT's most important attacking player, and he now holds the mark for most goals by an American in Europe's top five leagues with 59. As long as he can stay healthy, he's a lock to be in the U.S. lineup.

He'll try to keep the momentum going in this weekend's momentous clash with top-of-the table Napoli.

When Pochettino switched to a three-man back line during the September international window, it was a move that didn't appear to benefit Gladbach's Joe Scally. The wing back position favors the mobility and attacking instincts demonstrated by the likes of Sergi√±o Dest and Alex Freeman over the defending of Scally, but then Gladbach interim manager Eugen Polanski trotted out a 3-4-3 with Scally as the right wing back, and the American delivered an impressive performance.

Scally showed an ability to get forward that was unexpected given that he recorded no goals and no assists this past season -- his xG of 0.26 is already on its way to eclipsing last year's 0.38. Granted, who knows what formation the permanent Gladbach coach will prefer once he's hired, but the performance should help keep Scally in the lineup.

Given his performance last weekend, why isn't he in this week's in-form XI? It's a fair question, especially when you consider Dest conceded a penalty that was converted in PSV Eindhoven's 2-2 draw with Ajax. Combined with some defensively shaky moments during the September international window, it's worth weighing whether Dest is enough of a defensive liability that he loses his spot in the starting lineup. That said, Dest's value in attack is still high enough given his ability to deliver the unexpected, though Scally has given Pochettino something to think about in terms of who his starting wing backs should be.

Meanwhile, the relative stock of the U.S. corps of forwards continues to go through some wild swings in form. Folarin Balogun looked to have gained some separation from the chasing pack after a great performance against Japan, but that was before his tepid effort in a 4-1 Champions League defeat to Club Brugge landed him on the bench for last week's league encounter against Metz. Even worse for Balogun, his replacement, Mika Biereth, scored the opener in a 5-2 win, while Ansu Fati scored two off the bench and George Ilenikhena also got on the score sheet.

The silver lining for Balogun is that no other U.S. center forwards scored last weekend, although Ricardo Pepi's selfless run to the near post allowed Ismael Saibari to score PSV's first, so he'll remain the starter in this week's lineup. Also, Balogun's skill set is unique within the USMNT player pool, given his ability to make runs in behind the opposition defense, and this should mean his spot in the U.S. squad is still secure. He'll need to work his way back into the Monaco lineup, though, and this week's match at Lorient will reveal the extent to which his spot in the club hierarchy has fallen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The USMNT's World Cup record: Which confederations give them the most success?","https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/soccer-playbook-2025/40461/the-usmnts-world-cup-record-which-confederations-give-them-the-most-success","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:20:31 GMT","

We break down the USMNT's record by confederation to see which region gives them the most success‚Ä¶and trouble.

The United States Men's National Team has had a complicated history at the World Cup. From appearing in the very first World Cup in 1930 to their 40 year drought to the modern era, they have had some ups and downs when playing in the world's biggest tournament.

A lot of a team's success at a World Cup can hinge on how they fare against the teams in their group. Whether you're in a so-called Group of Death or you're placed in a group that an opponent's fans consider to be ‚ÄúEASY,‚Äù the USMNT has had to claw and scrap in just about every World Cup they've been in. And, against the best teams in the world, their record hasn't been great.

But, when you break down the USMNT's World Cup record by confederation, we get a further glimpse at which teams they may hit a bit above their batting average and where they fall flat. We take a look at the USMNT's record by confederation at the World Cup compared to how they've done all-time against teams from that region.

UEFA - 3W-14L-7D, 16 group stage points (27% win rate)

Starting with UEFA makes sense because at a World Cup, it's normally guaranteed that you have at least 1 team from Europe in your group. With 16 teams at the 2026 World Cup, UEFA will have 8 groups with 1 team and 4 groups with 2 teams. For the USMNT, it feels almost certain that they will be in a group that contains 2 teams from UEFA. The only times the USMNT were in a group that did not have 2 UEFA teams at a World Cup were 1930 - only Belgium was in their group - and 1934, which did not have a group stage and only had a bracket. The USMNT lost to Italy in the first round of that tournament. In 1950, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2022, the United States was placed with 2 other UEFA teams. In 1990, the USMNT - returning to the World Cup for the first time in 40 years, was placed in a group with 3 UEFA teams.

It's no wonder that they have played 24 of their 37 World Cup matches against European teams, and their record against Europe explains why there hasn't been a ton of World Cup success for the United States. Their 27% win rate far underperforms their all-time record against Europe (58W-100L-44D - 39.6% win rate) and that is what needs to improve quickly for the team to become a major force down the line.

Oceania - 0W-0L-0D (‚Äî)

The USMNT doesn't play Oceania often. They're 2W-0L-2D (75% win rate) against New Zealand, the only current Oceania member that they've played in soccer. Of course, Australia was a part of Oceania until 2006, and they were 0W-1L-1D against them before they joined the Asian Football Confederation. The United States has never played an Oceania team at a World Cup.

Concacaf - 1W-0L-0D (100% win percentage)

Of course, Concacaf is the home confederation for the USMNT where all-time they hold a 231W-97L-83D record (66.3% win rate). However, they've only faced a Concacaf opponent once in their World Cup history, and we all know which match that was: Dos A Cero in Jeonju. The USMNT's 2-0 win over Mexico in the 2002 World Cup Round of 16 remains to date the lone time they have faced a Concacaf opponent, and it's easily the biggest win in the history of one of the fiercest rivalries in the world.

AFC - 1W-1L-1D, 4 group stage points (50%)

The USMNT hasn't faced that many Asian teams at the World Cup. The United States have only faced two Asian teams in the World Cup, all in the group stage: Iran (1998, 2022) and South Korea (2002). The USMNT lost against Iran in 1998 and exacted revenge in 2022, while they drew South Korea in 2002. Their 50% win rate in the World Cup against Asian teams is just slightly off their all-time 57.9% win rate (21W-14L-9D). With the AFC getting 8 direct spots in the World Cup, plus a potential 9th through the inter-confederation playoff, the USMNT should prepare to see one at some point during the World Cup.

CAF - 2W-2L-0D, 6 group stage points (50%)

Like Asia, the United States have only seen 2 African teams in a World Cup: Ghana (2006 group stage, 2010 Round of 16, 2014 group stage) and Algeria (2010 group stage). Between 2006 and 2022, the USMNT only faced African or European teams at the World Cup in 13 straight matches, including 3 straight against African teams. Their 50% win rate and 6 group stage points earned against Ghana and Algeria is slightly off their 65% all-time win rate against African teams (12W-6L-2D). The CAF will have 9 teams directly slotted into the World Cup, with a possible 10th team entering via the inter-confederation playoff.

CONMEBOL - 2W-3L-0D, 6 group stage points (40%)

The USMNT have had their issues all-time against South American teams, with a 30W-59L-30D record (37.8% win rate) in their matches against CONMEBOL. However, this is the confederation that the USMNT has performed slightly better than their batting average when it's in the World Cup. The United States have a 40% win rate against South American teams in just 5 matches, beating Paraguay at the 1930 World Cup and famously beating Colombia at the 1994 World Cup. The United States will want to improve their record against South American teams, especially the traditional powers like Brazil and Argentina, but their win rate shows that they might have a decent shot when lining up against a team from South America in the World Cup.

Overall, the United States Men's National Team will have to improve their World Cup record: 9W-20L-8D (35.1% win rate) with 40 goals scored and 66 conceded. To do that, they have to play better when the bright lights of the world stage shine upon them. As the co-hosts next summer, that spotlight will shine even brighter. It's upon the team to perform when the stakes are the greatest.

FIFA pulled back the curtain on its three official mascots for the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

The Athletic's Adam Crafton shared the details on Clutch, Zayu, and Maple, which are intended to represent each host county. Clutch, a bald eagle, represents the U.S. Mexico has Zayu the jaguar. And Canada is symbolized through Maple the moose.

The bald eagle is the United States' national bird and the animal most synonymous with the U.S., while the moose occupies a similar standing in Canada. The jaguar's connection to Mexico goes back centuries.

""Ancient civilizations of Mexico, such as the Maya, bestowed huge significance upon the jaguar, linking it to the underworld and symbolizing strength and bravery,"" Crafton wrote.

FIFA went even further by assigning positions to the three mascots. Maple is a goalkeeper, Clutch is a midfielder, and Zayu is a striker.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the mascots will add to the overall World Cup experience.

""Maple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself,"" he said, per Crafton. ""I can already picture them on children's shirts, high-fiving football legends and ‚Äî in another first for this tournament ‚Äî starring in video games played by millions worldwide.""

The 2026 tournament is the first since FIFA increased the number of teams from 32 to 48. As the hosts, Canada, Mexico and the United States have already qualified.

The World Cup is scheduled to kick off on June 11, 2026, and culminate in the final on July 19 at MetLife Stadium.","{'href': 'https://bleacherreport.com', 'title': 'Bleacher Report'}","soccer"

The vast scale and complexity of the recent Club World Cup stood out for Senior Pitch Management Manager, Alan Ferguson. He explains how that will shape preparations for 2026.

With less than a year to go until the FIFA World Cup 2026, the curtain fell on football's newest showpiece event, the expanded Club World Cup. The new 32-team tournament was also a chance for a dress rehearsal for football's governing body before next year's main event.

For Senior Pitch Management Manager, Alan Ferguson, this was an opportunity to test the newly developed shallow pitch profile system, which was deployed in varying levels in five stadiums for the Club World Cup, including MetLife Stadium, where Chelsea FC became the first winners of the new format.

Testing new technology

As a learning opportunity, the FIFA Pitch Team has taken a great deal away from the experience.

‚Äú‚ÄúThe first thing that hit home for me was the sheer scale of the tournament,‚Äù Alan explained. ‚ÄúThe Club World Cup was hosted in twelve stadiums across America, with 63 matches, and each host city had its own challenges. However, in ten months' time, we'll be at sixteen stadiums in three countries, each with its own climatic challenges.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything from stadiums to weather really got us thinking, and we have certainly plenty to think about in the coming weeks, and if I'm honest, it's pretty much where I thought we would be.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's one thing to research in the universities, but the real challenges come once you do it for real. From what I've seen across this tournament, I am confident we will fully align for the World Cup in ten months' time.‚Äù

While these were substantial challenges, the experience gained from the Club World Cup is critical to achieving FIFA's ambitious goals for the 2026 World Cup. A significant amount of time, effort and money was invested in the research programme run by Tennessee and Michigan State Universities, which developed the shallow pitch profile system, and this was their first real-world tournament test.

‚ÄúThe Club World Cup has given us invaluable insight into what we need to be ready for next year,‚Äù says Alan. ‚ÄúAnd with the systems we've developed, I'm confident that we'll exceed expectations in 2026.‚Äù

‚ÄúWithout the research that's gone into the new system, I've got no doubt the five pitches that used it at this tournament wouldn't have been a success.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs the Club World Cup approached, the team installed nine pitches in nine cities in 10 days, which was no mean feat. Everyone, from the Sod farmers to the hauliers, stadium teams and FIFA pitch Managers did a fantastic job pulling it off.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe whole operation went as smoothly as I could have hoped for, with the highlight coming in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium, where we had four days to install ahead of kick-off. Not only did we pull this off, but we also shallow stitched the pitch in situ using five machines in two days, which is another first. There were three concerts in the stadium ahead of the tournament, which only left a four-day window for installation, so we had to work with the time we had.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith the tournament over now, I think we still have a way to go so we can reach the uniform standards I want to achieve, but the important thing for me is we saw what we have developed so far, and it worked well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere were some challenges that were unique to this tournament due to turnaround times and the needs of stadium owners that we won't face at the World Cup, but even those are valuable experiences that we can anticipate now. There were also issues with the weather that prompted us to think, but we can now try to prepare better for that.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost importantly, we've changed perceptions of overlay pitches in the US, showing our system can host several games across a tournament. This gives me confidence for the World Cup.‚Äù

Up to 75 different floors were tested, with a short list of only seven able to be considered. One product which shone in testing was Permavoid. This modular system proved to be a success, generating ideal surface hardness and traction.

Another key finding from the research was the ability to achieve shallow stitching. Standard stitching in a restricted profile was not an option. FIFA has already implemented this finding in its other tournaments, with two pitches in Chile for the Men's U20 World Cup, scheduled for September 2025, benefiting from the new technology.

Training Pitch Challenges

Away from the public-facing stadium pitches comes the more significant challenge of the approximately 34 training pitches. Anyone who works in delivering international football tournaments will know this tends to be the most difficult area.

‚ÄúTournament training sites usually comprise a diverse range of venues,‚Äù Alan begins.

‚ÄúWe had everything from professional MLS training grounds to state-run high school and university pitches.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy preference is to pick up as many professional facilities as possible, because by working with the professional venues, we have a much higher starting point, often being able to save significant sums of money along the way.‚Äù  

‚ÄúI have no issue transforming a local training pitch into an international training pitch and leaving a strong legacy for football after the tournament. But such exercises are often underestimated by local organisers. Not only does the uplift in a local pitch require quite a bit of work, but it also requires the staff to upscale training.‚Äù

‚ÄúAgain, that's not a big issue for us, but once the venue realise the time involved and downtime for the venue pitch during the work, it usually creates more issues for venue management. By embracing more professional venues, it offers FIFA the chance to fund legacy programmes across several venues.‚Äù

‚ÄúUltimately, for us, it comes down to quality. During the Club World Cup, we didn't always achieve the standards we wanted, but by working with the Local Organising Committee, we can address those issues in time for the World Cup.‚Äù

As we count down to the 2026 World Cup, Alan Ferguson remains confident that the lessons learned from the Club World Cup will directly influence the tournament's success. With new technologies, a better understanding of venue challenges, and a clear focus on legacy, the FIFA Pitch Team is more than ready for the world's biggest football event.‚Äù

PAOK fans displayed a banner reading 'Stop genocide' during their match against Maccabi Tel Aviv

The United States government will try to prevent any attempt to ban Israel from competing at the 2026 World Cup.

A United Nations commission of inquiry said earlier this month that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

That has led a panel of UN experts and the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to call for sporting sanctions against the country.

Next year's World Cup is being co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada.

A US State Department spokesperson told BBC Sport: ""We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup.""

Meanwhile, there have been reports that European football's governing body Uefa - which organises World Cup qualifying matches - could meet to decide whether to suspend Israel as early as next week.

One senior source at a European member association told BBC Sport: ""Our understanding is that Uefa leadership wants to see some action on this.

""Nothing is confirmed or scheduled. But there is a new, high-level pressure from many nations compared to just a month ago.""

Israel are set to play Norway in a World Cup qualifier in Oslo on 11 October.

Earlier this month Norwegian football federation president Lise Klaveness said her organisation ""has to deal with Israel participating in their competitions, but cannot and will not be indifferent to the humanitarian suffering that is taking place in the region, especially the disproportionate attacks against civilians in Gaza"".

The Italian FA has also spoken about the challenges of playing Israel, who Italy host on 14 October in Udine.

The UN report said there were reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law had been carried out since the start of the war in 2023.

A panel of human rights experts at the UN subsequently called on world football governing body Fifa and its European body Uefa to suspend Israel's national team from international football,, external saying: ""Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual.""

Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence. Its foreign ministry called the UN report ""distorted and false"".

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 65,419 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's figures are quoted by the UN and others as the most reliable source of statistics available on casualties.

There has been an increase in calls to ban Israel from sporting competition since the UN's report.

And it comes amid reports that Uefa could vote on whether to suspend Israel next week. Uefa has said that no meeting is currently planned.

Israel are third in their World Cup qualifying group - organised by Uefa - on nine points, six behind leaders Norway.

The top team from each group qualifies automatically for the World Cup, with the runners-up going into the play-offs.

Spanish PM Sanchez said Israel should be treated in the same fashion as Russia by being banned from international sports competitions.

""Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image,"" Sanchez said.

The Russia national team have been banned from competing in international football tournaments since the country's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The Israeli FA declined to comment when contacted by BBC Sport, and Fifa has been approached for comment.

Sanchez's comments came as the final stage of the Vuelta a Espana was abandoned earlier this month after pro-Palestinian protesters entered part of the course in the centre of Madrid.

Protesters knocked down barriers and occupied the road at several points on the course including Gran Via, where cyclists were due to pass multiple times.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing under their national flags at the 2024 Olympics.

Earlier this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry sidestepped a question about sanctioning Israeli athletes, saying: ""The sports movement has to showcase the good that is in humanity.""

Meanwhile, supporters of Greek side PAOK displayed Palestinian flags and banners during their side's Europa League match against Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday.

Fans held signs in English reading ""Stop the genocide"" and ""Show Israel the red card"".

Chants of ""Free Palestine"" were also heard after Maccabi supporters unfurled an Israeli flag.

The displays came after protests earlier in the day in Thessaloniki, where fans and activist groups rallied against Israel's participation in European football.

Demonstrators submitted more than 1,900 signatures to Uefa in support of a petition launched this week, which said there could be ""no fair play with representatives of genocide"".

The match had been designated high risk due to the ongoing situation involving Israel and Gaza, with PAOK warning supporters before the match: ""The display of banners, messages or flags with political content could result in heavy sanctions for our club.""

Maccabi face Aston Villa at Villa Park in the Europa League on 6 November.

World Cup

FIFA has confirmed Clutch, Zayu, and Maple as the mascots for the 2026 men's World Cup, with a bald eagle, a jaguar, and a moose representing the three co-hosting nations: The United States, Canada, and Mexico.

FIFA teased the three mascots in a video posted to social media on Wednesday but The Athletic has obtained an exclusive first image of the mascots. FIFA, after being approached by The Athletic with the leaked image, subsequently provided a narrative story behind each character.

Clutch, is dressed in the U.S men's national team's blue away kit. The bald eagle is recognizable for its place at the center of the Great Seal since 1782. An act of Congress, signed by President Joe Biden in 2024, made the bald eagle the official national bird. 

Maple the Moose represents Canada and is dressed in the country's red home kit. The mascot also draws inspiration from Canada's maple leaf, which is the country's national symbol.

Zayu the jaguar represents Mexico and is dressed in the nation's green home strip. Ancient civilizations of Mexico, such as the Maya, bestowed huge significance upon the jaguar, linking it to the underworld and symbolizing strength and bravery. 

Meet Maple, Zayu and Clutch. The official #FIFAWorldCup mascots for 2026! pic.twitter.com/A27AcWX91h

‚Äî FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) September 24, 2025



Each mascot also has its own narrative designed by FIFA and is given both a playing position on the soccer field and a backstory.

The U.S. mascot Clutch is a midfielder with ‚Äúan unquenchable thirst for adventure, soaring across the United States and embracing every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism.

‚ÄúFearless on the pitch and uplifting off it, Clutch leads by action ‚Äî rallying teammates, lifting spirits and turning every challenge into an opportunity to rise higher. A social spark and sports fanatic, Clutch, like all great midfielders, unites people wherever they go, proving that true flight is about purpose, passion and play.‚Äù

Canadian mascot Maple the Moose is a goalkeeper who FIFA says was ‚Äúborn to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture.‚Äù

FIFA's description continues: ‚ÄúA street style-loving artist, music enthusiast and dedicated goalkeeper, Maple found purpose through creativity, resilience and unapologetic individuality. With a knack for making legendary saves and a heart full of strength and leadership, Maple combines endless stories and unstoppable flair.‚Äù

Zayu the Jaguar is a striker from the jungles of southern Mexico. FIFA says his name is inspired by ‚Äúunity, strength and joy ‚Ä¶ and demonstrates exceptional ingenuity and agility that intimidates defenders.

‚ÄúOff the pitch, Zayu embraces Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. More than an athlete, Zayu is a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride.‚Äù

The FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: ‚ÄúMaple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself. I can already picture them on children's shirts, high-fiving football legends and ‚Äî in another first for this tournament ‚Äî starring in video games played by millions worldwide.‚Äù

The mascots will not only provide a feel-good factor to the tournament but also form part of FIFA's commercial offering. Mascot shirts will go on sale via FIFA platforms and they will also be playable characters in a new FIFA-licensed game, FIFA Heroes, which will launch next year. FIFA describes the game as an ‚Äúarcade-style, fast-paced five-a-side football title‚Äù, which will feature ‚ÄúWorld Cup mascots past and present, football's biggest icons and favourite fictional characters from popular TV shows and films.‚Äù The game will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch, while the mascots will also feature in FIFA Super League Soccer on Roblox.

The 2026 World Cup draw will take place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington‚ÄØD.C. on December 5, with the tournament starting on June 11 and finishing on July 19.

A 64-team World Cup?

The concept will sound like a step too far to some, but others believe it deserves real consideration.

In April, the South American governing body Conmebol raised an official proposal to expand the 2030 tournament to 64 teams, and Fifa will discuss it with leaders from the continent in New York this week.

The first 48-team World Cup will take place next summer across the United States, Canada and Mexico - expanded from the current 32-team format - but there are serious attempts from some to make it even bigger for 2030.

That tournament will be the first to be spread across three continents to mark its 100-year anniversary, with main hosts Spain, Morocco and Portugal being joined by Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay in hosting opening-round matches.

But is the World Cup about to make more history? BBC Sport looks at whether a 64-team tournament could really happen and what it might look like.

The 2030 World Cup will be the competition's centenary edition

So, what is going on?

The idea was first ""spontaneously raised"" at a Fifa council meeting in March by Uruguayan Football Federation president Ignacio Alonso.

It was then presented at Fifa congress in April by Conmebol, which believes it would be a fitting way to mark the World Cup's centenary.

Fifa's official position has always been it will discuss expansion ideas with its stakeholders and it is duty bound to consider any proposals from its council members.

The Fifa council would make the ultimate decision, but there are no signs it is something expected to be made imminently.

How dramatic would this expansion actually be?

Fairly seismic is the obvious answer.

The pace of change has been remarkable, since the long-standing 16-team format increased to 24 teams in 1982.

It became a 32-team event in 1998 before being expanded to 48 teams for next summer's showpiece.

Adding another 16 teams for 2030 would mean the World Cup had doubled in size in eight years and would mean more than 30% of Fifa's current 211 members would participate.

Send us your questions

Conmebol president Alejandro Dominguez (left) is in favour of a 64-team World Cup, while his Uefa counterpart Aleksander Ceferin (right) disagrees

Fifa president Gianni Infantino said ""every idea is a good idea"", but the proposal for a 64-team tournament has divided opinion among the six Fifa confederations and national associations.

Conmebol president Alejandro Dominguez said expanding the World Cup for its centenary would ensure ""nobody on the planet is left out of the party"".

Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin is among those to have dismissed the proposals, with the Slovenian saying it is a ""bad idea"" for both the tournament itself and the qualifying process.

Victor Montagliani, president of the governing body for football in North and Central America and the Caribbean (Concacaf), said the suggestion ""doesn't feel right"" and believes the expansion would damage ""the broader football ecosystem"".

Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa agreed, saying further expansion would bring ""chaos"".

While there has been limited further public discussion, there are a few obvious reasons why people would be in favour and against the proposal.

Financially, more games would surely mean bigger TV deals and sponsorship possibilities.

The expanded 2026 format is already predicted to be generating more money than any previous World Cup through sponsorships, merchandising, ticket sales and broadcast revenues, with Fifa expecting to earn $11bn (¬£8.2bn) over the four-year cycle to December 2026.

By flinging its doors open wider than ever before, the tournament would be more inclusive and the change would probably result in a host of nations reaching the World Cup for the first time.

At the 2022 World Cup, hosts Qatar were the only team making their tournament debut.

Cape Verde are only one win away from joining already-qualified Jordan and Uzbekistan as debutants at the 2026 competition, while New Caledonia and Suriname could add to the growing number of debutants already in next summer's World Cup.

A 64-team tournament would also increase the likelihood of all the world's top players competing.

On the flip side, the competitive nature of the event would be brought into question. The potential for one-sided matches would increase, while qualifying would become even more a foregone conclusion for many nations than it is already.

Questions will be asked about the added amount of travel that players and fans will have to make, with sustainability likely to be an important issue with the increased number of flights needed to transport teams, fans and media.

Spain, Portugal and Morocco will co-host the 2030 World Cup - but the opening matches will be held in South America

This is a difficult question to answer.

The notion of a 64-team tournament is almost unprecedented in top-level international sport, so it is difficult to cite any examples.

Next summer's expanded format is complicated enough, with the top two and best eight third-place finishers from 12 groups of four qualifying for the last 32.

The obvious structure for a 64-team World Cup in 2030 would be for the top two from 16 groups of four to qualify for the last 32. Perhaps a bit tidier than next years?

Should the proposal eventually be accepted, the 2030 edition would include 128 matches - up from the 64-game format played between 1998 and 2022.

Next year's World Cup will have 104 matches and will take 72 games ‚Äì eight games more than an entire 32-team World Cup ‚Äì just to get down to 32 teams.

From the start of the 2026 tournament until the end of the last 16 there will be 96 games across 27 days, with no rest day.

Just one of those days will feature a single match, and just two days will have only two matches. The remaining 24 days will feature three, four or even six matches.

Therefore, the impact of another 16 teams joining the fray is rather mind-boggling.

How would they fit in the extra matches?

Fifa has already stated the 2030 finals will run from 8 June, with the final on 21 July, and the possibility of making the tournament longer would seem unlikely with the footballing calendar already more tightly packed than many would like.

This would mean the need for more games per day in the group stages and thus extra stadiums would have to be considered.

There have been suggestions Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay could host more games during these group stages.

And what would the impact be on qualifying?

For starters, it would be almost inconceivable that the world's top football nations would not qualify for the World Cup.

While Italy are currently preparing to sit out a third consecutive World Cup, such shock scenarios, which are all part of the drama, are hard to envisage should a 64-team tournament become a reality.

Conmebol could already see a maximum of seven teams qualify for next summer's event, and they would clearly want more members qualifying for an expanded tournament.

All other continents would also be expected to have more qualifying spots, but the logistics around this are purely guesswork for now.

The mere potential of a 64-team World Cup has raised plenty of questions - as well as eyebrows. Whether it gets off the ground or not remains to be seen, a matter for sporting and political power-brokers to figure out.

Is it even a World Cup without a mascot?Well, how about three?

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup being the biggest edition (48 teams) of the marquee soccer extravaganza, we'll also have a plethora of mascots for next summer's edition. 

[WORLD CUP 2026: WHICH TEAMS HAVE QUALIFIED?]

Three co-hosts. Three distinct mascots. Each of these cuddly creatures represent the co-hosts of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and have their own special attributes on the pitch.

A moose from our neighbors up north, Maple wears the No. 1 and is in charge of anchoring the net. From the name to his uniform color, Maple embodies some of the country's most recognizable emblems and is ""born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture.""

And although Les Rouges are better known for playmakers such as Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, it won't hurt to have Maple's antlers covering as much of the goal as possible. 

(Courtesy: FIFA) 

A jaguar who plays forward, donning the No. 9 in Mexico's iconic green kit. An elusive creature found in southern parts of the country, jaguars are a symbol to many of Mexico's ancient civilizations. Zayu is said to ""embrace Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. ‚Ä¶ a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride.""

And there's also no shortage of quality forwards for El Tri at the World Cup, including Javier ""Chicharito"" Hern√°ndez, Cuauht√©moc Blanco, and current striker Ra√∫l Jim√©nez. 

You need a maestro in the midfield, and Clutch should be up to the task. You need a keen eye and some sharp instincts when wearing the No. 10 shirt, so it's no surprise to have a bald eagle representing the United States.  Clutch is said to have ""an unquenchable thirst for adventure, soaring across the United States and embracing every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism.""

Christian Pulisic usually wears that number for the U.S. men's national team as a winger, so USMNT fans will hope he soars to new heights in 2026.

Jurgen Klopp's decision to step down as Liverpool boss rocked the world of football. The resurgent Reds were top of the Premier League and still in three cup competitions when the Kop idol announced on January 26, 2004 that he would leave Anfield at the end of the season.

""I can understand that it's a shock for a lot of people at this moment, when you hear it for the first time, but obviously I can explain it ‚Äì or at least try to explain it,"" Klopp told the club's official website.

""I love absolutely everything about this club, I love everything about the city, I love everything about our supporters, I love the team, I love the staff. I love everything.

""But that I still take this decision shows you that I am convinced it is the one I have to take. It is that I am, how can I say it, running out of energy.""

Jannik Sinner made a quick start in his bid to reclaim the China Open trophy in Beijing, where he powered past two-time finalist Marin Cilic 6-2, 6-2.

Competing for the first time since his US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, with which he also ceded the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner bounced back in emphatic fashion. The 24-year-old Italian, who triumphed on his Beijing debut in 2023 and reached last year's final, saved the only break point he faced upon return to the Chinese ATP 500 event, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Starting off STRONG! üí™@janniksin defeats Cilic 6-2 6-2 and advances into Round 2 in Beijing@chinaopen | #2025ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/8W6A9G9003

‚ÄúI try to put a lot of concentration into the first-round matches, because I know that many things can go wrong,‚Äù said Sinner, who has won his past 27 opening-round matches since Cincinnati in 2023. ‚ÄúAfter you usually find your rhythm, your pace, the speed of the courts much better. I try to prepare myself in the best possible way. I came here quite early in order to feel the conditions.

‚ÄúI'm very happy to deliver this kind of performance today. Marin is a very tough player to play against, his peak is quite high. I managed to break him quite early in both sets, which gave me the confidence to keep going.‚Äù

Sinner will aim to keep pace in his battle with rival Alcaraz for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours across the remaining months of the season. He trails the Spaniard, who is competing in Tokyo, by 2,590 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

Sinner will next face Terence Atmane for the second time in as many months. The French qualifier earlier defeated Zhang Zhizhen for his first tour-level win since his surprise run to the semi-finals in Cincinnati, where he was halted by Sinner in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head clash.

Earlier on Day in 1 the Chinese capital, Alexandre Muller sprang an early upset by rallying past Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-6(5), 6-4 for his first Top 10 win on hard courts and third overall (3-9). He will next play Fabian Marozsan, who ousted Benjamin Bonzi 7-6(1), 6-3 on his Beijing debut.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina also booked his spot in the second round with a clinical 6-1, 6-3 victory over Camilo Ugo Carabelli. The Spaniard, who hit 21 winners, including six aces, awaits eighth seed Daniil Medvedev or Cameron Norrie next in Beijing.

Taylor Fritz narrowly escaped an opening-round upset on Thursday at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo, where he rallied past Gabriel Diallo 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(3).

Just days removed from his standout Laver Cup wins over Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev, Fritz found himself pushed onto the defensive against fellow big server Diallo, who struck 16 more winners (40-24). Yet the second-seeded American dug deep to seal a two-hour, nine-minute victory and extend his perfect 3-0 record in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

With his win, Fritz also strengthened his bid to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive year. He is sixth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, having reached the title match at last year's season finale before falling to Jannik Sinner.

‚ÄúThe biggest thing for me today was the energy, it's really tough to match the energy from last week with Andre [Agassi] and the team going crazy on the bench,‚Äù said Fritz of Laver Cup's Team World, captained by Andre Agassi. ‚ÄúI really just had to find it and get it going. It was a really tough match to play.‚Äù

Fritz now boasts a 46-17 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, only behind World No. 1 Alcaraz (62) for the most wins this season. The American, who captured the Tokyo title in 2022, faces a second-round clash with Portugal's Nuno Borges.

It was also a strong day for other Americans. Sebastian Korda rallied past countryman Marcos Giron for a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(4) victory, while Jenson Brooksby upset sixth seed and last year's finalist Ugo Humbert 7-6(4), 6-3.



Korda set a meeting with Japanese qualifier Sho Shimabukuro, who stunned fifth seed Tomas Machac 6-3, 7-6(4) in his first tour-level match of the season, and Brooksby next plays Luciano Darderi, who denied home hope Yoshihito Nishioka 7-6(9), 6-3 to advance.

Korda, who missed the grass swing due to a right shin stress fracture, is up seven spots to No. 67 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. Brooksby now has 17 tour-level wins this year and remains on track to better his career-best count of 25 from 2022, the year he reached a career-high World No. 33.

Brandon Nakashima and qualifier Ethan Quinn were also among the American winners on Thursday in Tokyo. Nakashima backed up his semi-final run in Chengdu by rallying past Jordan Thompson 6-7(6), 7-6(4), 6-2, and World No. 81 Quinn upset countryman Alex Michelsen 7-5, 6-2.

Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah.

Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year.

Fourth-placed Prizmic captured his third ATP Tour match win of the season at the event in Chengdu. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah.

China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. The 20-year-old lefty returned to Tour at the end of July in Toronto after missing the first six months of the season due to a foot injury.

Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

Fifth-placed Alexander Blockx, sixth-placed Nicolai Budkov Kjaer and eighth-placed Martin Landaluce are in Challenger Tour action this week in Orleans, while seventh-placed Nishesh Basavareddy lost in the opening round of qualifying in Beijing.

Carlos Alcaraz overcame both an injury scare and a rain delay on a dramatic debut at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo, where he defeated Sebastian Baez 6-4, 6-2 on Thursday evening.

Midway through the opener, the World No. 1 collapsed to the floor holding his left ankle and heel, which required strapping, only to later be interrupted by a 30-minute rain delay prior to serving for the first set. Despite the setbacks, Alcaraz steadied himself to win in straight sets and move safely into the second round at the ATP 500 event.

‚ÄúI was scared too, I'm not gonna lie,‚Äù Alcaraz said. ‚ÄúWhen I planted the ankle, I was worried, because it didn't feel good at the beginning. I'm just happy that I was able to play good tennis after that and finish the match quite good. I will try to recover to do whatever it takes to be ready for the next round.‚Äù

After dropping serve for 2-2 in the first set, Alcaraz stretched for a forehand and stumbled backward in clear discomfort before collapsing to the court, clutching his left leg and glancing anxiously to his team. While lying there, the World No. 1 received on-court attention from the physio before moving to his chair, where his left ankle and heel were taped during a medical timeout.

Alcaraz tentatively returned, but eventually retrieved some of his first-class shotmaking to seal the first set, which was halted for 30 minutes at 5-4. The 22-year-old Spaniard then had the strapping reinforced, and with his movement more secure, he powered through the remainder of the match.

‚ÄúI couldn't do anything at all during the first five minutes [after] I did it,‚Äù said Alcaraz, who improved to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Baez. ‚ÄúI was worried that I wouldn't have the confidence to finish the match, but the physio came and did some tests. It was good I could walk to the bench and that gave me confidence [to continue]. I'm trying to have a warrior mentality in every match, in every aspect of everything.‚Äù

Next in his campaign is Zizou Bergs, who ousted in-form Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo 1-6, 7-6(2), 7-6(4). The top-seeded Alcaraz is this week aiming to join 12 fellow ATP No. 1 Club members who have triumphed in Tokyo. He owns a Tour-leading 63 wins and seven titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.



Alcaraz's seeded semi-final opponent Casper Ruud shook off a sluggish in his opener to overcome Japanese wild card Shintaro Mochizuki 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and keep pace in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The former Nitto ATP Finals runner-up is currently 13th, but he insists that qualification for the season finale is yet to cross his mind.

‚ÄúNot yet. Typically when we come back to Europe, there's only three or four more tournaments, so that's when you think about it,‚Äù said Ruud, who next plays Matteo Berrettini. ‚ÄúMy goal is to have a good end of the season, and I haven't really had that in the past except for Turin, [where] I've had some good results. Indoors is not my forte.

‚ÄúLet's see‚Ä¶ It was a little tough to play today, coming a long way from San Francisco, but I'm very happy I was able to overcome it.‚Äù

Abbi Pulling reviews the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Five years on from their curtailed last race together, there will be a special reunion for Romain Grosjean and Haas this week.

Romain Grosjean will drive a Formula 1 car for the first time since his dramatic crash in the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix when he gets behind the wheel of a 2023-spec Haas during a test at Mugello on Friday.

Grosjean's Haas was engulfed in flames when he crashed through the barriers on the opening lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix in 2020, leaving him with extensive burns on both hands.

It turned out to be his 179th and final Grand Prix, with the Frenchman going on to compete in the IndyCar series in America, taking six podiums and three poles over the course of four seasons.

On Friday, he will return to a Formula 1 car following an invite from his former team Haas, with whom he spent five seasons competing between 2016 and 2020, when he drives the VF-23 in a Testing of Previous Car (TPC) test.

Haas Team Principal Ayao Komatsu, who was Grosjean's race engineer when they worked together at Lotus, will once again serve as his race engineer at Mugello.

‚ÄúI'm absolutely thrilled to be welcoming Romain Grosjean back into a Formula 1 car for the first time in five years but especially proud he's returning in one of our cars ‚Äì it's only fitting,‚Äù said Komatsu.

‚ÄúRomain and I have worked together throughout his entire Formula 1 career so this test at Mugello is of particular significance to us both.

‚ÄúI'm delighted he embraced the opportunity to come and get back behind the wheel with us, a day that's going to be made extra special by having so many members of the original crew back together to witness it.

‚ÄúIt should be a fun day and knowing Romain as I do, I know he'll want to give it his all as usual ‚Äì I'd expect nothing less, not least as we've talked about making this happen for a long time now.‚Äù

Grosjean added: ‚ÄúI'm incredibly grateful to Gene Haas and to Ayao Komatsu for inviting me to participate in the TPC at Mugello.

‚ÄúTo say I'm excited to get back behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car would naturally be an understatement. I really can't believe it's been almost five years, but to come back and have this outing with my old team is truly something special.

‚ÄúI'm excited to see everyone, I'm sure we'll spend a bit of time reminiscing about the old days, but I'm also keen to be of use regarding the trackside agenda with the VF-23 ‚Äì it's great the team now has the TPC program as part of its on-going development.

‚ÄúFinally, my kids had designed my helmet for what was meant to be my final Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi back in 2020 ‚Äì I'm at last going to be able to give it a go in a Formula 1 car on Friday.‚Äù

Ex-IndyCar driver and F1 TV broadcaster James Hinchcliffe will get his first chance to drive a Formula 1 car on Friday when he drives the same VF-23 as part of a feature for F1 TV.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Former Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer picks the bones out of Oscar Piastri's uncharacteristically scrappy Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Oscar Piastri had a tough weekend in Baku, crashing in Qualifying, dropping to the very back of the pack after a botched race start, and then crashing again on the opening lap.

The race start was as big a mistake as you can get for a championship contender at this phase of the season. It's elementary, but it proves that ice-cool Oscar feels pressure and emotion like the rest of us.

From ninth on the grid, things were looking routine for Piastri on Sunday as he lined up perfectly in his grid box, found his optimal pre-start revs of 9,500rpm and hovered his foot there waiting for the lights to go out. This should have left him in good stead for a decent launch and a charge through the field over a 51-lap Grand Prix.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Could an unlikely championship comeback be on the cards after Max Verstappen's charging wins at Monza and Baku? While we wait for the answer to that question, F1.com runs through some other dramatic title-winning campaigns from years gone by...

Another layer has been added to the battle for the 2025 F1 Drivers' Championship after Red Bull's Max Verstappen slashed the points gap to McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri on a dramatic weekend in Azerbaijan.

It means, with seven Grands Prix and three Sprint weekends still to come, 69 points cover Piastri in first, Norris in second and Verstappen in third ‚Äì plenty of paddock figures feeling there is now a three-horse race for the crown.

So, could an unlikely comeback be on the cards? While we wait for the answer to that question, F1.com runs through some other dramatic title-winning campaigns from years gone by...

The 1976 season is perhaps one of the most well-known in F1 history, with it marking the famous championship battle that played out between James Hunt and Niki Lauda.

While Lauda had looked to be the favourite during the early stages of the campaign ‚Äì entering Round 10 of 16, the German Grand Prix, with a 23-point lead over Hunt ‚Äì the picture changed when the Austrian suffered serious burns in a horrifying fiery accident at the Nurburgring.

After making a remarkable recovery that saw him return only two months later with four races remaining, Lauda remained ahead of Hunt by three points entering into the season finale in Japan.

But when the arrival of torrential rain at Fuji resulted in Lauda opting to withdraw from the event, Hunt's third place finish was enough for him to clinch his first and only World Championship.

With just over two thirds of the 1982 Formula 1 season complete, Keke Rosberg was back in fifth place in the championship on 23 points, while Didier Pironi led with a tally of 39. Pironi and his closest challengers ‚Äì John Watson, Alain Prost and Lauda ‚Äì had each scored two victories, but Rosberg had not yet claimed a win.

However, when Pironi sustained injuries in a crash at the German Grand Prix that ultimately brought his F1 career to an end, Rosberg found himself closing in on the title battle. Having broken his duck by winning at Dijon, he entered the season finale with a nine-point advantage over closest challenger Watson.

While Watson finished the Caesars Palace Grand Prix in second place, Rosberg's fifth was all the Finn needed to earn him his sole drivers' title.

One of the most memorable championship turnarounds came in 2007, a campaign known for the tense intra-team fight that unfolded at McLaren between rookie Lewis Hamilton and two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso.

Hamilton was at the head of the standings with five rounds remaining on 84 points, five clear of Alonso and 15 ahead of third-placed Felipe Massa. Back in fourth was Kimi Raikkonen on 68 points, the Finn having so far claimed three victories in his debut season for Ferrari.

While another win in Belgium helped Raikkonen to close in, Hamilton and Alonso were still ahead with two races to go. But when Hamilton suffered his first F1 retirement at the penultimate round in China ‚Äì having become beached in the gravel at the pit entrance in wet conditions ‚Äì Raikkonen took victory and put himself only seven points behind Hamilton in the title race.

The driver known as ‚ÄòThe Iceman' went on to win again at the season-closing Brazilian Grand Prix, with Alonso and Hamilton back in third and seventh respectively. This enabled Raikkonen to take the championship by just one point from the McLaren pair.

A man who knows all about title comebacks is Sebastian Vettel, whose first championship in 2010 ‚Äì a year that also witnessed a change in the points-scoring system, with 25 now awarded for a win ‚Äì saw him overturn Hamilton's earlier advantage and take his debut title by just four points from Alonso.

But in terms of bouncing back in particularly dramatic style, the 2012 season was especially memorable. An eventful start to the campaign saw a different driver take victory at each of the opening seven races, with one of these claimed by Vettel.

Alonso, meanwhile, went on to build a lead in the championship and, with eight races remaining, held 164 points to Vettel's 140. The German then bolstered his challenge by embarking on a run of four consecutive wins in the latter part of the season, meaning that he led Alonso by 13 points entering into the finale in Brazil.

That advantage looked to have evaporated just a few moments into the race, with Vettel dropping to the back of the field following a first-lap incident with Bruno Senna. Despite sustaining damage to his car ‚Äì and enduring a lengthy pit stop amid the arrival of rain ‚Äì the Red Bull driver ultimately crossed the line in sixth, enough to beat second-placed Alonso to the title by three points.

While it may not be the biggest comeback numbers-wise, the battle for the 2014 championship was a noteworthy one; as well as witnessing a dramatic turnaround from Hamilton, it also marked the first year of what would become a fierce intra-team rivalry between the Briton and Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton had initially enjoyed the better start of the Mercedes duo, winning four of the five opening races, but Rosberg took momentum ‚Äì and the championship lead ‚Äì with victory in Monaco. From there Hamilton slipped behind his team mate and, when the season entered its summer break, Rosberg held an 11-point advantage.

While Daniel Ricciardo won when the campaign resumed at Spa-Francorchamps, Hamilton embarked on an impressive resurgence that saw him win six of the seven remaining Grands Prix.

Rosberg remained in contention for the title right up until the season-closer in Abu Dhabi, but problems with his car saw him drop down the order to a final position of 14th, while Hamilton cemented his second World Championship by taking victory.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman give their verdicts on how the Azerbaijan Grand Prix went for Haas.

Haas did not manage to score any points in Azerbaijan, with Ollie Bearman the higher placed of their two drivers in 12th. Esteban Ocon followed him home in 14th after an eventful race that saw the Frenchman suffer contact off the line.

Ocon's weekend had already been compromised by a disqualification in Qualifying for a technical infringement, meaning he started from last. A good getaway saw him fighting with Nico Hulkenberg, but unfortunately the duo collided.

That led to an immediate pit stop due to a puncture, and with the Safety Car out after Oscar Piastri's crash, Haas saw an opportunity to try something different. Having started on the hard tyre, Ocon was fitted with some mediums before coming back in the next lap for more hards.

That gave him 49 laps to try and survive ‚Äì and thrive ‚Äì on the C4 compound. He was asked afterwards whether the early collision hampered his race.

‚ÄúLuckily it didn't ‚Äì I think for both our races. At least I didn't have heavy damage,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt was just a small touch, and it touched the wheels mainly, which was a good thing.

‚ÄúIt was a good start; we tried a really aggressive strategy, which at the end made me lose out quite a lot. So, a bit of a shame on that part. We will review ‚Äì it has been a difficult weekend for us.

‚ÄúI think there are a lot of things we can improve for next weekend and this is what we will look out for in Singapore.‚Äù

Haas had looked fast at points in practice, with both drivers flirting with the top 10. As such, hopes had been high going into Qualifying, only for Ocon to exit in Q1 before Bearman crashed out in Q2. Those were just the latest in a series of issues for Haas, which Ocon wants to see rectified moving forwards.

‚ÄúYesterday [we had] a brake problem, in Monza we had an issue with the front end of the car really that was quite big. So, we just need to enter weekends and have a clean sweep and no issues, and a healthy weekend really. This is what we are all asking for.‚Äù

As for Bearman, he knew that Q2 crash was costly as it meant a P15 starting slot on a day where there was only one race retiree, and limited options to move forward.

‚ÄúQualifying was tough this weekend; I did a mistake in Q2 that meant I didn't put a lap on the board. Of course, it was very tricky conditions but that is no excuse. So yeah, just need some improvements [needed] for Singapore,‚Äù was his take.

‚ÄúIt was a good race overall, we made a good comeback, had really good pace. But starting 15th, lost a few places on the early laps with the Safety Car restart and after that I was really stuck.

‚ÄúIn the first stint, I lost a lot of time stuck behind [Franco] Colapinto and [Lance] Stroll, and after that it was really damage limitation. The car was quick but I couldn't do much with it.‚Äù

Haas head to Singapore sitting ninth in the standings, 11 points behind Kick Sauber.

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

It was a point-less weekend for Kick Sauber drivers Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg on the streets of Baku.

Gabriel Bortoleto chose to take the positives from his and Kick Sauber's performance at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with the Brazilian rookie finishing one spot outside the points on what was always going to be a ‚Äútough‚Äù weekend.

Bortoleto and Sauber headed to the Baku City Circuit off the back of a strong Q3 showing and points finish at Monza, only for Q2 in Qualifying and a run to 11th place in the race ‚Äì almost 30 seconds off Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar in 10th ‚Äì to be the limit this time out.

While he missed out on making it five top-10 results in seven events, Bortoleto knew the unique nature of the tight, twisty street track was never going to play to the strengths of Sauber's C45 package.

Reflecting on his Sunday afternoon, he said: ‚ÄúDefinitely an intense race, very close to the walls at all times ‚Äì you need to keep your focus level very high the whole race.

‚ÄúI'm happy that we finished the weekend without any damage on the car and that we delivered everything the car had available.

‚ÄúI really don't think we could have finished P10 today. Hadjar finished in P10 and was [half a minute] ahead. It's just not a weekend for us that we had the pace to fight with them.‚Äù

Bortoleto added: ‚ÄúI'm quite convinced that we can perform in other weekends. We knew this was going to be a tough track for us. There are weekends where we can fight for it and weekends where we cannot, so it's fine.‚Äù

Bortoleto's team mate, Nico Hulkenberg, started the race in 17th after a Q1 exit and could only rise to 16th ‚Äì having spent most of his day stuck behind Lance Stroll's Aston Martin.

Asked if early contact with Haas' Esteban Ocon compromised his race, Hulkenberg said: ‚ÄúNo, not at all. That was just Lap 1 racing. I think neither of us had a problem after that.

‚ÄúI just didn't get off to the best first lap, lost two or three positions. I got two back actually at the restart, a nice move into Turn 3, a double whammy ‚Äì that was quite nice and rewarding.

‚ÄúI had a long, long first stint behind Lance and unfortunately I couldn't get him. We lost a lot of race time there and that was make or break. Then obviously no Safety Car, nothing happening, so eventually pitted and came out far behind.

‚ÄúI think the pace at the end was good, but obviously the damage was done yesterday already and early in the race. [I need to] try to be better and cleaner next time around.‚Äù

Sauber remain eighth in the Teams' Championship standings after Azerbaijan on 55 points, with Haas just behind on 44 and Aston Martin just ahead on 62.

Abbi Pulling reviews the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Yuki Tsunoda enjoyed his strongest weekend so far as a Red Bull driver at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with the Japanese driver also trying to support team mate Max Verstappen's championship bid along the way.

Yuki Tsunoda has explained how he opted not to attack Liam Lawson as much in the fight for fifth during the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, in order to support Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen's title chances by not giving an opportunity to McLaren's Lando Norris behind in seventh.

After lining up in P6 on the grid ‚Äì his best Qualifying result as a Red Bull driver ‚Äì Tsunoda made a clean start and held off any potential challenge from Norris in the early stages. As the race progressed, the Japanese driver found himself on the tail of Lawson in the Racing Bulls car, whilst still keeping Norris at bay.

The trio ultimately crossed the line with Lawson in fifth from Tsunoda in sixth ‚Äì the margin standing at just over half a second ‚Äì and Norris in seventh.

However, speaking during F1 TV's post-race show later on, Tsunoda suggested there were potentially opportunities for him to overtake Lawson but that he felt it was safer not to do so, meaning that it did not present a chance for Norris to capitalise ‚Äì a move that would have allowed the Briton to gain further points on Verstappen in the championship fight.

‚ÄúI enjoyed the first stint, for sure,‚Äù Tsunoda reflected on his afternoon in Baku, a race that was comfortably won by Verstappen. ‚ÄúThe second stint was also very hard for me, especially with McLaren behind and thinking about [the] championship, both Teams' and Drivers' Championship for Max.

‚ÄúThere were a lot of opportunities I could probably go [down the] inside and attack Liam, but there is a lot more risk that maybe McLaren will overtake both of us or [pass Liam], which he will step up one more [position].

‚ÄúI think as a Red Bull you don't want to have that, and I think I did the right decision not challenging him. But at the same time, I didn't have enough pace to overtake comfortably.‚Äù

While Saturday's Qualifying session proved to be one of the most eventful in recent history ‚Äì amid a record six red flags throughout ‚Äì Sunday's race did not feature as many incidents. Asked if conditions had felt different ‚Äì particularly in terms of the wind gusts at the track ‚Äì Tsunoda responded: ‚ÄúIt's a lot different to yesterday, for sure.

‚ÄúI was hoping to not have a Safety Car with my strategy, especially in the beginning, and I was more hoping towards the end that [there might be] a Safety Car. [I] was a bit surprised.

‚ÄúI think last year as well, we didn't have much Safety Car [deployment] and I think drivers started to get used to it, and I think it shows how the level is very high in this current Formula 1 grid. With that, I enjoyed it.‚Äù

With his P6 marking his strongest outing since his promotion to the main Red Bull team ahead of Round 3 in Japan, Tsunoda acknowledged that the result has given him a boost as he looks to keep on improving during the remainder of the campaign.

‚ÄúIt's something that gives me more confidence in the future,‚Äù the 25-year-old said. ‚ÄúI think we made a couple of changes to the car, which got supported a lot from the team, and also I put my effort into my long run [performance].

‚ÄúLast week I saw some trend that Max is doing a little bit differently compared to myself, and I had an idea and immediately translated it in the simulator, and I feel something good there but obviously translating it into this real track is a different story.

‚ÄúI think I'm able to try some multiple steps and show some good steps with that, show some pace from that simulator. It's not the level that I want yet, but I think from the changes to the car it helps a lot for myself, but also some bits from my driving style match well with these changes, so I just keep [with] what I'm doing now and progress more.‚Äù

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto have given their verdicts on what proved to be a tough weekend for Alpine at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Pierre Gasly conceded that the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was ‚Äúpainful‚Äù for the Alpine team, with the Frenchman stating that the squad had ‚Äúabsolutely no chance‚Äù after lacking pace throughout the weekend.

Having failed to score points since the Belgian Grand Prix back in July, Alpine again came away empty-handed in Baku. The Enstone-based outfit took a gamble by splitting strategies between Gasly and Franco Colapinto ‚Äì starting the former on the hard compound and the latter on the soft ‚Äì but the move ultimately did not move the pair forwards, leading to a P18 and P19 finish.

Reflecting on the race afterwards, a downbeat Gasly summed up the situation by admitting: ‚ÄúWe've just got no pace here.‚Äù

In terms of the learnings that the team can take forward from the event ‚Äì with one eye on preparing for 2026 ‚Äì Gasly spoke of the importance of understanding why the A525 seemed to particularly struggle at the Baku City Circuit.

‚ÄúThe cars will be very different, I think,‚Äù the 29-year-old said. ‚ÄúI'm sure there's stuff we can learn because obviously it hasn't been good at all this weekend in terms of pace, and we've been slightly more competitive on other race tracks.

‚ÄúThis weekend we had absolutely no chance unfortunately, so there is fundamentally something on this track which we're not doing quite well and it's important to take the lessons from it.

‚ÄúBut, yeah, I must say it's a bit painful. It's painful for everyone, and I just think we've got to keep our head down and try to work together as a team and try to find a way to get better for next weekend.‚Äù

The Azerbaijan event was also tough for Colapinto, who was amongst those to crash in Saturday's Qualifying session. After lining up in P16, the Argentinian's afternoon was made more difficult when he was involved in a collision with Alex Albon, an incident that the Williams driver was handed a 10-second time penalty for.

‚ÄúIt was a tough day,‚Äù Colapinto conceded. ‚ÄúWe didn't really have any pace today and we just really struggled with the car, with the pace, and we need to keep working to get better.

‚ÄúOf course I lost a lot of time with the contact with Alex, 12 seconds I think, and then a broken front wing that gave me a lot of understeer [and a] flat spot. So it was tough, but we just had no pace and we need to get better at that.‚Äù

The 22-year-old added that the team would ‚Äútry to get better‚Äù for the next race, with the Singapore Grand Prix being the next round on the calendar on the weekend of October 3-5.

Also in the fifth episode of the show's scorching 27th season, Satan and President Trump's different attitudes toward becoming parents together become clear.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	Predictive betting comes to South Park in episode five of the show's sporadic yet highly rated 27th season, when the odds on whether Kyle's mom, who is a Jewish woman, will attack Gaza become a hot speculation at the elementary school.


	It all starts with the kids of South Park Elementary placing bets on whether one of their own ‚Äî a Boy Scout who insists on repeatedly informing the class that she is one of the group's WeBelos ‚Äî is a boy or a girl. Soon, Eric Cartman is going on about Kyle's mom, one of his least favorite people in town but one he enjoys talking (and on the big screen, singing) about.

	Back at the White House, Satan and President Trump are awaiting the birth of their child, who is likely to bring about the apocalypse, and are preparing for the little one's arrival. A seemingly goober-like version of Vice President J.D. Vance is back, too, with bad news for Trump. 




			Related Video		







	‚ÄúEveryone is so excited for the baby,‚Äù Vance says. ‚ÄúBoss, you must be so excited as well. Yeah, well, excited, it is going to completely change your life, though‚Ä¶.‚Äù


	Naturally, this being South Park, Trump soon begins his efforts to kill his and Satan's unborn child. Hijinks ensue. Vance's motivations are also revealed later in the episode (but you all knew the Vice President of the United States was no goober, right?).Plots in Washington and our favorite small Colorado mountain town once again merge after a phone call is placed from South Park to end the sports betting craze, via government intervention. FCC chief Brendan Carr ends up on the other end of the line from a frustrated Kyle and within about 10 seconds of his appearance on the show, he's there with Trump and Satan, shitting so hard he flies around the room, and then in the hospital with a parasite called toxoplasmosis; it can be transferred from cats to humans and bring about some complications ‚Äî in particular, for Carr, the loss of his freedom of speech.


	As the tension around what Kyle's mom Sheila will do about the Israel-Gaza atrocities reaches a fever pitch at South Park Elementary, she decides that it's time that she go to Gaza and does what she needs to do. However, this is not before explaining her perspective on the seemingly endless conflict that has now come for her personally.

	











	‚ÄúYou see, it's just pure anti-Semitism,‚Äù Sheila explains in one of the show's teachable moments. ‚ÄúI'm so sick of being grilled about my views on Palestine and my thoughts on Hamas, and being judged for things that are centuries old and that non-Jews know nothing about. 


	‚ÄúWell, if they all think we should do something, then you better believe I'll do something,‚Äù she concludes.


	The episode ends with her in Israel ‚Äî and she does attack. But it's only verbal violence, as Sheila launches into a nonstop tirade-as-homage to Curb Your Enthusiasm and its pseudo-villain, Susie Greene (Susie Essman). Cue the trademark tuba, mandolin, banjo and piano of ‚ÄúFrolic,‚Äù Curb theme song, as we reach what is said to be the halfway point of the 27th season of South Park.


	The episode arrived a week later than planned, after the show's creators admitted that they failed to complete it in time; Trey Parker and Matt Stone blamed their own procrastination habits for the delay. But some speculated the killing of Charlie Kirk, who was spoofed in episode two of season 27, at a speaking event in Utah that week, led to the new episode being yanked or possibly tweaked. The South Park team did manage to touch on the other major scandal of the moment with the Carr subplot, as it was his comments and veiled threats to ABC that are believed to have been the catalyst for Jimmy Kimmel's late night show going dark last week.

Fresh off its IPO, the indie disruptor is betting big on global audiences. But its values-based playbook may not translate everywhere.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Barely a week since Angel Studios rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and the faith-friendly disruptor is still basking in the glow of its high-profile debut and feeling the heat that comes with it. The Utah-based studio behind Sound of Freedom has gone from a family-run outsider operation to a $1.6 billion public company in less than a decade. Its rise reflects not only the strength of a niche market hungry for values-driven storytelling but also the new pressures of proving that a homespun model can scale under Wall Street's unforgiving gaze. It comes as the studio has expanded internationally, striking distribution agreements across Europe, Latin America, and Asia in an effort to prove its grassroots, faith-friendly business model can resonate worldwide.

					Zurich Summit Bets on ""Boring Old Money"" to Fuel Film Financing		
			









	Angel's secret weapon has been its 1.5 million-strong ‚ÄúAngel Guild,‚Äù paying members who double as financiers and gatekeepers, voting on which projects make it to screens, as well as providing Kickstarter-style capital investments and a ‚Äúpay-it-forward‚Äù booking system that allows people to buy and then donate movie tickets to Angel Studios releases for others to use.

	‚ÄúRather than having a couple dozen people make all the decisions about every movie that goes out, I can't take a movie into the studio and stream it or take it to theaters unless the guild passes it,‚Äù chief content officer Jeffrey Harmon explained, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in June, ahead of its IPO.

	











	That grassroots democracy has delivered some startling wins, including the $250 million global success of Sound of Freedom and The King of Kings, a South Korean-produced animated hit about the life of Jesus, which has grossed more than $70 million worldwide. Media analyst Evan Shapiro estimates that from 2023 to 2025, Angel's releases averaged $34.7 million per title, outpacing indie rivals like A24.


	Angel's pitch to investors is that audiences in middle America, the same group that Taylor Sheridan tapped to create his Yellowstone television empire, will flock to faith-friendly movies that embrace a more conservative worldview.


	‚ÄúAngel is a response to Hollywood gatekeepers being out of touch,‚Äù says Angel CEO and co-founder. ‚ÄúWe have flipped the model, empowering our 1.5 million Angel Guild members to be virtual co-producers, deciding what values-driven film and television shows get made and distributed. While we are encouraged by the early response to the power of our new model, we are focused on building lasting value over the long term.‚Äù


	But the company's bold approach comes with obvious risks. Angel has yet to turn a profit. In the first half of 2025, it booked $135 million in revenue but still posted a $53.3 million loss. The company has attributed much of its spending to efforts to expand its Angel Guild membership base, though detailed breakdowns of marketing costs are not publicly available. Just ahead of its listing, Angel raised $55 million from more than 40,000 individual investors and secured a $100 million credit facility with Trinity Capital. According to summaries of its filings, Angel has also used high-interest debt and other financing arrangements tied to revenue streams such as Sound of Freedom. These moves provided the studio with growth capital, but also raised questions about potential dilution, leverage, and the durability of its financial runway.

	











	The international expansion adds another layer of uncertainty. Whether Angel's blend of evangelical-inspired hits and broader family fare can travel beyond its U.S. base remains an open question. ‚ÄúEurope is a more secular market generally,‚Äù Harmon admitted to THR, but noted he sees strong growth potential in territories like Brazil, which boasts a more faith-focused audience. ‚ÄúThey embrace the faith films more so than even the U.S. does.‚Äù


	The company has already partnered with Brazil's largest faith-based distributors for theatrical rollouts, inked a slate deal with U.K.-based distributor Kova for a pipeline of titles, and secured streaming and theatrical partnerships across Latin America. Angel has also pursued selective distribution agreements in Asia, including South Korea ‚Äî home to a large Christian community ‚Äî where The King of Kings became a local hit before expanding globally. These deals show Angel adapting to territory-specific partners, but also highlight the challenge of tailoring its model to vastly different cultural markets.


	The studio has also run into friction with creatives. A bitter arbitration battle over The Chosen ended with Angel losing rights to its biggest series (Angel is appealing), and a lawsuit with Slingshot, producer of the animated feature David, is ongoing. Angel president Jordan Harmon has previously waved off the disputes, noting that lawsuits in the entertainment industry are ‚Äúlike pigeons in New York City. It's just the reality of this space.‚Äù

	











	Despite those bumps, Angel is charging ahead. The studio has teed up The Senior, a sports drama starring Michael Chiklis as a 59-year-old who returns to college to play football, and Zero A.D., a biblical thriller from Sound of Freedom director Alejandro Monteverde, starring Sam Worthington, Ben Mendelsohn, Gael Garc√≠a Bernal and Jim Caviezel. Its 2026 slate includes Young Washington, a George Washington origin story timed to hit theaters next summer during America's 250th anniversary celebrations.


	Angel Studios shares, trading under ticker symbol ANGX, have dropped from around $13 after going as high as $20.39 and as low as $4.52. On Tuesday, the stock had closed at $5. 


	Given the current cultural moment, Angel Studios' IPO looks particularly fortuitous. But Wall Street's memory is short, and overseas audiences, which have proven resistant to patriotic American fare ‚Äî James Gunn's Superman being a case in point ‚Äî may prove harder to proselytize. Barely a week into its life as a public company, Angel has shown it can light a spark. The question is whether that spark can sustain a flame big enough to keep both its faithful backers and its new investors believing.

	The first look at the movie's cast can be seen below with a photo taken during the table read.

The film earned $38.1 million ($108 million today) at the box office before becoming a cult favorite.


	During summer of 2024, Gad teased the sequel in an Instagram post. ‚ÄúJust handed in a film script that I think may be the funniest and best thing I've ever worked on and I am so freaking excited,‚Äù Gad captioned the post at the time. He added that working with Samit and Hernandez ‚Äúhas been heaven on Earth and many other planets as well. Love you boys!‚Äù

	











	Moranis is represented by Troy Bailey of Bailey Brand Management and Marc Von Arx. Gad is repped by CAA, Range and Johnson Shapiro. Palmer is repped by 3 Arts and Hertz Lichtenstein. Lewis Pullman is repped by CAA and Anonymous Content. Carrigan is repped by United Artists in the U.K., Goodman Genow and Schlegel Entertainment. Wyner is repped by The House of Representatives. Zuniga is repped by Untitled Entertainment, CESD and Jackoway. Bill Pullman is repped by CAA.

The entertainment giant may soon have to turn over documents and communications dealing with the late night host's sidelining, including company moderation polices and copies of deals with affiliate stations addressing their right to preempt programming. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	A group of Disney shareholders is exercising its right to demand materials related to the company's decision last week to suspend Jimmy Kimmel‚Äòs late night show, a precursor to a potential lawsuit.


	In a letter to Disney, the American Federation of Teachers and Reporters Without Borders said there's ‚Äúcredible basis to suspect‚Äù that the board breached its fiduciary duty to investors by prioritizing ‚Äúimproper political and affiliate considerations.‚Äù




	‚ÄúThe fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech, triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney's stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship,‚Äù stated the letter, first reported by Semafor.

					Disney Sued After Enforcing Rights to Mickey Mouse in the Public Domain		
			









	The chain of events that led to ABC pulling the show unfolded unusually fast, starting with a thinly veiled threat from Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr that his agency might take action against the network over accusations that the late night host mischaracterized the politics of the man who allegedly killed Charlie Kirk. Within five hours, Nexstar, an owner of ABC affiliate stations around the country, said that it would preempt the show. Minutes later, ABC caved.


	The aftermath, which sparked national debates over censorship, saw calls to boycott Disney subscriptions and threats from talent indicating that they'd stop working with the studio until Kimmel was allowed to return. Last week, Disney's stock fell by over 2 percent, with its market value plummeting by nearly $4 billion.

	











	The shareholders are asking for board materials related to the suspension of Kimmel. They also seek communications with government officials, Nexstar and Sinclair over the decision; copies of Disney's deals addressing affiliate stations' right to preempt programming; policies regarding moderation of late night programming; and information on the company's ability to obtain regulatory approval in other areas of its business.


	The purpose of the so-called books and records demand is to investigate potential misconduct. Depending on what they uncover, the investors could file a shareholder lawsuit. ‚ÄúThere is a credible basis to suspect that the Board and executives may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty, care and good faith by placing improper political or affiliate considerations above the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,‚Äù said the letter, which cites concerns of whether Disney took into consideration Nexstar's $6.2 billion megamerger with Tegna.


	Although Kimmel was allowed to return to ABC's airwaves, Disney will likely continue to see ripple effects from its handling of the suspension. On Tuesday, President Trump said on Truth Social, ‚ÄúI think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do.‚Äù


	In a statement, Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for the shareholders who represented E. Jean Carroll in sexual abuse and defamation lawsuits against Trump, said large media companies ‚Äúshould not succumb to unconstitutional threats or blackmail.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúABC was the network to run the series Schoolhouse Rock more than 50 years ago. Its leadership should pay attention to the important lessons it taught.‚Äù

After all the tears, the cheers, the confetti and the fireworks, ""AGT"" has a new champion.

	Lars Brandle



	After all the tears, the cheers, the confetti and the fireworks, America's Got Talent has a new champion ‚Äî Jessica Sanchez.


	The Texas native's name was called out during the finale Wednesday night (Sept. 24) on NBC, completing a decades-long dream that a scriptwriter would be proud of.


	With her win, Sanchez collects the $1 million champion's check, an all expenses paid trip to Universal's new theme park Epic Universe, and a special place in the hearts of a nation.

	










A post shared by America's Got Talent ‚Äì AGT (@agt)


	Sanchez is the comeback kid, for real. She auditioned for the first season of AGT back in 2006, when she herself was a child. Now aged 30 and married, she's the hero of AGT 2025, which she aced while nine months pregnant with a daughter of her own.


	On Tuesday night's (Sept. 23) live final, Sanchez nailed her rendition of ‚ÄúDie With A Smile‚Äù by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. Wearing a delicate all-white ensemble, Sanchez was all power and precision. ‚ÄúIt's perfection,‚Äù remarked Sof√≠a Vergara, after the singer's final performance. ‚ÄúYou look like a little pregnant angel. I mean you look beautiful, your voice, I've never heard anything like that. Bravo Jessica.‚Äù 


	It was Vergara who, during Sanchez's audition, gave the singer her Golden Buzzer, and a direct pass to the live round of the competition.


	Viewers agreed. When America voted for the final time, it was Sanchez who came out on top. 

	











	Earlier, Sanchez joined forces with aerial specialists Sirca Marea for one last performance of ‚ÄúGolden Hour‚Äù by JVKE, returning to a song that earned her a spot in the Finals.


	Performing in front of the acrobatic pair, ‚ÄúI feel like they made the song come alive,‚Äù she later told AGT host Terry Crews. ‚ÄúI mean, they're just so amazing.‚Äù


	Sanchez came out ahead of a 10-strong Finals field that included Mama Duke, Micah Palace, Steve Ray Ladson, Team Recycled, Chris Turner, LightWire, Jourdan Blue, Leo High School Choir and the high-flying  Sirca Marea.


	For the record, second place went to freestyle rapper Chris Turner, and singer Jourdan Blue completed the podium in third place. Chicago's Leo High School Choir came fourth, and visual artists LightWire snagged fifth position.

On Billboard's music business podcast On the Record, senior editor Griselda Flores talks concert cancellations and the lack of Latin artists at Coachella.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	When Donald Trump was elected to his second term as President of the United States last November, Billboard‚Äòs senior Latin editor, Griselda Flores, began watching to see if his forthcoming immigration policy changes would impact the Latin music business.


	There was already a historical pattern to support this thinking: Back in the 2000s, when George W. Bush strengthened immigration enforcement and tightened visa restrictions, Billboard found that it hurt the business of Latin music concert promoters, who depend on immigrants to fill seats. Abel DeLuna, a California-based member of the veteran Mexican music association Promotores Unidos, told Billboard in 2007 that the policies alone accounted for 20% to 25% of the drop in his concert promotion business, for example.


	Through Flores's extensive reporting, she found that Trump's policies did, in fact, have some economic and cultural impact on this sector of the music industry. The Michelada Festival in Chicago was cancelled last minute this summer, citing a ‚Äúrapidly changing political climate‚Äù and ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù around artist visas. Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny announced he would not be coming to the U.S. on his next tour, citing a fear of potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the crowd. Mexican-born Narcocorridos artists and Cuban acts found it hard to get visas, and stadium-level acts like ‚ÄúBox Office King‚Äù Juli√≥n √Ålvarez had visas canceled at the last minute before shows.


	To explain what she's been seeing over her last nine months of reporting on the issue, Flores went on Billboard's new music business podcast, On the Record With Kristin Robinson. 


	The interview can be watched in full below or listened to at this link.

EXCLUSIVE: Ash Brannon and Chris Buck's Academy Award-nominated animated mockumentary feature Surf's Up is set for the small screen treatment.

	Lienne Sawatsky, Dan Williams, and John Hazlett, the trio behind animated children's series' The Guava Juice Show, are writing the adaptation, and will serve as showrunners. Jennifer Twiner McCarron, CEO and Chair of Thunderbird Entertainment, will exec produce alongside Atomic Cartoons' Joel Bradley and Aaron Behl and Sony's Rick Mischel.

	The original Surf's Up starred the likes of Shia LeBeouf, Jeff Bridges, Zooey Deschanel, Jon Heder and and James Woods, and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature 18 years ago. It parodied surf documentaries such as Riding Giants, following a teenage northern rockhopper penguin, Cody Maverick, who dreams of becoming a professional surfer by competing in the Big Z Memorial competition on Pen Gu Island.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The series will follow an over-confident teen penguin named Flip, who teams a zany bunch of young surfers in his attempt to become a surf legend. Things go spectacularly wrong and the wipeouts are spectacular, so they instead they build their own surf community on Pen Gu Island. Characters from the movie such as Cody, Big Z and Chicken Joe will return.


	‚ÄúOur team at Atomic is thrilled to be working on Surf's Up: The Series and for the opportunity to introduce these adored characters to the small screen, reaching new and existing fans of the iconic animated film,‚Äù said Twiner McCarron, who is also the CEO of Atomic in addition to Thunderbird.


	‚ÄúLienne, Dan and John are passionate about only two things in life ‚Äì penguins and surfing,‚Äù added Behl. ‚ÄúIt was undeniable that they were the write team ‚Äì pun intended ‚Äì to adapt Surf's Up as a hilarious animated series.‚Äù

	











	Atomic has bases in Vancouver, Ottawa and L.A., and is known for the likes of The Last Kids on Earth, Rocket Saves the Day and Mermicorno: Starfall, which is currently in production. It has also worked on brands such as LEGO, My Little Pony and CoComelon. Atomic's parent, Thunderbird, is behind the likes of Super Team Canada, Molly of Denali, Highway Thru Hell, Kim's Convenience, Boot Camp and Sidelined: The QB and Me, and operates TV sales division Thunderbird Distribution and Thunderbird Brands, which manages consumer products rights.


	The plan is to market Surf's Up: The Series internationally to land TV partners and consumer products lines.


	‚ÄúWe're excited to be partnering with Atomic and their long history of bringing great intellectual property to series animation,‚Äù said Sony's Mischel. ‚ÄúSurf's Up is iconic and we look forward to a whole new audience getting to know these characters.‚Äù

	In the show, Franck (Magimel) and his longtime friends, who spend weekends hunting together, come across another group who begin targeting them for no apparent reason. Despite one of their group being shot, they strike back and manage to escape. However, as Franck goes back to his normal life with wife Krystel (Laurent), he senses he is being watched or tracked by hunters now hell-bent on revenge.

	In the trailer for his new documentary Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, Ben Stiller says of his late parents, the comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, ‚ÄúThey had this incredible marriage.‚Äù


	But it wasn't without its challenges as Stiller explores in the film, which premieres at the New York Film Festival on October 5. They forged the groundbreaking comedy duo Stiller & Meara in the 1960s and ‚Äò70s, but had to balance the demands of career, romantic partnership and parenthood to Ben and his older sister Amy. Eventually, the comedy act split up, but the marriage of Stiller and Meara endured for more than 60 years.

	Apple TV+ is home to Severance, the hit drama on which Ben Stiller serves as executive producer, co-showrunner, and director.


	‚ÄúI feel very fortunate to be partnering once again with the incredible team at Apple TV+, this time on a project that is very personal to me and my family,‚Äù Stiller said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt's exciting to finally get to share it with audiences; and a great honor to celebrate my parents, both as I knew them growing up, and as I've come to know them in new ways through the making of this film.‚Äù


	Anne Meara died in 2015 at the age of 85; her husband Jerry Stiller died in 2020 at the age of 92. Following his parents' passing, Ben ‚Äúdug into the vast treasure trove of recordings, footage, letters, and other ephemera with which they documented their personal and professional lives,‚Äù the New York Film Festival writes in its program. ‚ÄúThese extraordinary archives are the foundation of this immensely moving‚Äîand, of course, very funny‚Äîdocumentary, beautifully directed by Stiller and edited by Adam Kurnitz (The Velvet Underground, NYFF59), which charts, with love and candor, the challenges and insecurities that are part of any show-business family's essential makeup.‚Äù

	











	Along with siblings Ben and Amy, the documentary feature's Ben's wife, actress Christine Taylor Stiller, and a Stiller & Meara pal ‚Äì actor Christopher Walken.


	‚ÄúYour father was a kind of a saint,‚Äù Walken tells Stiller in the trailer. ‚ÄúYour mom kind of scared me a little bit. She'd look at me, and I could tell she knows you're up to no good.‚Äù

Emma Watson has revealed how she struggled to adjust to Hollywood after Harry Potter.


	The British actress has taken a significant step back from acting since 2019's Little Women, and in the past couple of weeks has participated in a couple of interviews about her self-imposed exile. 


	Last week, Watson said she found the process of selling a movie ‚Äúsoul-destroying.‚Äù Now, in an appearance on Jay Shetty's On Purpose podcast (see video below), Watson became emotional recounting her experience of film sets post-Potter.

	After playing Hermione Granger for 12 years, she said the J.K. Rowling franchise gave her a warped perspective of the bonds created through filmmaking. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	‚ÄúI was coming to those sets with an expectation that I had developed on Harry Potter, which was that the people I worked with were going to be my family, and that we were going to be lifelong friends,‚Äù she explained.


	‚ÄúI came to work looking for friendship. And that was a very painful experience for me, outside of Harry Potter and in Hollywood, bone-breakingly painful, because most people don't come to those environments looking for friendships.‚Äù


	Watson continued: ‚ÄúThey're looking for: ‚ÄòThis is my chance. This is my role. This is what I want out of it. I'm focused. This is my job. This is my career.' I was not of that mindset.‚Äù In a tearful moment, Watson said the shattering of her expectations ‚Äúbroke‚Äù her: ‚ÄúIn a way, I'm proud that it did, because I guess that means I have something left to break.‚Äù

	











	During the same interview, Watson opened up about her rift with Rowling over transgender rights. She told Shetty that Rowling's views were ‚Äúreally painful,‚Äù but she could never cancel the author from her life. ‚ÄúIt's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with,‚Äù she said.

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: Top reality TV executive Corie Henson is taking on a beast of a new role.


	Deadline understands that Henson, who was most recently unscripted chief at NBC, is joining Beast Industries, the company founded by MrBeast, the world's top YouTuber.


	Henson has been named Head of Beast Industry Studios, which oversees MrBeast's YouTube channels as well as its moves into longform streaming series such as Beast Games, the Amazon competition series that has been renewed for two further seasons.


	It comes as MrBeast, otherwise known as Jimmy Donaldson, is expanding more into traditional television alongside his growing YouTube empire, where he has over 440 million subscribers.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	‚ÄúMrBeast rewired how millions of people consume entertainment. I'm beyond thrilled to join Jimmy and Jeff to help build what comes next,‚Äù Henson said. ‚ÄúWe're not just creating franchises, we're building worlds that actually matter to fans ‚Äî and doing it across every screen.‚Äù


	Henson will report to Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries. Tech entrepreneur Housenbold joined the company last year.


	Housenbold told Deadline that he wants to turn Beast Industries into the next Disney. ‚ÄúJust like Disney has Mickey [Mouse], it also has Lucasfilm, Pixar, Marvel, Searchlight, ABC, ESPN, and so on ‚Äî we have Jimmy. We know how to build virality into everything we do, and we're looking to continue building large-scale viewership, whether it's short-form or long-form content, and Corie is going to be integral to getting us there quickly,‚Äù he said.


	‚ÄúCorie brings world-class experience and a proven ability to scale iconic franchises. We're excited for her to lead Beast Industries Studio as we continue to blend the best of traditional entertainment with creator-driven innovation and expand our global impact,‚Äù he added.


	In addition to his YouTube projects and Beast Games, Donaldson is also writing a book with James Patterson, launching an animation studio and a video game platform, and is releasing a theatrical feature. The company is also developing more unscripted and scripted series, which will be overseen by Henson.

	











	Earlier this year, Donaldson explained the rationale behind Beast Games, which saw 1,000 contestants compete in a series of physical, mental and social challenges to win a grand prize.


	‚ÄúI've just always been really excited about taking the big spectacles we do on YouTube but being able to do it over an episodic series where we could actually get to know the contestants and have more depth and story and get more invested into the challenges and games. The idea was to take what we do on YouTube, but make it 10 times bigger and 20 times better,‚Äù he told Deadline.


Beast Games, which premiered on Amazon's streaming service in December and ran through February, saw Donaldson give away $25 million in prize money including a $10M prize to the winner.


	The show was renewed for two more seasons in May.


	Henson has a storied unscripted background. She joined NBCUniversal in 2022, where she became EVP, Unscripted Content, Competition and Game Shows, where she oversaw NBC staples such as America's Got Talent and The Voice as well as Peacock hits The Traitors and Love Island. She left earlier this year as a result of a restructure implemented by Donna Langley.


	Henson's big win at NBC was Deal or No Deal Island, a new spin on the classic game show that returned for a second season after strong ratings for its first season. She also greenlit Destination X, a major new adventure format that is expected to launch later this year and will likely be the first of a number of interesting international co-productions and deals.


	Before NBCU, Henson worked at Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox. She was previously EVP, Head of Unscripted for TBS, TNT and truTV before she decided to leave following Warner Bros.' merger with Discovery. There, she oversaw series such as the reboot of Wipeout, The Go-Big Show and The Cube as well as Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses, the Warner Bros-produced, Helen Mirren-fronted competition series that performed well for TBS and Cartoon Network.


	Before Turner, Henson was EVP, Alternative Entertainment at Fox and before that was EVP, Unscripted Television at Electus and VP, Alternative Series at ABC Entertainment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","South Park kicks the literal shit out of FCC chair Brendan Carr","https://www.avclub.com/south-park-conflict-of-interest-brendan-carr","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:40:00 GMT","

Anyone worried that South Park might be feeling a little cowed after the events of the last two weeks may now pretty safely put those fears to rest: Although the Comedy Central show‚Äîwhich missed its deadline last week, as it races through a hyper-political 27th season‚Äîdidn't touch on the death of Charlie Kirk with its latest episode, it went hard on a man who's been very vocal about how other people have talked about it: FCC chair Brendan Carr. Pretty literally, as Trey Parker and Matt Stone took very obvious glee at having the show's version of Carr be brutalized in a number of ways throughout Wednesday night's ‚ÄúConflict Of Interest,‚Äù ending with him stuck in traction in the hospital (with his arm locked in a distinctive pose), while being told that ‚ÄúHe may lose his freedom of speech‚Äù if a virus caught from exposure to cat feces reaches his brain.

To be fair, Carr campaigned just as hard to be South Park‚Äòs latest administration whipping boy, after a week of throwing his weight around to try to get the broadcast TV networks to toe the line and stop saying mean things about his boss. We've noted that Parker and Stone have spent the last few months basically daring administration officials to respond to them this season, and this might be the most aggressive provocation yet, as they depicted Carr being poisoned, pushed down stairs, and covered in cat shit as part of a comedy of errors involving Trump trying to get rid of his unborn child inside Satan's butt. In case the previous sentence didn't make it clear, South Park isn't all that interested in doing nuanced satire right now‚Äîalthough the show did take some more thoughtful pokes at the ever-increasing prevalence of online betting in American culture‚Äîbut it remains shocking and bracing to see how far the series will go when it's on the offensive.

All that and the show weighed in on the Israel-Gaza conflict, tapping Kyle's mom‚Äîwho, like most of the show's adults, can veer wildly in how villainously she acts‚Äîto pointedly note that the current fight in the region is ‚Äúnot Jews vs. Palestine, it's Israel vs. Palestine.‚Äù From there, she traveled to Israel personally to have it out with Benjamin Netanyahu, asking him, ‚ÄúJust who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it's some shield from criticism?‚Äù So, yeah: That week off has definitely not mellowed South Park out.

Sure, being a massive conglomerate capable of buying and selling some of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet sounds fun. You can throw around billions of dollars, engage in all sorts of fun mergers and acquisitions, and only occasionally find yourself forced to kneel and shell out cash in the face of the government being kind of mean to you. But have you considered how many people also wind up yelling at you, even when you only fold in the face of censorship a little bit?

These questions brought to us by news that some of Disney's shareholder groups would like the corporation to answer their questions about its conduct over the last week, and specifically as applies to the nearly week-long suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the airwaves. Specifically, THR reports that Reporters Without Borders and the American Federation Of Teachers (both of whom own Disney stock, apparently) have issued a letter to the company's board, stating that they believe that there's a ‚Äúcredible basis to suspect‚Äù that the board broke its duty to investors by putting its focus on ‚Äúimproper political and affiliate considerations‚Äù in the Kimmel matter.

Basically, the letter asserts, by bowing to FCC pressure‚Äîindirectly applied to the House O' Mouse after FCC chair Brendan Carr told affiliates that there was ‚Äúan easy way or a hard way‚Äù to deal with Kimmel's comments about right-wing conduct in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder‚ÄîDisney cost its shareholders a bunch of money in the form of lost public reputation, streaming service cancellations, and drops in stock price. (It's worth noting, in the interest of accuracy, that while Disney's stock price did drop after the Kimmel suspension was announced, it didn't drop much, in the grand scheme of things; that being said, it's not clear yet how many people actually canceled their Disney+ subscriptions, or how much overall damage Disney has done to its rep over the last seven days.) The shareholders are demanding to be given access to board communications about the decision to suspend Kimmel, as well as any back-and-forth between Disney and Nexstar or Sinclair, the affiliate ownership groups that are continuing to keep the talk show off the air in the markets where they own ABC stations.

Reading between the lines, it's easy to see how the shareholder groups are trying to send a message, i.e., that capitulating to the Trump administration's demands could potentially be just as much a hassle for Bob Iger and his fellow members of Disney leadership as trying to fight them. ‚ÄúThe fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech,‚Äù the letter states, ‚ÄúTriggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney's stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship.‚Äù

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Emma Watson talks J.K. Rowling rift, says she's sad a conversation was ""never made possible""","https://www.avclub.com/emma-watson-jk-rowling-rift","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:50:00 GMT","

The Harry Potter cast battle lines got drawn pretty quickly once J.K. Rowling started getting seriously into transphobic rhetoric circa mid-2000, divided between those franchise actors, like Ralph Fiennes, who voiced support for the series creator as she got ever-more-vocal about attacking trans rights and identity, and those who dared dissent. Notably, the latter camp included the series' three stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who all expressed their vocal support for trans folk early and often.

Rowling did not take this well, to put it lightly, making public comments suggesting she would never forgive the young performers for their statements‚Äîpretty much all of which started and stopped with quotes like Watson's ‚ÄúTrans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned‚Äù‚Äîand implying on social media that their presence in the Harry Potter film franchise ‚Äúruins‚Äù those movies for her.

Watson has now addressed the rift, with Variety reporting that the performer, who's been on hiatus from acting since appearing in Little Women back in 2019, popped up on a podcast this week in which Rowling's comments were addressed. Appearing on On Purpose With Jay Shetty, Watson expressed her sadness at the idea of Rowling‚Äîwho she has, obviously, known since she was 11‚Äîcompletely shutting the door on any possible conversations:

I really don't believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can't and don't treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with. I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don't get to keep and cherish. To come back to our earlier thing‚ÄîI just don't think these things are either or. I think it's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with. I think the thing I'm most upset about is that a conversation was never made possible.‚Äù

Rowling has, of course, stayed very busy in the years since she and the Potter kids broke up: She's been very publicly funneling parts of her vast wealth into supporting legal challenges to trans rights in the U.K., while also lending her name and support to the new Harry Potter TV series in the works at HBO.

It's one of about a dozen things that makes the samurai video game sequel one of the most aggressively dull games I've played in recent memory.

Like its predecessor, 2020's Ghost Of Tsushima, Y≈çtei puts its best foot immediately forward: Studio Sucker Punch Entertainment has made a very pretty video game here, depicting the wide, rolling plains and epic vistas of Northern Japan with meticulous and cinematic detail. From the mountain that lends the game its title‚Äîand dominates its skyline‚Äîto the vast fields of wildflowers you go racing through on horseback on your way to your next avengin', Y≈çtei is undeniably gorgeous, as good a technical pitch as anyone's ever crafted for the PlayStation 5 hardware. No game has ever been more readily and clearly made for the existence of its own Photo Mode‚Äîand if you sense some contempt in that sentence, well, yeah, absolutely.

I admittedly gushed about Tsushima's visuals back in my 2020 review, using the word ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù fully six times in the body of my write-up. (To let my past self off the hook a bit, we were three months into the pandemic lockdowns, and anything that wasn't the walls of my living room or the inside of my own eyelids was feeling pretty goddamn lustrous by that point.) But the elegance of Tsushima's landscapes also felt genuinely novel at the time, an escalation in what a video game world could look like. Meanwhile, five years of new hardware (and other developers playing catch-up) have only revealed how quickly this kind of visual spectacle can start to feel rote. Yes, Y≈çtei is pretty‚Äîbut it's pretty in a way where you can slurp up all of that beauty simply by watching its trailer a couple of times. You see it, register ‚ÄúPretty!‚Äù in your head, and then feel nothing beyond it; none of the game's aesthetic flourishes feel like they're in service of anything meaningful, beyond filling out a roll of eye-catching PR screenshots, and the actual effect often comes off as busy, more than jaw-dropping.



All of that panoramic showing off feels decidedly disconnected, for instance, from the game's plot, which drops you into the boots of hardened vengeance seeker Atsu (Erika Ishii, at least in the game's English voice track). As quickly sketched in Y≈çtei's opening minutes‚Äîand then fleshed out with early flashbacks that mark one of the game's rare narrative high points‚ÄîAtsu gets her motivations straight out of The Big Book Of Plots You've Seen A Million Times Already: Happy childhood, murdered family, list of mask-themed murder targets who've each conveniently migrated to one corner of the game's massive, icon-strewn map. When not distracted by the nine million chores waiting to intrude on her quest for solitary vengeance, Atsu masters new weapons, pursues her targets, and serves as the subject of god only knows how many lectures about the pointlessness of sanguine revenge.

I will note, for the sake of transparency, that I have not finished Ghost Of Y≈çtei, with this review representing 20 hours of dedicated play. It is certainly possible that the game's later sections contain at least one narrative moment that I had not already seen in any five other movies or games you might care to name on this topic; if so, I'd suggest Sucker Punch move that moment forward, so as to make their game's first-through-twentieth impressions a little less dire. As is, Ishii gives a low-key but winning performance as Atsu, but the dialogue is so flat, and the stories being told so rife with samurai film clich√©s, that I found myself actively heckling the writing as I made my way through beat after tired beat. Even when the game tries to make a plot moment zig or zag‚Äîwould you believe, dear reader, that the bad guys have internal lives and motivations that lend shading to the cartoonish cruelty with which they orphaned our heroine?‚Äîthe overall tone is so relentlessly dour that you can predict every single emotional pivot of every single character's arc with only the barest understanding of how these kinds of stories usually go.

This basic unwillingness to present players with anything they haven't seen before extends equally to the game's play. Combat is presented with exciting trappings, with enemies hitting hard enough (and in big enough groups) to frequently put Atsu on her back foot, forcing you to burn resources to heal. But after a few hours (and a few upgrades), the game's fights essentially solve themselves, as you learn to spam parry/block for everything except the handful of enemy moves immune to it, while switching between Atsu's growing arsenal of weapons in order to counter different foe loadouts. (Each new weapon involves studying under a different master, allowing Y≈çtei to add training tropes to its gigantic grabbag of clich√©s.) Big climactic fights can be exciting, as the game's intimidating boss enemies run Atsu through her paces. But by that 20th hour, I was starting to take hits in mook fights not due to difficulty, but because I was getting so bored of the fighting that my attention would flag‚Äîa death knell for a game where the thrills of combat are among its biggest ostensible selling points.

Y≈çtei is somehow even less innovative, meanwhile, in its exploration gameplay, as Atsu takes time out from her critical race towards vengeance to paint pictures, hunt bounties, climb mountains, cook food, pray at shrines, gobble up hundreds of pieces of crafting litter, and befriend the wildlife of Hokkaido. No one instance of this stuff is offensive, and a few of the mission types, like a series of map objectives that see you rescue hunted wolves to empower Atsu's occasional animal companion, can round out to being pretty exciting. 

But just as equally, no one instance of them is something you haven't done in a game of this type before, whether it's summoning your Magically Teleporting Horse to come running up from behind you, or climbing carefully color-coded rocks, or poking around at the Dual Shock 5's touch pad to do little extra bits of interactivity like lighting fires or cooking fish. And none of it will ever leave you alone. Repeating Tsushima's one truly great map game trick‚Äîthe blowing wind that guides the player to their chosen objectives‚Äîto massively diminishing returns, Y≈çtei constantly reminds you that there's more crap to pick up just over that next beautifully realized hill. With collectibles glinting in the sunlight, navigation-aiding birds and foxes suddenly swooping into frame, and the air itself pushing you toward yet another completion point, the game sometimes feels like reality itself is screaming at you to do more, get more, play more. No individual reward (beyond the initial slate of skill points that gets Atsu's basic combat powers online) feels terribly meaningful, but the game's Skinner box side has been carefully calibrated to keep you moving toward the next thing on the horizon, basically forever.

Some of the gameplay elements that Ghost Of Y≈çtei so aggressively replicates are fun, pretty much by default. Sneaking around an enemy camp and slowly merking every single guy inside it, for instance, is always going to carry a thrill, even when developers choose not to do much new with the template. (With the exception of the ability to sometimes call in your wolf pal to help you, stealth combat is pretty much unchanged from Tsushima: Sneak, stab, get caught, giant fight, repeat.) Everything presented here, with the exception of the word-to-word writing, is baseline competent, and frequently fun in small doses. As a way to turn hours of human life into a vague sense of accomplishment, the game ticks all the necessary boxes.

But, god, there's something spiritually draining about seeing this much effort, and this many resources, thrown at a game that doesn't seem to have a single creative idea running through its pretty, massive head. It's not just that Ghost Of Y≈çtei has nothing new to say about revenge. (Like I said up top, pretty much no vengeance-minded story seems capable of cracking that one.) But it also has nothing new to say about sword combat in video games. Or open-world map design. Or crafting systems. Or sibling relationships. Or melancholy. Or how climbing should work in games that sure have a lot of it, while paradoxically not seeming to give two shits about how it feels. It feints at some of these things, some of the time. It throws dozens of upgrades, cosmetic changes, and other little customization elements at you, constantly, to create an illusion of choice. It pours enormous amounts of time and energy into creating the tone and texture of the samurai movies its creators are so clearly obsessed with.

But none of it arrives with any genuine impact, because genuine impact would get in the way of easing the player toward the next simple set of tasks, to keeping them hooked on the ride. The fact is, you've played this game before. You'll almost certainly wind up playing it again. It'll pass through you like water‚Äîor maybe a gorgeously decorated bowl of gruel‚Äîand that's both Ghost Of Y≈çtei's blessing, and its curse.

This Friday marks the kick-off of the first Riyadh Comedy Festival, a pretty concerted effort by the government of Saudi Arabia to rebrand the capital city as an international comedy destination. To that end, organizers from the Saudi General Entertainment Authority have reportedly thrown around quite a bit of cash to bring in some of the biggest names in the comedy world to perform at the festival, including Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Aziz Ansari, Gabriel Iglesias, Louis CK, and several more. It has also, correspondingly, brought some critique: Most notably from comedian Marc Maron, who posted a stand-up clip to his social media this week blasting comics for signing on for a festival being put on by a government with a pretty lengthy list of human rights abuses detailed by Amnesty International.

In the clip (posted to the WTF comics' Facebook page), Maron opens by asking his audience ‚ÄúHow do you even promote that?‚Äù Referencing both 9/11 and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Maron pulled no punches: ‚ÄúBut don't let that stop the yuks, it's gonna be a good time.‚Äù (True to form, Maron also did a bit of self-deprecation, noting that he wasn't personally invited to the festival: ‚ÄúEasy to maintain your integrity when no one's offering to buy it out.‚Äù)

Maron isn't the only comic who's spoken out about the Riyadh Festival: Shane Gillis has made comments on various podcast appearances, stating that he turned down a reportedly large amount of money to perform at the fest due to his discomfort with Saudi politics. Comedian Tim Dillon was also reportedly fired from the festival this week, allegedly over jokes he made about his decision to sign on for it in the first place, claiming at the time ‚ÄúThey're paying enough money to look the other way.‚Äù (He also joked, ‚ÄúGet over it, so what they have slaves,‚Äù referencing a long litany of allegations of forced labor imposed on migrant workers in the country.) Dillon said on a more recent episode of his show that his management told him ‚ÄúThey heard what you said about them having slaves. They didn't like that.‚Äù Dillon said on the earlier podcast that he was being paid $375,000 for the single show, and that some comics were getting more than a million, it's worth noting that those numbers haven't been confirmed by any other sources.

Last year, Oppenheimer took home best picture for its depiction of the genesis of the United States' nuclear program. This year, Kathryn Bigelow's A House Of Dynamite imagines its end. ‚ÄúI always thought just being ready is the point,‚Äù Idris Elba's character says in the film's new trailer. ‚ÄúIt keeps people in check, keeps the world straight. If they see how prepared we are, no one starts a nuclear war.‚Äù As you can probably imagine, that's not what happens.

The rest of the trailer watches as a group of high-level government officials‚Äîincluding characters played by Rebecca Ferguson and Jason Clarke‚Äîpanic and scramble as an intercontinental ballistic missile heads straight for the continental United States. At one point, someone remarks that they've never seen the military readiness condition set to DEFCON 2 (near nuclear war) before. Later, Gabriel Basso's character remarks that diverting the missile is like ‚Äúhitting a bullet with a bullet.‚Äù The situation is very grim. 



‚ÄúThese are dedicated professionals at the highest level of government being called on to make impossible decisions in the most extreme circumstances imaginable, which is almost scarier in a way,‚Äù Bigelow‚Äîwho said she sees this film as part of an unofficial triptych including The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty‚Äîtold Tudum. ‚ÄúI wanted the view of the film to be trained inward, not outward, and for the audience to lean into the ambiguity at the heart of the nuclear debate: How can we call this defense when the outcome could well be total destruction? The antagonist is the system we've built to essentially end the world on a hair trigger.‚Äù

A House Of Dynamite premieres in select theaters on October 10, before streaming on Netflix October 24.

‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù actor William Shatner, who played the role of Captain Kirk, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 24, TMZ reports. He is 94 years old.

The outlet adds that he ‚Äúexperienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon,‚Äù with the actor having ‚Äúcalled emergency medical service workers for help as a precaution and paramedics showed up in an LAFD ambulance.‚Äù

Shatner was taken to a local hospital, with TMZ reporting that he's doing ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúresting comfortably.‚Äù

TMZ posted on social media, sharing the news, and many fans left comments, showing support for Shatner. 

‚ÄúüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ,‚Äù one fan commented.  

‚ÄúOh no.. I hope he's not beamed up just yet.. Stay strong @WilliamShatner.. Engines need more Warp Speed,‚Äù someone wrote. 

‚ÄúWishing Captain Kirk well,‚Äù a fan said.

In June 2025, Shatner opened up about a medical condition he has been dealing with for years called tinnitus.

According to the Mayo Clinic, tinnitus is ‚Äúwhen you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears,‚Äù however, it isn't ‚Äúcaused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.‚Äù The condition began when he was filming ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù due to the special effects explosion.

In the video released by the nonprofit organization Tinnitus Quest, Shatner aimed to spread awareness.

‚ÄúOver the years, I've had many ups and downs with my tinnitus,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know from firsthand experience just how difficult it can get.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äùs a diverse condition that comes in different degrees of severity. About 1‚Äì2% of the population suffer from a chronic, debilitating form of tinnitus. There are no effective treatments‚Äîand that's why we need more research,‚Äù he added. 

A post shared by William Shatner (@williamshatner)

On Aug. 7, William Shatner took to Instagram, revealing to fans that, at the age of 94, he has decided to release a book. 

‚ÄúMy dear followers, I wanted to drop a bit of a teaser: I'm writing a new book. Even Better: the book's all about YOU, the fans, and you can be a part of it, maybe even be in it!,‚Äù he captioned the post. ‚ÄúGo to WilliamShatnerAndYou.com to find out more!‚Äù

Shatner has played many iconic roles, including Captain Kirk, Denny Crane, T.J. Hooker. So with that, he is asking fans to ‚Äúsubmit your own tale of how my characters: be it Kirk, T.J. Hooker, or even Denny Crane‚Äîhave touched your life.‚Äù And a lucky few will get the opportunity to be interviewed by Shatner about their stories, while will be featured in the book.

Alexandra Grant set the record straight about her relationship with Keanu Reeves. The 52-year-old artist took to Instagram on September 24 to shut down wedding rumors, sharing a candid photo of herself kissing the 61-year-old actor at Roden Crater in Flagstaff, Arizona.

A post shared by Keanu Reeves (@keanureeves.media)

‚ÄúThis is a real photo. Not an engagement photo or an AI wedding announcement‚Ä¶ simply a kiss!‚Äù she wrote in her caption. ‚ÄúWe're at Roden Crater, and Keanu and Gard had just finished interviewing James Turrell for Visionaries.‚Äù

Grant called the headlines ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and confirmed she and Reeves never tied the knot. ‚ÄúI'm sharing it here to say thank you to everyone for the congratulations on our wedding. Except we didn't get married,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúGood news is much needed these days, but it's still fake news, so be careful out there! So, here's a bit of real happiness!‚Äù 

Read Alexandra's complete statement here.

A representative for Reeves also addressed the speculation on Sept. 23. ‚ÄúIt is not true,‚Äù the rep told People. ‚ÄúThey are not married.‚Äù The couple first went public in November 2019 when they walked the red carpet together at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles. 

Nearly a decade earlier, they had collaborated on the 2011 book ‚ÄúOde to Happiness.‚Äù 

At the time of their debut, a source told People, ‚ÄúKeanu wants to openly share his life with her. He is extremely happy and grateful to have Alex in his life.‚Äù

The marriage rumors surfaced just as Reeves began his Broadway debut in ‚ÄúWaiting for Godot.‚Äù Grant celebrated the milestone with another heartfelt Instagram post, praising his portrayal of Estragon.

A post shared by Brian Skope (@skopephotography)

‚ÄúTo Keanu ‚Äî who is not on social media, and with whom I'll share this later ‚Äî your hard work and dedication to trying something new and brave is so inspiring, artist to artist,‚Äù she wrote. 

‚ÄúYour Estragon is unlike any I've seen before ‚Ä¶ funny, lonely, pensive, philosophical.‚Äù

She also applauded director Jamie Lloyd and the cast, calling the production ‚Äúexciting, wildly imaginative, surprising.‚Äù

A post shared by Keanu Reeves (@keanureeves.media)

Reeves and Grant first met in 2009 at a dinner party and went on to collaborate on the books ‚ÄúOde to Happiness‚Äù and ‚ÄúShadows.‚Äù In 2017, they co-founded X Artists' Books, with their friendship eventually blossoming into romance.

Though protective of their privacy, the pair have shared glimpses of their love over the years. At the 2023 MOCA Gala in Los Angeles, they kissed on the red carpet, and Reeves later told People that his happiest recent moment was with Grant: ‚ÄúA couple of days ago with my honey. We were in bed. We were connected. We were smiling and laughing and giggling. Feeling great. It was just really nice to be together.‚Äù

From blockbuster hits like ‚ÄúThe Matrix,‚Äù ‚ÄúJohn Wick,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù to his latest chapter on Broadway, Reeves continues to thrive as an actor. Yet some of his most meaningful moments are found offscreen, in the life and love he shares with Grant.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jennifer Aniston Reacts to Pal Jimmy Kimmel's On-Air Return","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kimmel-return-jennifer-aniston-reacts/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:05:13 GMT","

Jennifer Aniston is showing Jimmy Kimmel love after the Tuesday, September 23 return of his show ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù The ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù star took to her Instagram Stories to share a repost of a shot from the late night host's account that shows him walking underneath a lit up ‚ÄúOn Air‚Äù sign. Aniston captioned the post with a simple heart emoji to show her support.

The actress has been a guest on ‚ÄúKimmel‚Äù multiple times, and Parade says she has also been ‚Äúgood friends for more than a decade‚Äù with the comedian. After the show's suspension on Wednesday, September 17, Aniston joined over 400 other celebrities to sign an open letter sticking up for Kimmel and championing free speech on television.

Ahead of Kimmel's big comeback, he and his longtime sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, comically pretended to have planned a totally different opener as they appeared dressed in banana and monkey costumes. ‚ÄúMaybe we should change?‚Äù they playfully joked after viewing news clips calling the moment ‚Äúthe most anticipated monologue in late night.‚Äù

Kimmel received a standing ovation as he walked onto the stage. He talked about the importance of being able to share his opinions, saying, ‚ÄúThis show is not important, but what's important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this,‚Äù he told fans. He then referenced talk show hosts from other places he says have told him they would get ‚Äúthrown in prison‚Äù for making fun of those in power. 

‚ÄúOur freedom to speak is what they admire most about this country. And that's something I'm embarrassed to say I took for granted until they pulled my friend Stephen off the air,‚Äù he explained, referencing announcement by CBS that ‚ÄúThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert‚Äù will end in May 2026 when Colbert's contract is up. The New York Times says Colbert's farewell season kicked off in July.

He then called efforts to coerce local affiliates to take his own show off the air ‚Äúun-American.‚Äù One fan commented on YouTube that they still can't view the show on local TV, writing, ‚ÄúI never thought I'd be unable to watch a TV show in this country, but tonight my local ABC station in East Tennessee, owned by Nexstar, is not showing Jimmy Kimmel Live. It's blatant censorship. And outrageous. Good to have you back, Jimmy.‚Äù

When Aniston dropped by Kimmel's show last year, the host introduced her as ‚Äúone of the most loved human beings in all the world,‚Äù after calling her ‚Äúa legendary star of screens big and small.‚Äù The 56-year-old was on to promote her children's book, ‚ÄúClydeo Takes a Bit Out of Life.‚Äù

Aniston brought her rescue dog by the same name along, and talked about a special project she started called The Clydeo Fund. She explained, ‚ÄúI started that because I care about helping animals and the dogs, shelter dogs.‚Äù She said the book if for ‚Äúhelping kids find their passions,‚Äù and lamented that ‚Äúkids today are so distracted by those little telephones.‚Äù

The ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù 49 premiere wasted no time in shaking up the game. In Fiji's sweltering heat, the castaways battled through their first challenge, formed tentative alliances, and marched into their opening Tribal Council‚Äîwhere one player's torch was snuffed, becoming the first to leave the game. With host Jeff Probst guiding the action, ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù 49 proved from the very start that every second counts.

During the immunity challenge, all three tribes compete for safety from tonight's tribal council. Only one will be sent to elimination. Hina and Ali win immunity while Kele is sent to tribal council tonight. One of the members of Kele will be going home tonight.

The men of Kele tribe are targeting Nicole. While others are pointing fingers toward Annie. The votes follow suite and the first player voted out at Tribal Council becomes Nicole.

To to be updated with Tribal Council Results.

The season opened with the introduction of three tribes: Kele, Hina, and Uli. The 18 new contestants arrived by boat, each carrying ambition, strategies, and a lifetime of stories. Among them: Kimberly ‚ÄúAnnie‚Äù Davis, a musician-entrepreneur from Austin; Alex Moore, a political communications director from Evanston, Illinois; Nate Moore, a former Marvel Studios executive; and many others with unique backgrounds.

Long before the first torch was extinguished, the premiere revealed a behind-the-scenes shake-up: two original castaways violated pre-game rules and were removed, forcing the producers to bring in two alternates‚ÄîJason Treul and Michelle ‚ÄúMC‚Äù Chukwujekwu‚Äîjust 12 hours before filming. This unprecedented move added extra intrigue to the early dynamics. The alternates entered with fresh eyes and fewer expectations, though not necessarily fewer risks.

Once tribes were settled, producers dropped a punishing marooning challenge: castaways raced to secure essential supplies and establish camp dominance. From there they battled for reward advantages, sowed seeds of trust (and doubt), and jockeyed for position ahead of the first Tribal Council. Tensions simmered in the humidity, and alliances began whispering.

‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù 49 carries an added layer of anticipation because it serves as the final season before the franchise's landmark 50th installment. Fans and producers alike recognize that the buildup to ‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù 50 will bring heightened expectations, major twists, and a celebration of the show's legacy. With that in mind, every move in season 49 feels magnified, as players not only fight for the title of Sole Survivor but also set the stage for what promises to be one of the biggest chapters in the series' history. 

Adding to the buzz, two castaways‚ÄîRizo ‚ÄúRiz God‚Äù Velovic and Savannah Louie‚Äîare already confirmed to return for season 50, making their performances this year even more closely watched.

We have the Finals details below for who is performing tonight on ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù 2025.

The Semifinals took place last week on ‚ÄúAGT‚Äù 2025. America voted, and six acts moved on to the Finals, joining the four Golden Buzzer acts from the Quarterfinals. Now it's time for those 10 acts to perform for America's votes on Tuesday, September 23, at 8/7c on NBC.

For tonight's episode, the 10 finalists will be taking the stage one last time. These 10 acts will all be fighting for America's votes and a chance to be named the winner of ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù season 20.

Only one act can win it all, but who will it be? Check out the acts performing tonight on ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù season 20 right here.

Turner is an improv rapper who amazes me every performance. While he seems to doubt he should be in the Finals, America voted, and this guy, I feel, is going to amaze us tonight with what he does.

Sanchez was eliminated before performing in the Semifinals on the first season of ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent.‚Äù Now, she is back and ready to perform in the ‚ÄúAGT‚Äù finale for season 20, while also being nine months pregnant. The season 11 runner-up on ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù is ready to take it all the way for a win.

Jourdan was one of Howie Mandel's Golden Buzzers from the audition rounds. He then got food poisoning during the Quarterfinals, but powered through and has now made it to the Finals.

We all know that choirs usually do well on ‚ÄúAGT,‚Äù so here we are with another choir in the Finals. Simon Cowell definitely seems to be a fan of theirs, which could help them in their fight to win this week.

This act was one of Simon's Golden Buzzer acts during the audition rounds. Everyone was then shocked when Howie didn't give them one in the Quarterfinals. However, they have made it to the ‚ÄúAGT‚Äù finale, and I think they have a real shot at being named the winner.

Mama Duke blew up on TikTok after her audition video went crazy online. She then came out and sang another original song for the Quarterfinals. Mel B loved it and hit the Golden Buzzer for her, sending Mama Duke straight to these Finals.

Another Golden Buzzer act, as Micah Palace impressed Simon during the Quarterfinals, to get him to hit the buzzer for him. Simon felt Micah's original song could be the anthem for the World Cup when it comes to North America.

While there are a lot of singers on ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù season 20, we do need those danger acts. Sirca Marea provides that, as this aerial act does such dangerous tricks while flying in the air. They added blindfolds for the Semifinals.

It's been a while since we've seen Steve Ray Ladson on ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù 2025. He performed the first week of the Quarterfinals and got Sofia Vergara to hit the Golden Buzzer for him, sending him to the Finals thanks to his original song.

This dance group wanted to impress Mel B during their Quarterfinal performance since she was confused during their audition. She was impressed, but Howie was impressed even more and hit the Golden Buzzer for them, sending them straight to the Finals.

Catch all of these acts tonight at 8/7c on NBC, as the Finals on ‚ÄúAmerica's Got Talent‚Äù season 20 take place.

The Los Angeles Festival of Movies (LAFM), heading into its third year April 9 ‚Äì 12 in 2026, has parted ways with MUBI as a presenting sponsor, as LAFM shared on Instagram Thursday.

The festival launched in 2024 with MUBI as a sponsor to bring the best of independent film to Los Angeles over one weekend. MUBI has been subjected to internal and external strife since receiving a $100 million investment from the venture capital company Sequoia, which has also supported companies tied to Israeli military technology amid the war on Gaza. 

 










MUBI CEO Efe Cakarel said in August that the distributor and streamer's profits have no relationship to other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. MUBI secured the investment at the end of May 2025, around the time it acquired the Jennifer Lawrence-starring film ‚ÄúDie My Love‚Äù out of Cannes for a reported $24 million. MUBI declined to comment on the LAFM news, and referred back to Cakarel's statement from August.

Filmmakers and MUBI staff have since implored the company to drop its relationship with Sequoia, with a request to remove Sequoia partner Andrew Reed from MUBI's board. 

 










MUBI's fall slate includes, along with ‚ÄúDie My Love,‚Äù Kelly Reichardt's ‚ÄúThe Mastermind‚Äù and Jim Jarmusch's Venice Golden Lion winner ‚ÄúFather Mother Sister Brother.‚Äù At the Venice Film Festival this year, Jarmusch expressed discontent over MUBI's relationship with Sequoia and said he'd had conversations with its leaders about next steps.

Back in August, IndieWire obtained a letter signed by roughly half of MUBI's staff sharing frustrations over the investment. Cakarel said that Sequoia is a minor investor in the company with no oversight on programming or distribution. Expected on October 15 is an internal policy at MUBI, to be shared publicly, on guidelines to ethical investments.

Micah Gottlieb and Sarah Winshall co-founded the L.A. Festival of Movies as a response to the 2018 discontinuation of the L.A. Film Festival. Gottlieb's film non-profit Mezzanine also serves as a sponsor.

Here's the festival's full statement, as shared on Instagram, below. IndieWire has reached out to MUBI for comment.

In the spirit of continuing to build trust and transparency with our community, we want to share that LAFM has parted ways with our presenting sponsor MUBI, on account of its financial ties to Sequoia Capital, a company invested in Israeli military technology and the ongoing campaign of genocide in Gaza.
 










This was not a decision taken lightly. LAFM is still a brand-new festival run by a fledgling nonprofit organization, and we are still largely dependent on corporate sponsorships and donations. This decision definitively puts us behind on our fundraising goals for next year.

With MUBI, we were able to work with a marketing team that understood our mission of bold curation, and supported us in cultivating dynamic spaces for cutting-edge arthouse and independent cinema. We are now actively seeking sponsors and donors who share those values.

When we began in 2024, we arrived in an incredibly precarious environment for independent cinema. We planted a seed in a city dominated by the commercial film industry, in order to build a foundation for the kind of film culture we want to perpetuate.

Like many, we have been witnessing the genocide in real time on our social media feeds. And like many, we question our material ability to move the needle as a cultural arts organization. But we do not want to remain indifferent.

We are so lucky to proceed with intention, curiosity and warmth. It is these values that we want to imbue to our partners and to our audience.

The support that we get from you goes a long way. 

Please consider supporting us, and help us make it to 2026.

When Paul Thomas Anderson‚Äòs previous film ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza‚Äù was released by MGM and United Artists Releasing in 2021, the narrative surrounding the movie was that it was an example of then-MGM film chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy spending a premium on an auteur director ‚Äî and one who didn't necessarily have a clear box office track record.

Produced on a budget of $40 million, ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza‚Äù made only $34 million worldwide, including just $17.3 million domestic. For another filmmaker who doesn't have 11 Oscar nominations, that might put a damper on what they could command moving forward. 

 










But for PTA's latest ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another,‚Äù Anderson is now commanding a budget that's not just exponentially higher than any he's worked with ‚Äî a report in Variety had it at $115 million, but IndieWire understands it to actually be $130 million ‚Äî it's also higher than anything he's grossed to date at the box office. Not a coincidence, De Luca and Abdy are back at the helm again, this time at Warner Bros., offering him the keys to the castle.

All that was at least the narrative early in the year, when De Luca and Abdy had a few costly flops in a row, namely the ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù sequel, and the duo was staring down the pike of another expensive auteur passion project in Ryan Coogler's ‚ÄúSinners.‚Äù The performance of that film shut people up, and the studio's incredible hot streak that also includes ‚ÄúFinal Destination: Bloodlines,‚Äù ‚ÄúWeapons,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring: Last Rites,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuperman‚Äù has given them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to PTA, at least for now. 

But the question is warranted. Anderson's most successful movie in his 10-film career is ‚ÄúThere Will Be Blood,‚Äù the 2007 Best Picture nominee and Best Actor winner, which grossed $76.9 million worldwide according to Comscore, a little more than half of what ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù costs. 

For all his other films, only ‚ÄúPhantom Thread‚Äù has crossed the $50 million worldwide mark, and that was just barely at $52.2 million. ‚ÄúMagnolia‚Äù clocks in at No. 3 with $48 million in 1999, ‚ÄúBoogie Nights‚Äù made $43 million in 1997, and ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza's‚Äù $34 million comes in fifth.

The last and only time PTA worked with Warner Bros. Pictures (‚ÄúMagnolia‚Äù and ‚ÄúBoogie Nights‚Äù were New Line Cinema releases, now a division of WB) was PTA's worst-performing film (not including his barely-distributed debut ‚ÄúHard Eight‚Äù), 2014's ‚ÄúInherent Vice,‚Äù which made just $14.8 million worldwide. Coincidentally, ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù is ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by another Thomas Pynchon novel rather than a direct adaptation. 

 










What sets ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù apart from all of those movies is the scale at which Warner Bros. will release it. Having skipped the festivals (PTA just isn't a fan), Warner Bros. is positioning ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù as a commercial property and will give it a wide release. Every Anderson movie to date has received a platform release in an amount of theaters you can only count on one hand (OK, ‚ÄúMagnolia‚Äù got a whopping 7 screens). Comparing opening day results for ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù to anything in his repertoire will be apples and oranges. And when those films did expand, the most screens he's ever been given were just shy of 2,000 for ‚ÄúLicorice Pizza.‚Äù ‚ÄúBattle‚Äù should easily surpass that.

It's fitting too because ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù is arguably unlike any film Anderson has made, the rare film of his to be set in the 21st century and play like a relentless action movie. The $130 million budget certainly looks like it's all there on the screen in the film's elaborate riot scenes and chase sequences on foot and on wheels. And short of Tom Cruise, Anderson has arguably never had an A-lister on Leonardo DiCaprio's level starring, so his own box office cache shouldn't hurt.

Warner Bros. is also following a playbook that it executed to perfection with ‚ÄúSinners,‚Äù releasing ‚ÄúOne Battle After Another‚Äù on a plethora of film formats and premium offerings and getting Anderson out there to explain the value of it. Suffice it to say, Anderson has never had that IMAX bump either. All of that is a sign Warner Bros. is banking that audiences will feel this movie is one you have to see in a theater.

For his latest directorial outing, Ben Stiller has tackled the toughest of tough subjects: his own family. ‚ÄúStiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost‚Äù is, on its surface, a very intimate look at the life and work of Stiller's comedic genius parents Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, but even in the film‚Äòs first trailer, it's clear that the doc goes beyond that (already quite intriguing!) promise.

In the film, ‚ÄúStiller tells the story of his parents, comedy icons Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, exploring their impact both on popular culture and at home, where the lines between creativity, family, life and art often blurred. In the process, Stiller turns the camera on himself and his family to examine Jerry and Anne's enormous influence on their lives, and the generational lessons we all can learn from those we love.‚Äù

The AppleTV+ documentary will premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 5, with other screenings to follow throughout the festival's run.

The New York Film Festival's own synopsis provides deeper exploration of the film, noting that ‚Äúafter Anne and Jerry passed away in 2015 and 2020, respectively, Stiller dug into the vast treasure trove of recordings, footage, letters, and other ephemera with which they documented their personal and professional lives. These extraordinary archives are the foundation of this immensely moving ‚Äî and, of course, very funny ‚Äî documentary, beautifully directed by Stiller and edited by Adam Kurnitz, which charts, with love and candor, the challenges and insecurities that are part of any show-business family's essential makeup.‚Äù

 










Stiller himself stars in the film, along with his sister Amy Stiller, his wife Christine Taylor-Stiller, his children Ella and Quinlin Stiller, plus Christopher Walken and Stephen Colbert. The doc is produced by Red Hour Films' Stiller and John Lesher, as well as Geoffrey Richman and Lizz Morhaim, with XTR's Bryn Mooser, Justin Lacob and Kathryn Everett, as well as Tony Hsieh and Andy Hsieh serving as executive producers. 

‚ÄúStiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost‚Äù will be released in select theaters on Friday, October 17 and will start streaming globally on Apple TV+ on Friday, October 24. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Kathryn Bigelow is back with her first movie in eight years, the nuclear missile thriller ‚ÄúA House of Dynamite,‚Äù which premiered to raves at Venice, having already been acquired by Netflix in advance. The trailer for ‚ÄúA House of Dynamite‚Äù is here, and it is gripping. Watch it below.

Senior situation room duty officer Rebecca Ferguson (here doing such a great American accent you'll forget about Ilsa Faust immediately) receives shocking news: An intercontinental ballistic missile has appeared over Asia with a trajectory that appears to take it to a Midwest city in the U.S. And, given how fast ICBMs travel, reaching suborbital altitudes, it'll reach that target in 18 minutes. The entire film that follows plays out by toggling back and forth among myriad different perspectives, including Idris Elba as POTUS, in an ever-growing ensemble during those 18 minutes.

The cast also includes Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, and Jonah Hauer-King, with Greta Lee and Jason Clarke. It comes from a script by Noah Oppenheim, the former president of NBC News who also wrote Pablo Larrain's ‚ÄúJackie‚Äù as well as co-created the Robert De Niro-led Netflix series ‚ÄúZero Day,‚Äù about a devastating cyberattack on the U.S.

IndieWire Executive Editor Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his review that the ‚Äúhorrifically gripping and hopeless‚Äù film ‚Äúwill ruin your day.‚Äù In the best possible way, as he also gave it an A- score and a Critic's Pick, when reviewing it out of the 2025 Venice Film Festival earlier this month.

‚Äú‚ÄòA House of Dynamite' moves at a whirring gradient with an ever-widening ensemble ‚Äî which includes Greta Lee, Jason Clarke, and Moses Ingram as various cogs ‚Äî that can be challenging to keep track of,‚Äù Lattanzio continued. ‚ÄúThe film essentially takes place entirely within an under-20-minute timeline, showing the same events from a shuffling deck of points of view. Bigelow's grindingly focused direction is peerless here, with her already established as a frank and fearless chronicler of American political ambiguity in films like ‚ÄòThe Hurt Locker' and ‚ÄòZero Dark Thirty,' and with ‚ÄòA House of Dynamite' seemingly completing a trilogy about the collapse of the American dream in war times.‚Äù

‚ÄúHardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie ‚Äî with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole ‚Äî also wants to shake you out of your slumber.‚Äù

 










‚ÄúA House of Dynamite‚Äù opens in select U.S. theaters on Friday, October 10 and will stream on Netflix starting on Friday, October 24. Watch the trailer below.

‚ÄúHell is waiting for you. I'll be your nightmare forever,‚Äù Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is told at gunpoint in one of the most thrilling sequences of Kiyoshi Kurosawa‚Äòs career in ‚ÄúCloud.‚Äù

It's a line, though, that could apply across the Japanese filmmaker's work, whether the specters in the machine stalking a post-Y2K digital realm in ‚ÄúPulse‚Äù or the elusive serial killer who seems to operate by hypnosis in ‚ÄúCure,‚Äù one of the very best horror movies ever made.

‚ÄúCloud‚Äù is Kurosawa's first movie to weld his techno anxieties to a Western framework, as his movie about a sociopath-adjacent internet reseller and hoarder culminates in the grandest action set piece yet from the filmmaker. And it turns out, Kurosawa intended ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù as homage to American action thrillers like Sam Peckinpah's ‚ÄúStraw Dogs.‚Äù

IndieWire exclusively announces that ‚ÄúCloud,‚Äù which played U.S. theaters over the summer and was Japan's submission for the 2025 Best International Feature Oscar, will begin streaming on the Criterion Channel on Tuesday, October 7. The film will premiere alongside a new interview with Kurosawa, part of Criterion's Meet the Filmmakers series, and IndieWire shares an exclusive clip from that interview in the video above.

 










That same day, ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù will also become available for TVOD rentals on Apple TV, Prime Video, and Fandango at Home. A home-video release will follow next February.

‚ÄúI had the desire to shoot the kind of action scenes often seen in American films. However, I knew that to do something like that for Japanese audiences, I would have to choose a completely different type of character to focus on. Like a yakuza, a police officer, or the Japan Self-Defense Force. I really didn't want to do that. That's why I wanted the protagonist to be an average guy who typically avoids heated confrontation but gets caught up in what could be called a shootout,‚Äù Kurosawa says in the clip. 

‚ÄúA protagonist who has no connection to violence whatsoever, yet ultimately becomes a participant in a kind of carnage. When it comes to such a story, I immediately thought of ‚ÄòStraw Dogs.' It's a gruesome action film ‚Ä¶ with not a single positive thing about it. I don't reference Straw Dogs in every scene, but everyone who sees ‚ÄòCloud' immediately notices the resemblance. Since this is a film where people who have never even held a handgun engage in what you would call action‚Ä¶ and murder each other, I knew from the start it'd never be popcorn entertainment. What would happen if someone who had never considered or experienced such a thing suddenly held something that could kill another person?‚Äù

 










IndieWire's David Ehrlich also raved about ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù circa Venice last year, writing, ‚Äú‚ÄòCloud' updates the filmmaker's signature focus for a modern world that's enmeshed in an infinite (but invisible) network of small cruelties and bitter grievances ‚Äî a network so ubiquitous that even the better angels of our nature might drive us straight into hell. Almost too mundane to care about until it becomes impossible to stop watching for much the same reason, this riveting and highly unusual shoot-em-up finds Kurosawa returning to his roots, only to discover that psychological terror isn't quite as abstract as it used to be.‚Äù

Netflix Animation has already had a very successful 2025, with ‚ÄúKPop Demon Hunters‚Äù becoming the sleeper hit film of the entire summer and a major cultural phenomenon. Now, the streamer hopes to repeat that success with their major animated release of the fall, ‚ÄúIn Your Dreams.‚Äù The first trailer for the film, a fantasy comedy kids adventure in the vein of '80s films like ‚ÄúLabyrinth‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Neverending Story,‚Äù shows off the next chapter in the streamer's animated slate.

Directed by former Pixar animator Alex Woo in his feature directorial debut, ‚ÄúIn Your Dreams‚Äù focuses on two young siblings, Stevie (voiced by Jolie Hoang-Rappaport) and Elliot (Elias Janssen), whose parents (voiced by Cristin Milioti and Simu Liu) are experiencing tension in their relationship. As Stevie stresses over the possibility that they will split, she and Elliot discover a strange book telling the story of the fabled Sandman, who can makes a person's deepest wish come true. The book grants them the ability to enter into the dream world, where they venture on a quest to find the Sandman and attempt to save their parents' marriage. Other voice actors in the film include Craig Robinson as Elliot's toy giraffe Baloney Tony, as well as Omid Djalili, Gia Carides, SungWon Cho, and Zachary Noah Piser.

In 1994, on an album called Minimal Nation, Detroit's Robert Hood stripped Motor City funk to its bones. Most of its tracks were made of little more than lithe, swinging drum programming and solitary synth patches that glistened like oil slicks; it's generally considered the origin point for what came to be known as minimal techno. In February of the same year, more than 4,000 miles away, a taciturn young Finn named Mika Vainio took an even sharper scalpel to the same ideas. His debut album, Metri, couldn't be more skeletal if it were a laboratory specimen. Where there are drum machines, they merely thump and hiss; his custom-built tone generators glisten like icicles and roar like buzz bombs. If Hood's album represented minimal techno's ground zero, Vainio's was its ground √ò.

Vainio would go on to become best known as one half of Pan Sonic, a duo (with Ilpo V√§is√§nen) that, from the early 1990s until its dissolution in 2009, waged a scorched-earth campaign against electronic music's staid conventions. But it was Vainio's √ò alias‚Äîafter a symbol signifying absence in a number of contexts, from math and geometry to linguistics‚Äîthat would be his longest-running project, evolving from those brutalist techno origins to encompass a wide array of electronic techniques and soundscapes.

In addition to many solo and collaborative albums under his own name, Vainio released eight albums as √ò until 2017, when he plunged from a cliff in France. He had been at work on a ninth √ò album for three years at the time of his death. Working from notes he left behind, Tommi Gr√∂nlund, his friend and founder of the S√§hk√∂ label, and Rikke Lundgreen, Vainio's former partner, compiled the material into Sysivalo, his final album. (According to Lundgreen, Vainio had already decided upon the album concept, title, track order, and even cover art.) The title‚Äîa portmanteau meaning something like ‚Äúcharcoal light‚Äù‚Äîis evocative and fitting. Vainio's music often felt like an apocalyptic clash between being and nothingness, but on Sysivalo, darkness and light flow together in ways that are unusual for his work, evoking a dynamic mixture of vulnerability, tenderness, and grace.

Vainio's music could sometimes sound like he had jacked directly into an electrical substation, but his palette here is soft and tufted. Distant thunder takes on a purplish pastel hue, misted with white noise. There are few hard attacks and even fewer moments where the levels bleed red. A bite-sized quality distinguishes these 20 tracks, which run shorter than he typically worked. Vainio's enduring interest in capturing the vastness of sound is distilled into pieces that feel both atmospheric and tactile, like cupping small clouds of colored smoke in your hands. Yet there's little doubt that Sysivalo is envisioned as an album‚Äîa single, overarching work, rather than a collection of stray pieces. A ruminative mood pervades the hour, and tones and themes frequently repeat. The drawn-out foghorn blast that opens the album with ‚ÄúEtude 1‚Äù reappears, whittled to a fine point, in ‚ÄúEtude 5,‚Äù and turns up again nine tracks later in ‚ÄúAine‚Äù (‚Äúsubstance‚Äù), threading the album with a faint sense of deja vu.

The etudes that open the album establish the record's pensive air. Shadowy rumbles dissipate into spectral shapes; pliable, chalky tones are ringed with a weird, metallic aura. The music is abstract and largely formless, yet the way sounds move through time‚Äîgrowing, morphing, decaying‚Äîgives it an unmistakable sense of purpose and direction. What seems at first like a dark, impenetrable palette quickly opens up to reveal a world of contrasts: now his tones are gaseous and floating, now they're thick slabs of concrete.

Within these contrasts lie some of the most ‚Äúmusical‚Äù moments of Vainio's career. ‚ÄúEtude 4‚Äù begins with what sounds like a punishingly low chord from Sunn O))), the drone-metal group of his friend and collaborator Stephen O'Malley. Then a clean-toned, lightly flanged guitar rises out of the murk, resembling something from the Cure at their gloomiest. In ‚ÄúSylvannus,‚Äù we hear the doleful tones of what might be an actual synthesizer, not just buzzing electronics‚Äîa rarity for Vainio, and the contemplative melody it plays is even rarer.

On three tracks, he revisits his techno roots. ‚ÄúT-Bahn‚Äù (presumably a companion piece to ‚ÄúS-bahn‚Äù and ‚ÄúU-bahn,‚Äù from 2008's Oleva) evokes Metri's Millsian chimes and glowering bass throb, sounding at once heavier and more diaphanous than ever, and he returns to similar sounds several tracks later. The bass of ‚ÄúDual‚Äù is so massive, it seems to suck the air out of the room; the reverberant squiggles of ‚ÄúUrsa‚Äù suggest wraiths lighting up the distant corners of a catacomb.

For all its intimidating scale and precision sonics, Vainio's music was, first and foremost, an expressive vehicle, rather than a drily experimental practice. He drew his titles from metaphysics and science but also everyday events in his own life; the sleeve of his 2011 guitar album Life (...It Eats You Up)‚Äîwith titles like ‚ÄúIn Silence a Scream Takes a Heart,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd Give Us Our Daily Humiliation,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpen Up and Bleed‚Äù‚Äîfeatured photographs taken after a drunken accident with a knife. Vainio suffered from alcoholism and depression; some of the stories shared by his family and friends are harrowing. But while it is certainly possible to hear much of his music as bleak or charged with negative energy, Sysivalo resists being reduced to one-dimensional readings. At times, there are moments of something that almost resembles hope.

‚ÄúKohtalo‚Äù (‚Äúdestiny‚Äù) is among the quietest pieces in Vainio's catalog, an 84-second miniature for unaccompanied music box. Toward the end, a dog barks in the distance. You can tell by the way its bark reverberates off nearby buildings that it is nighttime, probably a residential neighborhood in a European city‚Äîa scene of domestic stillness. It reminds me of something his father, Kalle Vainio, said of his son after he died. He recalled that Mika had once told him that he didn't plan to start a family, given the demands of life on the road. ‚ÄúMika's autobiographical hints are very quiet, they are rarely underlined,‚Äù his father continued. ‚ÄúIt is possible that some of his songs are lullabies for children whose father he could have been.‚Äù

‚ÄúLoputon‚Äù‚Äîwhose title translates as ‚Äúendless‚Äù‚Äîcloses the album with a startling sense of finality. It begins with a microtonal fog; the cloud clears, and bright, pinging tones drip down, an echo from his earliest records, as though in conversation with his younger self. The bass resembles a church organ; the pace is slow and ceremonial. The song comes to rest on a shimmering minor-key chord‚Äîthe kind of ending that leaves no doubt that it is the finale‚Äîand the chord fades out, leaving only the sound of blowing wind. If, as Lundgreen says, Vainio finalized the track order before he died, then we know that he meant for ‚ÄúLoputon‚Äù to conclude the record. Nobody knows whether he intended Sysivalo as his final album. But ‚ÄúLoputon,‚Äù like the album as a whole, makes for a deeply moving swan song‚Äîa soft yet determined gleam holding fast against the darkness.

In 1998, the Darla label released a 12-inch EP compilation called Drum & Bliss, putting a name to a style that had been woven into the indie-pop fabric‚Äîone part whispery near-ambient bedroom pop, one part breakbeats. The fierce ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù break that served as the foundation for jungle had been around long enough that it almost seemed comforting, so why not fuse rhythms of its ilk with music that was as soft and cuddly as a teddy bear? Around this time, the Icelandic quartet m√∫m recorded its earliest music together. These experiments, some of which were later collected on the 2012 compilation Early Birds, show a young band‚Äîtwo guys, Gunnar √ñrn Tynes and √ñrvar Sm√°rason, and twin sisters Gy√∞a and Krist√≠n Anna Valt√Ωsd√≥ttir‚Äîworking in the drum & bliss mode, chopping beats with a butter knife while folding in twinkly instruments that sound rescued from a toddler's box of toys.

If circumstances had been different, perhaps m√∫m would have risen no further than Junior Varsity KM and Technicolor, two artists from that Darla comp. But around the turn of the millennium, music fans of a certain stripe, desperate for the next album by Radiohead, were losing their minds over Sigur R√≥s; the hunger for another experimentally minded band from Iceland was strong. That may have led to more people checking out m√∫m's debut‚Äîreleased in 1999, but most people didn't hear it until 2001‚Äîthan would have otherwise. Which worked out well, because Yesterday Was Dramatic ‚Äì Today Is OK was excellent, with intricate music-box IDM rounded out with contributions from friends including strings from future Oscar winner Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. To my ear, they never got anywhere near that peak again. Through the 2000s, m√∫m's records became increasingly song-based and were sometimes nauseatingly infantile. The Valt√Ωsd√≥ttir sisters left, the band became more of a collective, and then m√∫m went dormant after 2013's Smilewound.

The first m√∫m album in 13 years, History of Silence, seems designed to situate the band's electro-folk in a more relaxed and mature setting, bringing five additional players into the mix alongside founders Tynes and Sm√°rason. Here and there, it works. The production of the opening ‚ÄúMiss You Dance‚Äù is alternately lush and spare, with a handful of piano notes, a repeating tone that sounds like a utility pole cable being thwacked by a hammer, a sparkly string arrangement, and subtle bits of processing. It's homey and lived in, more clear-eyed than anything from m√∫m's initial run. And while the tune isn't particularly memorable, the layered voices carry an appealing indie-pop warmth that brings to mind Sufjan Stevens.

The arrangements, mostly acoustic with a pinch of electronics, are the best part of the record. We get tinkly bits of piano where you can hear the wood, beds of faintly glitchy percussion, and the general atmosphere of dusty chamber pop with a light digital overlay. There's air and space between the instruments, and even though the album is brief, it's unhurried. The instrumental ‚ÄúA Dry Heart Needs No Winding‚Äù is lovely, adding a dreamy reverb-kissed guitar, what sounds like a bass clarinet, and a squelchy synth that could be beamed in from an early-'60s vision of the future. ‚ÄúOnly Songbirds Have a Sweet Tooth‚Äù is something like early Decemberists or Andrew Bird subjected to circuit bending.

But the rich sound palette and careful assembly of the instruments can't compensate for the broader lack of melody. And when a song lodges in memory, it's often for the wrong reason. The way in which m√∫m uses voices seems highly specific, deliberate, and crafted for a certain effect. But if you aren't wired a certain way, the singing is hard to take. I like my share of whispery twee and have a decent tolerance for age regression as a creative strategy. But when a woman's voice enters ‚ÄúI Like to Shake‚Äù‚Äîwide-eyed, mouse-like, with a nervous quiver‚Äîit's so mannered it pulls me out of the record completely.

As you can tell from the song titles‚Äî‚ÄúMild at Heart,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Dry Heart Needs No Winding‚Äù‚Äîm√∫m are infatuated with the innocence of childhood, and it can work in small doses. When they overdo it, as they do on roughly half the songs here, the effect ranges from slightly queasy to deeply irritating. For all the refinement and musical growth on History of Silence, the aesthetic hurdle in place during the band's first go around remains.

When Angel and Lulu Prost were kids in St. Louis, Missouri, they played in a family band at church on Sundays. Now the twin tricksters make music so aggro it could jumpscare the pope. Frost Children's new album, SISTER, is packed with tracks that sound devised in a VO2 max lab to push people into excruciating physical exertion. This is a duo who grew up on brostep and Krewella and have spent their career shitting on taste boundaries: Their output to date has been consistently peculiar and amusingly all over the place, from a Super Smash Bros. theme rewired into hyperpop to ‚ÄúBob Dylan,‚Äù a spoken-word composition that imagines the iconic songwriter encountering a Jack Harlow-branded Sweetgreen salad. SISTER cuts the shit and streamlines their sound into a fat hit of DJ dopamine. It's their bid for stardom, with the exuberant euphoria dulled only by the sense that this has been done so many times over.

SISTER throws back to the era of Mad Decent Boat Parties and EDC livestreams on desktop YouTube. This is music for mammoth festival grounds, a post-ironic pastiche of the early 2010s. Frost Children dial the rickety rollercoaster of EDM pop to Kingda Ka chaos: ecstatic rises and drops of death. Some tracks need NSFW warnings, because they'll make you wanna smash your desk: ‚ÄúElectric‚Äù summons an earth-shakingly thunderous bassline and ‚ÄúControl‚Äù throttles with the furor of a cyborg firing plasma beams out of its eyes/ The album reaches peak geek when they let the beats wig out. ‚ÄúDon't make me cry‚Äù explodes like they're keymashing the DAW. Highlight ‚ÄúRalph Lauren‚Äù is one of the few sounds that feels genuinely new here, a chic circus of pop and squelch and sleazy synths. Babymorocco hops between frenetic claps and kicks like he's limboing off nine drinks.

This kind of YOLO EDM-pop was always hyper-expressive and hyper-surface: It simulated the feeling of a love so powerful, a sensation so large, that nothing else mattered. Frost Children's update to the party-pop template attempts to give it a genuine, tender core; they're emo kids at heart and they embroider the ballistic drops with anxious reflections and half-hooks about crying for help. It's a strange contrast‚Äîa cocktail of delirious fun and angsty distress. On ‚ÄúBound2U,‚Äù Angel and Lulu snarl at a lover they can't quit over a beat that sounds like an acoustic guitar exploded by synth TNT. Analog outlier ‚ÄúSister‚Äù flashes back to when the duo was 17 and their relationship was on the fritz. Sometimes the delivery comes across unnecessarily abrasive, like an MC who can't stop interrupting and monologues over the climax. Their production intoxicates most with the more careless pop anthems‚Äî‚ÄúRadio‚Äù is so punchy you can almost smell Kim Petras' fruity lipstick.

But even the most pleasant songs lack that one genius earworm that makes something like Zedd's ‚ÄúClarity‚Äù (or modern EDM peer Ninajirachi's recent starburst of a song ‚ÄúAll I Am‚Äù) so ebullient. ‚ÄúWhat Is Forever For‚Äù sounds whiny and way too predictable‚Äîall future bass-y synths and hooks that scream bittersweet, but in a way that makes you think of a TV ad targeting millennials wistful for their Chainsmokers years; you can see the crystal-shard shower of the drop coming from a mile away. ‚ÄúBlue Eyes‚Äù and ‚Äú2 L√òVE‚Äù coast on blissed-out vocal chops like something from the Majestic Casual archives. At times it feels like Frost Children are camouflaging their natural eclecticism: They could pull off something as unhinged as Skrillex's ‚ÄúCinema‚Äù remix, but SISTER is more straightforward, a glassy garden of echoing vox and dewy-eyed dreaminess.

The low ebbs detract from an album that's otherwise difficult to resist bouncing to. SISTER adds to what has become, depending on your perspective, an EDM-pop renaissance or an exhausting clone swamp: the flood of electro-pyros like The Hellp, 2hollis, Ninajirachi, Bassvictim, Effie, and Suzy Sheer; a new generation of producers, like Underscores, whose brains were broken by Skrillex and Porter Robinson. Fans already invested in the Frost Children story may find they can project intention onto the duo's personalized throwbacks. For the rest of us? There's already so much of this stuff, and Frost Children have made some more.

Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged the threats made by Donald Trump after his late-night show returned on Tuesday night, describing the president as an ‚ÄúEighties movie-style bully.‚Äù


	On the latest episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel did a line-by-line takedown of Trump's Truth Social post, which suggested he planned to sue ABC and accused the comedian of being ‚Äúyet another arm‚Äù of the Democratic Party. ‚ÄúI can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,‚Äù Trump wrote in the post.


	‚ÄúYou can't believe they gave me my job back?‚Äù Kimmel responded. ‚ÄúI can't believe we gave you your job back.‚Äù


	‚ÄúWhy would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat garbage,‚Äù Trump's post continued. 


	‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù Kimmel responded. ‚ÄúThere's the threat again. This time straight from FCC-biscuit's mouth. He says, ‚ÄòI think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 million dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers!' Only Donald Trump would try to prove he wasn't threatening ABC by threatening ABC. And you almost have to feel sorry for the people who work for him who try to clean up the messes.‚Äù

	











	Trump's post closed with, ‚ÄúLet Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad ratings.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd he does know bad ratings,‚Äù Kimmel said. ‚ÄúHe has some of the worst ratings any president has ever had. So on behalf of all of us, welcome to the crappy ratings club, Mr. President.‚Äù

	











	Kimmel continued, ‚ÄúNext, he'll try to sue us. And I want to say good luck with that, because we thought about it, we packed the courts, and we have a surprise ace up our sleeve: Mr. Judge Steve Harvey.‚Äù


	The host also responded to claims that ‚ÄúI go too hard on Donald Trump, to the point where there are still a lot of people who think I should be pulled off the air for making fun of Donald Trump.‚Äù 


	‚ÄúSo I want to explain: I talk about Trump more than anything because he's a bully,‚Äù Kimme said. ‚ÄúI don't like bullies ‚Äì I played the clarinet in high school. I just don't like them. Donald Trump is an old-fashioned Eighties movie-style bully taking your lunch money. And if you give it to him once, he'll take it again. Two things he loves: lunch and money.‚Äù

	He added, ‚ÄúRooting for this bully, I don't care what side you're on, it's like rooting for Biff from Back to the Future. Literally, Donald Trump was the model for Biff in Back to the Future! And this is who people are cheering for? I don't know about you, I'm with Marty McFly.‚Äù  


Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to air on ABC on Tuesday night after a weeklong pause. Last week, the network abruptly suspended the long-running late-night series, citing an ‚Äúill-timed and thus insensitive‚Äù monologue in which the comedian criticized right-wingers for trying to ‚Äúscore political points‚Äù off the murder of Charlie Kirk. Kimmel kept quiet in the days that followed, while Hollywood raised its voice on his behalf.

	Last night, Kimmel criticized the Trump administration's attempts to pull him from the air. ‚ÄúI barely paid attention in school, but one thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like is anti-American,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I am so glad we have some solidarity on that from the right and the left and from those in the middle, like Joe Rogan. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we'll even find another one. Maybe we can get a little bit closer together.‚Äù


	The late-night show broke records during its return. The episode drew 6.3 million viewers, about triple its average ratings, despite a quarter of ABC stations in the U.S. not airing the show. A further 19 million watched Kimmel's emotional nearly 28-minute monologue on social media, with the number still climbing.

O
n April 26, 1973, a young writer got his first article published in Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúIt's been four years since Poco played their first gig at the Troubadour and everybody made a point of saying the band would be The Next Big Thing,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúFive albums and many tours later, Poco is still on the verge.‚Äù 


	Despite a few hits in the late Seventies, Poco did not become The Next Big Thing. But the article launched the career of Cameron Crowe, who was just 15 years old at the time. Before long, he was writing cover stories for the magazine, hanging with David Bowie on the Sunset Strip, flying cross-country with Led Zeppelin, and going fishing with Lynyrd Skynyrd. 


	A fictionalized account of his years as a rock journalist resulted in the beloved 2000 film Almost Famous, but more than 50 years after his debut as a professional writer, Crowe is finally ready to tell the real story. The writer-director's memoir, The Uncool, arrives on Oct. 28. The book is not a salacious celebrity memoir, but a tender chronicling of his Rolling Stone years, where he earned the trust of musicians and witnessed now-iconic concert moments. He also goes deep on his upbringing and family life, and the time he may or may not have prank-called Lucille Ball.

	











	Ahead of the release, Crowe, 68, opened up on all this and more for Rolling Stone's Last Word feature.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







Have you always wanted to write a memoir?No. This is really just pivoting back to a kind of writing that I loved. Sometimes you just feel like there's a sweet spot, and you love living there. Around the time of the [Almost Famous] musical, I felt like I had a lot that needed to get out ‚Äî that I just wanted to write for me. It was such a joyful experience, and it became 800 pages. It was that kind of writing. 

	











How did it come about?Ultimately, it also came time to do a collection book of all the journalism that I'd done for Rolling Stone and other places in the day, because I'd gone back and re-interviewed a lot of those people again. And that was my little long-term project. But it turned out that this [memoir] was a good kind of first chapter to all of that. It's about finding your voice. One person that you meet, interviewing them for the magazine introduces you to another person, and that chain link fence becomes your life and your dream. The book is really about that.

Is that other book still coming out?Yeah, that's the next stage. It comes out next year. You saved everything from your past, from backstage passes to a doodle David Bowie drew you. It must have made writing easier. I kept everything, because why not? They're souvenirs from a front row seat. My dream was always, if I get a front row seat, I want to put you in the seat next to me. It's like, ‚ÄúHere's what it is to really be in the middle of all of it, and to do diary pieces from within that hurricane.‚Äù


	The idea, Angie, is to just write a letter to a friend. Don't write for the world, don't write to be a writer with a capital W. It's kind of like when people write about Bob Dylan, they feel the need to swing in the arena with Bob Dylan. It's like, ‚ÄúNo, don't do that. Get out of the way.‚Äù [I wanted to] write this in a way so that it feels like somebody is talking to just one person. It's you and them late at night and you're just saying, ‚ÄúHere's what it was like, can you believe it?‚Äù That's the tone that I love the most.


How long did it take to complete? When we spoke in 2020, you were already working on it.I kept adding and adding and adding to it, realizing, ‚ÄúYou know what? Jerry Garcia was really an amazing interview.‚Äù I was a little guy living in San Francisco, and I'm back here now. I'm going to go back into the book and add the stuff about Jerry Garcia, because that was really pivotal for me in a certain way. It was fun to keep introducing people to what's behind the Wikipedia page on some of your favorite artists. Because over time, you get reduced to whatever that Wikipedia page is.I just kept thinking, it isn't a celebrity memoir: ‚ÄúHere are all of the secrets I've had in my back pocket to finally tell!‚Äù It was a little bit like, ‚ÄúYou should meet the David Bowie that I got to meet. You should meet the guy that was giving me a ride home at 6:30 in the morning from the Station to Station sessions, going, [British accent] ‚ÄòDo I turn left or right here at this street to drop you off, you who has no driver's license?'‚Äù That guy was a really generous human being that wanted to help my writing voice, by just throwing stuff at me from his life. That was a growth step that you could never have imagined, and resonates constantly with me. So that was an important part of the book to write about.

The memoir ends in the early Eighties, right when your film career is starting. Why did you decide to cap it there?That was when a new door opened ‚Äî the door to making movies and taking a step into this really unknown world. That, to me, feels like a whole other life happened. But everything I've done has a very obvious road to music.Tom Petty was responsible for that door opening, while you were conducting interviews for the 1983 doc Heartbreakers Beach Party.He says, ‚ÄúPick up the camera and film this.‚Äù I'm like, ‚ÄúThere's no director around.‚Äù [He said] ‚ÄúPick up the camera!‚Äù And he does this song, ‚ÄòI'm Stupid,' right into the camera. I'm like, ‚ÄúThis is amazing. This feeling doesn't happen when you're transcribing 12 hours of interviews in the middle of the night. This is going right to the center of the creative process.‚Äù Cut. He goes, ‚ÄúCongratulations, you're a director.‚ÄùEach chapter here is like a snapshot of profile subjects.Yeah. It's kind of like, let them be singles that amount to an album. I've always loved the books that you could carry with you in a backpack and just pull out at any given point when you have 20 minutes, and flip through it and get a feeling. You just want to keep them close. They're not huge coffee table books or anything. They're always kind of like Patti Smith's book [2010's Just Kids]. It travels well. You really feel like you got a friend in that book. That's what I was going for.You also tell your family history here. I imagine that was therapeutic in a way, since most people only know the fictionalized version of your family in Almost Famous.Yeah. There was a happy/sad quality about growing up in the desert in Palm Springs, and later in San Diego, where music really suited that. I hadn't written about Southern California at that time ever before. It's such a vivid memory, and that's a part of what I love about music. It's one of those places that you go to in your heart and your mind. It's like Joni's song, ‚ÄúMy Secret Place.‚Äù To write about that world was really satisfying.


We all know about your mom, Alice, and your sister, Cindy, who were portrayed in the film. Did you ever think to include your father, or your late sister, Cathy, in the movie?No. My oldest sister has always been there on my shoulder. She's been such a huge presence, and she's been gone for a long time. Obviously when you're 10 years old and you lose a sibling who's 19, it's like, ‚ÄúWell, they were an adult.‚Äù So I always thought of her as an adult. And then you get older and you realize she was a teenager. She never got out of her teens. She was living in that world and she loved Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was that nearest faraway place and she gave that to me. Over time, I realized how much I owe her, and my sister Cindy. The book's a lot for them.

	











Cathy was a huge Beach Boys fan. Knowing that now, I view that ‚ÄúFeel Flows‚Äù scene in Almost Famous differently.I had heard a story from someone who had gone to see Almost Famous in the theater, and when the movie was over and the lights came up, there was somebody crying behind him. And my friend turned around and it was Brian Wilson. He said, ‚ÄúHey Brian, why are you crying?‚Äù He goes, ‚ÄúBecause that's my brother. That was my brother singing that song.‚Äù And that to me was like, ‚ÄúWalk away.‚Äù If this film burns in a lightning blast five minutes from now, I'm good. Those are the little victories along the way, where the music person inside of you was like, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù 


The book begins in 2019, when you're at rehearsals for the Almost Famous musical. You're on the phone with your mom, and you scream, ‚ÄúI want my old life back!‚Äù What did you mean by that?When I was directing and doing everything myself, and looking forward rather than potentially looking backward. And the richness that could be mined from looking backwards in a format that I didn't know, which was musical theater. So it was kind of that cry for help that was supposed to happen unheard by anyone else, but one of the crew was just a few feet away smoking a cigarette and heard everything. So I wanted to write about that in the book, too. The act of looking back is very dangerous.


You write that you didn't see a lot of rock & roll excess at first. At what point did you witness it?Being backstage interviewing Steve Marriott from Humble Pie. I come from a school teacher mother. Drugs are the enemy. He has a green Heineken in his hand and he's in the locker room of the San Diego Sports Arena, and the conversation's going really well. And then from his other hand comes the biggest hash joint I could have ever imagined. It was out of a Robert Crumb cartoon. It was so huge, and I was like, ‚ÄúWhat do I do if he offers it to me?‚Äù And he did, and I was like, ‚ÄúNo thanks. Not today.‚Äù He's like, ‚ÄúSmart, more for me.‚Äù And I heard that forever, since that day.


	If you don't do the drugs that you see, you're not there to party with them, and you send that message, which is cool. The huge excess was kept from me a lot, though I saw the hint of some of it around the edges. Sometimes, you can say a lot in between the lines. Grover Lewis did that big profile of the Allman Brothers Band [in 1971] before I did mine, and he just went right into a kind of procedural explanation of the drugs everybody was doing. I didn't want to do that, because that felt like a police report. 


	It's a case-by-case basis. Some [musicians] are like, ‚ÄúYeah, write about anything!‚Äù or you sense that about them, and you do. Other people you feel like, ‚ÄúI just want to write about the creative process, and I'm not interested in partying with you until two a.m., so I'll leave at midnight.‚Äù 

	











You did indulge sometimes, though. You write that you had a Pimm's cup with Ron Wood, and planted some seeds from Bob Marley's weed in your backyard. [Laughs.] Thanks. There was a siesta hour from time to time, but mostly, you're never going to get the story done or delivered in time if you're that guy who is there for a dual purpose. And I think there's a kind of journalist that gets filtered out of the process pretty quickly if you realize that they're there to make friends more than write something from the heart.


This is a good time to talk about your baby face. You write that you were kicked out of clubs for being underage, but it also made musicians trust you. I see it as a blessing and a curse.I grew some facial hair in the early Nineties when I was living in Seattle, and that was really a mistake. People that saw that were like, ‚ÄúNo, no, no, no, that look is not you. Just stop that, here's this razor, go get rid of that.‚ÄùIn 1975, you got a Rolling Stone assignment that was a bit different from your usual beat. It was an essay titled ‚ÄúHow I Learned About Sex.‚ÄùI ended up putting this in the book at the last minute, too. Tim Cahill was an editor that worked with me a little bit on the Allman Brothers story. He called me up and said, ‚ÄúI want you to do something that's not about music.‚Äù I'm like, ‚ÄúSounds great!‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúIt's the men's issue.‚Äù And I'm like, ‚ÄúFantastic!‚Äù And he goes, ‚ÄúThe subject is how you learned about sex.‚Äù And I'm like, ‚ÄúGr‚Äîgreat!‚Äù And then proceeded to die on the vine trying to write this story. At the last minute, I just spewed out a lot of the embarrassing stuff that I never wanted to tell anybody, and sent it in.The call was instantaneous. He was like, ‚ÄúThis is what you should be doing. This is real writing. I laughed my ass off. Wow, this is embarrassing.‚Äù The embarrassing stuff is what people always love. Be personal, but don't overtake the story, was the lesson I took from that at.You wrote cover stories on Led Zeppelin and Joni Mitchell ‚Äî musicians who weren't exactly fans of Rolling Stone. The former is particularly impressive: you convinced Jimmy Page to do the cover while he was eating a bowl of cereal.I'm telling you, I'm still shocked it happened. That was a line that was never supposed to be crossed, Led Zeppelin appearing in Rolling Stone. But it was the music fan in him that really helped that happen, because I had a bootleg tape of a Joni Mitchell interview from Canada, and he's a fan, and he wanted to hear it.And you never got it back.I never got it back. I finally got another copy of that interview a couple of weeks ago, so it came home to roost in some way or another.


You got to witness now-legendary songs in concert when they were brand new. Material from Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti, the Who's Quadrophenia, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ‚ÄúSimple Man.‚Äù Did you have a feeling at the time they'd become classics? That's a really good question. It felt classic in the moment. [Photographer] Neal Preston and I would go back to the hotel room and recap at the end of these wonderful nights. You just wanted to take those little moments and treasure them. How much better can it get than Lynyrd Skynyrd at Winterland with Ronnie Van Zandt barefoot? We had that feeling a lot: ‚ÄúIf it's this good now, how good is it going to be? This is one of the best rock shows ever.‚Äù And it was. That thing ‚Äî that white-hot moment for rock ‚Äî was never the same in that way again.


You went fishing with Van Zandt in Hawaii. Was he any good?None of us caught anything, but he was a really good fisherman. He reminded me of Duane Allman on the cover of one of those archives albums, where you've never seen a guy more comfortable holding a fishing rod. This is what this guy is meant to hold in life. And most importantly, he knew how to have fun catching not one bite. It was just a wonderful afternoon.Mistakenly, I'd recorded a little bit of that, and heard it back in the context of a mixtape that I didn't even realize had them recorded on it. This was some time ago, but I was in the kitchen listening to this mixtape. It was like, Paul McCartney and Wings' ‚ÄúBeware My Love.‚Äù And there was Ronnie and the guys from Lynyrd Skynyrd from years earlier fishing, laughing, talking about music, and it all came back. And then with a click, it went back into ‚ÄúBeware My Love.‚Äù And I was just like, ‚ÄúFuck, man.‚Äù And I've not let it in because I have been so sad since Ronnie died, but I started listening to Skynyrd again after that.You also interviewed Gram Parsons and Jim Croce, who both died a day apart, in Sept. 1973.You tend to really be imprinted by the first people that you knew who died in your life. They took the time to really bond. Jim Croce even more than Gram Parsons, but you have this indelible time where they reveal part of themselves to you and trust you. That was so vivid to be 15 and have Jim Croce say, ‚ÄúThis guy is here to interview us!‚Äù And I was just sitting in the wrong dressing room. But the guy ended up just telling stories, and I ditched school the next day and there were more stories. I just felt like, ‚ÄúI'm meeting people that get me as opposed to some of the people at school.‚Äù And then he died, and Gram was gone in an odd, mystical way. So there was a feeling at the time of, ‚ÄúGrab this time around your heroes, because there's a danger and sometimes there's a body count in this business of people in their little planes.‚Äù I was always scared of little planes.What's the best piece of advice you've ever gotten?Act like you belong until you do belong. 

	











What about from the Eagles' Glenn Frey? I know he loved to pass down his wisdom to you.Oh, man. I put that into a scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It's spoken over a cardboard cutout of Debbie Harry, which is like, ‚ÄúIf they can't smell your qualifications, move on.‚Äù I felt like Debbie Harry when Glenn was telling me this. He was such a student of how to slip into a room and make everybody part of your sport, which is, ‚ÄúLet's all do great stuff together.‚Äù That was the sport of Glenn Frey. And along the way, if somebody tries to hold you back, move on. Don't let it get you down. If they can't smell your qualifications, fuck them.


You once left your wallet in the bathroom at CBGB, and Dee Dee Ramone helped himself to $75. Did you ever tell him you knew he stole it?No, I did not. I don't think people would really imagine that I would've been around the Ramones when the Ramones were first starting. It's kind of like, ‚ÄúWhat happened? Why didn't he stick with the Ramones?‚Äù But I was moving back to California, and I think it was a little bit like I was leaving their wonderful land, their wonderful kingdom, never to return, when I was moving to California again. But being around them at that pivotal time was amazing. I felt sad that he had to steal some money from me, but I knew that if people were able to appreciate how unique the Ramones were, that things would be OK, at least for a while.


You also had an unpleasant encounter with Lou Reed while in New York.And apparently it continued throughout his entire life, because I spoke to somebody who was friends with him, and I was like, ‚ÄúYeah, I always wondered what he thought of Almost Famous, when Philip Seymour Hoffman and Patrick Fugit debate the relevance of Lou Reed and his association with David Bowie.‚Äù And the person I was talking to said, ‚ÄúOh, let me end the mystery. He didn't like it and he wasn't a fan of yours either.‚Äù I'm sorry to Lou Reed [Laughs.] It didn't go his way in that scene.


What advice do you wish you could give your younger self?Keep everything. Because one day you'll be able to look at this souvenir that means so much to you, whether it's a tape of somebody talking or something somebody gave you, and it will all come back and you will have this moment again. 


Do you ever regret jumping straight into adulthood as a teenager and missing out on that period of your life?I do. I miss some of those things. Some of the things I've been able to go back and check the box on. That's a thing that I'd always had as a conversation with my sister, Cindy, because she had a message for me, which is, ‚ÄúTake time to be an adolescent.‚Äù Take time to live the life of the people that are in those audiences while you're lucky enough to be in those crowds. Did you ever want to have fun like them as opposed to having to run home and transcribe and have a story done within days? Will you miss one day, the other life?So yes and no. When I really think about it, I wouldn't trade the life that I was able to have in those years, and I was very happy to write the book and share the highs and lows of that whole period. So I think some people think like, ‚ÄúYou had a charmed life, you got to do all that, and you were doing stories when you were young.‚Äù It's like, ‚ÄúNo, there were a lot of hills and valleys.‚Äù But it was worth it because you should do the thing that you can't say no to, and that was writing about music, particularly in that time.You were briefly in a high school band, the Masked Hamster. Do you ever think about what would have happened had you not gotten kicked out, or was it just a hobby?[Laughs] Do you know how amazing it is to be asked that question? The Masked Hamster is actually a band we can talk about. Maybe that was my dream. I don't know, man. If I had been able to play ‚ÄúI Can't Explain‚Äù properly with a band, I may have never written another word. I was so happy in that moment, but I guess I just summoned that pleasure in another way, because I was really not meant to be a musician.

	











What about if you'd stayed writing for Rolling Stone, and hadn't moved onto directing? Do you ever think about what would've happened?I do a lot, because [film] barely happened. Fast Times was definitely put on the most back of back burners by the studio, and it really was like a death march to the movie being released. So those dreams did not exist. When people started showing up in Spicoli Vans, it was like, ‚ÄúWhat? This is a miracle.‚Äù But I would've kept on writing. I think I would've written stories like Ray Bradbury, because he had wit and soul to him, which was the stuff that I always loved. When there was a little meat on the bone, but it was also fun. Ray Bradbury would've been my guiding light. 


The media landscape is drastically different now than it was in 1972.Journalists are being laid off hugely all the time, and it's tragic. So that's a reason to wave the flag for journalism. You are a journalistic hero. You're out there doing stuff at a time when it's hard to spend a couple thousand words writing about Judee Sill. So there is a nobility to that, but it's also just like being a journalist has been trivialized as a job. They've been the butt of jokes lately, and it's ridiculous. If this book does anything, I would really love for it to get across the joy of what it is to be a journalist when things are really cooking and you are there exploring something that's near and dear to your heart, and you can write about it, that is a hugely important thing.It's tougher now than it was, but it's more immediate, which is great. You can immediately find out about last night's show with Neil Young. You can immediately find out how the set lists are changing. So media is really wonderful that way. 


Do you think that social media has robbed rock stars of their mystique?Absolutely. There's so many outlets and a million podcasts. To find an artist who shrouds themselves in just a little bit of mystery is a beautiful thing, but it's so hard for them to drop an album. There has to be a campaign. And once you're campaigning, you've lost mystique. So the ball game is to keep people interested in that magic thing that happens when you capture a feeling, and not talk about it and dissect it and sell it so much that it loses its power. So this is the daily battle that we wage.


What's the best and worst part about success?The best part of success is that people can know that you have a voice and you can meet with an actor that you're interested in working with or call and ask for access to an artist that you know or appreciate or want to write about, and they might know your work. That's the best part.The hardest part about success is ‚Ä¶ I don't know, it all feels like a gift. When I was first starting to write, James L. Brooks told me, ‚ÄúBuddy, think of the privilege we have. We got the greatest job in the world. We get to tell stories.‚Äù And I still feel that every day. 


What did you learn from the Almost Famous musical?In San Diego, it was a smaller, heartfelt thing. It ended up being something that was completed by my mom dying, which I'd never thought would happen. The emotion of her dying just bled through the cast. They took the baton of everything that had happened, and did it for my mom. And then Covid happened, and it was rolling the boulder back up a very bigger hill. And I think we learned, once again, what we already knew, which is the most personal and passionate version of the show is the show to do. There's going to be a performance of it in Connecticut in October. So we did some more work on it, just to use what we learned from the Broadway experience. It's a living, growing thing, and I learned a lot.

	











I'm sure the negative reviews were hard to swallow.Yeah. I just will always remember Casey Likes the day after, when a lot of the reviews had hit. Here comes the kid who's playing you as a young guy, an optimistic young warrior. Here he is leaping down the street, literally jumping, saying, ‚ÄúThis just makes me want to do better and better and better!‚Äù It was an amazing moment that I'll never forget. These things all take time. Scripts take time and plays take time, and bands take time and songs take time. It's the beautiful journey.


The memoir is a great way to introduce younger audiences to your writing, who are mostly familiar with you as a director.Yeah. Led by this thing that I did grow up with, which is, ‚ÄúPut on your magic shoes.‚Äù Everybody always says ‚Äúyou can do anything‚Äù to a young person growing up. I actually believed it. There was only one person in the whole time at Rolling Stone that ever said, ‚ÄúYou're too young to be able to write about me.‚Äù Everybody else was like, ‚ÄúOK, sit down. What else you got?‚ÄùWho was that?Steve Miller.

	Alyssa Mercante



	A woman stands in the doorway of a burning building, the large brim of a hat obscuring her face, her yellow hakamashita dappled red with blood. Fire dances off the hilt of the katana in her hand. Death lies in her wake. ‚ÄúOnry≈ç!‚Äù the villagers hiss as she mounts a horse and disappears behind the veil of night, evoking the folk tales of vengeful ghosts who refuse to depart this mortal plane in search of revenge. 


	This Ghost of Y≈çtei haunts the red maple forests and stalks the snowy tundra in search of those whose names are written on the sash wrapped around her waist. She won't stop until each name is crossed out in blood, and her image is soon plastered on bounty posters across the land. Shrines crop up in her honor ‚Äî both from those who wish to avoid her wrath and others who approve of her killings. 


	Who is this Ghost of Y≈çtei? Is she woman or y≈´rei?


Ghost of Y≈çtei (out Oct. 2), Sucker Punch's standalone sequel to 2020's action-adventure game, Ghost of Tsushima, centers around protagonist Atsu (Erika Ishii), who lost her family at the hands of a brutal lord and dedicates her life to avenging them. Like the 1973 film Lady Snowblood (and the movie it inspired, Kill Bill), Atsu tears across the beautiful but troubled lands resting in the shadow of Mount Y≈çtei in search of revenge, leaving behind a bloody trail as she learns much about herself in the process.

	











	Five years after the release of its predecessor, Y≈çtei expands upon Tsushima in every direction ‚Äî its characters are more complex, its story more gripping, and its visuals more stunning. In Y≈çtei, the series' beautiful music is tied even closer to its narrative, as is the franchise's impressive flora and fauna. 

	











Y≈çtei's world is larger, and you explore it differently ‚Äî willing settlers and unwilling r≈çnin with a katana at their gullet will offer hints about hot springs, wolf dens, shrines, and altars, all of which will help progress your build. You can use those hints to help pinpoint their location, an oral cartography that fills in the map bit by bit.

	Atsu is a mercenary, not a samurai, so she doesn't need to fight in accordance with their rigid values. Because of this, Y≈çtei's combat is much more varied and fun than Tsushima's. Rather than swapping katana stances to fight different enemies, Y≈çtei gives players several different weapons (though you'll need to complete missions to get them). 


	You can beat baddies into a bloody pulp with dual katanas, a spear, a kusarigama, or an ≈çdachi, and swap between them on the fly (a lid for every pot, yada yada). A kusarigama's iron weight can be swung to bash through enemy shields, a dual katana better deflects incoming spears, and a single katana always stands strongest against its mirror.


	Swapping between weapons when facing a barrage of enemies can be a bit of a struggle, especially when they're wielding a variety of weapons, but thankfully, Atsu's dodging and parrying skills should make up for panicked swaps. As she progresses through her skill tree, Atsu can deflect away incoming arrows, unleash a flurry of dual-katana strikes, and temporarily sheath her katana just to pull it out and gut an enemy in one swift motion. 


	Couple that with the throwables in her arsenal (kunai that you can upgrade to light enemies ablaze, metsubushi powder to blind them, shinobi bombs that sheathe you in smoke), and Atsu is a much more formidable fighter than Tsushima's Jin Sakai. I dreaded large battles in Tsushima, even avoided them, but welcome them in Y≈çtei. There are few things more satisfying than embedding a kusarigama in a man's skull right after he hurls insults at you, then turning on a dime to throw fiery kunai at the chest of a big brute, his screams echoing through the forest.

	If you prefer to be a bit more demure in doling out death, Y≈çtei improves upon Tsushima's stealth gameplay. Atsu has an entire skill tree dedicated to sneaking, and you can still take out enemies silently from afar with the thrum of a bowstring or disappear amidst the fog of a smoke bomb. It may not satisfy players who prefer stealth, but it's more than enough for me.

	











	If Ghost of Tsushima was a feast for the senses, Ghost of Y≈çtei is a buffet (and I'm about to get kicked out after going for my fourth plate of lobster claws). There are many lovely details that Sucker Punch was clearly given the time, space, and budget to labor over. 


Tsushima made use of the DualSense controller's haptic feedback in a few, simple ways: the tension of a pulled bow string, the vibration of a cat's purrs, the clinging of katana blades. Y≈çtei takes the controller and makes it feel like a real-world multi-tool.


	In the opening moments, your fingers act as Atsu's brushstrokes as she writes the names of her enemies on her sash, swiping up, down, and across the DualSense pad like you're painting the characters. Lifting the controller and swinging it swiftly down hammers steel at Atsu's family forge, gently pulling the trigger urges a campfire's tendrils higher, while tilting it this way and that lowers mushrooms further into that fire for cooking.


Y≈çtei organically melds the DualSense's capabilities with diegetic gameplay, all of which urge you to explore more of this world and whisper in your ear, ‚ÄúWhat's another hour or two more?‚Äù


	It's obvious from the opening moments that Ghost of Y≈çtei was built from the ground up for PS5 (Tsushima originally launched for PS4 in July 2020). Atsu jumps on horseback, and the screen narrows and stretches like you're sitting in a movie theater, the grassland of Ezo sprawling in every direction, Mount Y≈çtei's snowcapped peak resting in the distance. At one point, Atsu climbs its range and skirts along the mouth of the dormant volcano, which spreads like an impossibly massive maw in every direction (Y≈çtei is pushing the limits of draw-distance tech). 


	There are visuals seared into my brain: Atsu and her horse galloping across a frozen lake that looks like blue lace agate; Atsu making camp under the green streaks of the aurora borealis; red maple leaves careening and pinwheeling in the wind in Atsu's wake. It may be the most beautiful game I've ever played.


	But Y≈çtei's beauty isn't superficial, nor is it an attempt to distract from its gameplay or its story. Players will want to explore Ezo to see more splendor, sure, but will also want to kill that r≈çnin they can barely make out that's camping in an open field, and will definitely want to know why that one samurai at the checkpoint looks so familiar. Every element is enveloping, pulling you in until it's time to awaken from the fugue state at 2 a.m., bleary-eyed, the screen blinking a warning about the DualSense's battery life. 

	











	Whereas Tsushima slowly peels back the layers of protagonist Jin like a stubborn taro root, Y≈çtei tells us exactly who Atsu is from the outset: an angry young woman, doggedly chasing vengeance across an island picked apart by selfish lords and the samurai who serve them. She is single-minded and short-tempered, preferring the company of foxes, wolves, and her horse (whom I named Shimaki in my play-through) to people. 


	Atsu is no onry≈ç, but she has a supernatural air about her ‚Äî wolves suddenly appear to help turn the tide in a battle, launching at her enemies' throats or latching onto their outstretched arms. If she kills enough foes without taking damage, she can invoke the Onry≈ç Shout, which shakes the ground upon which she treads and sends her foes stumbling backward in fear. 


	Yet she rebukes the onry≈ç title, and wonders why they ‚Äúhave to die to get revenge.‚Äù Atsu ‚Äúwon't be someone's bedtime story,‚Äù and wants desperately to define herself, yet she is taciturn, hoping that her actions will tell her tale, and frustrated when she doesn't like how it's told. 


	The more time I spend with Atsu, the more it's clear she has the heart of a young, traumatized girl, encased in a woman's body. That young girl was stubborn and tomboyish and skilled with a katana, yes, but she was also soft and sweet. She wanted to raise horses when she grew up, but instead spent the last sixteen years as a mercenary in war-torn lands, only to return home and realize that the very people who ruined her life are destroying everyone else's.


	Despite Atsu's scary reputation and the horrors of its world, Y≈çtei is softer and more sensitive than Tsushima. There are dozens of little moments of quiet kindness and profound mourning, of gentle reflection and solemnity, of nature reaching out to Atsu, and by proxy, the player.


	Birds flit around Atsu's head and lead her to points of interest. Foxes tap their toes excitedly while she chops bamboo. When she rests at a hot spring, neck deep in cloud-blue water, a buck nestles in the grass just behind her. A wolf drops a salmon at her feet while she sleeps at her campfire.


	I make it a point to save every wolf in the game, despite the side quests sucking up precious time. I believe, doggedly, this is what Atsu would want. As I lead Atsu through her story, I worry about her. I question her decisions, yet continue onward in the hopes that I can help her find peace. It's that hope for Atsu, and for the people of Ezo, that propels me forward through a story that is so much more complicated than a typical revenge tale.

	











	Sadly, like so many games released in the last few years, Ghost of Y≈çtei will launch as an unwilling soldier in an ideological culture war. When Atsu was first revealed as the game's protagonist, reactionaries jumped to disavow the sequel, citing bad-faith reasoning that failed to hide their prejudices. Sucker Punch recently fired a developer who joked about right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination after the same people who vowed to never play Yotei launched a cancel campaign against the studio.


	It's unclear if this will change the minds of those who already planned on boycotting the game. But after many hours with it, what is clear is that Ghost of Y≈çtei is a work of art. It embodies the ideology that games can lead players through a beautiful, interactive world while still giving them the agency to materially affect it. Refusing to engage with it means robbing yourself of the experience, like walking into a museum eyes closed rather than appreciating any of the paintings. 


Ghost of Y≈çtei isn't perfect. During my playthrough, I encountered zero progression-blocking bugs but several visual glitches, the occasional hitching enemy, and the rare, weirdly rendered NPC, but nothing broke the immersion.


	Side quests are a bit same-y, which is a common problem in action games. Killing a crew of r≈çnin just to have one give in and hand over important information via cutscene gets tiring, yet there's solace in climbing a shit-covered rocky outcropping to bow at a heavens-touching altar over and over again. Its world, though bigger, isn't technically completely open, as there are barriers between regions (likely to allow for some load times, which are lightning-fast).

	Yet Ghost of Y≈çtei transports players to feudal Japan with such vivid effectiveness that it's hard to leave it and return to the reality of the modern age. It seamlessly blends diegetic gameplay with a compelling, moving narrative that's pushed forward by a complex cast of characters. It's absolutely a game of the year contender, and an improvement upon Tsushima's winning formula.


Ghost of Y≈çtei releases on Oct. 2 for PlayStation 5.

	Under new rules Spotify announced today, an AI ‚Äúband‚Äù like the now-infamous Velvet Sundown will still be allowed on the service, but would be encouraged to label itself properly from the start. Overall, Spotify has zero intention of eliminating AI-generated music from its service, execs said Tuesday, in a press conference announcing its new guidelines. At the same time, the company said it's waging war against a flood of low-quality AI content, removing more than 75 million ‚Äúspammy‚Äù tracks in the past 12 months alone.


	There's no question that in the wake of the rise of services such as Suno ‚Äî which allow near-instant generation of new songs ‚Äî AI-generated music is deluging streaming services.  Spotify competitor Deezer has said that approximately 28 percent of daily uploads are fully AI-generated music, though those tracks account for a mere 0.5 percent of actual streams. But even as Spotify aims to curb the impact of that onslaught, they're signaling that AI music is here to stay.  ‚ÄúWe're not here to punish artists for using AI authentically and responsibly,‚Äù said Charlie Hellman, Spotify's VP global head of music product. ‚ÄúWe hope that artists' use of AI production tools will enable them to be more creative than ever.‚Äù 

	











	Spotify is most concerned about ‚Äúmass uploads, duplicates, SEO hacks, artificially short track abuse, and other forms of slop,‚Äù according to a blog post from the company. Accordingly, it's rolling out a new spam filter to flag uploaders engaging in those practices, and thus ‚Äúhelp prevent spammers from generating royalties that could be otherwise distributed to professional artists and songwriters.‚Äù The company will stop short of removing those tracks, though, instead simply making them ineligible for recommendation by the streamer's algorithm. The company will still have no rules in place against boosting AI-generated songs in general.

	The platform will encourage, but apparently not mandate, that artists label their AI usage via a new industry standard developed through DDEX ‚Äî a long-standing non-profit that creates technical standards for song metadata across platforms. The idea is that artists will specify their precise uses of generative AI, ranging from fully prompt-generated songs to human-made songs with AI-tweaked lyrics. The approach treats AI use as ‚Äúa spectrum, not a binary,‚Äù said Sam Duboff, Spotify's global head of marketing and policy, music business.

	The new policies also include more explicit bans on unauthorized AI voice clones and deepfakes. ‚ÄúSome artists may choose to license their voice to AI projects‚Äîand that's their choice to make,‚Äù Duboff  said. ‚ÄúOur job is to do what we can to ensure that the choice stays in their hands.‚Äù At the same time, the company says it's aiming to be more vigilant about ‚Äúprofile mismatches,‚Äù where fraudsters upload content under the name of real artists, often famous ones. 


	This summer, the Velvet Sundown, a fake AI-generated band that initially didn't acknowledge its nature, amassed over a million monthly listeners, while appearing to benefit from algorithmic promotion on Spotify. The band eventually admitted in an updated bio that it was ‚Äúa synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence.‚Äù Duboff suggested the ‚Äúband‚Äù might have gained much less notoriety if it was properly labeled from the start. ‚ÄúI think the kind of news cycle, the fan interest, would've been really different,‚Äù he said.

	As if Jimmy Kimmel's return to late-night wasn't enough, South Park put FCC chair Brendan Carr through a grueling gauntlet of slapstick pain in its latest episode, Wednesday, Sept. 24. 


	The episode isn't a direct commentary on how the Trump administration pressured ABC and affiliate owners to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live!, though Trey Parker and Matt Stone made their views on the matter evident enough. Carr is part of an episode subplot involving Donald Trump's efforts to get rid of his unborn butt baby with Satan, but all the zany schemes the president concocts keep befalling the hapless FCC chair instead.


	These include: Slipping down a greased flight of stairs, eating a stew laced with Plan B, and finally, getting covered in dirty cat litter and infected with toxoplasmosis. The last trap puts Carr in the hospital, where a doctor quips about his condition: ‚ÄúHis bones are healing, so he may regain full range of motion. But if the toxoplasmosis parasite gets to his brain, I'm afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.‚Äù

	In a more direct nod to the Kimmel controversy, J.D. Vance shows up at the hospital, delighted that Carr is in critical condition and thus unable to challenge the VP for the presidency. Vance even threatens Carr with the same words the FCC chair used on a podcast when revealing his desire to get Kimmel booted over a joke he made about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk: ‚ÄúWe can do this the easy way or the hard way.‚Äù

	Last night's South Park aired a week later than expected, after Parker and Stone admitted they were unable to get the episode ‚Äúdone in time.‚Äù The show's blockbuster 27th season has been airing every other week, as opposed to weekly, to ostensibly give the pair and their staff more time to craft episodes in response to current events. (Case in point: The Carr plot was almost certainly added after last week's episode was delayed, as Stone and Parker announced the postponement the same day, Sept. 17, ABC suspended Kimmel.)


South Park will air five more episodes this year, with the tentative schedule set as: Oct. 15, Oct. 29, Nov. 12, Nov. 26, and Dec. 10.

B
enny Safdie desperately wants to tell me about the time he got punched in the face. 


	Over a long breakfast at Old John's Luncheonette ‚Äî the kind of New York diner that, despite a recent renovation, still emanates a distinct greasy-spoon vibe ‚Äî the 39-year-old writer, director, and actor will wax poetic on a number of topics: elementary particle physics, the benefits of therapy, geeking out with Christopher Nolan, It's a Wonderful Life. He's as good a conversationalist as he is a filmmaker, and as one half of the duo responsible for movies like 2017's Good Time and 2019's Uncut Gems, that's saying something. Those gritty, often harrowing, and oddly funny character studies helped Robert Pattinson and Adam Sandler dig into darker sides they didn't normally get to display, and Safdie's latest work, The Smashing Machine (hitting theaters on October 3rd), is about to do the same for Dwayne Johnson.


	But first, Safdie needs to explain why he spent years chasing this new film, a biopic about early MMA champion Mark Kerr, in the first place. A while back, Benny was going to play a boxer in a project he was developing with his brother, Josh. So he started training at a gym. ‚ÄúYou walk in, and there are all these loud noises, big guys punching shit, hitting each other,‚Äù Safdie says. ‚ÄúAnd you're immediately like, ‚ÄòI want to learn how to do this.'‚Äù He was told he had talent and strength. Maybe the kid should consider an amateur bout.

	Then, while sparring one day, Benny found himself on the receiving end of a KO. ‚ÄúI just got my ass kicked,‚Äù he says, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI got handed so many punches that I blacked out. I remember coming to, and everyone was like, ‚ÄòDon't sit down. You'll pass out.' But it was the best feeling in the world. I said thank you to the guy who beat the shit outta me. Because now I knew what it was like. I was part of it.‚Äù

	











	The role never happened ‚Äî the pugilist character eventually turned into the developmentally disabled brother Benny played in Good Time ‚Äî but Safdie was left wanting to communicate what he called ‚Äúthe love and compassion and empathy in that world of violence.‚Äù And when he discovered a 2002 documentary about Kerr (also called The Smashing Machine), he felt he'd found the perfect vehicle. Safdie had seen UFC fights with his stepdad in the early pay-per-view days of the sport, ‚Äúback when it was still banned [almost] everywhere but Connecticut, and too hot to watch on television.‚Äù

	He'd never heard of Kerr, however, until Johnson, a fan of Uncut Gems, reached out to the Safdies. Back when he was rising up the pro-wrestling ranks in the late 1990s and considering a transition to the MMA circuit, Johnson had met Kerr. Later, after the artist formerly known as the Rock caught up with that original doc around 2008, he bought the rights to Kerr's story, filled with professional triumph and personal tragedy. Johnson envisioned playing the fighter ‚Äî and he thought the Safdies were the ones to help him bring the biopic to the screen. 


	‚ÄúThere's a juxtaposition of grit and desperation along with these loving moments in Gems,‚Äù Johnson says, in a separate Zoom interview. ‚ÄúI felt like, ‚ÄòI'm watching something that I shouldn't be seeing' ‚Äî like, that's how intimate it felt. And that was what I was looking for.‚Äù


	Johnson sent the brothers the documentary, which immediately struck a chord with Benny. But then Covid hit, and the project ‚Äújust drifted away,‚Äù Safdie says. He began developing the gloriously surreal series The Curse ‚Äî about married real estate developers giving a small town a TV makeover ‚Äî with his friend Nathan Fielder. ‚ÄúBut I never stopped thinking about the movie.‚Äù One day in 2019, Safdie saw a famous image of Kerr wearing a Nautica sweater and tracked down a similar garment online in Johnson's size. He sent it to Johnson, along with a handwritten note that read, ‚ÄúIf you ever make this, whether I'm part of it or not, I hope this sweater helps you get into the mindset.‚Äù

	Much has been made of the fact that Benny pursued The Smashing Machine project on his own, but he says there is no friction with Josh ‚Äî the reasons are all quite practical. A follow-up to Uncut Gems that the Safdies had been working on with Sandler had hit a few snags, and Benny began to follow his muse in a slightly different direction. And in reality, the brothers had always ‚Äúmade things separately,‚Äù he says. Back when they were both attending Boston University, Benny made a short, while his older brother Josh worked on a feature entitled The Pleasure of Being Robbed. (It was Benny who took two separate phone calls from Cannes, saying that both movies had been accepted to play the festival; the French programmers had no idea the two men were related until he told them.) There was never a plan to work together per se, Benny says. When they started working on a prickly story about their father which turned into the 2009 feature Daddy Longlegs, however, their contrasting perspectives about their upbringing helped balance the emotional tone. A partnership was formed.

	











	Still, Benny says, they were never wedded to being a duo. ‚ÄúWe had different sensibilities and things we wanted to do,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúOnce we'd finished Uncut Gems, it was like, what's next? Josh was like, ‚ÄòI want to do this thing.' And I wasn't sure I wanted to do that thing. At some point, you want to do something that maybe you can't explore because the other person is not interested.‚Äù 


	Lots of brothers work together. Not all of them get a New York Times article about their creative split. ‚ÄúI get that need for built-in drama,‚Äù he admits, in reference to the headlines announcing that the Safdies were ‚Äúdone making movies together.‚Äù They'd had heated fights on sets, sure, but they were still family. ‚ÄúThere are these Ukranian boxers, the Klitschko brothers. And a fan I know would always say, ‚ÄòOh, what I give to see them fight each other!' So I get it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù Safdie shrugs.


	After relishing the experience of making The Curse, Benny felt that something was different in his creative process: ‚ÄùLike, OK, it's time for a change.‚Äú Some of his early shorts, he notes, revolved around two characters he'd crafted into separate meta-comedy personae that he'd trot out for open-mic nights and film on the sly. One was named Zachary Mulden, whose ‚Äúfunny‚Äù stories revealed how pathetic his life really was (an anecdote about waiting two hours to ambush friends during a paintball game ends with him admitting he actually doesn't have any friends). Another was a ‚ÄúWall Street guy‚Äù who fancied himself an observational comic, who Safdie dubbed Ralph Handel. A typical routine would start with Handel going, ‚ÄúSo I went to the grocery store, and guess what I got? Anybody? Anybody?‚Äù Then he'd describe the frozen pizza and pack of gum he purchased in banal detail.


	It was the sort of gonzo performance art that Safdie loved, and he remembered the buzz he got from going out on a limb in front of a crowd. The fact that he was trading lines with Fielder and Emma Stone in The Curse ‚Äî he played Dougie Schecter, the unctuous producer of the show-within-the-show ‚Äî as well as co-writing and co-directing episodes, reminded him how fun it was to be in front of the camera, too.


	So when filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson (Licorice Pizza) and Claire Denis (Stars at Noon) started hitting him up with offers to act in their projects, Safdie increasingly said yes. He was still waiting on a call from Johnson that he wasn't sure would ever come when Christopher Nolan reached out to offer him a role as a scientist in Oppenheimer. He jumped at the chance. And in between setups, Safdie would kill time observing Nolan at work and shooting the shit with his co-stars, notably Emily Blunt.

	











	‚ÄúHe's just a glass of bubbles,‚Äù Blunt says of Safdie, in a separate call. ‚ÄúHe's so light, and it's just wonderful to be around him. Having seen his movies, I think I was expecting someone way more intense. But he just has this wonderful, guileless hopefulness about the world and about creating. And yet, you know, he also understands struggle. He understands panic, and anxiety, and humanity at its most broken. And he's interested in revealing that in the most unique ways.‚Äù


	One day while chatting with Blunt, Safdie mentioned Johnson, the sweater gift, and their abandoned project. He knew that she and ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù were close pals after co-starring in the 2021 adventure film Jungle Cruise, and he wondered if Dwayne had ever received the pullover. Blunt then reached out to Johnson, who says he never got the shirt. (‚ÄúI'm sure someone on his team saw the letter, which looked like a psychopathic eight-year-old had written it, and went, ‚ÄòYeah, DJ doesn't need to know about this,'‚Äù Safdie says, laughing.) But the star wondered if Benny was still interested in making the film. They soon began hashing out what would be the younger Safdie's debut as a solo feature director. Blunt was cast as Kerr's emotionally volatile wife, Dawn, which ‚Äî as both she and Benny respectively mention ‚Äî was anything but a done deal. It wasn't until Safdie saw a clip of her and Johnson getting ready for the 2023 Oscars and noted their rapport that he texted Johnson: ‚ÄúIt's got to be her.‚Äù


	And judging from the way that Safdie turns The Smashing Machine's blend of get-in-the-ring brutality and domestic strife into a combination of Rocky and Marriage Story, you can see how he's filtered a real-life sports story into a unique take on redemption, addiction (Kerr struggled with opiate addiction, and overdosed twice) and self-acceptance, one bloody haymaker at a time. It's unlike your typical biopic, as well as unlike any other film that Johnson, nearly unrecognizable under a lot of prosthethics, courtesy of the Oscar-winning make-up designer Kazu Hiro, has done before ‚Äî his own version of Raging Bull.

	(That film turned out to be a big touchstone for both Safdie and his lead; when it's name-checked during our interview, Johnson excitedly tilts his Zoom camera and points to a framed picture on his living room wall: It's a vintage poster of Martin Scorsese's 1980 boxing drama, which was part of Safdie's wrap gift to Johnson.)


	It feels like Safdie is starting a new chapter that is both of a piece with his work with his brother and completely his own. ‚ÄúI really wanted to do something that felt like a virtual reality for emotions,‚Äù Safdie says of The Smashing Machine, before pushing away his empty breakfast plate. ‚ÄúYou know, what does it feel like to be that guy and go through that struggle? I wanted to capture that feeling of getting punched in the face, then needing to do it again and again.‚Äù

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific

China appears to have seized on U.S. conspiracy theorists' current and most enduring obsession: unidentified flying objects and the aliens believed by many to pilot them.

A screenshot from a video clip purportedly showing a UFO being shot down over Shandong, China, Sep. 14, 2025.

While Russia has long made an effort to weaponize Western conspiracy theories to exacerbate mistrust and polarization in countries like the United States, China has been slower to catch on. Preferring to focus its early malign influence operations on Taiwan, its big debut in the effort to link information warfare to conspiracy theory occurred during the COVID-19 global pandemic, when the Chinese government helped promote the discredited idea that the virus was manufactured in a U.S. weapons laboratory. The Chinese social media and content creation platform, TikTok, has also been a major vector for conspiracy theory, promoting the circulation of videos on all manner of conspiracy theories, from the hollow to the flat earth and beyond. However, China's latest foray into conspiracy theory appears to have seized on U.S. conspiracy theorists' current and most enduring obsession: unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the aliens believed by many to pilot them.

What is driving the puzzling politics of the UFO in great power competition? China appears to be taking advantage of the confluence of three recent events: the recent discovery of a chemical biosignature on Mars; misinformation about the serendipitous passage of an extra-solar cometary body, 3I/ATLAS, through the solar system this year; and, most importantly, the ongoing fascination with the topic of UFOs in the U.S. Congress. While these three things are just the latest in an ongoing moment of American cultural fascination with all things extraterrestrial, the events taken together have created a unique opportunity for Beijing to target U.S. conspiracy theorists and possibly audiences well beyond the United States with a signal about its advancing military capabilities.

A video recorded in Shandong, China on September 12 went viral on Chinese social media before being recirculated in the West by The Daily Mail, Newsweek, and a number of other outlets. Ostensibly showing the successful destruction of a UFO over the skies of China, the video depicts a slow-moving object being successfully intercepted by a fast-moving missile, with both going up in a ball of fire. Videos reposting and dissecting the footage have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. 

Although there is nothing else to the video, the exact message behind the apparent missile test is clear from the headlines: China can successfully shoot down a UFO. 

This might seem silly, but the information operation at the heart of the video's release is communicating something more serious. By properly contextualizing the Chinese UFO video, the full content and gravity of the message becomes clear.

To that end, consider the clamor raised in Congress over the past few years about UFOs in U.S. airspace and other U.S. military operational environments. Just three days before the appearance of the Shandong footage, members of Congress released another video ‚Äì this one raising concerns about the United States' own inability to successfully accomplish the same mission. Provided to Congress by the U.S. military whistleblowers, the video shows what appears to be a Hellfire missile targeting a fast-moving UFO in airspace over Yemen. The missile ‚Äúbounces off‚Äù without detonating, and the alleged UFO continues on its journey mostly unphased.

In reality, the video likely depicts a missile fired by one drone bouncing off another, with the failed detonation being the result of the fact that the missile is tailored for air-to-ground operations. The video represents the disclosure of the first known instance when the MQ-9 Reaper drone was used in an air-to-air operation. The failed detonation could be thus the result of the same atypical mission set. 

But the Hellfire missile's bladed ‚ÄúGinsu‚Äù variant has reportedly been used previously in Yemen, suggesting another plausible explanation for a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù detonation: It is also conceivable that the video shows a missile piercing a balloon or similar object. If this is the case, the video would appear to be a repeat of the shootdown of the Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States for a week back in 2023. 

Either way, the ongoing military operations targeted at Yemen-based terrorist organizations, and the threat of Houthi drones emanating from the region, it makes sense that U.S. forces in the region would strike down any potentially hostile aerial objects, be they drones or balloons.

Yet, the kinds of things depicted in the decontextualized, black and white, infrared video lacking clear resolution ‚Äì illusions of rapid movement, nebulous objects ‚Äì often pass for evidence in conspiracy theory belief communities, an audience that rarely brooks with such explanations. Thanks to phenomena like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and the so-called ‚Äúbackfire effect,‚Äù conspiracy theorists instead often prefer fantastic narratives that support their preexisting beliefs and misperceptions. These the exact sorts of bias targeted by China's sophisticated information operations. 

Worse, because the message is amplified by the congressional bullhorn, China is able to target a much wider audience than the average conspiracy theorist. By watching these two videos together, the full message for a much larger audience becomes clear: China can successfully shoot down a UFO; the United States cannot. In other words, the release of the Chinese video is a signal designed to erode confidence in U.S. military capabilities, and with it, decades of U.S. soft power messaging to the contrary.

Hollywood movies from ‚ÄúStargate‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù to ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattleship‚Äù have long reinforced the idea of U.S. hegemony and the U.S.-led world order through the depiction of the U.S. military leading a global resistance to extraterrestrial invasion. But movies are fiction. Thanks to the narrative being promoted about the Yemen drone strike, China has positioned itself as the real deal ‚Äì with Congress inadvertently providing its stamp of approval on Beijing's strategic messaging. As such, the politics of the UFO in great power competition make China out to be a guarantor of global security, capable of doing something in real life that the United States can only accomplish in the movies.

Taken literally, this may again seem silly. Surely, only the most ardent believers in the extraterrestrial origins of the UFO would buy into this messaging? Perhaps. Yet, in the United States alone, somewhere between 44 percent and 63 percent of Americans believe in a government UFO coverup, while even serious scholars conceive of UFOs as threats to international order. This means the message could resonate with a broad audience. 

Despite this, the message is not actually meant to be taken literally. On one hand, it should be read as a signal of Chinese capabilities, in which case, the message could be meant to create feelings of insecurity in the domestic U.S. audience, not about aliens but about China's relative power compared to that of the United States. 

On the other hand, the message can be interpreted as a signal to foreign governments about Chinese capabilities vis-√†-vis the United States. That is, it may not be intended for U.S. audiences at all. It may be a message reinforcing China's overarching strategy to those countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region, or in Africa or Latin America, that either remain undecided about whether China or the United States would be a more reliable security partner in the coming years, or that otherwise remain open to the idea of a Chinese-led world order. 

In this respect, as bizarre as it may seem, the release of the Chinese UFO video can function similarly to the conflict between India and Pakistan in May 2025. The short-lived outbreak of hostilities over Kashmir was a military success for India, but thanks to claims that Pakistan's Chinese-supplied air defense systems shot down a number of Western-built Indian fighter craft, Pakistan created a perception of Chinese technical superiority. As a result, China came out of the conflict victorious in the narrative space.

Of course, China ‚Äì like many a nation-state ‚Äì is familiar with the problem of multiple audiences. As such, the release of the video may easily have been intended for both Western and non-Western audiences. In any case, the securitization of the UFO phenomenon in the United States, and the broader politicization of UFOs in Congress, has gifted China with the opportunity to punch at one of the United States' core insecurities by painting it as a nation declining in relative capability. This can, in turn, ultimately pay off for Beijing both by eroding US domestic political will for sustained competition or conflict with China, and by broadening China's international base of support.

While Russia has long made an effort to weaponize Western conspiracy theories to exacerbate mistrust and polarization in countries like the United States, China has been slower to catch on. Preferring to focus its early malign influence operations on Taiwan, its big debut in the effort to link information warfare to conspiracy theory occurred during the COVID-19 global pandemic, when the Chinese government helped promote the discredited idea that the virus was manufactured in a U.S. weapons laboratory. The Chinese social media and content creation platform, TikTok, has also been a major vector for conspiracy theory, promoting the circulation of videos on all manner of conspiracy theories, from the hollow to the flat earth and beyond. However, China's latest foray into conspiracy theory appears to have seized on U.S. conspiracy theorists' current and most enduring obsession: unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the aliens believed by many to pilot them.

What is driving the puzzling politics of the UFO in great power competition? China appears to be taking advantage of the confluence of three recent events: the recent discovery of a chemical biosignature on Mars; misinformation about the serendipitous passage of an extra-solar cometary body, 3I/ATLAS, through the solar system this year; and, most importantly, the ongoing fascination with the topic of UFOs in the U.S. Congress. While these three things are just the latest in an ongoing moment of American cultural fascination with all things extraterrestrial, the events taken together have created a unique opportunity for Beijing to target U.S. conspiracy theorists and possibly audiences well beyond the United States with a signal about its advancing military capabilities.

A video recorded in Shandong, China on September 12 went viral on Chinese social media before being recirculated in the West by The Daily Mail, Newsweek, and a number of other outlets. Ostensibly showing the successful destruction of a UFO over the skies of China, the video depicts a slow-moving object being successfully intercepted by a fast-moving missile, with both going up in a ball of fire. Videos reposting and dissecting the footage have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. 

Although there is nothing else to the video, the exact message behind the apparent missile test is clear from the headlines: China can successfully shoot down a UFO. 

This might seem silly, but the information operation at the heart of the video's release is communicating something more serious. By properly contextualizing the Chinese UFO video, the full content and gravity of the message becomes clear.

To that end, consider the clamor raised in Congress over the past few years about UFOs in U.S. airspace and other U.S. military operational environments. Just three days before the appearance of the Shandong footage, members of Congress released another video ‚Äì this one raising concerns about the United States' own inability to successfully accomplish the same mission. Provided to Congress by the U.S. military whistleblowers, the video shows what appears to be a Hellfire missile targeting a fast-moving UFO in airspace over Yemen. The missile ‚Äúbounces off‚Äù without detonating, and the alleged UFO continues on its journey mostly unphased.

In reality, the video likely depicts a missile fired by one drone bouncing off another, with the failed detonation being the result of the fact that the missile is tailored for air-to-ground operations. The video represents the disclosure of the first known instance when the MQ-9 Reaper drone was used in an air-to-air operation. The failed detonation could be thus the result of the same atypical mission set. 

But the Hellfire missile's bladed ‚ÄúGinsu‚Äù variant has reportedly been used previously in Yemen, suggesting another plausible explanation for a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù detonation: It is also conceivable that the video shows a missile piercing a balloon or similar object. If this is the case, the video would appear to be a repeat of the shootdown of the Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States for a week back in 2023. 

Either way, the ongoing military operations targeted at Yemen-based terrorist organizations, and the threat of Houthi drones emanating from the region, it makes sense that U.S. forces in the region would strike down any potentially hostile aerial objects, be they drones or balloons.

Yet, the kinds of things depicted in the decontextualized, black and white, infrared video lacking clear resolution ‚Äì illusions of rapid movement, nebulous objects ‚Äì often pass for evidence in conspiracy theory belief communities, an audience that rarely brooks with such explanations. Thanks to phenomena like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and the so-called ‚Äúbackfire effect,‚Äù conspiracy theorists instead often prefer fantastic narratives that support their preexisting beliefs and misperceptions. These the exact sorts of bias targeted by China's sophisticated information operations. 

Worse, because the message is amplified by the congressional bullhorn, China is able to target a much wider audience than the average conspiracy theorist. By watching these two videos together, the full message for a much larger audience becomes clear: China can successfully shoot down a UFO; the United States cannot. In other words, the release of the Chinese video is a signal designed to erode confidence in U.S. military capabilities, and with it, decades of U.S. soft power messaging to the contrary.

Hollywood movies from ‚ÄúStargate‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù to ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattleship‚Äù have long reinforced the idea of U.S. hegemony and the U.S.-led world order through the depiction of the U.S. military leading a global resistance to extraterrestrial invasion. But movies are fiction. Thanks to the narrative being promoted about the Yemen drone strike, China has positioned itself as the real deal ‚Äì with Congress inadvertently providing its stamp of approval on Beijing's strategic messaging. As such, the politics of the UFO in great power competition make China out to be a guarantor of global security, capable of doing something in real life that the United States can only accomplish in the movies.

Taken literally, this may again seem silly. Surely, only the most ardent believers in the extraterrestrial origins of the UFO would buy into this messaging? Perhaps. Yet, in the United States alone, somewhere between 44 percent and 63 percent of Americans believe in a government UFO coverup, while even serious scholars conceive of UFOs as threats to international order. This means the message could resonate with a broad audience. 

Despite this, the message is not actually meant to be taken literally. On one hand, it should be read as a signal of Chinese capabilities, in which case, the message could be meant to create feelings of insecurity in the domestic U.S. audience, not about aliens but about China's relative power compared to that of the United States. 

On the other hand, the message can be interpreted as a signal to foreign governments about Chinese capabilities vis-√†-vis the United States. That is, it may not be intended for U.S. audiences at all. It may be a message reinforcing China's overarching strategy to those countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region, or in Africa or Latin America, that either remain undecided about whether China or the United States would be a more reliable security partner in the coming years, or that otherwise remain open to the idea of a Chinese-led world order. 

In this respect, as bizarre as it may seem, the release of the Chinese UFO video can function similarly to the conflict between India and Pakistan in May 2025. The short-lived outbreak of hostilities over Kashmir was a military success for India, but thanks to claims that Pakistan's Chinese-supplied air defense systems shot down a number of Western-built Indian fighter craft, Pakistan created a perception of Chinese technical superiority. As a result, China came out of the conflict victorious in the narrative space.

Of course, China ‚Äì like many a nation-state ‚Äì is familiar with the problem of multiple audiences. As such, the release of the video may easily have been intended for both Western and non-Western audiences. In any case, the securitization of the UFO phenomenon in the United States, and the broader politicization of UFOs in Congress, has gifted China with the opportunity to punch at one of the United States' core insecurities by painting it as a nation declining in relative capability.

While most golfers turn to swing coaches when their game goes astray, Norway's Viktor Hovland has been taking mental breaks that are truly out of this world - and this week his cosmic curiosity helped launch his best range session in years.

Hovland, speaking a day after Ryder Cup teammate Ludvig Aberg spilled the beans on the Norwegian's otherworldly interests, said on Thursday he developed an interest in unidentified flying objects as a way to escape the frustrations of professional golf.

When Hovland was told by media that Aberg said he liked to talk about UFOs, the Norwegian was unable to contain a laugh before opening up on his fascination.

""I've always been extremely into my golf, and sometimes you just look at your golf swing and trying to practice hard and you don't really get the results that you want, it can be quite frustrating, and I think it's been one of those things that I've kind of taken my mind off of golf a little bit,"" said Hovland.

World number 12 Hovland went on to explain that his cosmic curiosity had become something of a rabbit hole, offering more questions than answers but ultimately providing the mental break he needs from the grind of professional golf.

""And then the more you go into it, you just get more questions,"" said Hovland.

""It's one of those things that you don't really find any more answers but it's very interesting to go in there and kind of challenge some of your beliefs that you currently hold, and you kind of have to expand your mind a little bit.""

Perhaps the UFO interest is paying off for Hovland, as he was caught on camera ahead of Wednesday's Ryder Cup opening ceremony excitedly telling teammates Shane Lowry and Robert MacIntyre that he had his best range session ""in two years"".

Hovland is making his third consecutive Ryder Cup appearance for Europe this week after being selected by Luke Donald as a captain's pick for the first time.

As a Ryder Cup rookie at Whistling Straits in 2021, Hovland returned with a record of 0-3-2 but turned things around in Rome two years ago as he walked away with an impressive 3-1-1 record as Europe reclaimed the Ryder Cup.

""I don't know which one I learnt more from, but it was very interesting from my own personal experience going through the loss at Whistling Straits,"" said Hovland.

""I felt like I was maybe more timid as a rookie playing on foreign soil.

""I do feel like being on both of those teams has really helped me. It is going to help me this week.""

China appears to have seized on U.S. conspiracy theorists' current and most enduring obsession: unidentified flying objects and the aliens believed by many to pilot them.

A screenshot from a video clip purportedly showing a UFO being shot down over Shandong, China, Sep. 14, 2025.

While Russia has long made an effort to weaponize Western conspiracy theories to exacerbate mistrust and polarization in countries like the United States, China has been slower to catch on. Preferring to focus its early malign influence operations on Taiwan, its big debut in the effort to link information warfare to conspiracy theory occurred during the COVID-19 global pandemic, when the Chinese government helped promote the discredited idea that the virus was manufactured in a U.S. weapons laboratory.

Professional ghost hunter and author Marie Mason of Ghosts Hunter Investigations will conduct paranormal tours at Porterville's Zalud House Museum ahead of Halloween, city officials announced.

The city of Porterville will offer these tours at 8 and 10 p.m. on Oct. 3 and 4. Mason said that her work begins with learning the history of a building, its area, and its residents. 

‚ÄúThe historical part is that as a paranormal investigator, we are investigating the people from the past,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe theory is maybe they want to tell their side of the story, so, therefore, we incorporate the history and say to them, ‚ÄòOK, we know that you shot William Brooks in the chair. Was he really having an affair with you?'""

The spirit boxes and the equipment Mason uses will validate answers in real time, she said.

‚ÄúMaybe the voice box will say, ‚ÄòYes, I shot him.' Then maybe one of the tools will blink over there in the corner,"" she said.

The theory with ghost hunting is that there's ""residual energy or unfinished business,‚Äù Mason said. 

‚ÄúWhat happened at the Zalud House is there was nothing but tragedy, one tragedy after another,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNot only did the whole family die individual weird deaths, but this particular house has all the original items. It's all their same stuff from 1891. That whole entire house is filled with the original people's energy everywhere.‚Äù

Mason was interviewed two weeks before investigating the Zalud House, but she had already done her homework.

John Zalud and his wife, Mary, built the house in 1891, she said.

‚ÄúMary and John had three kids, two daughters and one boy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe son, Edward, died mysteriously in a freak accident. He fell off his horse. 

‚ÄúWho the heck falls off a horse in 1890s?‚Äù Mason asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúThen, daughter Anna married a guy named William Brooks, and he was alleged to have had an affair.

‚ÄúHe was in the Pioneer Hotel, with his friends, laughing about it,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúShe walked in, the lady that he alleged had an affair with, and they were laughing at her. She pulled out a pistol and shot him six times.‚Äù

The chair that he was sitting in still has a bullet hole, Mason said. The chair was donated by the Pioneer Hotel and it's in the bedroom of William Brooks in the Zalud House. 

‚ÄúSometimes when you sit on that chair that still has the bullet hole, people have reported to get pain in their back, exactly where the bullet hole is,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was documented on the Ghost Adventures TV show.‚Äù

With most of its original items, the Zalud House offers Mason ‚Äúresidual energy‚Äù for her investigation.

‚ÄúJust imagine all the fingerprints in that house,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt's residual energy. The residual energy is imperative because it's their items.""

She compared residual energy to DNA technology.

‚ÄúIf you know that somebody in a murder case in 1970 can leave their fingerprint on something, and today they can pull that fingerprint and they can get the DNA of that person, just imagine it on a scale that we're not even familiar with of the spiritual world.""

Zalud house is rare because it remained in the family until each owners' eventual death.

‚ÄúAll of them died by owning that house,"" Mason said. ""Then there were a lot of other little outside tragedies that were bizarre.""

‚ÄúThere's just death surrounding that place everywhere,‚Äù Mason said, before responding to the suggestion that the building may have been cursed. ‚ÄúI don't know about a curse, but what I do know is that when it comes to ghost hunting, you have to go deeper. You have to remember the surrounding area. 

‚ÄúYou had the Indian Wars, the Tule Treaty in 1851, the army was supposed to give them cattle,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey backstabbed the Indians.‚Äù

Mason noted that soon after, the Tule River tribe moved.

Mason said that visitors can expect a real paranormal investigation.

‚ÄúThe equipment that I use is an SLS camera, which is a Kinect,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI use a DNA box that will telekinetically use a ‚Äòword bank.' The theory is the ghosts are telekinetically grabbing the words and saying the words out loud.

‚ÄúThe third thing is we use the SP7 Spirit Box, and you hear a lot of static,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt's a regular radio, and it goes from channel to channel to channel at like 100 milliseconds, and the spirits have the ability to grab words going at 100 milliseconds.‚Äù 

Even with the equipment, Mason said the most important equipment for a paranormal investigation is their body. 

‚ÄúWhen you're in the room and you're investigating, you have to pay attention to your body,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLike, is your body shaking?

‚ÄúThe theory is it's energy,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThe room will get cold. Why does it get cold? They're sucking the energy because they're using energy from, let's say, your camera or your batteries to use it to manifest or to move an object.""

Museum curators have claimed to see shadow figures in the house.

‚ÄúThen they can smell the medicine in Mary's room, the medicine she used to take (for tuberculosis). Sometimes you hear stories of perfume, or sometimes you can smell a cigar,"" Mason said. ""I mean, it's bizarre how that can come through to this time frame. It's bizarre to think how is that possible.""

There have also been reports of items being moved or misplaced, Mason said.

‚ÄúSome say that the ghost doesn't like people sitting on their bed, and you'll see indentations in the bed,"" she added.

Tours are $50 per person, and limited to groups of seven adults. For more information visit the city of Porterville website.","{'href': 'https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com', 'title': 'Visalia Times-Delta'}","other"

Space stories often dwell on the vast unknown of the cosmos, but sometimes the absolute terror comes when astronauts return home. The new trailer for Jess Varley's ‚ÄúThe Astronaut‚Äù suggests that survival in orbit may have been easy, as isolation, paranoia, and something not of this world creep into the atmosphere.

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles won Us over when they played brothers on Supernatural ‚Äî and they have remained booked and busy since The CW show came to an end.

Padalecki and Ackles played the monster-hunting duo from 2005 to 2020. After appearing in over 300 episodes of the hit series, Padalecki exclusively told Us Weekly that he felt he would ‚Äúnever really say goodbye‚Äù to his character.

‚ÄúWe really have become a family,‚Äù he said at the time about the journey. ‚ÄúOver 15 years, we've cut the fat. We didn't fire anybody but if they didn't like being there, they move on. So the people that are there want to be there.‚Äù

Ackles felt the same way, which inspired him to expand the Supernatural universe. (The Winchesters series ran from 2022 to 2023 and focused on Dean (Ackles) and Sam's (Padalecki) parents in the '70s.)

‚ÄúIt's a long journey,‚Äù Ackles teased during a TV Critics' Association press tour panel that same year. ‚ÄúI don't think it's ever going to be over. It's just going to go away for a while. I don't know how long.‚Äù

Outside of Supernatural, Padalecki and Ackles have scored a plethora of opportunities ‚Äî some of which even allowed them to cross paths again with each other or their former costars. Keep scrolling for an extensive breakdown of their ongoing list of TV projects:


Padalecki initially remained at The CW after wrapping up Supernatural. He was cast as the lead on the Walker, Texas Ranger reboot from 2020 to 2024, where he also served as executive producer. After Walker inspired the Walker: Independence prequel, Padalecki had an unnamed cameo in one episode.

Ackles, meanwhile, joined Walker as a director, but also scored a cameo in the role of Miles Vyas.

Season 3 of CBS' hit series Fire Country introduced Padalecki as Camden Casey in a three-episode arc meant to set up a potential spinoff. Fire Country: Surfside would follow Padalecki as a California firefighter dealing with the aftermath of his brother's death in the field.

Ackles' role as Soldier Boy on The Boys was a shocking departure for those of Us who loved him as Dean on Supernatural. The shakeup, however, paved the way for Ackles to score his own prequel series titled Vought Rising ‚Äî and a guest spot on the Gen V spinoff.

Padalecki joined in on the fun with a yet-to-be-announced role in the fifth and final season alongside Misha Collins. The opportunity reunites Padalecki with Ackles and creator Eric Kripke, who was part of Supernatural before coming onboard The Boys.

After working with showrunner Anna Fricke on Walker, Padalecki reunited with her on an untitled series for CBS about a headstrong country doctor practicing a unique style of improvisational medicine. The show is in development as part of Padalecki's ongoing first-look deal.

A guest role in season 2 led to Ackles joining the main cast of Big Sky as Beau Arlen alongside Reba McEntire.

Ackles found a way to return to his roots with The Winchesters, a Supernatural spinoff set in an alternate continuity. The actor narrated the show as his character Dean and served as an executive producer alongside wife Danneel Ackles.

Proving once again that Ackles knows what his fans want, he signed on to play Justin Harley‚Äòs onscreen brother on Tracker. In addition to the Smallville reunion, the introduction to Ackles as Russell paved the way for some fun Easter eggs.

The Prime Video series stars Ackles as Mark, a LAPD officer who is recruited to join a secret task force of undercover agents from all branches of law enforcement to investigate a suspicious murder that takes place in broad daylight.

A former psychic medium who became a Christian told The Christian Post that reports of witches cursing Charlie Kirk before his assassination could spread unnecessary fear by distracting from God's sovereignty.

""Nothing happens without God's permission,"" said Jenn Nizza, a former psychic medium who is now an author and podcaster who runs the website Ex-PsychicSaved.com.

Two days before Kirk was fatally shot in Utah by a 22-year-old assassin with leftist political views, the feminist news website Jezebel published an article by an unnamed staffer who said she had hired witches on the online marketplace Etsy to invoke ""multiple curses"" on the 31-year-old Turning Point USA co-founder.

The article, titled ""We Paid Some Etsy Witches to Curse Charlie Kirk,"" called Kirk a ""far-right misogynist"" and mentioned a spell to invoke hatred against him, with the author noting she was promised results within weeks and offered the choice of paying extra to ""amplify the energetic support.""

The article also noted that one of the witches confirmed to the author that requests for curses against political figures have risen in recent years. Formal occult activity against President Donald Trump repeatedly made headlines during his first term, with members of the ""#MagicResistance"" casting ""binding spells"" against him and his associates.

After Kirk was slain and their article faced backlash on social media, the outlet first appended an editor's note condemning political violence before deleting the article ""on the recommendation of our lawyers,"" claiming it was intended to be satirical.

Two days ago, this outlet promoted paying a witch to curse Charlie Kirk to make him be on the receiving end of hatred.Now they disavow themselves of the consequences of their rhetoric.The media has blood on its hands. pic.twitter.com/3LS6MDOQeN

The article had left Kirk and his wife, Erika, ""rattled,"" prompting them to ask a friend to pray over them the day before he was shot, according to conservative political commentator Megyn Kelly, who is friends with the Kirk family.

""Erika and Charlie Kirk heard about these curses, and that news genuinely rattled Erika, in particular,"" Kelly said on her Monday podcast. ""She knew Christian teaching on the subject, she loved Charlie, absolutely, and she was scared when she heard of the curses Jezebel had called up.""

""She eventually worked it through, and so did Charlie,"" said added. ""As she later told me, 'Weapons will form, but not prosper; that Satan and those witches have no power.' Of course, God's will is the one that matters, and His blessing over Charlie was real and palpable.""

The night before Charlie Kirk was murdered, Erika Kirk called a friend to come over to their house to pray for Charlie after feminist website, Jezebel, paid witches on Etsy to curse him, according to Megyn Kelly.Jezebel bragged just two days before Charlie was assassinated‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/c5NQqCkyVW

Nizza told CP the idea that occult practitioners have ultimate power over life and death is a lie, and that anything their witchcraft happens to accomplish remains under the authority of God.

""Do I think that witches really were putting hexes and curses on Charlie? Probably. Do I think that they have any power to ultimately say who lives or dies? No, that's up to God,"" she said.

In a TikTok video posted last week, Nizza warned against focusing on the potential role that occultists and the demonic forces they invoke might have played in Kirk's murder. She admonished Christians to avoid descending into a spiral of fear and anger that distracts from God's sovereignty and faithfulness, a temptation she implied is part of the spiritual attack.

""They want to think that they have the power of God, and that's simply not true,"" Nizza said of occultists, whose activity she said ultimately leads to their own destruction. ""Don't fall for that way of thinking. God is sovereign over all things. God allowed Charlie to come home. Demons are on a short leash. Please try to remember that.""

Regarding whether she believes spiritual warfare is escalating in the wake of Kirk's assassination, Nizza told CP she remains optimistic that God will use any evil intentions to accomplish His will.

""I would say revival is upon us. Actually, I think that this is a classic but amplified case of 'what he meant for harm, God meant for good,'"" she said, paraphrasing Joseph's words to his brothers in Genesis 50:20, after their plans to persecute him ultimately led to saving his own people from famine.

Nizza also referenced the story of Pharaoh's sorcerers in Exodus, who she said were at first ""able to go tit-for-tat"" with Moses until the power of God overwhelmed their occult abilities when the Nile River turned to blood.

""They can't undo that,"" she said of whatever dark forces the Egyptian sorcerers were invoking. ""They can't make something clean. They can't purify something.""

Nizza suggested the promotion of the Gospel in the wake of Kirk's murder might be leading to a spiritual purification.

""Satan always loses, he always loses,"" she said. ""Charlie Kirk went home to Jesus Christ, so that's number one; number two, Charlie Kirk's voice got magnified.""

She noted millions heard the Gospel during Kirk's memorial service in Glendale, Arizona. In what has been dubbed ""the Charlie effect,"" reports have emerged of a surge in church attendance after his death.

""Here's God with this huge turn of events ‚Äî what they thought was going to be for evil, God intended for good to save many lives,"" she said.

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific

China appears to have seized on U.S. conspiracy theorists' current and most enduring obsession: unidentified flying objects and the aliens believed by many to pilot them.

A screenshot from a video clip purportedly showing a UFO being shot down over Shandong, China, Sep. 14, 2025.

While Russia has long made an effort to weaponize Western conspiracy theories to exacerbate mistrust and polarization in countries like the United States, China has been slower to catch on. Preferring to focus its early malign influence operations on Taiwan, its big debut in the effort to link information warfare to conspiracy theory occurred during the COVID-19 global pandemic, when the Chinese government helped promote the discredited idea that the virus was manufactured in a U.S. weapons laboratory. The Chinese social media and content creation platform, TikTok, has also been a major vector for conspiracy theory, promoting the circulation of videos on all manner of conspiracy theories, from the hollow to the flat earth and beyond. However, China's latest foray into conspiracy theory appears to have seized on U.S. conspiracy theorists' current and most enduring obsession: unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and the aliens believed by many to pilot them.

What is driving the puzzling politics of the UFO in great power competition? China appears to be taking advantage of the confluence of three recent events: the recent discovery of a chemical biosignature on Mars; misinformation about the serendipitous passage of an extra-solar cometary body, 3I/ATLAS, through the solar system this year; and, most importantly, the ongoing fascination with the topic of UFOs in the U.S. Congress. While these three things are just the latest in an ongoing moment of American cultural fascination with all things extraterrestrial, the events taken together have created a unique opportunity for Beijing to target U.S. conspiracy theorists and possibly audiences well beyond the United States with a signal about its advancing military capabilities.

A video recorded in Shandong, China on September 12 went viral on Chinese social media before being recirculated in the West by The Daily Mail, Newsweek, and a number of other outlets. Ostensibly showing the successful destruction of a UFO over the skies of China, the video depicts a slow-moving object being successfully intercepted by a fast-moving missile, with both going up in a ball of fire. Videos reposting and dissecting the footage have racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. 

Although there is nothing else to the video, the exact message behind the apparent missile test is clear from the headlines: China can successfully shoot down a UFO. 

This might seem silly, but the information operation at the heart of the video's release is communicating something more serious. By properly contextualizing the Chinese UFO video, the full content and gravity of the message becomes clear.

To that end, consider the clamor raised in Congress over the past few years about UFOs in U.S. airspace and other U.S. military operational environments. Just three days before the appearance of the Shandong footage, members of Congress released another video ‚Äì this one raising concerns about the United States' own inability to successfully accomplish the same mission. Provided to Congress by the U.S. military whistleblowers, the video shows what appears to be a Hellfire missile targeting a fast-moving UFO in airspace over Yemen. The missile ‚Äúbounces off‚Äù without detonating, and the alleged UFO continues on its journey mostly unphased.

In reality, the video likely depicts a missile fired by one drone bouncing off another, with the failed detonation being the result of the fact that the missile is tailored for air-to-ground operations. The video represents the disclosure of the first known instance when the MQ-9 Reaper drone was used in an air-to-air operation. The failed detonation could be thus the result of the same atypical mission set. 

But the Hellfire missile's bladed ‚ÄúGinsu‚Äù variant has reportedly been used previously in Yemen, suggesting another plausible explanation for a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù detonation: It is also conceivable that the video shows a missile piercing a balloon or similar object. If this is the case, the video would appear to be a repeat of the shootdown of the Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States for a week back in 2023. 

Either way, the ongoing military operations targeted at Yemen-based terrorist organizations, and the threat of Houthi drones emanating from the region, it makes sense that U.S. forces in the region would strike down any potentially hostile aerial objects, be they drones or balloons.

Yet, the kinds of things depicted in the decontextualized, black and white, infrared video lacking clear resolution ‚Äì illusions of rapid movement, nebulous objects ‚Äì often pass for evidence in conspiracy theory belief communities, an audience that rarely brooks with such explanations. Thanks to phenomena like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and the so-called ‚Äúbackfire effect,‚Äù conspiracy theorists instead often prefer fantastic narratives that support their preexisting beliefs and misperceptions. These the exact sorts of bias targeted by China's sophisticated information operations. 

Worse, because the message is amplified by the congressional bullhorn, China is able to target a much wider audience than the average conspiracy theorist. By watching these two videos together, the full message for a much larger audience becomes clear: China can successfully shoot down a UFO; the United States cannot. In other words, the release of the Chinese video is a signal designed to erode confidence in U.S. military capabilities, and with it, decades of U.S. soft power messaging to the contrary.

Hollywood movies from ‚ÄúStargate‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù to ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattleship‚Äù have long reinforced the idea of U.S. hegemony and the U.S.-led world order through the depiction of the U.S. military leading a global resistance to extraterrestrial invasion. But movies are fiction. Thanks to the narrative being promoted about the Yemen drone strike, China has positioned itself as the real deal ‚Äì with Congress inadvertently providing its stamp of approval on Beijing's strategic messaging. As such, the politics of the UFO in great power competition make China out to be a guarantor of global security, capable of doing something in real life that the United States can only accomplish in the movies.

Taken literally, this may again seem silly. Surely, only the most ardent believers in the extraterrestrial origins of the UFO would buy into this messaging? Perhaps. Yet, in the United States alone, somewhere between 44 percent and 63 percent of Americans believe in a government UFO coverup, while even serious scholars conceive of UFOs as threats to international order. This means the message could resonate with a broad audience. 

Despite this, the message is not actually meant to be taken literally. On one hand, it should be read as a signal of Chinese capabilities, in which case, the message could be meant to create feelings of insecurity in the domestic U.S. audience, not about aliens but about China's relative power compared to that of the United States. 

On the other hand, the message can be interpreted as a signal to foreign governments about Chinese capabilities vis-√†-vis the United States. That is, it may not be intended for U.S. audiences at all. It may be a message reinforcing China's overarching strategy to those countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region, or in Africa or Latin America, that either remain undecided about whether China or the United States would be a more reliable security partner in the coming years, or that otherwise remain open to the idea of a Chinese-led world order. 

In this respect, as bizarre as it may seem, the release of the Chinese UFO video can function similarly to the conflict between India and Pakistan in May 2025. The short-lived outbreak of hostilities over Kashmir was a military success for India, but thanks to claims that Pakistan's Chinese-supplied air defense systems shot down a number of Western-built Indian fighter craft, Pakistan created a perception of Chinese technical superiority. As a result, China came out of the conflict victorious in the narrative space.

Of course, China ‚Äì like many a nation-state ‚Äì is familiar with the problem of multiple audiences. As such, the release of the video may easily have been intended for both Western and non-Western audiences. In any case, the securitization of the UFO phenomenon in the United States, and the broader politicization of UFOs in Congress, has gifted China with the opportunity to punch at one of the United States' core insecurities by painting it as a nation declining in relative capability. This can, in turn, ultimately pay off for Beijing both by eroding US domestic political will for sustained competition or conflict with China, and by broadening China's international base of support.

In this article

CoreWeave on Thursday announced a $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI, expanding its current agreement with the artificial intelligence startup behind ChatGPT.

The new agreement brings the AI cloud infrastructure provider's total contracts with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.

""This milestone affirms the trust that world-leading innovators have in CoreWeave's ability to power the most demanding inference and training workloads at an unmatched pace,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in a statement.

In March, CoreWeave announced an $11.9-billion agreement with OpenAI to provide AI datacenters and technology over five years. Intrator told CNBC in May that the companies expanded the agreement by $4 billion.

CoreWeave, which went public in March, makes money by renting out and building data centers packed with numerous Nvidia graphics processing units. The company is backed by Nvidia and makes a significant chunk of its revenue from Microsoft, which is a key investor in OpenAI.

At the time of its prospectus, CoreWeave said it operated 32 datacenters powered by more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs. Its datacenter plans span the U.S. and parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden. 

Some of CoreWeave latest projects include a $6-billion deal for an initial 100 megawatt datacenter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and a multibillion-dollar commitment to building up AI datacenter capacity in the U.K.

Companies across the AI sector are racing to meet booming demand for computing capacity. That's ramped up the pressure on companies such as Open Ai and Nvidia.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC's Jon Fortt earlier this week that the compute constraints faced by the AI company and industry ""have been terrible.""

""We're so limited right now in the services we can offer,"" he added. 

Earlier this week, Nvidia announced a $100-billion investment in OpenAI to support its datacenter buildout using the chipmaker's AI processors.

OpenAI and Databricks are two of the most highly valued tech startups on the planet. Now they're working together.

Databricks, a data analytics software vendor, said Thursday that it has committed to spending $100 million over multiple years with OpenAI. Databricks is making it easier for customers to connect their data stored in its cloud service with GPT-5, announced in August, and other OpenAI models.

OpenAI, which was recently valued by private investors at $500 billion, has become a household name in the years since the launch of its ChatGPT in late 2022. In partnering with Databricks, valued at more than $100 billion in its latest funding round, OpenAI has landed its first formal integration with a business-focused product vendor, said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's operating chief, in a news conference Wednesday.

Lightcap said the company's ""aspiration is a multiple"" of the $100 million spending commitment in terms of revenue the agreement will generate.

Databricks has formed similar partnerships with Google and with Anthropic. But OpenAI is leading the way with more than 700 million people using its ChatGPT assistant, powered by GPT-5, every week.

The company was making enterprise more of a focus even before the Databricks deal. Microsoft has been bringing OpenAI models into businesses, governments and schools. And OpenAI has been building up its own sales function.

Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said the partnership will simplify the process for its customers when it comes to accessing OpenAI's models, which they've already been using in large numbers.

Until now, if a Databricks customer wanted to tap a proprietary OpenAI model to help analyze internal data, it would have required extensive configuration, as well as legal and security sign-off.

""The key difference here is that any database customer automatically now, just by clicking in the UI, can start using this product,"" Ghodsi said, referring to the user interface. Ghodsi said the price is similar to what it would cost if the user went directly to OpenAI.

Greg Ulrich, Mastercard's chief AI and data officer, said he's optimistic about the integration.

""It enables opportunity for research and targeted experimentation, using AI to solve new problems, bringing value to customers, enhancing employee productivity, in an environment that we trust, that we know,"" Ulrich said.

It's an increasingly competitive space.

Databricks rival Snowflake, which has a market cap of $75 billion, announced an expansion of its Microsoft partnership in February, enabling the use of OpenAI models. Oracle, which has a $300 billion cloud contract from OpenAI, said two weeks ago that in October it will launch a service for running Google, OpenAI and xAI models on data stored in its database software.

Databricks said earlier this month that it now generates more than $4 billion in annualized revenue, growing over 50% year over year, with $1 billion coming from AI products. The company's $100 billion valuation was announced alongside a $1 billion funding round.

OpenAI and Databricks ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.

            Hundreds of US generals and admirals around the globe have been called to Virginia for a meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth next Tuesday, several US officials told CNN, though the reason for the meeting is unclear.
    


            The meeting is expected to be held at the military installation in Quantico, Virginia, multiple officials said, adding that no one seems to know what the meeting is about, including the general and flag officers themselves, or why it was suddenly added to the calendar.
    


            One source familiar said they'd heard theories ranging from a group physical fitness test, to receiving a briefing on the state of the Defense Department, to a mass firing of officers, but regardless of the reason the sudden convening of so many senior military officers is highly unusual.
    


            ‚ÄúIt's being referred to as the general squid games,‚Äù one official quipped.
    


            Some officials also voiced security concerns about having so many high-ranking officers in one place at the same time. A congressional aide told CNN that unless Hegseth planned to announce ‚Äúa major new military campaign or a complete overhaul of the military command structure, I can't imagine a good reason for this.‚Äù
    


            The Washington Post first reported news of the meeting early Thursday.
    


            Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed that Hegseth will be ‚Äúaddressing his senior military leaders early next week.‚Äù The Pentagon did not answer specific questions about the purpose of the meeting or if the directive was for all general and flag officers in the military.
    


            It's unclear if the order was for all general and flag officers ‚Äî those with the rank of one star or higher ‚Äî or just those in certain command or leadership roles
    


Hegseth shuts down group advising on women in the military



            The meeting comes as the Trump administration has fired a slew of high-profile general and flag officers since taking office in January, in many instances due to Hegseth's campaign against diversity-related issues, but often also for unspecified reasons. Hegseth also ordered the Defense Department in May to cut the number of four-star generals and admirals by at least 20%.
    


            The officers who have been fired thus far include former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown; Adm. Lisa Franchetti, former Chief of Naval Operations; Adm. Linda Fagan, former Commandant of the Coast Guard; Gen. James Slife, former vice chief of the Air Force; Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, former head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency; Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, former chief of the Navy Reserve; and Rear Adm. Milton Sands, former head of Naval Special Warfare Command.
    


            Before taking on the role of defense secretary, Hegseth repeatedly voiced disdain for much of the military's currently serving general and flag officer corps. In a podcast appearance last summer, Hegseth said a third of the military's senior officers are ‚Äúactively complicit‚Äù in what he argued is a move towards politicization of the military. In a second podcast, he said senior officers are ‚Äúplaying by all the wrong rules‚Äù to cater to ‚Äúidealogues in Washington, DC.‚Äù

Ryan Walters, who has led Oklahoma public schools since 2022, is quitting to run a conservative education non-profit

Oklahoma's superintendent, who has attracted national attention as he sought to install religion and rightwing viewpoints in Oklahoma schools, will resign to run a conservative education non-profit.

Ryan Walters, who has led public schools in Oklahoma since 2022, has put Donald Trump-endorsed Bibles into classrooms and required teaching 2020 election conspiracies.

He is leaving the post to lead the Teacher Freedom Alliance (TFA), which says its mission is to help teachers develop ‚Äúfree, moral, and upright American citizens‚Äù. On its website, the group is touting Walters as its new leader.

‚ÄúWalters fearlessly fights the woke liberal union mob. TFA will take the fight straight to the unions and we will not stop,‚Äù the website says. ‚ÄúTogether, we will build a national movement that is centered on freedom and common sense, not on bullying and intimidation. Educators will now be able to break free.‚Äù

Walters announced his move on Fox on Wednesday night, teasing his appearance by writing on X: ‚Äúliberal's worst nightmare is about to become true‚Äù. On Fox, he said he wanted to ‚Äúdestroy the teachers unions‚Äù and ‚Äúbuild an army of teachers to defeat the teachers unions once and for all‚Äù. He said that his plan is to take the fight he started in Oklahoma to a national scale.

A local Fox affiliate reported tallied more than 400 national media appearances in the last two years by Walters as he sought to raise his profile nationally while pursuing a Christian nationalist agenda in Oklahoma, rejecting church and state separation and installing Christian viewpoints in governance.

Walters has repeatedly pushed Christianity into public schools in Oklahoma. He once tried to require schools to play a video of him praying. He advocated for the country's first Catholic public charter school. This week, he called for chapters of Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA in all Oklahoma schools.

He also has fought against teachers, particularly claiming they are pushing ‚Äúwoke indoctrination‚Äù in Oklahoma schools. He wants teachers coming from liberal states to include an ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù certification. He put prominent rightwing figures such as the activist behind Libs of TikTok and the leader of the Heritage Foundation on state education committees. Libs of TikTok and other conservative influencers advocated for Walters to become US education secretary under Trump.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed two Russian An-26 transport aircraft and two radar stations in a drone attack on occupied Crimea, the agency reported on Sept. 25.  

The strike is part of ongoing efforts to destroy high-value Russian assets on the peninsula, HUR said. 

According to the agency, its special forces set fire to the aircraft and destroyed a Russian surface surveillance radar system along with the MR-10M1 Mys M1 coastal radar station.

The An-26, a Soviet-era twin-engine turboprop aircraft, has been widely used for short- and medium-haul transport, capable of carrying up to 40 troops or 5.5 tons of cargo. 

The radar station is a coastal defense system that provides early warning and tracks surface sea targets.

""How well the Muscovites' An-26 transport aircraft burn - watch the video!"" HUR said in a post on social media.

Occupied Crimea has remained a key target of Ukrainian strikes, with recent weeks seeing intensified operations against airfields, radar stations, and other military infrastructure on the peninsula.

HUR reported on Sept. 21 destroying three Russian Mi-8 helicopters and a radar station in Crimea. 

Just one day later, Ukrainian forces struck two Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft.

""With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land,"" Trump told the press in the White House during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

NORAD dispatched an E-3, four F-16s, and four KC-135 tankers to track two Russian Tu-95 bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets.

The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for such strikes, saying, ""We will work on it.""

""It's not my goal ‚Äî elections... My goal is to finish the war,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

U.S. President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Thursday with the Republican leader signaling that the U.S. government's hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara may soon be lifted.

During Trump's first term, the United States kicked out Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after it purchased an air defence system from Russia. U.S. officials worried that Turkey's use of Russia's S-400 surface-to-air missile system could be used to gather data on the capabilities of the F-35 and that the information could end up in Russian hands.

Trump started his Oval Office meeting with Erdogan by offering hope that a resolution to the matter could be hatched during the day's talks.

‚ÄúHe needs certain things, and we need certain things, and we're going to come to a conclusion,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúYou'll know by the end of the day.‚Äù

The visit is Erdogan's first trip to the White House since 2019. The two leaders forged what Trump has described as a ‚Äúvery good relationship‚Äù during his first White House go-around despite the U.S.-Turkey relationship often being complicated.

U.S. officials have cited concerns about Turkey's human rights record under Erdogan and the country's ties with Russia. Tensions between Turkey and Israel, another important American ally, over Gaza and Syria have at times made relations difficult with Turkey.

Trump in remarks before reporters focused his concerns on Turkey's continued economic relationship with Russia.

Turkey has been one of the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuel since the European Union announced in early 2023 it would boycott most Russian seaborne oil.

Since January 2023, Ankara has purchased more than $90 billion in Russian oil, coal and natural gas. Only China and India have bought more from Russia in that period.

‚ÄúThe best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,‚Äù Trump said of Erdogan.

Trump added that Erdogan is respected by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

‚ÄúI think he could have a big influence if he wants to,‚Äù Trump said.

The push on Erdogan to become more engaged in pressuring Putin comes after Trump earlier this week said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia in the war. It was a dramatic shift from Trump's repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war

Erdogan has made clear he is eager to see the hold on F-35s lifted, telling Trump that he came prepared to ‚Äúthoroughly discuss‚Äù the issue.

The Turkish president was even blunter in a television interview this week. ‚ÄúI don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go,‚Äù Erdogan said in an interview this week on Fox News Channel's Special Report with Bret Baier.

President Joe Biden's administration kept Erdogan, who has served as Turkey's president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, at an arm's length during the Democrat's four years in office.

The reluctance to engage deeply was borne out of Turkey's record of democratic backsliding as well as Ankara's close ties to Moscow.

Opposition parties and human rights organizations have accused Erdogan of undermining democracy and curbing freedom of expression during his more than two decades in power. International observers say that baseless investigations and prosecutions of human rights activists, journalists, opposition politicians and others remain a persistent problem in Turkey.

Trump sees Erdogan as a critical partner and credible intermediary in his effort to find ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The Republican's administration is also largely in sync with Turkey's approach to Syria as both nations piece together their posture toward the once isolated country after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in December.

Trump and European leaders have followed Erdogan in embracing Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once commanded a rebel group that was designated a foreign terrorist organization.

Trump also said that Erdogan deserves credit for backing the rebel forces that ousted Assad from Syria.

‚ÄúI think President Erdogan is the one responsible for Syria, for the successful fight in ridding Syria of its past leader,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúHe doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement.‚Äù

Trump's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, met with al-Sharaa Monday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

Erdogan has sought to position his country as a point of stability in a tumultuous moment. He believes Turkey can play an essential role for European security and is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine, Syria and U.S. tariffs that have sparked a global trade war.

Turkey also believes it has emerged as a credible broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia.

Turkey is an influential actor in neighbouring Syria as the rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power last December. However, the fall of Assad aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and Israel, with their conflicting interests pushing the relationship toward a possible collision course.

Trump has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù in his dealings with Ankara.

Erdogan on Tuesday took part in a group meeting hosted by Trump on the sidelines of the General Assembly, when Trump gathered the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim countries to discuss the war in Gaza.

Erdogan has been critical of Israel's handling of the war, which was launched after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and takin about 250 people captive. More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and about 90% of homes in the territory have been destroyed or damaged.

Erdogan, in his UN address, alleged that Israeli forces have committed genocide, an allegation contested by Israel and United States.

            William Shatner's goal is clearly to ‚Äúlive long and prosper.‚Äù
    


            But fans of the legendary ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù actor were shook after TMZ reported Wednesday that the 94-year-old had been rushed to the hospital after suffering ‚Äúa medical emergency.‚Äù
    


            According to the site, Shatner's agent, Harry Gold, told them the star ‚Äúexperienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon and was checked out.‚Äù

            Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has the support of every living former chair of the central bank's powerful Board in her legal battle with President Donald Trump, who tried to fire her last month based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, according to an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court Thursday.
    


            An appeals court earlier this month kept Cook in her post through a preliminary injunction while her lawsuit challenging Trump's firing attempt moves forward ‚Äî just days before the central bank's September policy meeting. The administration appealed that decision, and is now being considered by the nation's highest court.
    


            Former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen warned against overturning the injunction, stating that it would ‚Äúthreaten‚Äù the Fed's independence of politics and ‚Äúerode public confidence in the Fed.‚Äù The brief was also signed off by some Republicans who once served in high-ranking government roles, such as former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Glenn Hubbard.
    


            The 32-page document details the historical importance of the Fed's policy decisions being free of political considerations, which is mostly the role it plays in keeping the US economy stable. At stake is the Fed's hard-fought reputation with investors and the rest of the world, according to the brief.
    


            Damaging the Fed's credibility could interfere with one of the institution's core missions of keeping inflation in check, the brief said.
    


            ‚ÄúThe Fed's ability to fight inflation is directly related not only to its actual insulation from short-term political pressures but also to the public's perception of its independence‚Äîbecause if the public and financial markets believe that the Federal Reserve is sufficiently insulated, they will act in accordance with that expectation, resulting in lower and more stable inflation, which is consistent with lower long-term interest rates,‚Äù according to the brief.
    


            Meanwhile, the allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook haven't been taken to court. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte first raised the accusations on social media and it is now being investigated by the Justice Department. So far, the administration hasn't revealed a smoking gun.



            Cook's legal battle is part of Trump's broader attempt to reshape the Fed's top ranks.
    


            At the central bank's rate-setting meeting earlier this month, Cook deliberated the economy alongside the newest Fed Governor Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser to Trump and who is taking an unpaid leave to serve a vacated term on the central bank's Board of Governors. Miran was sworn in an hour before the Fed's September 16-17 meeting, he told CNBC last week.

US President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on what he described as ‚Äúradical left terrorism‚Äù after a gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others.

The authorities identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn, 29, who died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing from a rooftop overlooking the ICE Field Office. Investigators said shell casings recovered at the scene bore the words ‚ÄúANTI-ICE‚Äù written in blue marker.

No ICE agents were harmed in the attack. The three victims were detainees inside a transport van at the facility's sally port, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Mexican Foreign Ministry confirmed that one of the injured was a Mexican national.

In light of today's horrific shooting that appears to be motivated by a hatred for ICE, Secretary Noem has ordered DHS to immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country.This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/PKZRc8F8jZ

In a post on Truth Social, Trump called the attack ‚Äúdespicable‚Äù and directly blamed Democratic rhetoric for inciting violence against law enforcement.

‚ÄúThe continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, must be stopped,‚Äù he wrote, pledging to sign an executive order this week to ‚Äúdismantle these domestic terrorism networks.‚Äù

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that more ICE officers would be hired and that security would be increased at ICE facilities nationwide. She described the shooter as ‚Äúevil‚Äù and accused Democratic lawmakers of ‚Äúdemonizing‚Äù law enforcement.

Vice President J.D. Vance also labeled Jahn a ‚Äúviolent left-wing extremist,‚Äù saying evidence not yet made public indicates that the attack was politically motivated. ‚ÄúYou don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell,‚Äù he said.

Jahn's brother, Noah, expressed shock at his involvement, saying he had not known him to hold strong political views or hostility toward ICE. Public records show Jahn had past drug-related convictions and was registered as an independent voter.

The FBI described the Dallas incident as ‚Äútargeted violence.‚Äù It was the second attack on an ICE facility in Texas in recent months, following the July shooting of a police officer outside a detention center in Alvarado.

UNITED NATIONS, September 25. /TASS/. NATO and the European Union have declared a real war on Russia through Ukraine, and are already directly participating in it, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a meeting of G20 foreign ministers.

He noted that the refusal to adhere to the principles of the UN Charter is ""a manifestation of neocolonial ambitions, [which] leads to increased global instability and breeds regional conflicts.""

""A clear example is the crisis in Ukraine, provoked by the collective West, through which NATO and the European Union want to declare, in fact, have already declared a real war on my country and are directly participating in it,"" Lavrov said at the event taking place on the sidelines of the high-level week of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly.

""The escalation in the Middle East is in the same row,"" Lavrov continued. ""The unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has already claimed the lives of 65,000 people, and some UN officials working in the Middle East say there are estimates that the death toll is 10 times higher.

Interior department says National Park Service removed statue of pair holding hands because of incorrect permit

An impromptu statue of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands was unceremoniously removed from the National Mall in Washington just a day after a group of anonymous artists erected it there.

The piece showed the president and the late convicted sex offender, who were friends in the past, looking joyful together, with wide grins and feet kicked back.

A plaque stated that it was built in honor of friendship month. ‚ÄúWe celebrate the long-lasting bond between President Donald J Trump and his ‚Äòclosest friend' Jeffrey Epstein,‚Äù the accompanying text stated.

The Secret Handshake, the group that created the art, had obtained a permit that allowed it to keep the statue displayed on the in the capital until 8pm on Sunday.

But the National Park Service, the federal agency that oversees the area, removed the statue because ‚Äúit was not compliant with the permit issued‚Äù, Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for Department of the Interior, said to CNN.

Trump, who usually is adept at shaking free of any scandal, has not been able to temper the widespread curiosity and also anger from some on the right over the administration not disclosing the so-called Epstein files ‚Äì all the material the authorities have on the business dealings, crimes and investigations into same regarding the New York financier, who killed himself in jail while awaiting federal trial in 2019 on sex-trafficking offenses. His accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a long prison sentence.

A Secret Handshake artist who identified himself as Patrick but would not provide his full name to the Guardian said in a telephone interview that the group built the Trump-Epstein statue to ‚Äúhonor the one and only true friend Donald Trump seems to have in his life‚Äù.

In 2002, Trump told New York magazine that Epstein was a ‚Äúterrific guy‚Äù and ‚Äúa lot of fun to be with‚Äù but has repeatedly said in recent times that the two fell out long ago. The White House has called Epstein ‚Äúa creep‚Äù.

Epstein had also told the journalist Michael Wolff that he was Trump's ‚Äúclosest friend for 10 years‚Äù.

Trump recently said he was ‚Äúnot a fan‚Äù of Epstein and that he stopped talking to him because Epstein ‚Äústole people that worked for me‚Äù.

Patrick said he was confused by the authorities' decision to remove the statue.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration has mostly been all about rebuilding statues that have already been torn down, of Confederate generals and other racist tropes and figures from the past‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would argue that Trump is a racist figure from the past, so why would you tear that down?‚Äù

In a statement to the New York Times, the White House said: ‚ÄúDemocrats, the media and the organization that's wasting their money on this statue knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents.‚Äù","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ana Reyes says firings likely violated federal law but do not justify reinstatement before lawsuit ends

A federal judge refused on Wednesday evening to reinstate eight former inspectors general who filed a lawsuit after the Trump administration fired them with no warning and little explanation.

US district judge Ana Reyes said that while Donald Trump likely violated the federal law governing the process for removing the non-partisan watchdogs from office, the president's firings didn't cause enough irreparable harm to justify reinstating the watchdogs before the lawsuit is resolved.

The eight plaintiffs were among 17 inspectors general who were fired by Trump on 24 January. Each received identical two-sentence emails from the White House that attributed their removal to unspecified ‚Äúchanging priorities‚Äù. The mass firings targeted all but two of the cabinet agencies' inspectors general.

Plaintiffs' attorneys said the firings were unlawful because the administration didn't give the US Congress the legally required 30-day notice or provide a ‚Äúsubstantive, case-specific rationale‚Äù for removing them.

Government attorneys said the president can remove inspectors general ‚Äú without any showing of cause‚Äù and doesn't have to wait 30 days after providing notice to Congress.

The judge noted that even if the inspectors general were reinstated, Trump could simply give notice to Congress and have them removed from their positions 30 days later.

Inspectors general are responsible for rooting out waste and fraud and other malpractice in federal agencies. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the US Senate.

Reyes said the inspectors general had provided ‚Äúexceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations‚Äù.

‚ÄúThey deserved better from their government. They still do,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, this Court cannot provide Plaintiffs more.‚Äù

Reyes said the plaintiffs can be legally compensated later if they win their lawsuit.

The plaintiffs were inspectors general at the Small Business Administration and the departments of defense, state, veterans affairs, health and human services, agriculture, education and labor. Their attorneys say work by inspectors general in 2023 alone saved more than $90bn in taxpayer dollars.

Neither the White House nor the attorney representing the inspectors general immediately responded to requests for comment.

‚ÄúDefendants' actions, moreover, telegraph to the public that many of the largest federal agencies now lack the institutional mechanisms to detect and stop fraud and abuse (or at a minimum those mechanisms have been greatly weakened), which will likely engender wrongdoing that could harm the public,‚Äù plaintiffs' attorneys wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

NATO and the EU have ""declared war"" on Russia through Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed at a G20 foreign ministers' meeting on Sept. 25.

Lavrov's remarks come amid rising tensions between Russia and NATO following recent violations of the alliance's airspace by Russian drones and fighter jets.

Russia's chief diplomat reiterated the Kremlin's long-standing narrative that the West provoked the war in Ukraine and said NATO and the EU had moved beyond indirect support and were now parties to the war.

His comments echoed a similar statement made by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Sept. 15, who said that NATO is at war with Russia due to ongoing military support for Kyiv. 

Peskov's comments came days after Poland shot down Russian drones that entered its airspace.

Following multiple Russian airspace violations across NATO member states, U.S. President Donald Trump said allies should shoot down Russian aircraft breaching their airspace, a position backed by several European officials.

In response, Russian Ambassador to France Alexey Meshkov warned on Sept. 25 that such actions by NATO would amount to ""war"" against Russia.

Poland shot down at least three Russian drones that entered its airspace on Sept. 10, while a few days later, Romania reported a Russian drone flying over its territory for nearly an hour.

On Sept. 19, Estonia accused Russia of violating its airspace with three MiG-31 fighter jets, which remained in Estonian airspace for 12 minutes.

A recent surge in Russian airspace violations and other provocations on NATO territory, including disinformation campaigns, has heightened concerns in the West over the risk of a broader Russian military escalation.

Since 1999, there has been plenty of Albertan freedom-seeking political parties: Alberta First, Wexit Canada, Maverick, People, Freedom Conservative, Wildrose Independence and the Buffalo Party.TODD KOROL/Reuters

Francine Pelletier's latest book is Dream Interrupted: The Rise and Fall of Quebec Nationalism. She is a former co-host of CBC's Fifth Estate. 

After years of wanting ‚Äúin,‚Äù the West now wants out. Alberta, at least, has been pumping out that message at high volume. On April 29, the new leader of the province's Republican Party, Cameron Davies, boasted that his election, coming on the heels of yet another Liberal victory in Ottawa, marked ‚Äúthe birthday of many new separatists in Alberta.‚Äù On the same day, Premier Danielle Smith wasted no time in introducing legislation that opens the door to a citizen-initiated referendum on sovereignty.

Seen from Quebec, where I live, it's impossible to observe this new separatist surge without a bemused sigh. After being Quebec's harshest critic for decades, Alberta is now ripping pages out of la belle province's hymn book to better belt out their grievances vis-√†-vis the federal government. Oh, the irony.

I happened to be living in Alberta in the early 1970s when the discovery of oil and gas was giving the province a whole new stature, and the muscle that goes with it. (Who can forget Alberta premier Peter Lougheed's infamous line, ‚ÄúLet the eastern bastards freeze in the dark‚Äù?) It was also a time when a number of Albertans complained about bilingual text on their cereal boxes. It was such a profoundly different place from where I grew up ‚Äì Ottawa and the Gatineau region ‚Äì that it forced me to think long and hard about who I was and where I belonged in this vast expanse called Canada. So I am by no means indifferent to Alberta's belated identity crisis. No one better understands the resentment that comes from being used, dismissed or misjudged, as Albertans have been complaining about for years, than Quebecers. That said, Albertans should be wary of the hornets' nest they are stepping into.

Opinion: Alberta's separatism is hollow, artificial and all about money

Separating from Canada is no mean feat. It is a radical act that demands what radicalism often eschews: popular support as well as an established, credible political party at the helm. The art of secession demands a clear vision of what a new fiefdom is all about. It can't just be about more money, or fewer rules. If you are going to create that much trouble inside and outside the province, there has to be a higher goal, a moral imperative that everyone can respect, at least begrudgingly. As far as I can see, Alberta separatists have miles to go before they sleep. 

Support for Alberta sovereignty is indeed rising but remains underwhelming, registering at anywhere between 22 per cent and 36 per cent, depending on the poll. Since 1999, there has been a surfeit of Albertan freedom-seeking political parties: Alberta First, Wexit Canada, Maverick, People, Freedom Conservative, Wildrose Independence and the Buffalo Party, with one formation often begetting the next and all advocating for greater provincial autonomy. The latest separatist vehicle, the Republican Party, an updated version of the Buffalo Party, has upped the ante by calling for a binding referendum on Alberta independence. The party claims to have the wind in its sails and 26,000 members, though 20,000 of those memberships were handed out for free. Other than independence, the party stands for traditional conservative values (faith, freedom, family), fiscal conservatism, enhanced prosperity and, without spelling out what this means, pro-Americanism.

The combined triumph of Donald Trump in the U.S. and Mark Carney here in Canada has heightened Alberta's revulsion toward Ottawa while whetting its appetite for a MAGA second-coming, Francine Pelletier writes.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

To muddle things further, nothing really distinguishes the separatists' goals from Ms. Smith‚Äòs plan for a ‚Äúsovereign Alberta within a united Canada.‚Äù The fourth consecutive election of a federal Liberal government has clearly united all manner of conservative politicians in Alberta in a high-stakes poker game. Never underestimate the power of resentment or economic anger ‚Äì but, for now, this amounts to political grandstanding, reminiscent of the emotional speech given by Robert Bourassa, in June, 1990, after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. It was quite a dance, with the sedate federalist Quebec premier going so far as to invoke sovereignty in response to having been denied a new constitutional status. But it was just a performance, and nothing came of it.

So what does Alberta want? 

When that question was first asked of Quebec, 30 or more years ago, the answer was straightforward: to protect a distinct French-speaking culture and identity in the midst of a mostly English-speaking continent. That has been the crux of the sovereigntist movement from day one: a home that would not only safeguard Quebec but help it thrive and, by the same token, be open to everyone. ‚ÄúThe Quebec I'm talking about must also be for all Quebecers,‚Äù wrote Ren√© L√©vesque in his 1968 manifesto. ‚ÄúWe can become a model society if we choose.‚Äù It was an ambitious yet generous proposition which, despite two attempts, failed to materialize.

Opinion: Why is Alberta so grumpy? The truth is the West has been struggling badly

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the 1995 referendum. Lost by a mere 54,000 votes, the razor-thin defeat was borne with astonishing equanimity by the general population. There was no blood in the streets and few insults hurled at the other side. We kept calm and carried on. Little did we know, however, that there would be a heavy psychological price to pay, as well as a political one.

This is something I think most Canadians ignore and even many Quebecers haven't quite come to terms with. The 1995 referendum marked a turning point in the already fraught Quebec-Canada relationship. Until the late 1980s, there was still some sympathy in English-speaking Canada for Quebec's claim of a distinct society. But the fear that swept the country on October 30, 1995, extinguished much of that goodwill. In my opinion, relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada have never fully recovered.

Within Quebec, the consequences of two failed sovereignty bids have been more dramatic still. The outcome of the 1995 referendum not only deflated the sovereigntist movement, it brought back the old siege mentality of darker times. Jacques Parizeau's unfortunate outburst on referendum night was the first sign of this curious regression. By blaming the defeat on ‚Äúmoney and ethnic votes,‚Äù Quebec's then-premier evoked a past when foreigners were seen as obstacles to French-Canadian survival. The toxic combination of failure, loss and shame, the inevitable aftermath of this stinging defeat, had suddenly shifted the province into reverse.

People gather in support of Alberta becoming a 51st state during a rally at the Legislature in Edmonton, on May 3, 2025.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

Though this was certainly not Mr. Parizeau's intent, a seed was planted that night that would continue to grow over the next decades, slowly transforming the progressive civic nationalism championed by Ren√© L√©vesque (and Jacques Parizeau) into the more ethnic-minded nationalism of Fran√ßois Legault today. His government's controversial Bill 21, which prohibits teachers and soon daycare workers, among other public-service employees, from wearing religious symbols, is the most visible sign of Quebec's born-again conservatism. Quebec is not alone, of course, in discriminating against religious minorities. The rise of right-wing populism has opened the door to nativist and anti-immigrant sentiment throughout the Western world. But because of its long history of isolation, Quebec is particularly vulnerable to this worrisome drift. 

Alberta, I know, has a very different history than Quebec. But political gambles have a way of running their own course, no matter when or where they happen. In 1995, no one could have predicted that the progressive sovereigntist movement, which had dominated the Quebec political landscape for the last 30 years and transformed it for the better, would slowly morph into an undistinguished neoconservative one. Similarly, no one can predict where Alberta is heading today. In all likelihood, sovereignty is a red herring. That's not what Alberta (really) wants. More power, yes; more control over oil and gas, definitely. But that isn't sufficient to establish a spanking new country.

If not sovereignty for Alberta, then what? Joining the United States? The combined triumph of Donald Trump in the U.S. and Mark Carney here in Canada has clearly heightened Alberta's revulsion toward Ottawa while whetting its appetite for a MAGA second-coming. Make Alberta Great Again caps are everywhere and banned books in schools are dominating the headlines. There is a culture war happening in Alberta and it has Mr. Trump's name on it; 51st state, anyone? Might that be where the wannabe ind√©pendantistes are really headed?

My message to Albertans: Be careful what you wish for, lest it come true.

Stu Kedwell, senior portfolio manager and global head of equities at RBC Global Asset Management Inc.Craig Bagol/The Globe and Mail

Stu Kedwell was 19 when he inherited 40 shares of U.S. conglomerate 3M from his grandmother's estate. Although he launched a window-washing business and sold futons while earning a commerce degree at Queen's University, stocks still weren't on his radar. 

That changed after he joined RBC Dominion Securities, the wealth management arm of Royal Bank of Canada. He started as a trainee and did a stint with the portfolio advisory group before managing money. 

He and Doug Raymond co-run the $8.2-billion RBC North American Value Fund, a Canadian-focused equity offering that has outpaced the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index since 2005. We asked Kedwell why he's a gold bull and likes Berkshire Hathaway. 

Can you describe your investment strategy?

We buy growth stocks at reasonable prices. After identifying companies that we want to own, we do scenario analysis to understand different outcomes for them. We want businesses that can compound faster than the stock market over time.

What's your outlook for Canadian versus U.S. stocks?

We're finding more value in Canadian equities, which is 60% of the fund. All domestic sectors, except for technology, trade in line or below their long-term averages. Loan losses at the banks are a worry due to rising unemployment and falling condo prices, but they're well capitalized to deal with the challenges. Our top bank holdings are Royal Bank and TD Bank. We acquired shares of TD on weakness last year when it was dealing with money-laundering issues. We saw value in them. 

What's your outlook for Canada's energy sector? 

Oil prices have fallen, but the balance sheets of energy firms are strong, and their free cash flow generation is very reasonable. We own Canadian Natural Resources and Imperial Oil, which have long-life oil sands assets. These stocks are attractive if crude recovers in 18 to 24 months. In the meantime, we can collect attractive dividend income. We own pipelines, such as TC Energy and Enbridge, that have high-dividend yields and good prospects. TC Energy, which is more gas-focused, will also benefit from the build-out of liquefied natural gas plants in Canada. Enbridge has more of an oil focus but has acquired some utilities. 

You own the iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold ETF. Why?

I'm bullish long term on gold. More central banks and foreign countries want to own it versus the U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons, including their worries after sanctions were imposed on Russia when it invaded Ukraine. The dollar has arguably plateaued and is set to weaken, so that's good for gold, as well as concerns about the growing U.S. fiscal deficit. We prefer owning an ETF in the gold sector to reduce the risk of owning individual stocks.

Craig Bagol/The Globe and Mail

Berkshire Hathaway is a top holding. Is it still attractive given that its legendary investor, Warren Buffett, will retire at year-end?

If I own a security run by a 94-year-old man, it's because he has management in place for a successful succession. I like conglomerates like Berkshire because you get revenue from many sources, and it's reallocated back across their businesses. Berkshire gets a lot of cash from its insurance group. Some people say it's not being optimized, but I'm comfortable with it. When the skies are sunny, it's what you expect Berkshire to do. In a downturn, you'd expect the cash to be put to work successfully.

Among the so-called Magnificent Seven U.S. tech stocks, your fund owns Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple. Why? 

We also owned chipmaker Nvidia but sold it in July because its valuation had already priced in its growth potential. Microsoft has a more enduring business model. It's growing at a strong clip with the right products and services. We own Meta and Alphabet because they have a lot of advertising exposure. Meta benefits from a rising user base on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We like Alphabet based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, despite concerns about AI chatbot risks to its Google search engine. Apple is lagging in the AI race, but its service revenue is growing strongly.

Books are heavily restricted behind bars, including some of the books that officials have fought for students to access.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news ‚Äî make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

The last several months of the Trump administration's reign have seen the deployment of language restriction as a tactic in the systemic erosion of civil rights. While the scale has intensified dramatically, this enforcement of social hegemony through literary and aesthetic regulation is not a new phenomenon. Historian Andrew Hartman contends that ‚Äúthe history of America, for better and worse, is largely a history of debates about the idea of America.‚Äù We are watching this ideological question play out violently, attempting to delineate which bodies are ‚ÄúAmerican,‚Äù what behavior is ‚ÄúAmerican,‚Äù and what art, what literature, what television is ‚ÄúAmerican.‚Äù One of the many ways this debate is performed is through grand displays of moral outrage over literature, as well as through the banning of books and education material.

In the 2023-2024 academic year, schools and libraries across the country fought a record number of book bans ‚Äî a figure that will likely rise as increasing restrictions are imposed on academic institutions, museums, and libraries. In late 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an assembly bill into law protecting school curricula from gender- and race-based bans. Tony Thurmond, state superintendent of public instruction, celebrated this victory, proclaiming that the measure ‚Äúsends a strong signal to the people of California ‚Äî but also to every American ‚Äî that in the Golden State ‚Äî we don't ban books ‚Äî we cherish them.‚Äù

While these safeguards are undeniably important, Thurmond's conviction that ‚Äúwe don't ban books‚Äù is missing a caveat: We don't ban books here ‚Äî except in our state prisons. Access to literature for people experiencing incarceration has always been heavily monitored; often the very same books that state officials fight for access to in public schools are restricted in jails and prisons.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Chuck Murdoch, 68, has experienced this firsthand. On August 19, 2024, his memoir Badfish: Stories from the Dark House was published by Blue Ear Books.

The book is a product of nearly three decades worth of Murdoch's writings, a chronicle of his past 30 years spent languishing across various California state prisons, despite abundant evidence pointing toward his innocence. He explains the title in the introduction: ‚ÄúBadfish‚Äù is the moniker Murdoch bestowed upon himself, inspired by the band Sublime's 1997 hit of the same name. ‚ÄúDARK HOUSE‚Äù is used throughout the book as a surrogate word for prison.

Murdoch's conviction derived from a 1983 robbery-murder in a bar in Long Beach, California ‚Äî a case that went cold for 11 years, until a jailhouse informant offered Murdoch's name during questioning. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, despite large doubts remaining about his culpability. (He had not matched the description of initial reports, nor was he selected by any eyewitnesses in photo lineups conducted in the days after.) Further doubts emerged in post-conviction appeals: A senior Eighth Circuit judge decried the suppression of a note revealing that the informant had received a lesser sentence in exchange for a confession implicating Murdoch. Years later, another judge dissented the denial of federal relief, deeming the conviction a ‚Äútruly spectacular miscarriage of justice.‚Äù

Despite these acknowledgements, Murdoch is still living out his sentence at the High Desert State Prison in Susanville, California, 30 years later. Having never been able to truly meet his children due to his incarceration, Murdoch wrote the book primarily for them to know their father. Over the course of three chronological sections, the book follows Murdoch's early life, his early passage through the jail system after his brief stint as the ‚ÄúBaskin-Robbins Bandit,‚Äù and the 30 years of prison time that followed his wrongful conviction. He documents the reality of life inside prison ‚Äî the violence, abuse, and manipulation of truth. The book is a personal account of the sheer suffering perpetuated by the U.S. carceral system.

The day Badfish wasreleased in August 2024, Murdoch's sister sent him a copy. Weeks passed, and he did not receive it. In September, Blue Ear Books received a letter from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Division of Adult Institutions informing them that Badfish had been confiscated as contraband and placed on the centralized list of banned publications across California prisons. This decision, the letter said, was based on the belief that the work presented‚Äúa serious threat to facility security or the safety of incarcerated people and staff.‚Äù The letter did not specify which element of the book was so threatening, nor did the prison respond to sustained requests to clarify or review this ban.

‚ÄúI have not ever seen my published book. I've never held it.‚Äù

Murdoch confirmed over the phone that one year after the publication of his life story, he has still never seen his completed work. ‚ÄúI have not ever seen my published book. I've never held it,‚Äù he told Truthout. ‚ÄúI talk about the prison system, how a lot of things are unfair, and kind of unreasonable, irrational. And for some reason, the California Department of Corrections decided to ban my book and disallow it. So they're not allowing it into prisons for any prisoners to read, not even myself.‚Äù

Recently, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was required to publicly list its Disapproved Publications, displaying the hundreds of titles that have been deemed a threat to security. There is no specific requirement for qualities that merit suppression, just that they present a ‚Äúlegitimate penological interest.‚Äù Basic Drawing by Louis Priscilla rests atop the ‚ÄúB‚Äù section ‚Äî the list informs us that it ‚Äúcontains frontal nudity.‚Äù Considering nudity in art potentially dangerous seems ironic when the group ‚Äúat risk‚Äù has nearly nonexistent privacy. Would a glimpse of Michelangelo's David present a security risk to those who are forced to shower with strangers? Further down, we are told that Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is disallowed for lacking ‚Äúserious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.‚Äù This murky phrasing does not reveal what qualities merit ‚Äúserious value‚Äù in the eyes of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Further still, The Kite Runner allegedly‚Äúcontains conduct which is or appears to be forceful, threatening or violent,‚Äù and Merriam-Webster's Visual Dictionary ‚Äúpresents a serious threat to facility security.‚Äù

As we fight the increasing suppression of material in our schools, libraries, and historical records, we must not forget the people living through incarceration.

These nonsensical justifications seem to be at odds with the newly minted ‚ÄúCalifornia Model‚Äù currently being implemented at San Quentin, inspired by the ‚ÄúNordic Model‚Äù of imprisonment guided by rehabilitation. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation website claims that the model aims to expand education and job opportunities, reentry planning, and shift expectations for correctional officers to implement a more rehabilitative environment. However, the arbitrary limitation of reading material clashes with this vision.

Book bans are recognized by California officials at the public school curriculum level to be damaging and controlling. Why does this recognition not extend to populations beyond students? The vast majority of those behind bars will leave at some point ‚Äî should we not ensure that those re-entering society are better educated, better informed? Murdoch himself reiterated this discrepancy. ‚ÄúI think that my book, getting my book published, is a testament to rehabilitation ‚Äî I had to teach myself how to read and write ‚Ä¶ I would have hoped the Department of Corrections would have stood behind me and supported me in that, but instead they banned my book,‚Äù he said.

After one year of waiting and a lifetime plundered from him, Murdoch is still being denied the only thing he can call his own: his life story, his personal truth. Despite this suppression being a more subtle cruelty in the larger scale of incarceration, repressive control of information and abuse of power is destructive on any level. The State of California acknowledges that the diversity of representation and artistic form in the public arena is essential, and yet, censorship practices are utilized openly against some of the state's most vulnerable citizens. The strict regulation of art, news, and literature under the guise of ‚Äúsafety‚Äù or ‚Äúvalue‚Äù or ‚Äúobscenity‚Äù are smokescreens that have been employed to retain control over the voices and subject matter available to readers or viewers. As we fight the increasing suppression of material in our schools, libraries, and historical records, we must not forget the people living through incarceration ‚Äî those who are all too familiar with navigating this erasure, arbitrary restriction, and state-sanctioned censorship.

Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers ‚Äî that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political suppression under Trump.

To combat these challenges, Truthout has launched a fundraiser. We're close to our goal, but our deadline is closing in! We must raise $12,000 before midnight tonight. Please support independent journalism at this critical moment.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 A Conversation With Radek Sikorski

In early September, around 20 Russian drones entered Poland's airspace. NATO and Polish forces scrambled fighter jets to shoot them down, but not before several had traveled hundreds of miles into Polish territory.

To Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, the incursion was not just a test of NATO's resolve. It was a reminder of the precarious position of the alliance's frontline states as the war in Ukraine grinds on for its third year, and as Donald Trump upends the basic bargain of the transatlantic alliance.

Dan Kurtz-Phelan spoke to Sikorski on the morning of September 24 in New York, where he was attending the UN General Assembly. They discussed the ongoing threat from Russia and what it will take, in Washington and in European capitals, to prevent it from escalating. But more than that, Sikorski is grappling with a moment of sharp change in geopolitics‚Äîtrying to understand both why the old order collapsed and how to navigate the new order just now taking shape.

            Former President Barack Obama on Wednesday said the Trump administration engaged in ‚Äúviolence against the truth‚Äù with its announcements this week linking autism and Tylenol.
    


            ‚ÄúWe have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved,‚Äù Obama said during remarks at London's O2 Arena, according to a transcript provided to CNN by the former president's office.
    


            ‚ÄúThe degree to which that undermines public health, the degree to which that can do harm to women who are pregnant, the degree to which that creates anxiety for parents who do have children who are autistic, which by the way itself is subject to a spectrum, and a lot of what is being trumpeted as these massive increases actually have to do with a broadening of the criteria across that spectrum, so that people can actually get services and help,‚Äù Obama added. ‚ÄúAll of that is violence against the truth.‚Äù
    


            At a White House press conference Monday, President Donald Trump announced that the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a ‚Äúvery increased risk of autism,‚Äù drawing immediate pushback from doctors in the US and abroad. Trump promoted a range of unproven theories about autism, Tylenol and vaccines, going beyond his administration's plans to highlight a cautious new warning on Tylenol, $50 million investment in further autism research and approval of a potential treatment.
    


How Trump blew up his administration's carefully laid autism announcement plans



            Obama said Wednesday that ‚Äúit is important for those who believe in the truth and believe in science, to also examine truth when it is inconvenient for us.‚Äù
    


            Obama also said the country is being ‚Äútested‚Äù by threats against free speech and the rule of law but called it a ‚Äúclarifying moment‚Äù of what Americans should stand for.
    


            ‚ÄúIt's fair to say that what I see repeatedly in my own country in the loss of leadership in promoting values like democracy and rule of law and free speech, and economic fairness, the fact that not only do we not promote them, but we actively oppose those values now, in many cases, it's fair to say I find appalling. I don't feel good about it,‚Äù Obama said.
    


            ‚ÄúI think we got complacent and smug and comfortable posturing that we believed in all these values because they were never tested. And now they're being tested,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's easy to believe in free speech when everybody kind of agrees with it. It's much harder when the people next to you seem just terrible and are promoting ideas that feel like they're inciting violence towards you.‚Äù
    


            The comments reflect the Democratic former president's increasingly outspoken posture. Throughout a series of public appearances this year, Obama has amped up his criticism of Trump's second term and expressed concern about the state of American politics.
    


            During stops at colleges and community centers, he's called the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and law firms ‚Äúunimaginable,‚Äù and warned that the US is ‚Äúdangerously close‚Äù to a more autocratic government.
    


            And earlier this month, Obama commented on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, calling it a ‚Äúhorrific tragedy‚Äù and saying that ‚Äúthe central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resort to violence.‚Äù

It's been only a year since Hurricane Helene hammered the southeast U.S. from Florida to the Carolinas. The worst wreckage has been cleared away, but cleanup crews are still at work plucking smaller debris from waterways throughout the region. (AP video by Brittany Peterson)

WOODFIN, N.C. (AP) ‚Äî Bracing himself against the current in waist-deep water, Clancy Loorham wrestles a broken length of PVC pipe from the rocky bottom of the French Broad River and peers inside.

‚ÄúI got a catfish in the pipe,‚Äù the 27-year-old with wispy beard and mustache shouted to fellow cleanup workers floating nearby in rafts, canoes and kayaks piled with plastic pipe and other human-made detritus. ‚ÄúHe's right here. I'm looking him in the eyes!‚Äù

It's been just a year since floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Helene washed these pipes out of a nearby factory with such force that some pieces ended up in Douglas Lake, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Tennessee. But they're already slick with algae and filled with river silt ‚Äî and creatures.

Helene killed more than 250 people and caused nearly $80 billion in damage from Florida to the Carolinas. In the North Carolina mountains, rains of up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) turned gentle streams into torrents that swept away trees, boulders, homes and vehicles, shattered century-old flood records, and in some places carved out new channels.

In the haste to rescue people and restore their lives to some semblance of normalcy, some fear the recovery efforts compounded Helene's impact on the ecosystem. Contractors hired to remove vehicles, shipping containers, shattered houses and other large debris from waterways sometimes damaged sensitive habitat.

‚ÄúThey were using the river almost as a highway in some situations,‚Äù said Peter Raabe, Southeast regional director for the conservation group American Rivers.




Conservationists found instances of contractors cutting down healthy trees and removing live root balls, said Jon Stamper, river cleanup coordinator for MountainTrue, the North Carolina-based nonprofit conducting the French Broad work.

‚ÄúThose trees kind of create fish habitats,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey slow the flow of water down. They're an important part of a river system, and we've seen kind of a disregard for that.‚Äù

The Army Corps of Engineers said in a statement that debris removal missions ‚Äúare often challenging‚Äù due to the large volume storms can leave behind across a wide area. The Corps said it trains its contractors to minimize disturbances to waterways and to prevent harm to wildlife. North Carolina Emergency Management said debris removal after Helene took into account safety and the environment, and that projects reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency met that agency's standards for minimizing impact.

Hannah Woodburn, who tracks the headwaters and tributaries of the New River as MountainTrue's Upper New Riverkeeper, said waters are much muddier since Helene, both from storm-related vegetation loss and from heavy machinery used during cleanup.

She said it's been bad for the eastern hellbender, a ‚Äúspecies of special concern‚Äù in North Carolina. It's one of only three giant salamanders found in the world, growing up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) long and weighing more than 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).

‚ÄúAfter the storm, we had so many reports and pictures of dead hellbenders, some nearly a mile from the stream once the waters receded,‚Äù said Woodburn.

Of even greater concern is the Appalachian elktoe, a federally endangered mussel found only in the mountains of North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Helene hurt the Appalachian elktoe, but it also suffered from human-caused damage, said Mike Perkins, a state biologist.

Perkins said some contractors coordinated with conservation teams ahead of river cleanups and took precautions. Others were not so careful. 

He described snorkeling in the cold waters of the Little River and ‚Äúfinding crushed individuals, some of them still barely alive, some with their insides hanging out.‚Äù On that river, workers moved 60 Appalachian elktoe to a refuge site upstream. On the South Toe River, home to one of the most important populations, biologists collected a dozen and took them to a hatchery to store in tanks until it's safe to return them to the wild.

‚ÄúIt was shocking and unprecedented in my professional line of work in 15 years,‚Äù Perkins said of the incident. ‚ÄúThere's all of these processes in place to prevent this secondary tragedy from happening, and none of it happened.‚Äù

Andrea Leslie, mountain habitat conservation coordinator with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, said she hopes the experience can inform future recovery efforts.

‚ÄúTo a certain degree, you can't do this perfectly,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey're in emergency mode. They're working to make sure that people are safe and that infrastructure is safe. And it's a big, complicated process. And there are multiple places in my observation where we could shift things to be more careful.‚Äù

Like the hellbender and the Appalachian elktoe, humans cling to the river, too.

Vickie and Paul Revis' home sat beside old U.S. 70 in a bend of the Swannanoa River. As Helene swept through, the Swannanoa took their home and scraped away a big chunk of their half-acre lot.

With the land paid for and no flood insurance payment to move away, they decided to stay put.

‚ÄúWhen you own it and you're not rich, you know, you can't,‚Äù Vickie Revis said, staring across the river at a row of condemned commercial buildings.

After a year in a donated camper, they'll soon move into their new house ‚Äî a double-wide modular home, also donated by a local Christian charity. It sits atop a 6-foot mound that Paul Revis piled up near the front of the property, farther from the river. 

Using rock, fill dirt and broken concrete dumped on his property by friendly debris-removal contractors, Paul has reclaimed the frontage the Swannanoa took. His wife planted it with marigolds for beauty and a weeping willow for stability. And they've purchased flood insurance.

‚ÄúI hope I never see another one in my lifetime, and I'm hoping that if I do, it does hold up,‚Äù Vickie said. ‚ÄúI mean, that's all we can (do). Mother Nature does whatever she wants to do, and you just have to roll with it.‚Äù

Back on the French Broad, the tedious cleanup work continues. Many on the crew are rafting guides knocked out of work by the storm.

MountainTrue got a $10 million, 18-month grant from the state for the painstaking work of pulling small debris from the rivers and streams. Since July, teams have removed more than 75 tons from about a dozen rivers across five watersheds.

Red-tailed hawks and osprey circle high overhead as the flotilla glides past banks lined with willow, sourwood and sycamore, ablaze with goldenrod and jewelweed. That peacefulness belies its fury of a year ago that upended so many lives. 

‚ÄúThere are so many people who are living in western North Carolina right now that feel very afraid of our rivers,‚Äù said Liz McGuirl, a crew member who managed a hair salon before Helene put her out of work. ‚ÄúThey feel hurt. They feel betrayed.‚Äù

Downstream, as McGuirl hauled up a length of pipe, another catfish swam out.

‚ÄúWe're creating a habitat, but it's just the wrong habitat,‚Äù crew leader Leslie Beninato said ruefully. ‚ÄúI'd like to give them a tree as a home, maybe, instead of a pipe.‚Äù

A gunman fired upon a Dallas immigration field office from a nearby roof Wednesday morning, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

All three victims were in a transport van outside the facility at the time, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Authorities said the shooter was involved in a ‚Äúhigh degree of pre-attack planning,‚Äù and investigators found ammunition with anti-ICE messaging at the scene.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof. After the shooting in Dallas, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide.

Here are some of the things to know about the shooting.

All three were detainees, but officials have not released any additional information about their identities.

Mexico's foreign affairs ministry said one of the wounded was from Mexico and was hospitalized with serious injuries. The consulate reached out to the family to offer support and legal help, it said.

DHS initially said two victims were dead, but hours later it issued a correction saying one was killed and two were critically wounded.

No law enforcement officers were injured, authorities said.

Authorities say the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but they have not released his identity.




A law enforcement official identified the suspect as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

FBI agents could be seen Wednesday afternoon at a house in suburban Dallas that public records link to Jahn.

Jahn briefly worked at a Texas-based solar company and in the marijuana industry, including a stint in Washington in 2017, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in that state. Jahn slept in his car during that time, he added. 

‚ÄúHe was lost, and I didn't expect him to be crazy,‚Äù Sanderson told AP. ‚ÄúDidn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't remember him being that abnormal, he didn't seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble, he kept his head down and stayed working,‚Äù Sanderson said. 

In 2016, Jahn pleaded guilty to felony charges of marijuana delivery, according to court records in Collin County, Texas. He served five years' probation.

The gunman in the Dallas shooting used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. The FBI on Wednesday said ammunition found at the scene had anti-ICE messaging, and FBI Director Kash Patel released a photo on social media showing a bullet with the words ‚ÄúANTI-ICE‚Äù written on it. 

On Thursday, Patel announced that FBI agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from the shooter's home.

‚ÄúOne of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‚ÄòHopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'‚Äù Patel wrote. ‚ÄúAP‚Äù is an abbreviation for ‚Äúarmor-piercing.‚Äù 

Patel also said the shooter researched DHS facilities, Kirk's killing and ‚Äúsearched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.‚Äù

At a news conference Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz said, ‚ÄúThis is the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP. This must stop. To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop.‚Äù

But Democrats accused Cruz and others of selectively releasing information and trying to ‚Äúcontrol the narrative‚Äù to fit Republican arguments that ICE agents are under siege.

Immediately after the initial news conference in which authorities refused to say whether detainees were among the victims, Democratic U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey called in to Dallas' WFAA-TV newscast and said he was ‚Äúabsolutely sickened‚Äù by officials' comments.

‚ÄúIf they are trying to control this narrative and they don't want migrants to be the victim in this story, then they may want to slow-walk giving us any information about this so they can still keep on talking about attacks on ICE,‚Äù Veasey said.

The shooting occurred at the local field office in Dallas, where agents conduct short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by ICE.

ICE facilities have varying security levels, with some heavily secured and others more exposed. 

John Torres, a former acting director of the agency, says facilities like the one in Dallas have vulnerabilities, including exposed loading areas for detainee buses.

The Dallas facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

On July 4, a police officer was shot in the neck at a Texas immigration detention center. Attackers dressed in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

On July 7, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, which abuts Mexico. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks in his car.

Panelists Joshua Ritter and George Terwilliger assess the mounting evidence against Tyler Robinson, the man charged with killing Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, on ‚ÄòThe Ingraham Angle.'

EXCLUSIVE: OREM, Utah ‚Äî Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University earlier this month, ""made contact"" with a police officer near where investigators recovered the alleged murder weapon wrapped in a towel in the woods at the edge of campus, according to two law enforcement sources.

It happened around 6:30 p.m. on Sept. 10, roughly six hours after a sniper's bullet struck Kirk in the neck as he was engaging the audience during a speaking event sponsored by the UVU chapter of his organization in Orem, Utah.

The officer was guarding the perimeter after authorities placed the campus on lockdown, and the encounter appears to have thwarted the suspect's attempt to recover the Mauser .30-06 rifle prosecutors allege was used to kill Kirk.

Prosecutors released excerpts from a text message conversation they say Robinson had with his roommate and romantic partner, Lance Twiggs, that occurred at an unspecified time on the evening of Sept. 10, in which Robinson allegedly discussed wanting to retrieve a rifle before returning home from Orem, which is about a four-hour drive from where he lived in Washington County.

While law enforcement searched the area, Robinson texted Twiggs, telling him to ""look under my keyboard,"" according to court documents.

The roommate found and photographed a note there that read, ""I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it."" Authorities say Twiggs has cooperated with investigators.

In another message, Robinson allegedly wrote he was ""stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.""

""You weren't the one who did it right????"" the roommate texted back.

""I am, I'm sorry,"" Robinson allegedly replied.

""I thought they caught the person?""

""No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing,"" came another alleged reply from Robinson. ""I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. Its (sic) quiet, almost enough to get out, but theres (sic) one vehicle lingering.""

Later in the conversation, he allegedly reiterated that he was looking for a chance to grab the rifle: ""There is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't wanna chance it.""

Eventually, he allegedly wrote that, ""I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle... I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpas (sic) rifle.""

A manhunt is underway in Oregon as authorities search for an accused murderer who was accidentally released this week due to a clerical error. 

Ty Anthony Sage, 26, was reportedly set free from the Multnomah County Detention Center in Portland after posting bail on Monday, according to FOX 12. 

Sage reportedly appeared for a hearing last Wednesday, where a judge issued a ruling denying him bail the next day. However, a Sept. 17 release form shows Sage's bail was set for $5,000 and he was permitted to bail out ‚Äì a direct violation of the judge's order.

Sage was arrested in connection to a 2021 robbery and shooting that killed 15-year-old Lowgunn Ivey and injured two others.

""It's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years,"" mother Jodie Ramsey told the outlet. ""My world stopped the day my son died.""  

Both Sage and 26-year-old Kevin Rivas-Ramirez were arrested in May, and face murder and robbery charges.

""The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office recognizes that we hold the ultimate responsibility for a person's release from custody,"" the sheriff's office told FOX 12. ""We are committed to conducting a review of the incident to have a full understanding of what occurred.

Sage's release appears to be an ""isolated incident,"" according to Sheriff Nicole Morissey O'Donnell, who added that ""this mistake should not have happened."" 

""I recognize that the system has failed, and it's failed Lowgunn's family and our community. We hold the ultimate responsibility for a person's release. In this case, we fell short. But we are committed to doing everything we can to restore community trust and confidence in our organization,"" Sheriff O'Donnell said, according to FOX 12.

Ramsey blasted the mistake made by authorities and expressed her frustration surrounding her son's alleged killer's release. 

""It's a major mess up, it's a monumental mistake that should have never occurred,"" Ramsey said. 

Ramsey added that Sage's release has left her and her family in fear as authorities work to locate the alleged killer. 

""Very fearful, very fearful, it's going to be a constant fear for me until he is back in custody, because he is [out of] custody doing God knows what,"" Ramsey said.

However, as Sage remains on the loose, Ramsey reportedly said she has lost any sense of hope that her son will receive justice after his death. 

""I don't have any hope,"" Ramsey said. ""I mean, once they finally caught him and they had him in custody, I had all the hope in the world. I was hopeful, I was completely hopeful. Now that he is no longer in custody, I have 100% doubts.""

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

The Iraq War sparked the first big political fight I had with my father. Like many in my generation, Iraq awakened me to the reality that America occasionally does bad things ‚Äî and sometimes evil things, as in the case of Abu Ghraib. And yet, my father, the most moral and intelligent person in my life (a description that still holds), defended the war and the politicians behind it. 

The disconnect baffled me. So I waved placards, wrote protest songs and letters to the editor, cut a heart-shaped hole out of an American flag, and hung it in my college apartment. I became a real piece of work, as my father might have described me at the time. He knew, as I did, that all of my ‚Äúactivism‚Äù was really just an extension of our argument played out in public. I couldn't wave my liberal pieties in his face, so I did the next best thing and waved them at the world.

DECONSTRUCT THE DEEP STATE. DON'T BECOME IT

I got lucky on the question of Iraq. The war didn't make sense to me on either a moral or strategic level. But I wasn't exactly working with great information. My views at the time were shaped largely by Michael Moore documentaries and the back page of the New York Times, making my victory more the product of luck than superior judgment.

Thankfully, my father and I reconciled over Iraq and everything else fathers and sons need to reconcile over following those turbulent years. 

But not all political disagreements between fathers and sons end with reconciliation. Some fester, others explode, and in the tragic case of Tyler Robinson, the suspected killer of Charlie Kirk, and his father, a political divide turned deadly.

Early reports indicate that a political disagreement between a father and son may have played a key role in the assassination of Kirk at Utah Valley University. The mother of Tyler Robinson, the suspected killer in the horrific attack, told reporters that Tyler and his father had engaged in heated political arguments with increasing regularity and intensity in the year leading up to the shooting.

Pictures of Tyler and his father leaked online in the early hours of the manhunt. One from what appears to be only a few years ago shows the pair seated beside one another at a diner, leaning into each other and smiling, perfectly comfortable in each other's company. Both are wearing baseball caps with sunglasses perched on the brim and T-shirts. It looks like they'd just been out for a hunting trip together. The picture was widely shared by liberals who wanted to paint Tyler as a Republican. And for all the world, that's just what it looks like. 

But by 2025, the two couldn't have grown more different politically. The father is described as a conservative member of the Mormon Church who supported President Donald Trump, while Tyler is said to have moved heavily toward the Left in recent years, and according to his mother, ‚Äúmore pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.‚Äù 

To further complicate matters, Tyler had begun a romantic relationship with his roommate, a young man purportedly transitioning into becoming a woman. The engravings on the bullet casings ‚Äî especially the phrase ‚ÄúNotices bulges OwO what's this?‚Äù ‚Äî indicate that Kirk's opposition to transgenderism played a major role in Tyler's decision to kill him. It also likely drove a wedge between the father and son, given the elder Robinson's affinity for Trump and membership in the Mormon church.

Tyler's mother told police that weeks earlier he had been angry about UVU's decision to host Kirk on campus, saying that Kirk ‚Äúspread too much hate.‚Äù Tyler's own words confirmed his mother's account. In text messages sent to his romantic partner while he was still at large, he wrote, ‚ÄúI had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.‚Äù Given what we know about his political identity, the father likely agreed with Kirk on the issue, meaning Tyler found him ‚Äúhateful‚Äù as well.

Tyler was preoccupied with his father's politics, even as he evaded authorities following the shooting. In the same text message thread with his romantic partner, Tyler lamented that his father had ‚Äúbeen pretty diehard MAGA‚Äù since Trump came into office. He also worried about his father's reaction if he did not return the gun home, texting, ‚Äúhow the [expletive] will I explain losing it to my old man.‚Äù 

The father's role in eventually resolving the manhunt is no small part of the larger tragedy. His wife was the first to recognize Tyler from the surveillance still shots released by the FBI, and he agreed that it looked like their son. According to court filings, the father then confronted Tyler, asking, ‚ÄúTyler, is this you? This looks like you.‚Äù

Tyler confessed but said he'd rather commit suicide than go to jail. But the father persuaded him to confide in a youth pastor and family friend who works with the Washington County Sheriff's Office and the U.S. Marshal's Service. The arrest was made within hours.

It's difficult to imagine what the father went through in those moments. He surely understood that handing over his son to the authorities amounted to participating in his son's eventual execution. 

But for a father of faith, helping a son find a path to spiritual redemption is a higher calling than helping a son escape worldly harm. The terrible consequences of surrender, his son's death and a lifetime of public shame for his family, did not outweigh his duty to assist in his son's salvation. A suicide would have robbed Tyler of the opportunity to repent, while being in custody would allow him a little more time before coming face-to-face with his maker. The choice to surrender his son was about justice, but it was also about faith. 

Following my second year of college, during which I mostly played in a rock band, made cringey political gestures, and read Kerouac and Sartre, I dropped out. I headed from New York to California with nothing but a sack of clothes and a guitar. I told everyone in my life that I was going to find a way to live without any structures or boundaries, and maybe even become a famous musician in the process.

About a month into my misadventure, I called my father and asked him for a plane ticket home. 

‚ÄúI thought you wanted to be one of the Dharma bums?‚Äù he asked. 

‚ÄúI did. But I can't,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúYou made your choice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLive with it.‚Äù

I called back a few days later and begged. I felt myself letting go of reality, and it scared me. He heard it in my voice.

This time my father bought me the ticket ‚Äî first class. And instead of making me take the train home or even pick me up himself, he sent a limousine to meet me at the airport. I'd never been in a limo before, and as I sat awkwardly behind the sharply dressed driver in my ripped jeans and T-shirt, I wondered why he did it. Only years later, when I first heard the Parable of the Prodigal Son and re-embraced the God I'd rejected in adolescence, did I understand. 

DEMOCRATIC PARTY ISOLATION IS GETTING WORSE

The duty of a faithful father is to point the son toward Heaven and let God take care of the rest. Sometimes that means making the unnatural act of offering up your own son to be killed. Sometimes it means making an elaborate and unforgettable gesture at great expense.

God is still working on me, and I join Erika Kirk in praying for Tyler's repentance, a grace Charlie surely would have desired, for the sake of both Tyler's soul and his father's heart.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","FEC vice chairman resigns, eyes Chip Roy's Texas House seat","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/washington-secrets/3823999/trey-trainor-resigns-fec-2026-elections/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:07:41 GMT","

The vice chairman of the Federal Election Commission said on Thursday he was resigning to consider a bid for an open House seat in Texas, leaving the agency with just two commissioners, two short of a quorum.

James E. ‚ÄúTrey‚Äù Trainor III told Washington Secrets that his resignation is effective Oct. 3 and that he is ‚Äúseriously evaluating‚Äù a run for the House seat being vacated by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), who has entered the GOP primary for Texas attorney general.

‚ÄúIt has been an honor to serve in this role since President Trump appointed me in 2020, despite the long confirmation process that began in 2017,‚Äù said Trainor.

He added, ‚ÄúLooking back on my tenure, I'm proud of several key moments: serving twice as chairman of the agency, overseeing DOGE-related activities on behalf of the president, and representing the United States as an international election monitor in Costa Rica and Romania. Additionally, I've had the privilege of testifying before the House Judiciary Committee on the weaponization of campaign finance laws against President Trump, and before the House Administration Committee on the broader issue of government overreach against everyday citizens under the Biden administration.‚Äù

Trainor's departure leaves open four of the six seats on the agency that regulates campaign finance. Both of the remaining members are Democrats, Chairwoman Shana M. Broussard and Dara Lindenbaum.

Lindenbaum said she was surprised by Trainor's resignation, coming two months after he decided against entering the Texas attorney general race. At that time, he told Secrets that he would remain at the FEC to fight any weaponization of the agency against Republicans.

‚ÄúI am very happy for him, very sad for us. He's really done a lot for the FEC,‚Äù she told Secrets.

Trainor was a partisan who never moved to Washington but worked well with the Democrats at the agency. Lindenbaum said, ‚ÄúI did not expect to have a great or even good working relationship with Trey Trainor when I started, but we actually have worked fantastically together, and a lot of the work that we've gotten done is because of that relationship. And I wish he could stay longer, but I absolutely wish him well on his next endeavors.‚Äù

Former FEC Chairman Lee Goodman, currently chairman of the Republican National Lawyers Association, said, ‚ÄúTrey has been a stalwart on the commission. He distinguished himself as an outside-the-beltway commissioner who approached legal issues from a unique and practical perspective unencumbered by entrenched Washington biases. His perspective will be missed.‚Äù

Trainor has been a regular on the Texas political circuit, often asked to speak to GOP groups. He has also been active in the lives of his six children, often posting photos to Facebook of their successes in bull riding and football.

‚ÄúLooking ahead, I'll be returning to private practice, where I'm board-certified in legislative and campaign law. Additionally, several Republican Party officials in Texas have urged me to consider running for Congressional District 21 to replace Chip Roy, and my family and I are seriously evaluating that option,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIn the meantime, I'm excited for a return to more ‚Äònormal' life ‚Äî attending rodeos, middle school football games, and spending quality time with my family,‚Äù he said.

The Trump White House is vetting possible FEC candidates, according to officials.

Even without a quorum, agency lawyers can still affect elections, and Republican campaign experts said they hope Trump will fill the three GOP seats soon.

SEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS

Explained Goodman, ‚ÄúThe main legal risk for everyone in the regulated community is that private complainants with partisan agendas can file complaints against their political opponents and then sue the hamstrung agency for failure to act on their complaints. A court will send the case back to the agency with instructions to act promptly. When the agency fails to act on the complaint a second time, because it lacks a quorum, the partisan complainant can enforce the law directly against its political opponent. Partisan enforcement of FEC laws is a bad consequence of the absence of a quorum.‚Äù

He added, ‚ÄúI hope the White House and Senate move quickly to restore a quorum at the FEC.‚Äù","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The unthinkable becomes the expected.

In the early months of the war in Ukraine, Gen. Mark Milley, then chair of the joint chiefs of staff, carried a note card in his briefcase outlining what he saw as the main priorities when it came to the US and NATO approach to the war. As reported by the Washington Post, they were: No. 1: ‚ÄúDon't have a kinetic conflict between the U.S. military and NATO with Russia.‚Äù No. 2: ‚ÄúContain war inside the geographical boundaries of Ukraine.‚Äù No. 3: ‚ÄúStrengthen and maintain NATO unity.‚Äù No. 4: ‚ÄúEmpower Ukraine and give them the means to fight.‚Äù

The order is telling. Supporting Ukraine has been a priority, but preventing escalation outside of Ukraine has often been a greater one, sometimes to the frustration of Ukrainian leaders who have at times felt that Western governments were too timid in supporting actions like long-range strikes into Russian territory. Milley is long gone from American leadership, but that attitude carried over with the return of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed concerns that the conflict could escalate to World War III.

So it's been remarkable over the past week to see the degree to which NATO leaders appear to have come around to the view that NATO-Russia conflict ‚Äî hopefully only limited conflict ‚Äî may be inevitable.

The reason is a series of increasingly brazen incursions into NATO airspace. On September 8, 21 Russian drones entered Polish territory, where some of them were shot down by an unprecedented Polish-German-Italian-Dutch military operation.

It's at least plausible, though somewhat hard to believe given the number of them, that those drones entered Polish airspace inadvertently while on their way to strike targets in Ukraine. Drones have periodically crossed into and crashed on the territory of several NATO countries bordering Ukraine since the start of the war. The fact that they were unmanned vehicles also made the situation easier to deescalate: that drones can be shot down without human casualties is one reason leaders are often willing to take more controversial or riskier actions with them. (In a notable 2023 incident, Russian jets collided with and downed an American MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea.)

The incident last Friday, in which three Russian fighter jets violated Estonia's airspace for 12 minutes, where they were intercepted by NATO jets, had the potential to become something much more dangerous. Unlike Poland, Estonia does not border Ukraine; it's hundreds of miles away. And in this case, the aircraft were manned. The Russian government has denied that it violated Estonian airspace.

On Monday, a series of drone sightings forced airports in Copenhagen and Oslo to close for several hours. On Thursday, drones shut down a second Danish airport, this one used for commercial and military flights. Norwegian and Danish authorities did not initially confirm widespread allegations ‚Äî including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ‚Äî that these drones were Russian, but Danish authorities have concluded they were linked to a ‚Äústate actor,‚Äù Reuters reported.

These incidents took center stage at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York City this week, with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski explicitly threatening to shoot down any additional aircraft that entered his country's airspace.

‚ÄúIf another missile or aircraft enters our space without permission, deliberately or by mistake, and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don't come here to whine about it. You have been warned,‚Äù he said, addressing the Russian delegation.

‚ÄúWe stand ready to take all steps necessary to defend NATO's skies and NATO's territory against Russia's imperialist warmongering,‚Äù UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.

More surprisingly, President Donald Trump responded, ‚ÄúYes, I do,‚Äù on Tuesday when asked by a reporter if he believed NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their territory. ‚ÄúRoger that,‚Äù Sikorski posted on X in response.

This comes amid this week's hawkish turn in Trump's frequently shifting views on the war in Ukraine, which also included a Truth Social post arguing that Ukraine will be able to retake all of its original territory, contradicting recent statements from many of his own senior officials.

Perhaps the warnings will be enough to deter future Russian provocations. History suggests they will not. And if Russia persists, we appear to be headed for the type of clash that not so long ago was viewed as the nightmare scenario. The question is whether it can be contained.

‚ÄúPutin wants to signal to us, to say, ‚ÄòYou Lithuanians, you Poles, if you continue to support Ukraine, the war will come to you. You will feel this,'‚Äù Eitvydas Bajar≈´nas, a veteran Lithuanian diplomat and former ambassador to Russia, told Vox.

The incursions have spurred calls for increased NATO investment in air defense and drone detection. They have also highlighted how Russia's cheap, replaceable kamikaze drones can provide a strategic advantage. One Estonian official described them to the Associated Press as a ‚Äúlottery ticket that always wins‚Äù ‚Äî either they hit their target or the enemy has to down them with a missile that costs far more than the drone. European diplomats are planning for a meeting Friday to discuss planned investments in a so-called drone wall: a system of sensors, electronic warfare systems, and weapons to prevent further violations.

In the shorter term, the countries along NATO's eastern border are planning for more Russian provocations. Lithuania's parliament, to take one example, has authorized the country's military to shoot down any drones that enter its airspace.

‚ÄúIf the Europeans are repeatedly warning Russia not to violate its airspace over and over and over again, and nothing happens, then what kind of message does that send?‚Äù

But Bajar≈´nas, now a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, acknowledged that a violation by manned aircraft, as happened in nearby Estonia last week, would pose tougher decisions for NATO leaders. ‚ÄúThere will be no automaticity,‚Äù he said of the decision on whether to shoot down an aircraft. ‚ÄúEach case will be weighed and discussed among allies as much as possible, but sometimes you need to make decisions in minutes.‚Äù

The Russian government may also be looking to test whether all those allies are on the same page. Western European countries have traditionally been thought of as less hawkish on Russia than Poland and the Baltic states, given those countries' fraught history with Russia and the Soviet Union. But experts and former officials say there's little daylight between European countries when it comes to the necessity of defending NATO airspace.

The bigger question mark is whether Washington is on board, says Liana Fix, senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. While Trump, this week anyway, is standing behind Eastern Europe's right to defend its airspace, ‚ÄúI don't believe this is the view of the vice presidency or the Pentagon, who want to prevent, above being drawn into a conflict with Russia and have viewed the Baltics with suspicion in that regard,‚Äù Fix said.

Indeed, the Financial Times's Gideon Rachman reported this week that Trump administration officials have complained about the ‚ÄúEstonization‚Äù of European defense policy, referring to former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who is now the EU's foreign policy chief. The Baltic countries are viewed by some in power in Washington as dangerously ‚Äúideological‚Äù in their opposition to Putin.

Tensions are high as a war that has raged for years threatens to spill across international borders. Russia's military is accused of war crimes as it targets civilians and bombs cities to rubble. As the blistering air campaign continues, Russian aircraft repeatedly fly ‚Äî if only briefly ‚Äî into NATO airspace, prompting fears that a shooting war could erupt between Russia and the Western military alliance, both armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. After repeated incursions, a Russian fighter jet that ignored multiple warnings from the ground is shot down over NATO territory ‚Äî one of the two airmen is killed. #WorldWar3 trends on Twitter.

The year is 2015, and the Russian jet was shot down over NATO member Turkey after bombing nearby rebel targets in Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad's government. World War III, suffice to say, did not break out. Turkey and Russia restored relations in 2016 when Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, apologized for the incident.

The 2015 precedent is likely one on the minds of NATO policymakers as they contemplate a response to the recent air incursions. The growing consensus appears to be that the risks of allowing these provocations to continue outweigh the risks of responding to them. ‚ÄúIf the Europeans are repeatedly warning Russia not to violate its airspace over and over and over again, and nothing happens, then what kind of message does that send?‚Äù Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow and NATO analyst at the Atlantic Council told Vox, summarizing this emerging thought.

Still, it is notable that the sustained efforts by NATO governments and militaries to keep this raging war within Ukraine's borders appear to be failing already. They may hope that a decisive show of force ‚Äî perhaps even including NATO defenses downing a Russian jet or killing a pilot ‚Äî is a necessary response to Russia's latest escalation. But that doesn't mean the escalation will end.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","How Business Insider's investigation into Amazon Prime led to a record $2.5 billion settlement with the US government","https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-investigation-ftc-settlement-2025-9","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission on Thursday, resolving a case over its Prime subscription sign-up and cancellation practices that Business Insider exposed in an exclusive investigation.

The settlement is the largest civil penalty in a case involving an FTC rule violation, the regulator said.

BI's 2022 report, based on internal Amazon documents, showed that the company had known since at least 2017 that its website design misled customers into joining Prime, the membership program that offers perks such as free delivery and video streaming.

Despite years of complaints, Amazon took little meaningful action, and in some cases, abandoned proposed fixes after internal tests showed slower subscription growth, according to Business Insider's investigation. Following the story, the FTC revived a long-dormant probe, according to its earlier complaint.

""On March 14, 2022, Business Insider published information leaked from current and former Amazon employees regarding the problems with Amazon's Prime checkout enrollment flow and the Iliad Flow,"" the FTC wrote in a previous filing. ""The Commission quickly ascertained that Amazon had failed to disclose much of the now-leaked documents and information to the Commission, despite the fact that at least some of it was responsive to the outstanding CID. Amazon withheld the information.""

As part of Thursday's settlement, Amazon will pay a $1 billion penalty and refund consumers $1.5 billion, the FTC announced. The deal, reached three days after a Seattle jury was seated, bans Amazon and two executives from continuing the unlawful practices. It also requires Amazon to implement ""meaningful changes"" to its Prime enrollment and cancellation processes, ensuring transparent disclosures and streamlined procedures.

""The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,"" FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement.

An Amazon spokesperson told BI in an email that there was ""no admission of guilt in this settlement by the company or any executives.""

""Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers. We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we'll deliver for Prime members in the coming years,"" the spokesperson said.

In this article

Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi's MGX will be main investors in TikTok's U.S. business, sources told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday. 

Those three entities will control roughly 45% of TikTok USA, Faber reported. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent, will own 19.9%, with the remaining 35% in the hands of ByteDance investors and new holders.

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday backing the proposed deal that will keep the social media app running in the U.S. ByteDance has faced an ultimatum under a federal law requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S. That law passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress who expressed national security concerns about the app and its potent content algorithm.

Last week, Trump signed an executive order delaying the divestiture deadline until Dec. 16.

Trump has been trying to keep the app afloat, repeatedly mentioning how important it was to his presidential victory in November. Billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass is a major ByteDance investor through Susquehanna, and he also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social, Trump's social media company.

Backers of ByteDance, including General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok USA, sources told Faber.

The deal does not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a so-called golden share in TikTok's U.S. operations, CNBC reported Monday. The new joint venture will have a board of directors comprised of a majority of American members, and Oracle will oversee the app's security operations.

Trump said Sunday that conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch could be involved in the TikTok deal as well as Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.

Citadel CEO Ken Griffin on Thursday knocked the Trump administration for making deals with large corporations to avoid the full extent of its tariff policies, describing such agreements as anti-American.

""Is that our country, that we're going to favor the big and the connected?,"" Griffin told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from Miami. ""That's not the American story.""

""When the state becomes involved in picking winners and losers, there's only one way this game ends: All of us lose,"" added Griffin, a billionaire and top Wall Street figure.

Griffin's comments come as U.S. companies have raced to make agreements with the White House that allow them to avoid the steepest levies placed on imports from many foreign countries. Multiple well-known businesses including Apple and Nvidia have announced significant domestic investments in recent months, which have been viewed by some as ways to gain favor from the Trump administration.

""I spoke about my concerns with the crony capitalism if we went down the path of tariffs,"" Griffin said. ""The line outside the White House of every business arguing why they should be exempt from paying tariffs on what they import into their products is nauseating.""

The Wall Street bigwig said tariffs can be considered similar to a ""national sales tax."" Because the levies would make up a higher proportion of household income for lower earners, Griffin said there are ""issues of equity and fairness"" involved with Trump's tariff policy.

Griffin warned that companies should act carefully when it comes to trying to win favor of a current White House team. He said those companies could find themselves disliked or having to make new deals when a new person takes the nation's highest office.

""It's the government's engagement in picking winners and losers. And we should tread carefully on that water,"" Griffin said. ""In fact, we should just stay out of it. That's where the crocodiles live.""

""The core competency won't be that you can drive innovation,"" he added. ""It's that you can drive the right favors from D.C.""

Every living former chair of the Federal Reserve, as well as a slew of ex-Treasury secretaries and former White House economic advisors, urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to block President Donald Trump from firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook as her lawsuit challenging her removal proceeds.

The signers said in a legal brief, ""The independence of the Federal Reserve, within the limited authority granted by Congress to achieve the goals Congress itself has set, is a critical feature of our national monetary system.""

""Allowing the removal of Governor Lisa D. Cook while the challenge to her removal is pending would threaten that independence and erode public confidence in the Fed,"" the amicus brief said.

Signers of the brief included the former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen; former Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, Hank Paulson, Jack Lew, and Timothy Geithner; former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairs Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, Christina Romer, Cecilia Rouse, Jared Bernstein, and Jason Furman; and former Fed Governor Dan Tarullo.

Members of the group had served under, and been appointed by, both Democratic and Republican presidents.

The economists  Ken Rogoff, Phil Gramm, and John Cochrane also signed the brief, as did Phil Gramm, a Republican who previously served as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.

The brief said that allowing Cook to be removed now ""would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed's independence and jeopardizing the credibilityand efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.""

The filing comes as Cook's lawyers face a 4 p.m. ET Thursday deadline to respond to arguments by the Justice Department that Trump should be allowed to remove her from the seven-member Fed Board of Governors while the Supreme Court considers whether the president has legal cause to fire her.

Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with applications she filed for two residential properties she owns. Cook denies any wrongdoing.

Cook sued Trump in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asking a judge to block her removal.

That judge on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing Cook as her suit plays out. A three-judge panel on the federal appeals court in D.C., in a split decision, later upheld that order.

Trump then asked the Supreme Court to lift those rulings and allow him to remove Cook.

Oops, something went wrong

IREN, formerly known as Iris Energy Limited, which recently adopted an AI-focused strategy, is projected to benefit from its move.

As per estimations shared by Bernstein, the Bitcoin mining firm is likely to see a hike in its share prices.

Related: What is Bitcoin mining? Explained

IREN stock reflected a gain of 12.86% on Sep. 25. With this, its current price has come to $47.14. Estimations from Bernstein analysts predict that the stock price could hit a historic high of $75.

""We believe IREN has made adequate progress for us to take the AI cloud business seriously, and build an investment case for re-rating,"" The Block quoted Bernstein analysts as saying in a note to clients.

In the last six months, the shares of the Australia-headquartered company have reportedly risen by 500%, making it the largest public BTC miner by market cap. Its shares have also logged 305% year-to-date profit - piggybacking on the AI hype.

IREN has been mining BTC since 2019. Later in November 2021 it went public at $28 per share.

In July this year, the company started funding its pivot into AI. It started building its own AI cloud business in order to reduce the reliance on the on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV).

Earlier this week, it has managed to acquire advanced GPUs from Nvidia and AMD - for nearly $670 million - in order to power its AI cloud business. This move gave IREN access to some of the most in-demand chips driving the global AI boom.

As of Sep 25, the company's market cap stands at $12.8 billion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","ETH price below $4K: Ethereum's ‚Äòbiggest loser' hit with $36.4M liquidation","https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-price-below-4k-ethereum-biggest-loser-36-4m-liquidation","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:49:59 GMT","

 ETH's breakdown from a key chart pattern can now lead to more losses for Ether price, targeting the $3,600‚Äì$3,400 zone in the short term. 

Key takeaways:

One ETH trader lost $36.4M in a single liquidation, cementing over $45M in total losses.

Ethereum now faces heavy long liquidation clusters at $2,370‚Äì$2,500.

Ether price technicals hint at another 10%‚Äì15% drop this month.

An Ethereum trader lost $36.4 million following the liquidation of a massive long bet, after Ether (ETH) slid below the $4,000 mark on Thursday.

Wallet ‚Äú0xa523‚Äù had staked 9,152 ETH on a price rise, only to be wiped out in one of the largest single-trader losses in the past 24 hours. 

Wallet ‚Äú0xa523‚Äù was left with just $500,000, with its total realized losses exceeding $45.32 million, leading Lookonchain to call it Ethereum's ‚Äúbiggest loser.‚Äù

The wipeout came amid a $331.66 million long squeeze that has punished bullish traders over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

This week alone, Ethereum traders have suffered over $718 million in long liquidations versus $79.62 million in short liquidations. Ether's price has dipped 10.56% in the same period.

Related: How one trader turned $125K into $43M on Ether ‚Äî and what you can learn from it

CoinGlass's liquidation heatmap highlights a huge build-up of leverage between $2,370 and $2,500. 

Therefore, if ETH keeps falling, many longs are set to be liquidated in that range, making it a likely area where selling could intensify before the market regains its footing.

On the upside, a big cluster sits at $4,760‚Äì$5,000. Short sellers will be in trouble and could be forced to buy back, driving prices higher, if ETH rebounds to those levels.

Ethereum has confirmed a breakdown from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, typically a bearish reversal setup if it occurs after a strong uptrend. 

The move shifts immediate bias to the downside, with the next target sitting near the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $3,595, down by around 10% from current levels in the short term.

The downside target falls in the support zone ‚Äî the $3,600‚Äì$3,400 area ‚Äî highlighted by ETH's Volume Profile (VPVR). 

It further overlaps with ETH's 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $3,392, indicating that the price can drop by 15% in the worst-case scenario if the sell-off gains steam into October.

Popular analyst Kamran Azghar highlighted around $3,600 as a ‚Äúkey demand‚Äù zone, noting that the ETH price may rebound to seek $4,900 or higher.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's weekly chart showed price retesting a key horizontal support zone around $3,800‚Äì$4,000, as highlighted by analyst Cold Blood Shiller.

The area had acted as a resistance during the 2022‚Äì2023 cycle. A successful defense of this level would strengthen the case for bullish continuation, turning former resistance into support.

A rebound toward the $4,760‚Äì$5,000 cluster, as highlighted by many bullish analysts in the past, remains possible if ETH bulls defend the $3,800‚Äì$4,000 levels in the coming days.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

SharpLink Gaming, the Nasdaq-listed affiliate marketing and gaming software firm-turned ETH treasury company, plans to become the first public company to natively issue its common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

SharpLink has appointed Superstate as its digital transfer agent, according to a statement on Thursday, using its Opening Bell onchain issuance solution to tokenize SBET equity in a legally compliant way. The firm said it aims to demonstrate how public companies can use blockchain infrastructure to create shareholder value, improve market efficiency, and drive forward the next generation of capital markets.

The two companies also plan to explore compliant ways for tokenized equities to trade on automated market makers and other DeFi protocols, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's Project Crypto initiative to modernize securities regulation for digital assets and onchain markets.

""SharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate's Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company,"" Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said. ""We're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond.""

SharpLink joins other public firms such as the recently-formed Solana treasury company Forward Industries and crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital in leveraging Superstate's Opening Bell for stock tokenization, albeit on the Solana blockchain in their case. Robinhood, xStocks, and Coinbase are also pursuing onchain solutions for public equities as the tokenization trend gains traction.

Chaired by Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin, SharpLink embarked on its Ethereum treasury strategy in June and has since accumulated more than 830,000 ETH ($3.3 billion) and generated over 3,815 ETH ($15.3 million) in staking rewards. It is currently the second-largest corporate Ethereum holder behind Tom Lee's BitMine, according to SER data.



""We're proud to have been the first public company to become a Digital Asset Treasury company on Ethereum, onboarding traditional finance to Ethereum. And now we are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum,"" Lubin said Thursday. ""As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink's conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built.""

SBET is trading down 5% in Thursday trading, according to The Block's SharpLink price page, echoing a broader correction across the crypto market.

        Share    

This week's crypto crash continued today, Sept. 25, with Bitcoin plunging to $110,000 and the market capitalization of all coins falling to $3.81 trillion.

Only five top-100 coins were in the green today, with popular tokens like Avalanche (AVAX), Aster (ASTER), and Dogecoin (DOGE) falling by over 10%. 

Avalanche has plunged by 16% from its highest point this month, while Aster and Dogecoin have fallen by over 15% in the same period.

One major reason for the crypto crash is the fear that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as many times as it hinted in its meeting last week.

In a statement this week, Jerome Powell suggested that the Fed was still concerned about inflation. Other Fed officials, including Beth Hammack and Austan Goolsbee, urged the bank to exercise caution when cutting rates.

Their message was that U.S. inflation remains high and that the labor market is still tight, with the unemployment rate hovering at 4.3%.

Cryptocurrencies do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates, as that leads to a risk-on sentiment.

Bitcoin and altcoins like Avalanche, Aster, and Dogecoin also plunged as sentiment in the industry worsened. This situation is demonstrated by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has dived from this month's high of 73 to 41. It is at risk of plunging to the fear area.

In most cases, cryptocurrencies drop when the index moves to the fear zone. In contrast, most coins rally when there is greed, as this stimulates fear of missing out among investors.

The other reason why the crypto market is going down is that liquidations have jumped this week. Crypto liquidations jumped by 100% on Thursday to $585 million. 

Liquidations also jumped by over 800% on Monday to more than $1.65 billion. Avalanche had liquidations worth over $9.4 million on Monday and $5.5 million on Thursday.

Similarly, Dogecoin liquidations jumped to $58.6 million and $11.8 million on the two days, respectively. 

Soaring liquidations are bearish for the crypto market, as they mean that long positions are being closed. Also, traders often stay on the sidelines when this happens. Data shows that the futures open interest of all coins fell by 2% on Thursday to $203 billion.

The new token is aimed at becoming ‚Äúa trusted European payment standard in the digital ecosystem,‚Äù per a Thursday (Sept. 25) news release from Denmark's Danske Bank, which is joined in the partnership by ING, Banca Sella, KBC, DekaBank, UniCredit, SEB, CaixaBank and Raiffeisen Bank International.

‚ÄúThe stablecoin will provide near-instant, low-cost payments and settlements,‚Äù the release said. ‚ÄúIt will enable 24/7 access to efficient cross-border payments, programmable payments, and improvements in supply chain management and digital asset settlements, which can vary from securities to cryptocurrencies.‚Äù

The stablecoin will be regulated by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA), and is expected to be first issued in the second half of next year.

The nine banks have formed a new company in the Netherlands, hoping to be licensed and supervised by the Dutch Central Bank as an e-money institution. This group is open to other banks joining, the release said.

The banks say their goal is to present a European alternative to what they say is a ‚ÄúUS-dominated‚Äù stablecoin market, while also ‚Äúcontributing to Europe's strategic autonomy in payments.‚Äù Individual banks will be able to offer value added services, like a stablecoin wallet and custody.

‚ÄúDigital assets have the power to transform the financial landscape ‚Äî not just by introducing new forms of money, but by unlocking meaningful efficiencies and savings for both the financial sector and customers,‚Äù added Flaminia Lucia Franca, Danske's head of transaction banking.

The announcement follows a partnership announced this spring by four of America's largest banks ‚Äî JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup ‚Äî to explore the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin.

As PYMNTS wrote in May, the proposed stablecoin would be backed by fiat held at the banks and operate like other stablecoins, but with one key difference: trust in institutional governance.

This vision is a marked departure from the early crypto sector ethos of disrupting incumbent financial players, that report added. Rather, it's a bet that those incumbents are best positioned to bring digital currencies into the mainstream.

‚ÄúWhen you think about the needs of every FinTech or payments company, or a bank that wants to enter the [stablecoin] space, they need secure infrastructure, from the creation of assets, such as tokenizing them, to holding them, and of course moving them,‚Äù Utila Co-founder and CEO Bentzi Rabi told PYMNTS in April. ‚ÄúEveryone will enter the stablecoin era in the end.‚Äù

The output of new enforcement actions from the Commodity Future
Trading Commission (CFTC) has virtually ground to a halt in 2025,
with a slowdown that greatly exceeds the slower pace of new
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions. But,
the CFTC Division of Enforcement has not gone away. A commodity
trading adviser (CTA) as well as a commodity pool operator (CPO)
and its principal, who previously pled guilty to orchestrating a
novel cryptocurrency-related fraudulent scheme, have agreed to pay
more than $2.8 million as part of a settlement with the CFTC,
announced on September 17, 2025.1 The CFTC's
announcement stated that it had obtained this judgment against
Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), the CTA and CPO, and Peter
Kambolin, its owner and registered associated person (collectively
the ""Defendants""). In the parallel criminal case,
Kambolin previously pled guilty in October of 2023.2

According to the consent order, these Defendants improperly
allocated profitable trades between two commodity pools and certain
proprietary accounts, misled pool participants, and violated CFTC
requirements on trade allocation. The court found from January 2019
through November 2021 that the Defendants marketed SAM as a CTA and
CPO offering strategies in exchange-traded cryptocurrency and
foreign exchange futures.

The Defendants ran at least two pools but executed those pool
trades alongside trades of their proprietary accounts and then
allocated the trades across the accounts each day. More
specifically, the Defendants consistently directed profitable
trades to their own accounts and assigned losing or less profitable
trades to the pools, defrauding participants and violating CFTC
requirements that customer trades be allocated fairly and
equitably. They also misrepresented that the pools would primarily
trade cryptocurrency and FX futures. To the contrary, more than
half of the trades in question actually involved equity index
futures.

Returning to the criminal case and his guilty plea,
Kambolin's case marked the first time that prosecutors brought
criminal charges related to cherry-picking against a commodity pool
trader focused, at least in part, on digital asset futures.
Kambolin was sentenced in January 2024 to two years in prison,
followed by three years of supervised release and a year-and-a-half
of home confinement. He also was ordered to pay $1.63 million in
criminal forfeiture and $1.2 million in restitution. The CFTC
consent order specified that money paid toward forfeiture and
restitution in the criminal case will be credited dollar-for-dollar
toward the civil amounts.

At the 80th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Pakistan took a visible step forward in shaping the global debate on technology, youth, and sustainable development. Represented by Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, Bilal Bin Saqib, who spoke at two high-level side events: one on Social Business, Youth and Technology and another on AI Capacity Building, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and ICAIRE with the support of the UN Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies.

Across both engagements, Bilal Bin Saqib and Pakistan's message was clear: for the developing world, technology is not an optional add-on but an essential tool for survival, resilience, and progress. In the social business forum, Pakistan underscored the reality that millions of young people are already using digital tools to receive remittances, fund micro-enterprises, and connect with the global economy. This adoption is not driven by speculation but by necessity, families seeking faster payments, entrepreneurs looking for capital, and communities searching for solutions. The challenge, as Pakistan framed it, is how to channel this grassroots energy into transparent, accountable, and socially productive systems that can scale.

The second intervention on artificial intelligence reinforced the same theme but through a broader lens. Pakistani Crypto Minister stated that AI is not a luxury reserved for advanced economies, but a necessity for developing nations seeking to leapfrog structural barriers. His call was for global cooperation to ensure equitable access, ethical safeguards, and collaborative models that allow the Global South to build capacity rather than fall further behind.

What made these interventions significant was not only the content but also the context. Pakistan was not speaking from the sidelines. At UNGA80, it was treated as an active participant in shaping the global conversation on the intersection of technology, development, and youth empowerment. 

The progress made in digital adoption, particularly in crypto and blockchain, was acknowledged in New York as a case study of how emerging economies can move quickly when driven by need.

For Pakistan, this marks a subtle but important shift in perception. No longer simply a recipient of development agendas, the country is positioning itself as a contributor of ideas and models, demonstrating how digital assets, social business frameworks, and AI can converge to tackle challenges of poverty, inequality, and climate vulnerability. The UNGA80 discussions showed that Pakistan is increasingly being viewed not as a follower, but as a country ready to lead in the Global South's engagement with emerging technologies.

Bilal Bin Saqib also met with Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, the President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, and Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development and Innovation, Zhaslan Madiyev, during his visit to New York.

A rough early session for crypto markets took a turn for the worse in U.S. afternoon hours Thursday, with BTC$109,669.81 tumbling below $109,000, its weakest price in nearly a month.

ETH$3,935.96 plummeted 8% through the past 24 hours rapidly approaching $3,800, erasing gains since early August. It's now has lost 22% since its record highs last month. SOL$200.41, changing hands above $250 only two weeks ago, plunged below $200, down another 8% today. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 6%.

The sharp move lower across the board triggered a widespread leverage flush on derivatives markets, liquidating over $1.1 billion worth of leveraged trading positions, CoinGlass data shows. Ether led liquidations with over $400 million long positions, or bets on higher prices, being wiped out, followed by bitcoin's $265 million.

Crypto equities also took a hit. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate owner of BTC, sunk as much as 10% during the session to five-month low. The stock, which is often seen as a leveraged bet on bitcoin's price, gave up all of this year's gains and is now 1.5% down year-to-date, while BTC is still holding on 16% advance during the same period.

Ether treasury firms Bitmine (BMNR) and Sharplink Gaming (SBET) were down 7%-8%,as were bitcoin miners MARA Holdings. (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT).

With Thursday's nosedive, BTC is now on the brink of taking out the lows of late August-early September, when it bottomed just above $107,000. That price level could serve as support at least for a bounce, with order books also showing a liquidity cluster which could absorb selling pressure, CoinDesk reported on a Hyblock Capital analysis.

Real-world asset specialist Centrifuge has launched what it calls the first licensed S&P 500 index fund on blockchain rails, opening one of the world's most recognized equity benchmarks to on-chain investors.

The Janus Henderson Anemoy S&P 500 Fund, dubbed SPXA, went live on Thursday on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by crypto exchange Coinbase.

The offering is the first tokenized index fund licensed by the S&P Dow Jones Indices. It allows the S&P 500, a wide basket of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies that covers roughly 80% of the U.S. equity market, to trade around the clock with transparent holdings.

FalconX, a digital asset brokerage, was an anchor investor in the product, while Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, will handle future expansion to other blockchains. Janus Henderson, a London-based global asset manager with nearly $500 billion in AUM, is serving as sub-investment manager, while Centrifuge's asset management arm Anemoy oversees the fund.

The initiative fits into a broader trend of bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and equities, often called real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Proponents explore tokenization for operational gains, speedier settlements and around-the-clock trading.

Centrifuge, which has built infrastructure for tokenizing private credit and fixed income since 2017, sees SPXA as its entry point into equities, a tokenization trend that has recently taken off.

""Indices are the best way to bring stocks on-chain,"" Bhaji Illuminati, CEO of Centrifuge, said in a statement. ""They're simple, collateral-ready and unlock liquidity in ways individual securities can't.""

For S&P Dow Jones Indices, the offering is a stepping stone to ""build the future of index-linked financial products"" traditional finance products are beginning to migrate to blockchain environments, said Cameron Drinkwater, chief product officer at S&P DJI.

 Stablecoin payments firm RedotPay said it became a fintech unicorn after a $47 million round with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Galaxy Ventures and Vertex Ventures. 

Stablecoin payments firm RedotPay said it joined the ranks of fintech unicorns after securing a $47 million strategic investment round. 

The raise saw participation from Coinbase Ventures, with continued backing from Galaxy Ventures and Vertex Ventures, and support from a global tech entrepreneur whose identity was not disclosed, according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph. In venture capital, a unicorn refers to a privately held startup valued at $1 billion or more.

‚ÄúHaving Coinbase Ventures join us, along with the continued support from Galaxy Ventures and Vertex Ventures, validates the progress we've made and the confidence investors have in our vision,‚Äù CEO Michael Gao said. 

Founded in April 2023, RedotPay offers stablecoin-powered cards, multicurrency wallets and global payout services. The company has reportedly reached over 5 million users and processed $10 billion in total payment volume (TPV) since its launch.

Studies indicate that a simple treatment could halt a leading cause of death for millions of people.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

We all have moments when we start to worry about our memories. You lose your keys. You forget the name of someone you know well. That alone is scary. And then there's dementia: You forget recent conversations; whole hours or afternoons become blank. You struggle with simple tasks you've done a million times: tying your shoes, making coffee. The person who used to plan trips while cooking dinner with friends and being the DJ for the party now lies awake at night in fear and spends days staring, because they don't know where they are or what to do next. Anger, depression, and confusion grow. You can remember enough to know‚Äîthis isn't your life.

It is possible that microscopic structures in your nerve cells are unraveling‚Äîand with them, your sense of who you are. 

It is also possible that putting a $150 object the size of a hairdryer against your head for a short period each day could stop dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Even reverse it. If it works, there would be no more watching people disappear bit by bit. And we'd see a huge reduction in one of the leading causes of death. 

Evidence is building that exposing the brain to short bouts of an extremely low-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) signal can slow or reverse the impacts of Alzheimer's. Anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, has studied the minute structures of the brain for decades‚Äìespecially those microscopic structures called microtubules that may contain our memories. Hameroff is the Senior Scientist at Arizona Astrobiology Center, former director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona and Co-Director of the Science of Consciousness Conference. He was an early voice among a growing body of scientists who think electromagnetism encourages microtubules to hold together.

Microtubules are protein structures that look something like cylindrical tubes made of beads, forming part of the cytoskeleton of all living cells. They're like the bones of the cell. But they're also oscillators that generate, propagate, and amplify electrical signals; so they're effectively the nerve center of the cell. Hameroff has been studying microtubules for decades as the possible biological structure that enables consciousness. He says he believes microtubules store our memories. After all, neurons last our entire lives, unlike most of the rest of our cells, which are constantly replaced.

There are tens of thousands of microtubules in every neuron. The most prevalent protein in them is called tau, which serves key functions for the microtubule, including possibly stabilizing it. When scientists have examined the neuronal cells of people who have died from Alzheimer's, they discovered piles of tau that appear to have fallen off the microtubules and stuck together in clumps called Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), or tau tangles. These tangles show tau in a specific state that is an Alzheimer's marker. When tau shows up in the bloodstream or urine, you know the disease is worsening. 

In Alzheimer's disease, Hameroff says, scientists don't know whether the microtubules disintegrate and release the tau or whether the tau falls off because of a malfunction that weakens the bond. The result is that the microtubules disintegrate. But there's a clear correlation between this breakup and Alzheimer's.

‚ÄúSo imagine, God forbid, your bones started to dissolve,‚Äù Hameroff says. ‚ÄúYou get really short and you lose all this mass. And if your bones are also your nervous system (the electrical signaling), you lose your nervous system.‚Äù This is what he believes happens in Alzheimer's. The microtubules, which serve as both the bones and the nervous system of the neuron, fall apart, so the neuron shrinks. When it does so, synapses are pulled away from one another. As the system collapses, memories and cognition are lost.

Another key marker of Alzheimer's is the presence of amyloid plaques‚Äîa sticky substance in the brain that can build up along the neural pathways outside the neuron. For decades the pharmaceutical industry has been creating drugs to remove the plaques. But many researchers say there's no convincing evidence that plaques cause Alzheimer's. People with the plaques don't always have symptoms; people with symptoms don't always have the plaques. 

Drug companies' efforts to use anti-amyloid antibodies over the last 20 to 30 years haven't worked to make patients better, Hameroff says. And there is no drug to address what is causing the tau tangles, though the tangles themselves aren't toxic, he adds.

The cost to treat the plaques can be enormous. A 2024 article published by Northeastern University noted that a new IV infusion therapy Kisunla, given once a month to people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, was $32,000 a year. Leqembi, another amyloid-destroying IV therapy for Alzheimer's, costs $26,500 a year.

Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organization, 55 million people globally live with dementia, with another 10 million cases diagnosed annually. Most people think Alzheimer's Disease and dementia are a normal part of aging, but they're not. While these diseases only affect about 10 percent of older people, they're also the seventh leading cause of death, and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. In 2019, dementia cost economies $1.3 trillion globally; approximately half of these costs are attributable to informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average five hours of care and supervision per day.

That's where the inexpensive brain zapper comes in.

Several studies have indicated that subjecting the brain to various ELF-EMF treatments can positively impact several systems in the microtubule. And that results in better brain function.

Researchers published a study in February in the European Journal of Neuroscience where they tested the theory that a 40Hz signal would reverse microtubule-tau disintegration. Not only did cells that had microtubule-tau separation damage stay intact when treated with multiple bouts of ELF-EMF, but it also significantly reduced the cause of weakened bonds between tau and the microtubule. Researchers also found that other frequencies in neuron-like cultures could help with microtubule development and regeneration.

Hameroff has been working with quantum mechanics expert Anirban Bandyopadhyay, PhD, who heads the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan. Bandyopadhyay previously discovered that numerous bands of electromagnetic energy exist within microtubules, at multiple frequencies and time signatures. 

It's important, Hameroff notes, that the only safe treatment strictly uses just the very low frequencies. Mid-range frequencies will open the blood-brain barrier which, as he says, is there for a reason. Higher frequencies are used to cause lesions, like zapping a tumor. 

Hameroff had made his own efforts to test these theories in 2011. He proposed to colleagues at one point that they experiment with using ultrasound to try to ease depression in some of their chronic pain patients. He reckoned the ultrasound machine the hospital was already using to find brain bleeds in infants might be safe enough to test on the brain.

‚ÄúAnd they said, yeah, great idea, Hameroff. You go first. You got a nice shaved head. Go ahead. We'll watch.‚Äù At the end of a long day in the operating room, his colleagues wheeled in an ultrasound machine. ‚ÄúSo I put the goop on. I put it to my head and turned it on. I kept it there for about 30 seconds, maybe, and I didn't feel anything. I was disappointed, so I put it down. But about a minute later, I got a buzz, and I started being buzzed for like two hours. And I was really creative, energetic. I felt tremendous,‚Äú Hameroff says.

The next day he recommended trying the treatment on patients experiencing pain. During a double-blind study‚Äîin which doctors didn't know whether a patient received true treatment or a placebo‚Äîthey asked people about changes in their mood, 10 minutes and 40 minutes after the treatment. 

‚ÄúSo it was not the best study in the world,‚Äù Hameroff says, ‚Äúbut it showed a positive effect in a double-blind study, and no side effects. We published it in the journal Brain Stimulation.‚Äù

Over the last decade, more studies have found that electromagnetic brain stimulation can address myriad issues. As a result, neuroscientists have used it to treat specific parts of the brain for specific conditions.  

So a budget brain zapper for Alzheimer's would do a lot of good. Because memory is stored all over the brain, with emotions, skills, spatial awareness, and sensory recall located in various parts of the cortex, Hameroff believes that treating the whole brain with ultrasound is probably the ticket. 

An ultrasound machine at a hospital, he says, costs around $70,000. The machine they're considering, the USPro2000, costs around $150. (Ironically he suspects that's one reason he's finding it difficult to get funding for medical trials: if it works, nobody will get rich. People will just get better.) 

A friend of Hameroff's, Sterling Cooley, had basically been doing informal tests using the device‚Äîa process Hameroff kept his distance from, given that he has a medical license to protect. However, after Hameroff talked with people at The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)‚Äîan American non-profit parapsychological research institute‚Äîthey offered to use their institutional review board to validate Cooley's results and make further research legal. 

‚ÄúWe have to be careful what we say,‚Äù Hameroff says. ‚ÄúWe're not treating Alzheimer's. We're treating mental memory problems. And we call it brain massage, ultrasonic brain massage. Which sounds a little bit better. It's kind of what it is.‚Äù

IONS Institutional Review Board also insisted that if the patients wanted to enroll, they had to have their doctor's permission. That slowed things down, Hameroff says. He's hoping for more funding to advance this treatment effort. ‚ÄúBut in the meantime, more and more papers are coming out showing improvement in Alzheimer's with ultrasound,‚Äù he says. One paper showed that cognition and memory improved significantly, and neural degeneration in the part of the brain responsible for  higher-order functions was reversed.

‚ÄúMy dream, I guess, is to go to the memory care facility near my house, which has gone from one city block to five city blocks since I've lived there, and go room to room and give everybody, you know, five minutes.‚Äù 

Then he'd like to modify the machine to use all the microtubule resonant frequencies Bandyopadhyay has discovered. He wants to call it The Tubulator 5000. 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúmaybe we'll do that.‚Äù

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hidden bacterial molecules in the brain reveal new secrets of sleep","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250925025336.htm","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 08:06:45 GMT","

What causes us to sleep? The answer may lie not only in our brains, but in their complex interplay with the micro-organisms spawned in our intestines.

New research from Washington State University suggests a new paradigm in understanding sleep, demonstrating that a substance in the mesh-like walls of bacteria, known as peptidoglycan, is naturally present in the brains of mice and closely aligned with the sleep cycle.

Those findings serve to update a broader hypothesis that has been in development at WSU for years -- proposing that sleep arises from communication between the body's sleep regulatory systems and the multitude of microbes living inside us.

""This added a new dimension to what we already know,"" said Erika English, a PhD candidate at WSU and lead author on two recently published scientific papers introducing the findings.

This view of sleep as arising from that ""holobiont condition"" joins a growing body of evidence suggesting that our gut microbiomes play an important role in cognition, appetite, sex drive and other activity -- a view that turns traditional brain-centric models of cognition upside-down and has implications for our understanding of evolution and free will, as well as the development of future treatments for sleep disorders.

The recent findings regarding peptidoglycan, or PG, lend weight to that hypothesis and point to a possible regulatory role for bacterial cell wall products in sleep. PG is known to promote sleep when injected in animals, but until recently, the conventional view held that it did not naturally migrate to the brain.

English found that PG, along with its receptor molecules involved in PG signaling and communication, was present in different locations within the brain, at levels that changed with the time of day and sleep deprivation.

The findings were reported in July in Frontiers in Neuroscience; longtime WSU sleep researcher and Regents Professor James Krueger co-authored the paper. English is also lead author of a recent paper with Krueger in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews that proposes the ""holobiont condition"" hypothesis of sleep.

That paper combines two prevailing views. One posits that sleep is regulated by the brain and neurological systems. Another focuses on ""local sleep,"" which frames slumber as the result of an accumulation of sleep-like states among small cellular networks throughout the body. Such sleep-like states have been observed among cells in vitro, known as the ""sleep in a dish"" model.

As these smaller pockets of sleep accumulate, like lights going off in a house, the body tips from wakefulness toward sleep.

The new hypothesis merges those theories, proposing that sleep results from the interplay between the body and its resident micro-organisms -- two autonomous systems that interact and overlap.

""It's not one or the other, it's both. They have to work together,"" English said. ""Sleep really is a process. It happens at many different speeds for different levels of cellular and tissue organization and it comes about because of extensive coordination.""

Links between the microbiome and behavior are emerging on several fronts, indicating that micro-organisms formed in the gut play an important role in cognition and fundamental human behaviors. This work upends the traditional view of human neurology, suggesting that it is not completely top-down -- i.e., the result of decision-making in the brain -- but bottom-up -- i.e., driven by the tiny organisms whose evolution shaped animals to serve as their hosts and whose needs influence the activities and cognition of their hosts.

""We have a whole community of microbes living within us. Those microbes have a much longer evolutionary history than any mammal, bird or insect - much longer, billions of years longer,"" said Krueger, who was named a ""Living Legend in Sleep Research"" by the Sleep Research Society in 2023. ""We think sleep evolution began eons ago with the activity/inactivity cycle of bacteria, and the molecules that were driving that are related to the ones driving cognition today.""

English's work expands upon known links between bacteria and sleep, including the fact that sleep patterns affect the function of the gut microbiome and that bacterial infections cause people to sleep more.

The new findings begin to delve into questions that English looks forward to exploring further.

""Now that the world has come to appreciate how important microbes are, not just for disease but also for health, it's a very exciting time to start to expand on our understanding of how we are communicating with our microbes and how our microbes are communicating with us,"" she said.

Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of nanoscopic defects or microstructures in ice crystallized from liquid water has never been obtained. This is mainly due to the difficulties in preparing and preserving crystalline ice samples that can survive under high-resolution imaging conditions. Here, we report the stabilization and √Ö-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water by developing cryogenic liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (CRYOLIC-TEM). We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work improves our understanding of water crystallization behaviors at a molecular spatial resolution.

Ice crystallization is one of the most important processes in the ecosphere and is central to atmospheric processes1,2,3, transportation safety4,5,6,7, biomedical cryopreservation8,9, and the food industry10,11. Among all ice species, hexagonal ice (type Ih) crystallized from liquid water is most prevalent in the ambient. Due to the weak hydrogen bonds between water molecules, these structures can easily deform on the molecular scale during crystallization12,13. The precipitation of dissolved gas in water can further generate cavities in ice crystals; their formation and migration are exclusive to liquid-crystallized ice14,15 with profound implications in glaciology and paleoclimatology16,17. Elucidating defects and microstructures of ice, particularly their molecular origins, is critical to understanding the thermodynamics, phase transformation, and mechanical properties of ice18 and many other hydrogen-bonded crystals19,20,21.

Despite substantial interest in ice on the molecular scale, most studies rely on in-silico simulations22,23,24,25 and ensemble-scale spectroscopy and diffraction26,27,28. Meanwhile, real-space imaging in ice at this scale remains incredibly challenging due to the conflict between the low stability of ice and the harsh and invasive conditions often required by high-resolution imaging techniques. Recent breakthroughs in low-dose cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)29,30,31,32 and ultra-high vacuum scanning probe microscopy33,34 have enabled atomic-resolution imaging of ice condensed from the gas phase or converted from vitrified films. However, these experiments have typically been limited to crystals with random shapes and far-from-equilibrium structures because they rely on phase transformation and deposition at ultra-low temperatures in a high vacuum. Although cryo-TEM has recently been used to observe crystalline ice films prepared by liquid nitrogen, the structures that have been observed are limited to single crystals and low-energy stacking faults35. Molecular-resolution imaging of the microstructures and defects formed by the crystallization of liquid water remains elusive to date.

Herein, we report an approach to freeze liquid water into high-quality ice Ih samples, termed cryogenic liquid-cell TEM (CRYOLIC-TEM), which allows for high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging. Inspired by advances in liquid-phase electron microscopy36, this method freezes liquid water between amorphous carbon (a-C) membranes into large-area (up to microns in size) single-crystalline ice Ih films stable under the electron beam. Aberration-corrected HRTEM imaging at a line resolution better than 2‚Äâ√Ö is routinely achieved with a record of 1.3‚Äâ√Ö in continuous single-crystalline regions. This new capability enables us to directly correlate lattice mapping with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on machine-learned models to elucidate defect nanostructures formed by liquid water crystallization. The formation, migration, coalescence, and dissolution trajectories of nanobubbles in single-crystalline ice are further observed in situ under the electron beam. This work provides a versatile way for accessing close-to-equilibrium ice Ih in TEM and unlocks previously inaccessible avenues to probe the nano- and molecular-scale interfacial configurations of ice and their structural dynamics.

To freeze liquid water into ice Ih membranes suitable for TEM imaging, we first encapsulated deionized water between two TEM grids coated with a-C membranes and then loaded the sample onto a cryo-TEM sample holder (Fig. 1a). The sample was subsequently cooled by liquid nitrogen along with the holder. This process is substantially slower than vitrification in standard cryo-TEM, allowing for the crystallization of water. Flat, robust, and smooth a-C membranes are necessary for obtaining large-area, high-quality ice single crystals (Supplementary Fig. 1). The surface properties of the a-C membrane are similar to that of graphite (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Exposing the cold sample to the atmosphere may result in the condensation of ice spherulites on the a-C film. This low-temperature (typically‚Äâ<‚Äâ‚àí180‚Äâ¬∞C) gas-phase ice deposition results in far-from-equilibrium mixtures of ice Ih and Ic (Supplementary Fig. 4), consistent with literature reports26,30,31,37. In contrast, ice formed by water crystallization between the a-C membranes often shows a flat morphology (Fig. 1b) and can be easily distinguished from condensed ice. In these crystals, single-crystalline regions aligned (or close) to the [0001] zone axis can often be found with areas up to several microns (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The thickness of encapsulated ice can vary from ~10‚Äânm to micron-scale, depending on the geometry of the pocket (see Supplementary Fig. 9). Still, high-quality HRTEM images can be acquired from relatively thin regions, achieving a record line resolution of 1.3‚Äâ√Ö (Fig. 1d). Preparing samples on a double-tilt cryo holder further facilitates diffraction and HRTEM imaging of single crystals along other zone axes (Fig. 1e, f, and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Importantly, these single-crystalline areas can withstand HRTEM imaging for at least minutes (electron flux up to ~100‚Äâe‚Äâ√Ö‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1) without developing discernable nanoscale defects (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).

The low-loss profiles were deconvolved using the Fourier-log algorithm to remove the zero-loss peak and plural scattering. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Cryogenic electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) was performed to evaluate the high chemical purity of the encapsulated ice (Fig. 1g, h). After subtracting the inelastic scattering from the a-C membranes, the low-loss spectrum of encapsulated ice shows a relatively sharp peak centered at ‚âà8.5‚ÄâeV and a broad peak at ‚âà15‚ÄâeV (Fig. 1g). The former is characteristic of the excitonic 1b1‚Äâ‚Üí‚Äâ4a1 orbital transition of H2O in ice38,39 and can be unequivocally distinguished from the œÄ‚Äâ‚Üí‚ÄâœÄ* transition from graphitic carbon39 or aromatic organics38 at lower energy. Accordingly, this method results in highly pure ice samples by avoiding the organic contamination frequently encountered by other encapsulation techniques, such as frozen graphene liquid cells40, caused by the solute concentration effect41,42. The broad peak is located at a lower energy than the bulk plasmon typically reported in the literature29,38,39, possibly due to the ice-carbon interface. Core-loss EELS profiles for the oxygen K edge also confirmed the highly pure chemical environment of the encapsulated ice (Fig. 1h).

The strip-shaped crystal section in Fig. 1b appears to be a single crystal according to diffraction criteria (Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, lattice-resolved HRTEM images reveal highly defective textures near the edge areas despite a perfect hexagonal pattern in the Fourier transform (Fig. 2a, b). A relatively strong defocus was applied to obtain sufficient contrast. Indeed, these edge areas are substantially more volatile under beam irradiation (electron flux density‚Äâ<‚Äâ20‚Äâe‚Äâ√Ö‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1) compared to large single-crystalline sections. The surface of this edge area is near-atomically smooth along the\(\,\left\langle \bar{1}100\right\rangle\) direction, which suggests an exposed \(\{\bar{2}110\}\) surface assuming a vertical facet.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To analyze the spatial distribution of the nanoscale defects, we developed a lattice amplitude mapping approach to evaluate the local crystal misorientation from the zone axis (see Methods). Colors in the map represent the relative strength of the lattice patterns in the three \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) directions. In this map (Fig. 2c), a white color suggests that the local area's zone axis [0001] is perfectly aligned with the incident electrons. A red color, for example, suggests that the local area is tilted by rotating around axis A in Fig. 2c. In this case, we only focus on the color balance rather than pixel intensities, as the varying thickness and the oscillatory contrast transfer function may complicate the latter. Nonetheless, nanostructures identified from lattice amplitude maps are generally insensitive to defocus, and only minor shifts in the overall color balance were observed at different defocus settings due to the slight imbalance of the beam deflectors (Supplementary Fig. 12). The lattice amplitude map at the defective edge reveals many subdomains on the 10- to 20-nm scale that are tilted away from each other despite the appearance of single-crystallinity according to the diffraction pattern (Fig. 1c) and the Fourier transform (Fig. 2b). This observation contrasts with that of the highly continuous lattice, indicative of high-quality single crystals with minimal nanoscale defects, away from the thin edges (Supplementary Fig. 12).

By converting the red-green-blue (RGB) model of the composite image into the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model, we can further evaluate the orientation and the relative degree of the tilt (Fig. 2e, f). In this model, the pixel saturation represents the color balance, therefore is directly correlated to the orientation which the local crystal domain tilts toward. Here, the subdomain orientation shows a significantly wider distribution compared to that in continuous lattices (Supplementary Fig. 13). The two dominant orientations are ‚âà9¬∞ and ‚âà127¬∞, suggesting that the subdomain tilting towards the a axes (rotating around the normal vector of a primary prism plane) is slightly preferred. More importantly, the pixel saturation is associated with the relative tilt of the c axis from the imaging direction. This is a semi-quantitative evaluation because the absolute value depends on the crystal thickness. The saturation histogram reveals that the tilt angle is distributed over a wide range with multiple broad peaks, indicating the presence of shallow local energy minima.

The HRTEM image further reveals the interfacial structures (Fig. 2d). Here, neighboring subdomains connect through relatively sharp interfaces or show gradual distortion over a few nanometers (i.e., mild change in the anisotropy of the lattice patterns). The typical tilt angle of such structures is on the scale of 1¬∞ to allow for the visibility of the ice \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) patterns according to both lattice visibility criteria43,44 (Supplementary Fig. 17) and kinematical TEM simulations (Supplementary Figs. 18‚Äì29). Notably, a wide variety of interfaces exist with different tilt angles, orientations, and length scales.

MD simulations were employed to study the interfacial structure and energy landscape of these configurations. We used a coarse-grained machine-learned bond order potential (ML-BOP) model of water, which correctly captured the thermodynamic properties of water phases in good agreement with experiments23. A low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) between two single-crystalline domains was constructed by rotating one around the a2 axis, annealing at 260‚ÄâK, and cooling to 93‚ÄâK (see ‚ÄúMethods‚Äù and Supplementary Note 2). We systematically varied the sample thickness and initial tilt angle to evaluate the post-annealing structures and energetics in a broad structural space (see Supplementary Data 1).

For very thin, freestanding ice structures consisting of a few molecular layers (thickness: ‚âà4.4‚Äânm; h‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ2, where h is the number of supercells (3 unit cells in the c axis, ‚âà22‚Äâ√Ö)), the post-annealing tilt angle significantly deviates from the initial setup (Fig. 3a, upper panel). A wide range of tilt angles are unstable as structures bounce back or forward during annealing. As ice thickness increases, the range of unstable configurations and the tilt angle deviation during annealing are reduced. The same trend is also reflected in the energy landscape of the annealed structures (Fig. 3a, lower panel). A substantial energy variance was observed for few-layer structures, indicating their instability. However, for thicker films of h‚Äâ=‚Äâ6 and 12 (thickness: ‚âà13.2 and ‚âà26.3‚Äânm), the energy profile converges and flattens out for tilt angles over ‚âà0.5¬∞ after an initial increase. This observation suggests that the energy penalties for varying the tilt angle of LAGBs in ice films may be minuscule.

To further understand the structural details of these boundaries, we examined the post-annealing MD trajectories (h‚Äâ=‚Äâ6; Fig. 3b). With a low tilt angle (case 1, 0.34¬∞), a defective region with disordered molecules and complex dislocations forms because the low tilt angle is insufficient to support a low-energy dislocation. This result corresponds to the initial energy rise as the tilt angle increases (Fig. 3a, lower panel). When the tilt angle is sufficiently large (case 3, 1.70¬∞), a perfect edge dislocation (Burgers vector, b‚Äâ=‚Äâ\(\frac{1}{3}\left\langle 1\bar{2}10\right\rangle\)) forms to compensate for the lattice mismatch (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, a moderate tilt angle (case 2, 0.96¬∞) leads to a mixed edge and screw dislocation, with the Burgers vector roughly pointing to the a3 axis. If we look along the a2 axis, i.e., roughly along the dislocation line (Fig. 3c), the crystal in case 2 only has a sufficient tilt angle to accommodate a visual half-plane mismatch, in contrast to the one-unit-cell mismatch in case 3. To avoid the unstable partial edge dislocation, a partial screw dislocation was also generated, leading to a perfect unit cell mismatch (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 34). This behavior is repeatedly seen in crystals with a larger thickness and when more than one dislocation line is present (Supplementary Fig. 35).

Based on the analyses above, we summarize how ice films develop LAGBs while minimizing the energy penalty (Fig. 3e). In conventional inorganic materials, such as bulk metals (upper schematic), the LAGB energy increases monotonously against the tilt angle with increasing dislocation density45. In comparison, ice crystals are mediated by the weak hydrogen bonds and organized by the flexible tetrahedral structural motifs of water molecules.46 This feature enables a high tolerance to local lattice distortions, including disordered structures and dislocations, along with interfacial configurations characteristic of clathrates (e.g., interfacial beads identified in Fig. 3). A large tilt angle gap exists in few-layer freestanding ice structures due to the unstable configuration (middle schematic). In ice films thicker than ‚âà10‚Äânm relevant to our TEM experiments (lower schematic), the energy of the LAGB first increases due to elastic strain and the formation of disordered structures but then quickly flattens out over a wide range of tilt angles, owing to the formation of perfect dislocations regardless of the tilt angle. The presence of unstable configurations and shallow local energy minima could further explain the mild preference for certain tilt angles observed in the experiment (Fig. 2e, lower panel). As such, LAGBs with various tilt angles can co-exist in ice films with low energy penalties.

This conclusion is consistent with our TEM results. The annealed configuration from the MD (case 3) was used for multislice TEM simulation (Fig. 3f, g). The simulated TEM image correctly reproduced the isotropic hexagonal lattices on the right that are perfectly aligned with the [0001] zone axis. Meanwhile, the pattern on the left is elongated in the horizontal direction due to tilting, consistent with the lattice anisotropy observed from experimental images in tilted subdomains (Fig. 2d). The increase in anisotropy is also evidenced by the horizontal intensity profile for a row of lattice spots in Fig. 3g. Importantly, even though a single dislocation line is present in the middle, the pattern anisotropy exhibits a gradual transition across 1 to 2‚Äânm, consistent with the interfacial transition observed in the experiments.

Away from the defective edges described above, we investigated the interior regions of single-crystalline ice. Continuous hexagonal lattices were observed over large areas (Fig. 4a‚Äìc), and the lattice amplitude map reveals an absence of subdomains (Fig. 4d).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

In this region, we discovered many trapped gas bubbles in the form of nanoscale cavities in the crystal (Fig. 4a, circular and elliptical features labeled by arrows). Thickness gradients due to bubble curvature are evidenced by the significant contrast variations near the bubble surfaces. The formation of nanosized trapped bubbles is attributed to the relatively fast cooling rate of the thin sample compared to bulk freezing47. Note that these bubbles exist prior to imaging and remain unchanged throughout the imaging process. Therefore, it is most likely that they are generated by gas precipitation instead of radiolysis.

By calculating the in-plane lattice distortion tensors using geometric phase analysis (GPA)48, we found that almost no additional strain field exists in the crystals surrounding the nanobubbles (Fig. 4e‚Äìg and Supplementary Fig. 16). The distribution of all in-plane lattice distortion indicators (strains, rotation, and dilation) is significantly narrower than that of the subdomain-containing defective edge (Fig. 4h).

Previous MD simulations for metals, such as Al, predicted strain fields surrounding a nanocavity (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ10‚Äânm) on the scale of 1‚Äì3%49. To understand the absence of such a strain field in ice, we first used continuum theories of elasticity to estimate the strain distribution around a spherical cavity50. The maximum elastic strains caused by the Laplace pressure of an ice nanobubble (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ10‚Äânm) is <0.4% (Supplementary Fig. 35). As such, nanobubbles in ice should be expected to cause negligible strain fields, which agrees with the HRTEM-derived strain maps.

Our MD simulations also confirm this conclusion. We modeled a spherical cavity (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ6‚Äânm) in an ice single crystal, melted the structures within 3‚Äânm in the vicinity of the cavity surface, and recrystallized them in silico (see Methods and Supplementary Data 2). Volumetric strain analysis shows no discernable strain accumulation around the cavity, with a mean and standard deviation of only 0.30% and 1.00% (Fig. 4j).

To further investigate the inner surface structure of the bubbles on the molecular scale, we moved to single-crystalline ice regions with a much lower thickness, where bubbles became quasi-cylindrical through-holes (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Movie 3). The reduced thickness allowed direct imaging and recognition of the lattice structures near the bubble surface. Notably, despite the overall curved shape, most exposed surfaces on the molecular scale can be attributed either to the primary prism planes, \(\{\bar{1}100\}\), or secondary prism planes, \(\{\bar{2}110\}\), assuming vertical facets. These two surfaces are the lowest-energy facets in ice Ih perpendicular to [0001]51,52. The ratio between the projected length of the primary and secondary prism planes is circa 3.8:1 (Table 1).

The bubble model in MD simulations was also used to reveal the surface faceting at the molecular level (see Supplementary Note 2.2). A significant fraction of the surface molecules are exposed as basal, primary prism, or secondary prism planes (Fig. 4k and Table 1). The fractional ratio between the primary and secondary prism planes in the MD-simulated cross-section at the center (Supplementary Fig. 38) and HRTEM follow the same trend predicted by their surface energy (Table 1). This result indicates that the trapped gas bubbles in the experiments are very close to thermodynamic equilibrium, and the nanoscale configurations we observed could reflect those in sufficiently annealed bubbles. We note that a lower amount of basal planes were observed in MD than prism planes despite their lower surface energy because the former must fit into the top and bottom curvatures. As such, trapped bubbles in ice are defined both by the macroscopic rounded shape and molecular-scale facets to minimize the total surface energy. The presence of these nanofacets may be important in defining the stability and migration kinetics of trapped gas bubbles in glacial systems16,53.

When we elevated the stage temperature to ‚àí70‚Äâ¬∞C and reduced the electron flux density to 25‚Äâe‚Äâ√Ö‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1, we observed nucleation and growth of new nanobubbles in single-crystalline ice sections under HRTEM conditions (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movie 4). The newly generated bubbles show similar shapes with trapped nanobubbles imaged at about ‚àí180‚Äâ¬∞C. Furthermore, these bubbles can migrate in the crystal and completely dissolve under the same conditions (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Movie 5) while the ice sample stays single-crystalline, suggesting that the system is near a steady state for bubble generation and ice recrystallization.

Bubbles can also dynamically coalesce and merge into larger ones (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Movie 6). In this observation, two bubbles approached each other, and their outlines initially showed different thickness contrasts. However, the contrast matched upon coalescence, which suggests that the two bubbles physically connected rather than passed by at different vertical positions. The ice surfaces in the bubbles are highly dynamic, as shown by the significant reshaping of the merging ones.

The persistent hexagonal patterns in the Fourier transform of the movies suggest that the ice sample stayed single-crystalline in these observations. GPA was performed on all frames to evaluate the mechanical consequences of the bubble trajectories. Here, the mean value of in-plane lattice dilation reflects the global distortion of the sample and only fluctuated within a range of ~1% throughout the experiments (Fig. 5d). The standard deviation of the lattice dilation was further calculated to evaluate local lattice distortion (Fig. 5e). Indeed, most data fall between the levels observed in the defective edges (Fig. 2) and the bubble-containing interior sections (Fig. 4) at about ‚àí180‚Äâ¬∞C. These observations further show that nanobubbles cause insignificant strain fields in ice crystals even during their dynamic evolution.

Bubble formation in ice under the electron beam can mainly be attributed to radiolysis54 and knock-on damage by the incident electrons55. To evaluate the radiolytic chemistry under the experimental conditions, we extended approaches developed for water radiolysis in liquid-phase electron microscopy56,57 to lower temperatures and numerically calculated the reaction kinetics at ‚àí70‚Äâ¬∞C and 25‚Äâe‚Äâ√Ö‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1 (see Methods and Supplementary Data 3). Notably, the system reaches a steady state within seconds of gas generation (Fig. 5f), consistent with in-situ TEM results. It is crucial to recognize that radiolysis offers one credible explanation for the formation of new bubbles in these experiments, but detecting the content of the gas species is challenging in these experiments. Nonetheless, the formation of substantial H2 and O2 species is in agreement with cryogenic EELS analyses of amorphous ice58,59, highlighting the potential role of these gas molecules in constituting bubble volumes in our experiments.

We have presented the first molecular-resolution imaging of nanoscopic defects in ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. The presented sample preparation method, which crystallized liquid water into thin ice films between a-C membranes, was a critical factor that led to this imaging breakthrough. These samples contain large-area single-crystalline regions that are sufficiently stable under HRTEM conditions for extended imaging. This method could be extended to prepare samples of mixed aqueous systems, as well as organic solvents, and provide new insights into liquid-liquid phase separation, solute precipitation, and the freezing behavior of organic liquids. Despite the presence of a heterogeneous interface between ice/water and the encapsulating membrane, the ice sample thickness is typically well beyond the thickness of interfacial regions (on the order of 1‚Äânm)60 such that there is no significant deviation from the physics of bulk phase transformation. However, the interfacial equilibrium and properties at this length scale are anticipated to differ from those of the bulk. Therefore, caution must be exercised when translating conclusions from HRTEM studies to bulk crystals. By maneuvering the sample temperature and electron flux density, a near-steady state of bubble generation and dissolution in crystalline ice was achieved. A finer control over the imaging conditions will likely pave the way to the direct imaging of ice-water interfacial structures and, moreover, crystallization and melting dynamics with molecular resolution, a holy grail in the ice research community61,62,63. Experimental images and movies can now be directly compared and correlated to computations on an previously unattainable molecular length scale to reveal the underlying structures, molecular interactions, and phase transformation pathways. The direct extraction of such √Ö-scale information provides a new research paradigm for theory, modeling, and forecasting of ice crystallization and melting in environmental, biological, and material systems.

Deionized (DI) water was generated by an ELGA PURELAB flex 2 system with a resistivity of 18.2‚ÄâMŒ© cm. Carbon-coated Cu grids for TEM were purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. Ammonium persulfate (‚â•98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

In a typical experiment, 1‚Äì3‚Äâ¬µL of DI water was dispensed on the carbon side of a TEM grid and loaded on a Gatan 626 single-tilt or a 915 double-tilt liquid nitrogen cryo-transfer holder, with the carbon/water side facing up. Another identical grid was put on top of the first one, with the carbon side facing down. The grid orientation was roughly aligned when placing the second grid, and the surface tension of water would then align and adhere the grids together. Depending on the models of the TEM and their column vacuum level, the sample can either be frozen inside or outside the column with liquid nitrogen. Freezing outside the TEM in the cryo transfer station is typically preferred for consistency. In either case, the copper shield remains closed during sample freezing.

TEM was performed on an FEI Titan Environmental TEM [extreme-brightness Schottky field-emission gun (X-FEG), 300‚ÄâkV] equipped with a CEOS double-hexapole aberration corrector (CETCOR) for the image-forming lenses and a Gatan UltraScan 1000 charge-coupled device (CCD) scintillation camera. A Gatan Metro 300 direct electron detector was used for the sample stability studies. TEM along zone axes other than [0001] was performed on an FEI Themis TEM (X-FEG, 300‚ÄâkV) equipped with a CEOS CETCOR for the image-forming lenses and an FEI Ceta 16‚ÄâM complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scintillation camera. Low-loss EELS was performed on a JEOL JEM-ARM300CF GRAND ARM (cold FEG, 300‚ÄâkV) equipped with a JEOL dodecapole expanding trajectory aberration corrector for the probe-forming lenses and a Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF) Quantum system. Convergence angle: 41.2 mrad; EELS collection angle: 62.4 mrad. EELS thickness measurements were conducted on an FEI Themis equipped with a GIF Quantum system with a convergence angle of 17.9 mrad and a collection angle of 36.18 mrad. Energy-filtered TEM was done on the same system. During the experiments, the temperature readout from the cryo holder is typically between ‚àí180 and ‚àí178‚Äâ¬∞C.

For all Fourier transform images presented in this article, the modulus of the complex values are displayed and are scaled linearly. Average background subtraction (ABS) filtering64 of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images was performed using a script in Gatan DigitalMicrograph (http://www.dmscripting.com/hrtem_filter.html) with the following parameters: Delta‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.0%, BW n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4, BW Ro‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.8, and low-frequency tapering‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.0%. Low-loss EELS profiles were first processed by removing the plural scattering using the Fourier-log algorithm. All EELS profiles were smoothed by adjacent averaging with a 50-pixel moving window size.

The lattice amplitude maps were calculated with the following procedures: (1) obtain the Fourier transform image; (2) mask only the circular areas containing the desired pair of lattice reflections and assign zero to all other pixels (mask diameter‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.2‚Äânm‚àí1); (3) perform inverse Fourier transformation; (4) obtain the absolute value of the image (i.e., flip the sign of negative intensity values); (5) perform Gaussian smoothing with œÉ‚Äâ=‚Äâ5 pixels (this may vary depending on the pixel size); (6) repeat this process for the other two pair of reflections; (7) overlay the three resulting images as a red/green/blue (RGB) stack. The lattice distortion maps (strain, rotation, and dilation) were calculated using the Strain++ package (https://jjppeters.github.io/Strainpp/) based on the geometric phase analysis (GPA) algorithm48. Zero-distortion points in GPA were chosen at the maximum-modulus frequencies in the Fourier transform. The Gaussian mask size (3œÉ) is set to 1/8 of the \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) g vector length.

After obtaining an ice sample in TEM, the holder temperature was raised to ‚àí70‚Äâ¬∞C and stabilized. Movies were recorded by screen capturing at an electron flux density of 25‚Äâe‚Äâ√Ö‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1 determined on the fluorescence screen through the integrated sensor. Frames were registered using the ImageJ StackReg module (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/).

The thickness and surface roughness of the carbon membranes from the TEM grids were measured based on method described in ref. 65. Briefly, the copper grid was etched by an ammonium persulfate aqueous solution (‚âà100‚Äâmg‚ÄâmL‚àí1), leaving the carbon membrane floating on the solution surface. The carbon membrane was then transferred to a glass slide and then to DI water for cleaning, which was repeated two times. Finally, the membrane was transferred to a silicon wafer ready for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. AFM was performed on an Asylum Research Cypher ES with a Bruker RFESPA-75 probe (resonance frequency, 75‚ÄâkHz; spring constant, 3‚ÄâN‚Äâm‚àí1). The scan rate was 1.5‚ÄâHz, and the amplitude was between 300 and 350‚ÄâmV. The thickness was determined at the edge of the membrane ruptures caused by drying. Image processing and quantification were performed with the Gwyddion package66 (http://gwyddion.net/).

The chemical characteristics of the carbon membrane surface were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Kratos Axis Ultra that uses a monochromatic focused Al KŒ± X-ray (1486.7‚ÄâeV) source. The instrument was calibrated prior to the introduction of the sample and referenced to binding energies for Cu 2p3/2 at 932.67‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.05‚ÄâeV and Au 4‚Äâf at 84.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.05‚ÄâeV. The base pressure of the sample analysis chamber was maintained at 1.6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10‚àí9‚ÄâTorr. The sample was prepared by adhering the carbon-coated copper grid to a stainless-steel bar using copper tape. The tape was used only in the corners, while at least two data points were analyzed from the center of the grid. Since the carbon-coated copper grid was conductive, no neutralizer was applied, and the results were analyzed without any charge correction.

Furthermore, the water contact angle was measured by drop-casting ‚âà1-¬µL of DI water onto a TEM grid and immediately capturing a side-view image. The drop shape was fitted to calculate the contact angle67. Experiments were repeated on three separate TEM grids.

Kinematical HRTEM simulation from single crystals was performed using the ReciPro package68 (https://seto77.github.io/ReciPro/). The simulation assumes a parallel beam condition, a beam energy of 300‚ÄâkeV‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.8‚ÄâeV, Cs‚Äâ=‚Äâ4 Œºm, and Cc‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.4‚Äâmm. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were simulated based on the dynamical theory using ReciPro, assuming a sample thickness of 30‚Äânm. Polycrystal SAED radial profiles were simulated based on the kinematical theory using the CrystalDiffract package (CrystalMaker Software, https://crystalmaker.com/crystaldiffract/). These simulations used the experimentally derived ice Ih crystal structure in the space group P63/mmc69,70.

Multislice TEM simulation71 based on explicit models from coarse-grained MD was performed with the QSTEM package72 (https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/en/sem/software/software_qstem) using the same TEM parameters. An F atom was used in place of a water molecule in the coarse-grained MD model for image simulation.

The MD simulations were performed using a coarse-grained machine-learned bond order potential (ML-BOP) model of water23. For grain boundary simulations, minimal-energy configurations of bi-grain ice models with different thicknesses and tilt angles were first established and equilibrated with the conjugate gradient algorithm73. The models were subsequently annealed in silico using the LAMMPS package74 at 260‚ÄâK and then gradually cooled to 93‚ÄâK in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble. For nanobubble simulations, a cavity of a radius of 6‚Äânm was created in a single-crystalline ice Ih model by removing the molecules within. The model was first equilibrated in LAMMPS at 260‚ÄâK and 1‚Äâbar. The surface areas of the bubble (thickness: 3‚Äânm) were subsequently heated to 270‚ÄâK and then 370‚ÄâK for melting, and finally cooled back to 260‚ÄâK for recrystallization. For detailed procedures, see Supplementary Note 2.

The OVITO package75 (https://www.ovito.org/) was used to perform local symmetry identification using the CHILL+ algorithm76 and dislocation analysis using an extended dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA)77.

Radiation chemistry is modeled by considering the interplay of twelve reactants relevant for liquid-phase TEM (H2O, H2, O2, H2O2, H, OH, HO2, H+, HO2‚àí, O2‚àí, OH‚àí, and the solvated electron eh‚àí). An amorphous ice sample with no spatial anisotropy is considered. The reactions among these reactants span a kinetic model that is described by a set of coupled differential equations78:

Here, ci denotes the concentration of the reactant i, t the time, k the reaction-rate constant of the respective reaction, Gi the generation value (G-value) of i upon electron irradiation, and œÅ the density of amorphous ice (0.92‚Äâg‚ÄâL‚àí1)79. The dose rate œà is calculated from Eq. (2)80:

In Eq. (2), œï is the electron flux density, and e is the elementary charge. As the inelastic scattering of 300‚ÄâkeV electrons in amorphous ice appears to be reasonably close to that in water81,82, a density-normalized stopping power S of 2.36‚ÄâMeV‚Äâcm‚àí2‚Äâg‚àí1 was approximated83. For an electron-flux density of 25‚Äâe‚Äâ√Ö‚àí2‚Äâs‚àí1, this yields a dose rate of 9.45‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ107‚ÄâGy‚Äâs‚àí1.

The harnessed kinetic model extrapolates Arrhenius-based rate constants84 to lower temperatures (Supplementary Table 8). As cryogenic G values are unavailable59, room temperature values are used (Supplementary Table 9)85. Modeling is performed using a temperature-dependent extension of AuRaCh57.

Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency created on a lark more than a decade ago, is now available to investors through the US public market.

On September 18, investment fund management firms REX Financial and Osprey Funds jointly launched a dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The launch marks the first time that US investors are able to bet on memecoins‚Äîwhich serve no purpose and promise no utility‚Äîthrough a traditional brokerage, without handling crypto directly.

ETFs are designed to track the price of an underlying asset‚Äîwhether metals, gold, or crypto. Loosely, for every dollar invested in an ETF, the operator stockpiles a dollar's worth of the asset, earning a fee as a percentage of the fund's total value.

‚ÄúIf you ignore stablecoins, dogecoin is the sixth largest [cryptocurrency] by market cap in the world,‚Äù Greg King, CEO and founder of REX and Osprey tells WIRED. ‚ÄúIt's really just following the demand that's already out there in the native crypto space and providing access via a regulated vehicle.‚Äù

The extent of that demand is evident: With a first-day trading volume of almost $18 million, the dogecoin fund performed better on debut than many other ETFs launched in the US this year, according to James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg. ‚ÄúPeople obviously want to trade it,‚Äù says Seyffart.

But it's less clear whether the arrival of memecoin ETFs is a net positive for the investing public. The purpose of capital markets is to create a more efficient means of funding endeavors likely to return value to society, some analysts contend, and memecoins promise nothing of the sort.

‚ÄúI still don't really understand why a memecoin should be in an ETF wrapper to begin with,‚Äù says Bryan Armour, director of ETF and passive strategies research for North America at investment research firm Morningstar. ‚ÄúSomething started as a joke with a Shiba Inu as its character‚Äîwhy should that be a part of capital markets?‚Äù

Before regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first US-listed bitcoin ETFs in January 2024‚Äîonly after the courts had forced the agency's hand‚Äîmembers of the crypto industry had fought for more than a decade for permission to package coins into funds.

However, since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the US government has taken a far more permissive stance toward crypto, instructing prosecutors to deprioritize certain crypto-related offences, passing crypto-specific legislation, and appointing a crypto czar to oversee policy strategy. The SEC, for its part, has retreated from numerous lawsuits against high-profile crypto firms.

The dogecoin ETF launch last week coincided with the release of a new ruleset by the SEC that will allow issuers to bring crypto-based ETFs to market without seeking specific permission on a case-by-case basis.

‚ÄúBy approving these generic listing standards, we are ensuring that our capital markets remain the best place in the world to engage in the cutting-edge innovation of digital assets,‚Äù said SEC chair Paul Atkins. ‚ÄúThis approval helps to maximize investor choice and foster innovation by streamlining the listing process and reducing barriers to access digital asset products within America's trusted capital markets.‚Äù

Though REX and Osprey did not launch the dogecoin ETF under the new ruleset, instead taking an alternative route involving separate legal provisions to ensure it won the race to market, analysts expect the SEC's new listing standards to tee up a proliferation of crypto ETFs in the US. Under the ruleset, any crypto coin already listed on a market‚Äîlike Coinbase Derivatives‚Äîthat participates in the Intermarket Surveillance Group, a network of organizations that monitors for fraudulent activity, would automatically qualify for the ETF treatment.

‚ÄúIt's a spaghetti cannon. They're going to cook up all these ETFs‚Äîwhether levered versions, inverse, or pure spot exposure‚Äîand they're going to frickin shoot this cannon at the wall and see what sticks,‚Äù says Seyffart. ‚ÄúThat's what these ETF issuers do.‚Äù

Before the approval of bitcoin ETFs in 2024, proponents argued that they would create a valuable avenue for both laypeople and financial institutions to invest through a regulated vehicle in an asset marketed as a digital equivalent to gold, a hedge against inflation, and so on.

Whatever the merits of the bitcoin investment case, the argument for memecoins is shakier. Typically modelled after a celebrity or popular internet reference, memecoins generate no revenue or cash flow, so their price depends entirely on caprices of the public mood and the vibes among investors. In the case of dogecoin, the supply of coins is even periodically diluted. ‚ÄúWith a memecoin, it would be hard for a financial adviser to feel comfortable buying that for a client,‚Äù says Armour.

One's stance on the prospect of memecoin ETFs coming to market in droves might depend on personal politics.

‚ÄúI'm very much libertarian in the way the SEC should be operating ‚Ä¶ The SEC's job is not to be a merit regulator. Its job is to be a disclosure regulator,‚Äù says Seyffart. ‚ÄúI personally don't own or trade any memecoins and probably won't own any memecoin ETFs. But it's a free market. People can do what they want.‚Äù

Others, including Armour, believe it's the joint responsibility of regulators, issuers, and investors to ensure that public markets aren't polluted with assets likely to inflict large and sudden losses.

‚ÄúDoes the SEC approving putting it into an ETF make people who don't know what these things are think they are more legitimate?‚Äù asks Armour. ‚ÄúIt pulls more attention and assets toward speculation, which typically is not a good long-term strategy for investors,‚Äù he claims.

The SEC declined to comment.

In King's opinion, moralizing over which assets should and should not be stuffed into an ETF is besides the point; the government has defined what is permitted. REX and Osprey ‚Äúprimarily view it as providing access to investments that already exist,‚Äù says King. ‚Äú[If there's] investor demand, it's something we'll consider launching.‚Äù

In January, REX and Osprey filed for permission to launch ETFs for a variety of other crypto coins, among them a memecoin promoted by Trump. The TRUMP memecoin has been roundly condemned by critics as an unethical money-grab that opens up a potential vector for bribery.

‚ÄúWe just play by the rules,‚Äù says King. ‚ÄúThe lines have been drawn ‚Ä¶ by the administration.‚Äù

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Taylor Soper on Sep 25, 2025 at 11:31 amSeptember 25, 2025 at 11:38 am

Siddhartha ‚ÄúSidd‚Äù Srinivasa has spent his career at the intersection of robotics research and real-world deployment. He helped start Berkshire Grey, launched Amazon's Robotics AI group, helped re-architect Cruise's autonomy stack, and leads the Personal Robotics Lab at the University of Washington as a professor.

Now he's adding a new role: venture partner at Madrona Venture Group, where he'll help shape investment themes and evaluate startups in robotics and embodied AI at the Seattle-based firm.

GeekWire caught up with Srinivasa for a conversation about the state of robotics, opportunities for entrepreneurs, and why he believes Seattle can become a global leader in AI and robotics. The interview was edited for brevity and clarity. 

GeekWire: Why did you decide to join Madrona?

Sidd Srinivasa: ‚ÄúI want to give back to the Pacific Northwest and make the Pacific Northwest an even bigger superpower in AI and robotics. I've been incredibly fortunate to work with some really wonderful VCs during my time at Berkshire Grey, and it felt like time for me to both give back as well as learn what it takes to be a venture capitalist ‚Äî to think about how to evaluate companies, to develop a sound thesis on where AI and robotics should go next.‚Äù

Where is robotics right now in terms of progress?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúHardware has become commoditized. A humanoid robot used to cost a couple of million dollars, only accessible to top labs. Now you can get one for $15,000 to $20,000. A large part of that is because electric motors have gotten better and cheaper, and our ability to produce them and to be able to scale them has gotten much better.

It's also the compute. I have more compute on my phone now than I did on the biggest computer I could find during my Ph.D. That's pretty significant.

Building large foundation models is also commoditized. And what these foundation models help us do is deal with all the common sense stuff that goes into getting any task done.‚Äù

What about the current challenges?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúThe place where we have a huge problem with robotics right now is that though we are able to address a lot of the common sense tasks like folding your laundry or clearing your table ‚Äî those are not the important tasks people would pay money for. This is a fundamental issue that a lot of robotics companies are facing right now. Yes, we have pretty amazing demos, we have cool videos of humanoids picking up an apple and putting it down. But who wants to pay for that? Not me. 

Robotics has a last-mile problem. We can go from zero to one, one to 10, 10 to 50 ‚Äî but very few times have we actually been able to go the last mile. We certainly did that at Berkshire Grey. We certainly did that at Amazon and with fulfillment. But beyond fulfillment, I haven't seen any great success in robotics.‚Äù

What's missing technologically?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúWe need breakthroughs in generalization. The other day, when I was staining my fence, by the time I got 20% done, I was an expert stainer of fences. That adaptiveness is what we need robots to do efficiently.  Reinforcement learning is a way to do that but it is very data inefficient. So being able to truly generalize novel scenarios and being able to learn on the fly while being efficient and safe ‚Äî safety is really important. 

I thought we would solve self-driving before we solve general purpose robotics. And we haven't solved self-driving yet. We're close, but not there yet. And I would say general purpose robotics is certainly five years behind self-driving in terms of capability and technology.‚Äù

What about humanoids?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúI am not sure whether the humanoid form factor is the right form factor to align around. Humans have two arms and two legs just 'cause ‚Äî there's nothing theoretically optimal about us. Maybe what you need is a robot with three arms, or a robot with seven fingers. I do believe that one day we will have capable robots performing useful tasks in our home. Whether that'll be a humanoid or a quadruped or a three-hand, three-arm robot ‚Äî I don't know.‚Äù

Which sectors look closest to achieving viable unit economics?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúThere's still a lot of juice left to squeeze in fulfillment. There's over 50-to-60% of fulfillment that is yet to be automated ‚Äî things like packing an Amazon box full of items. We need to be able to deal with that kind of high density. And I think last mile fulfillment is a space that is really ready to be disrupted. 

I've been really interested in computational agriculture from an observability point of view ‚Äî knowing what's going on in a greenhouse without having to walk the line. And commissary kitchens that make lunches that are delivered or airline meals. If we are able to build robots that can be very easily repurposed and retrained to perform multiple tasks and have a small form factor, then I think that's a space that can be really disrupted.‚Äù

What advice do you have for robotics founders?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúThere has to be a pull for robotics, not a push. If you're pedaling robotics to people who reluctantly accept it, it's never going to work. The pull has to come from a real customer need.

The second thing I would say is that there is this tendency to believe that robots can follow the software model. Maintaining, servicing and taking care of software is really easy. But that's not the case with real, physical robots. I would think very carefully about not just the actual application, but also the modality by which you are putting your robots out there.‚Äù

How do you think about robotics and job displacement?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúEver since I started working on robots, I've been very rightfully asked: will robots take our jobs? The lazy argument is to say the Industrial Revolution created more jobs than it took away, so robotics will, too. But it's not the people who lost their jobs who got the new jobs. Pittsburgh is a great example ‚Äî steel workers didn't become tech workers. So we have an entire generation of people who lost their jobs, who we did not re-skill to be able to take on the new roles that were coming up. We need to be committed to workforce re-skilling such that we can enable and empower the workforce to be able to work with and around new technology that comes about. It's not just a nice thing to do. It's a societal imperative.‚Äù

Any thoughts on Seattle as a robotics hub?

Srinivasa: ‚ÄúI think one of the things that's incredibly appealing about Seattle, and particularly about the University of Washington, which I think has been a pioneer in this, is just how closely faculty are able to work with industry while still maintaining and honoring their faculty position. 

I love Seattle. I think it's also incredibly valuable for dual careers. And I think it's a great place to start a company, not just because of Madrona, but also because of so many other VCs, as well as the huge amount of talent that's out here. So I think it's time to make Seattle the best in the world in AI and robotics.‚Äù

OpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep. Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning ‚Äî much like they would check social media or a news app.

Pulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI's consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. Features like ChatGPT Agent or Codex aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.

‚ÄúWe're building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,‚Äù said OpenAI's new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. ‚ÄúAnd ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction ‚Äî starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.‚Äù

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this week that some of ChatGPT's new ‚Äúcompute-intensive‚Äù products would be limited to the company's most expensive subscription plan ‚Äî which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it's severely limited in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it's rapidly building out AI data centers with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.

Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.

Pulse's reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic ‚Äî like updates on a specific sports team ‚Äî as well as more personalized briefs based on a user's context.

In a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family's upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.

Each report is displayed as a ‚Äúcard‚Äù featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.

A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: ‚ÄúGreat, that's it for today.‚Äù According to Fry, that's an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. 

Pulse is compatible with ChatGPT's Connectors, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that's set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.

If users have ChatGPT's memory features turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI's personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.

Wadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a ‚Äúnet-new functionality‚Äù for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.

But it's hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn't expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.

It remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can ‚Äúvary tremendously‚Äù in how much computing power it spends on a given task ‚Äî for some projects, it's fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.

Eventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user's behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI's agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.

For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in r√©sum√©s and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job.

David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built Juicebox, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates.

After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity.

In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).

On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia.

Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do.

Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn's interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia's internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup's growth potential.  

When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed.

‚ÄúI'm not sure I've ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,‚Äù Cahn told TechCrunch.

Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team.

Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities.

What sets Juicebox's search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would.

‚ÄúWe help find net new candidates that wouldn't be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we'd expect them to have in the regular searches,‚Äù Paffenholz told TechCrunch.

The startup's product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires.

Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls.

While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like Eightfold are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings.

Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup's technology stack.

‚ÄúWe've invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it's] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.‚Äù

OpenAI released a new benchmark on Thursday that tests how its AI models perform compared to human professionals across a wide range of industries and jobs. The test, GDPval, is an early attempt at understanding how close OpenAI's systems are to outperforming humans at economically valuable work ‚Äî a key part of the company's founding mission to develop artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

OpenAI says its found that its GPT-5 model and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 ‚Äúare already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts.‚Äù 

That's not to say that OpenAI's models are going to start replacing humans in their jobs immediately. Despite predictions by some CEOs that AI will take the jobs of humans in just a few years, OpenAI admits that GDPval today covers a very limited number of tasks people do in their real jobs. However, it is one of the latest ways the company is measuring AI's progress toward this milestone.

GDPval is based on nine industries that contribute the most to America's gross domestic product, including domains such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and government. The benchmark tests an AI model's performance in 44 occupations among those industries, ranging from software engineers to nurses to journalists.

For OpenAI's first version of the test, GDPval-v0, OpenAI asked experienced professionals to compare AI-generated reports with those produced by other professionals, and then choose the best one. For example, one prompt asked investment bankers to create a competitor landscape for the last-mile delivery industry and compare them to AI-generated reports. OpenAI then averages an AI model's ‚Äúwin rate‚Äù against the human reports across all 44 occupations.

For GPT-5-high, a souped-up version of GPT-5 with extra computational power, the company says the AI model was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts 40.6% of the time.

OpenAI also tested Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 model, which was ranked as better than or on par with industry experts in 49% of tasks. OpenAI says that it believes Claude scored so high because of its tendency to make pleasing graphics, rather than sheer performance.

It's worth noting that most working professionals do a lot more than submit research reports to their boss, which is all that GDPval-v0 tests for. OpenAI acknowledges this and says it plans to create more robust tests in the future that can account for more industries and interactive workflows.

Nonetheless, the company sees the progress on GDPval as notable.

In an interview with TechCrunch, OpenAI's chief economist Dr. Aaron Chatterji said GDPval's results suggest that people in these jobs can now use AI models to spend time on more meaningful tasks.

‚Äú[Because] the model is getting good at some of these things,‚Äù Chatterji says, ‚Äúpeople in those jobs can now use the model, increasingly as capabilities get better, to offload some of their work and do potentially higher value things.‚Äù

OpenAI's evaluations lead Tejal Patwardhan tells TechCrunch that she's encouraged by the rate of progress on GDPval. OpenAI's GPT-4o model scored just 13.7% (wins and ties versus humans), which was released roughly 15 months ago. Now GPT-5 scores nearly triple that, a trend Patwardhan expects to continue.

Silicon Valley has a wide range of benchmarks it uses to measure the progress of AI models and assess whether a given model is state-of-the-art. Among the most popular are AIME 2025 (a test of competitive math problems) and GPQA Diamond (a test of PhD-level science questions). However, several AI models are nearing saturation on some of these benchmarks, and many AI researchers have cited the need for better tests that can measure AI's proficiency on real-world tasks.

Benchmarks like GDPval could become increasingly important in that conversation, as OpenAI makes the case that its AI models are valuable for a wide range of industries. But OpenAI may need a more comprehensive version of the test to definitively say its AI models can outperform humans.

I've been running into it consistently, responses that just stop mid-sentence, not because of token limits or content filters, but what appears to be a bug in how the model signals completion. It's been documented on their GitHub and dev forums for months as a P2 issue.The frustrating part is that when you compare a complete Gemini response to Claude or GPT-4, the quality is often quite good. But reliability matters more than peak performance. I'd rather work with a model that consistently delivers complete (if slightly less brilliant) responses than one that gives me half-thoughts I have to constantly prompt to continue.It's a shame because Google clearly has the underlying tech.

1. Using the ""Projects"" thing (Folder organization) makes my browser tab (on Firefox) become unusably slow after a while. I'm basically forced to use the default chats organization, even though I would like to organize my chats in folders.2. After editing a message that you already sent,you get to select between the different branches of the chat (1/2, and so on), which is cool, but when ChatGPT fails to generate a response in this ""branched conversation"" context, it will continue failing forever. When your conversation is a single thread and a ChatGPT message fails with an error, re trying usually works and the chat continues normally.

It's a delicate balance, because these Gemini models sometimes feel downright lobotomized compared to claude or gpt-5.

My understanding is Gemini is not far behind on ""intelligence"", certainly not in a way that leaves obvious doubt over where they will be over the next iteration/model cycles, where I would expect them to at least continue closing the gap. I'd be curious if you have some benchmarks to share that suggest otherwise.Meanwhile, afaik something Google has done, and perhaps relates back to your point re ""latency/TPS/cost dimensions"" that other providers aren't doing as much is integrating their model into interesting products beyond chat, at a pace that seems surprising given how much criticism they had been taking for being ""slow"" to react to the LLM trend.Besides the Google Workspace surface and Google search, which now seem obvious - there are other interesting places where Gemini will surface - https://jules.google/ for one, to say nothing of their experiments/betas in the creative space - https://labs.google/flow/aboutAnother I noticed today: https://www.google.com/finance/betaI would have thought putting Gemini on a finance dashboard like this would be inviting all sorts of regulatory (and other) scrutiny... and wouldn't be in keeping with a ""slow"" incumbent. But given the current climate, it seems Google is plowing ahead just as much as anyone else - with a lot more resources and surface to bring to bear. Imagine Gemini integration on Youtube. At this point it just seems like counting down the days...

It's bad at agentic stuff, especially coding. Incomparably so compared to Claude and now GPT-5. But if it's just about asking it random stuff, and especially going on for very long in the same conversation - which non-tech users have a tendency to do - Gemini wins. It's still the best at long context, noticing things said long ago.Earlier this week I was doing some debugging. For debugging especially I like to run sonnet/gpt5/2.5-pro in parallel with the same prompt/convo. Gemini was the only one that, 4 or so messages in, pointed out something very relevant in the middle of the logs in the very first message. GPT and Sonnet both failed to notice, leading them to give wrong sample code. I would've wasted more time if I hadn't used Gemini.It's also still the best at a good number of low-resource languages. It doesn't glaze too much (Sonnet, ChatGPT) without being overly stubborn (raw GPT-5 API). It's by far the best at OCR and image recognition, which a lot of average users use quite a bit.Google's ridiculously bad at marketing and AI UX, but they'll get there. They're already much more than just a ""bang for the buck"" player.FWIW I use all 3 above mentioned on a daily basis for a wide variety of tasks, often side-by-side in parallel to compare performance.

This involves having it identify all potential keywords and distinct entities, determine their approximate gender (important for languages with ambiguous gender pronouns), and then perform a line-by-line analysis of each chapter. For each line, it identifies the speaking entity, determines whose POV the line represents, and identifies the subject entity. While I didn't need or expect perfection, Gemini Flash 2.5 was the only model I tested that could not only follow all these instructions, but follow them well. The cheap price was a bonus.I was thoroughly impressed, it's now my go-to for any JSON-formatted analysis reports.

Y'know with all these latest models, the lines are kinda blurry actually.

Here's What Happened","https://gizmodo.com/researchers-tested-bite-resistant-wetsuit-material-with-great-whites-and-tiger-sharks-heres-what-happened-2000663459","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 13:45:07 GMT","

Australian shark experts have revealed that some special wetsuit materials aiming to keep sharks from ripping your arm off or gouging out your guts might actually be helpful.

As detailed in a study published today in the journal Wildlife Research, the team investigated the extent to which four bite-resistant wetsuit materials‚ÄîAqua Armour, Shark Stop, ActionTX-S, and Brewster‚Äîcould lessen injuries and blood loss from great white and tiger shark bites.

‚ÄúOur study showed that bite-resistant materials incorporated into wetsuits can reduce damage from large white and tiger sharks (up to 3 metres) compared to standard neoprene wetsuit, even from moderate and severe bites,‚Äù Tom Clarke, a researcher from Flinders University's College of Science and Engineering, said in a university statement. Three meters is around 9 feet. (Who's going to break it to them that some great white sharks can grow up to 20 feet (6 meters) long?)

The team tested each material with real sharks and classified the bite damage in one of four categories of severity, from superficial to critical. They compared the damage to that allowed by standard neoprene material. This approach revealed that ‚Äúwhile there were small differences between the four tested materials, they all reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe haemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,‚Äù Clarke continued.

While sharks rarely bite humans (you're more likely to die from constipation, champagne corks, and lawn mowers) our interactions with them are increasing around the world as coastal communities expand and marine activities become more sought-after. The most unprovoked shark bites come from great whites and tiger sharks, which are also among the top three species that deliver the highest rate of deadly bites.

(As another side note, it would be interesting to know how researchers track provoked shark bites. Do they ask shark attack survivors, ‚ÄúHow much, on a scale of one to ten, were you asking for it?‚Äù)

‚ÄúWhile these suits don't eliminate all the risk (e.g. internal injuries may still occur), our results indicate that they can reduce blood loss and trauma from major lacerations and punctures, potentially saving lives,‚Äù said Charlie Huveneers, leader of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders University. Crushing injuries could also take place. ‚ÄúOur findings will allow for informed decisions to be made about the use of bite-resistant wetsuit materials for occupational activities, as well as enabling the public to make appropriate decisions about the suitability of using these products.‚Äù

So if a shark chomps down on your shin, it sounds like you could still break a leg‚Äîbut maybe the beast won't rip away your entire calf. As such, the researchers argue that bite-resistant wetsuits are a viable approach to lessen the severity of shark bite injuries.

Conventional chainmail suits work well, but they are too heavy and stiff for people to use while surfing or diving. On the other hand, new wetsuits made from strong and light fiber (frequently seen in sailing rope) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (a tough polymer) are flexible as well as effective, according to the statement.

I assume there's little chance of putting the materials through human trials. I certainly don't volunteer as tribute.

When Spaceballs 2 was first confirmed, there were rumors abound that the long-retired legend Rick Moranis may make a comeback to reprise his role as Dark Helmet. Now, we know that it's true‚Äîall of it, to quote a certain other sci-fi franchise‚Äîas Spaceballs 2 begins production.

Today Amazon MGM confirmed that Moranis will join Bill Pullman, Mel Brooks, Daphne Zuniga, and George Wyner as returning stars for Spaceballs 2, alongside series newcomers Lewis Pullman, Anthony Carrigan, Josh Gad, and Keke Palmer. While doing so, the studio announced that production had begun in perhaps the most perfect way possible: a perfectly staged black-and-white photo of cast and crew talking among themselves at a table read for the sequel's script.

This is, of course, a friendly shot across the bow back at The Force Awakens, which similarly confirmed its own cast with a black-and-white casual table read picture all the way back in 2014. We already got the hint that Spaceballs 2 was going to be leaning all the way in on Star Wars‚Äò own long-in-the-making sequel trilogy from the first teaser, climaxing with a shot of Dark Helmet's mask cracked and damaged akin to the melted Darth Vader mask that became so prominent in The Force Awakens‚Äò teasers. But this, with the carefully curated props littered about the place, the fancy couches and chairs in an otherwise pretty industrial environment (right down to the impromptu center table being a tilted-over crate)? It's a perfect bit of pastiche.

Spaceballs 2, directed by Josh Greenbaum and produced by the iconic Mel Brooks, is expected to awaken the schwartz some time in 2027.

Noah Hawley is ‚Äúpretty confident‚Äù Alien: Earth will return for a second season. Yet another mid-budget Stephen King project marches forward. Plus, what's coming on The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Spoilers, assemble!



Deadline reports a film adaptation of Stephen King's ‚Äúnovella,‚Äù Rat, is now in development with Isaac Ezban attached to direct. The story concerns Drew Larson, a writer ‚Äúcursed by his own ambition.‚Äù Each attempt at a novel has ended in disaster‚Äîillness, misfortune, or worse. Determined to break the cycle, he retreats to a desolate cabin in the Maine woods, convinced this time will be different. But as a violent storm traps him in isolation, Drew's body falters and his mind begins to unravel. In the grip of fever and madness, a stranger appears‚Äîan uncanny visitor who promises salvation and success‚Ä¶for a price Drew can barely comprehend.‚Äù

Deadline also reports the next Spider-Verse movie is now scheduled for a June 18, 2027, theatrical release date, a week earlier than its previous release date

Bloody-Disgusting has our first look at Sam Rockwell as ‚Äúa man claiming to be from the future who takes the patrons of an iconic Los Angeles diner hostage in search of unlikely recruits in a quest to save the world‚Äù in Gore Verbinski's Good Like, Have Fun, Don't Die. 

 

During a recent interview with Polygon, Noah Hawley stated he's ‚Äúpretty confident‚Äù there will be more Alien: Earth following its cliffhanger finale.

I'm pretty confident, given the show's success, that we'll get to make more. The risk is the reward.

Deadline reports Jimmi Simpson has joined the cast of The Walking Dead: Dead City as an incoming ‚Äúseries regular‚Äù named Dillard. No further details on his character are available at this time.

Deadline also reports Meredith Averill has replaced Moira Walley-Beckett as showrunner on Fourth Wing, a TV series at Amazon based on Rebecca Yarros' fantasy novels. The series concerns twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she ‚Äúleaves the life of a scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. At the order of her mother, who is a general in the military of Navarre, Violet enters the brutal ranks of Basgiath War College, which trains up-and-coming riders through the Graduate or Die method.‚Äù

Spoiler TV has images from ‚ÄúMarilyn,‚Äù tomorrow's new episode of Invasion. More at the link.

Two years ago, when the alien invasion began, Verna and Joel sparked the rise of Infinitas.

Spoiler TV also has images from ‚ÄúLa Justicia Fronteriza,‚Äù this week's episode of Daryl Dixon. Click through to see the rest.

Daryl and Carol disagree on how to move forward; a surprise attack changes everything.

Finally, 9-1-1 sends Supernova and Critters 4 star Angela Bassett to outer space, ‚Äúwhere no first responders have gone before,‚Äù in a teaser for the long-running series' genre-bending ninth season.

Taking a page from the private insurance industry's playbook, the Trump administration will launch a program next year to find out how much money an artificial intelligence algorithm could save the federal government by denying care to Medicare patients.

The pilot program, designed to weed out wasteful, ""low-value"" services, amounts to a federal expansion of an unpopular process called prior authorization, which requires patients or someone on their medical team to seek insurance approval before proceeding with certain procedures, tests, and prescriptions. It will affect Medicare patients, and the doctors and hospitals who care for them, in Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington, starting Jan. 1 and running through 2031.

The move has raised eyebrows among politicians and policy experts. The traditional version of Medicare, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities, has mostly eschewed prior authorization. Still, it is widely used by private insurers, especially in the Medicare Advantage market.

And the timing was surprising: The pilot was announced in late June, just days after the Trump administration unveiled a voluntary effort by private health insurers to revamp and reduce their own use of prior authorization, which causes care to be ""significantly delayed,"" said Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

""It erodes public trust in the health care system,"" Oz told the media. ""It's something that we can't tolerate in this administration.""

But some critics, like Vinay Rathi, an Ohio State University doctor and policy researcher, have accused the Trump administration of sending mixed messages.

On one hand, the federal government wants to borrow cost-cutting measures used by private insurance, he said. ""On the other, it slaps them on the wrist.""

Administration officials are ""talking out of both sides of their mouth,"" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat. ""It's hugely concerning.""

Patients, doctors, and other lawmakers have also been critical of what they see as delay-or-deny tactics, which can slow down or block access to care, causing irreparable harm and even death.

‚ÄúInsurance companies have put it in their mantra that they will take patients' money and then do their damnedest to deny giving it to the people who deliver care,"" said Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and a urologist. ""That goes on in every insurance company boardroom.""

Insurers have long argued that prior authorization reduces fraud and wasteful spending, as well as prevents potential harm. Public displeasure with insurance denials dominated the news in December, when the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare's CEO led many to anoint his alleged killer as a folk hero.

And the public broadly dislikes the practice: Nearly three-quarters of respondents thought prior authorization was a ""major"" problem in a July poll published by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Indeed, Oz said during his June press conference that ""violence in the streets"" prompted the Trump administration to take on the issue of prior authorization reform in the private insurance industry.

Still, the administration is expanding the use of prior authorization in Medicare. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said both initiatives ""serve the same goal of protecting patients and Medicare dollars.""

The pilot program, WISeR ‚Äî short for ‚ÄúWasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction‚Äù ‚Äî will test the use of an AI algorithm in making prior authorization decisions for some Medicare services, including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy.

The federal government says such procedures are particularly vulnerable to ""fraud, waste, and abuse"" and could be held in check by prior authorization.

Other procedures may be added to the list. But services that are inpatient-only, emergency, or ""would pose a substantial risk to patients if significantly delayed"" would not be subject to the AI model's assessment, according to the federal announcement.

While the use of AI in health insurance isn't new, Medicare has been slow to adopt the private-sector tools. Medicare has historically used prior authorization in a limited way, with contractors who aren't incentivized to deny services. But experts who have studied the plan believe the federal pilot could change that.

Pons told KFF Health News that no Medicare request will be denied before being reviewed by a ""qualified human clinician,"" and that vendors ""are prohibited from compensation arrangements tied to denial rates."" While the government says vendors will be rewarded for savings, Pons said multiple safeguards will ‚Äúremove any incentive to deny medically appropriate care.‚Äù

""Shared savings arrangements mean that vendors financially benefit when less care is delivered,"" a structure that can create a powerful incentive for companies to deny medically necessary care, said Jennifer Brackeen, senior director of government affairs for the Washington State Hospital Association.

And doctors and policy experts say that's only one concern.

Rathi said the plan ‚Äúis not fully fleshed out‚Äù and relies on ‚Äúmessy and subjective‚Äù measures. The model, he said, ultimately depends on contractors to assess their own results, a choice that makes the results potentially suspect.

""I'm not sure they know, even, how they're going to figure out whether this is helping or hurting patients,‚Äù he said.

Pons said the use of AI in the Medicare pilot will be ""subject to strict oversight to ensure transparency, accountability, and alignment with Medicare rules and patient protection.""

""CMS remains committed to ensuring that automated tools support, not replace, clinically sound decision-making,"" he said.

Experts agree that AI is theoretically capable of expediting what has been a cumbersome process marked by delays and denials that can harm patients' health. Health insurers have argued that AI eliminates human error and bias and will save the health care system money. These companies have also insisted that humans, not computers, are ultimately reviewing coverage decisions.

But some scholars are doubtful that's routinely happening.

""I think that there's also probably a little bit of ambiguity over what constitutes 'meaningful human review,'‚Äù said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

A 2023 report published by ProPublica found that, over a two-month period, doctors at Cigna who reviewed requests for payment spent an average of only 1.2 seconds on each case.

Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions told KFF Health News that the company does not use AI to deny care or claims. The ProPublica investigation referenced a ""simple software-driven process that helped accelerate payments to clinicians for common, relatively low-cost tests and treatments, and it is not powered by AI,"" Sessions said. ""It was not used for prior authorizations.""

And yet class-action lawsuits filed against major health insurers have alleged that flawed AI models undermine doctor recommendations and fail to take patients' unique needs into account, forcing some people to shoulder the financial burden of their care.

Meanwhile, a survey of physicians published by the American Medical Association in February found that 61% think AI is ""increasing prior authorization denials, exacerbating avoidable patient harms and escalating unnecessary waste now and into the future.""

Chris Bond, a spokesperson for the insurers' trade group AHIP, told KFF Health News that the organization is ""zeroed in"" on implementing the commitments made to the government. Those include reducing the scope of prior authorization and making sure that communications with patients about denials and appeals are easy to understand.

The Medicare pilot program underscores ongoing concerns about prior authorization and raises new ones.

While private health insurers have been opaque about how they use AI and the extent to which they use prior authorization, policy researchers believe these algorithms are often programmed to automatically deny high-cost care.

‚ÄúThe more expensive it is, the more likely it is to be denied,"" said Jennifer Oliva, a professor at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University-Bloomington, whose work focuses on AI regulation and health coverage.

Oliva explained in a recent paper for the Indiana Law Journal that when a patient is expected to die within a few years, health insurers are ""motivated to rely on the algorithm."" As time passes and the patient or their provider is forced to appeal a denial, the chance of the patient dying during that process increases. The longer an appeal, the less likely the health insurer is to pay the claim, Oliva said.

""The No. 1 thing to do is make it very, very difficult for people to get high-cost services,"" she said.

As the use of AI by health insurers is poised to grow, insurance company algorithms amount to a ""regulatory blind spot"" and demand more scrutiny, said Carmel Shachar, a faculty director at Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation.

The WISeR pilot is ""an interesting step"" toward using AI to ensure that Medicare dollars are purchasing high-quality health care, she said. But the lack of details makes it difficult to determine whether it will work.

Politicians are grappling with some of the same questions.

""How is this being tested in the first place? How are you going to make sure that it is working and not denying care or producing higher rates of care denial?"" asked DelBene, who signed an August letter to Oz with other Democrats demanding answers about the AI program. But Democrats aren't the only ones worried.

Murphy, who co-chairs the House GOP Doctors Caucus, acknowledged that many physicians are concerned the WISeR pilot could overreach into their practice of medicine if the AI algorithm denies doctor-recommended care.

Meanwhile, House members of both parties recently supported a measure proposed by Rep. Lois Frankel, a Florida Democrat, to block funding for the pilot in the fiscal 2026 budget of the Department of Health and Human Services.

AI in health care is here to stay, Murphy said, but it remains to be seen whether the WISeR pilot will save Medicare money or contribute to the problems already posed by prior authorization.

""This is a pilot, and I'm open to see what's going to happen with this,"" Murphy said, ""but I will always, always err on the side that doctors know what's best for their patients.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Scientists map step-by-step activation of brain receptors","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250924/Scientists-map-step-by-step-activation-of-brain-receptors.aspx","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 02:24:00 GMT","

When it comes to brain proteins, small changes can make a dramatic difference. Researchers studying NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, which are essential for learning, memory and moment-by-moment consciousness, know that even slight changes in their activity level can mean the difference between normal function and serious neurological disorders.

Now, University at Buffalo researchers in a long-term collaboration with scientists at the Vollum Institute have captured for the first time and in exquisite detail pictures of receptors in a fully open conformation. The paper also describes for the first time the sequence of structural changes that transform receptors from being silent to being fully active.

Published today in Science Advances, the team's work expands the understanding of how NMDA receptors function and how their malfunction contributes to disease.

Gabriela Popescu, PhD, professor of biochemistry in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB, is a corresponding author on the paper with Eric Gouaux, PhD, and Farzad Jalali-Yazdi, scientists at the Vollum Institute at Oregon Health & Science University. Lead authors are Jamie A. Abbott, PhD, research scientist in the Department of Biochemistry at UB, and Junhoe Kim, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at the Vollum Institute. Beiying Liu, PhD, is a co-author in the UB Department of Biochemistry.

Popescu has spent her career studying the biophysical properties of NMDA receptors, which generate electrical current in response to binding glutamate and help neurons communicate.

NMDA receptors are key to ongoing brain activity, but when they are inappropriately active, they kill neurons, such as, for example, after a traumatic brain injury, after a stroke, or during progressive neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.""

Gabriela Popescu, PhD, professor of biochemistry, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB

For that reason, Popescu and her colleagues have been focused on trying to understand and track the sequence of events that transform resting, inactive receptors into active, electricity-generating receptors. A key part of assembling this sequence requires obtaining pictures of receptors in different functional states to identify which parts change position during activation, enabling the transition. While previous research has reported atomic-resolution structures for receptors in the resting state, Popescu says that structures for active, pore-open receptors have remained elusive.

The researchers used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which involves flash-freezing samples of the receptors, then probing them with an electron beam to get a 3D view. The result is the first-ever, high-resolution image of a stable, open NMDA receptor. Unlike closed-pore receptors, in which the pore's four spiral structures, or helices, are straight, the researchers found that when the pore opens, the helices are bent or kinked.

It wasn't what they expected. ""We thought that the channel would open simply by prying apart the four helical rods that prevent ion flow to widen the mouth of the pore,"" says Popescu. ""Instead, we saw that all four rods are kinked outward and stabilized in this splayed conformation by new contacts with distant parts of the molecule.""

Each kink, she explains, represents a region of interest in the receptor. ""The identity of the amino acid at that position is essential as it must allow the kinking,"" she says. ""Without the image, without knowing that the helix must bend, we would not understand why this particular residue is important.""

The new observations will help researchers figure out the step-by-step process by which the receptor pore opens; they also provide insight into which other parts of the receptor may also play a role. There are many patients, Popescu notes, with single-point mutations in the DNA coding for this receptor. A point mutation is a change in a single amino acid in the receptor's structure. ""The new information helps us better understand what these amino acid residues do, why they are important and what goes wrong when they are altered,"" she adds.

The researchers also reveal the first mechanism of NMDA receptor activation integrating functional evidence obtained in Popescu's lab from single-molecule electrophysiology recordings with structural evidence from single-particle cryo-EM obtained in the lab of co-senior author Eric Gouaux, PhD, senior scientist at the Vollum Institute.

""Before this study, we knew that the receptor must change its structure several times to transition from resting to primed to open,"" says Popescu. ""Separately, structural studies produced pictures of receptors that looked a little different, but because we didn't know how the final open state looked, we couldn't arrange the pictures in the correct sequence.""

Popescu is now able to connect the new images of the receptor with her previous findings on the rate with which receptors change conformation to complete the activation cycle. Knowing how the receptor looks at each point in the sequence helps isolate which regions play key roles in the transition and why and how drugs bind to these regions, as well as why mutations in these regions cause disease.

""The work that my lab has done over the past 20 years can tell us how drugs or mutations change the current that glutamate elicits when it binds to the NMDA receptor,"" she says. ""Ultimately, the intensity, duration and frequency of this current - the tiny electrical signals that these receptors produce - determine how neurons communicate and whether our thoughts, feelings and emotions reflect reality in a way that helps us survive in a complex world. The new results show us why drugs and mutations change the current and can point us to ways to restore normal function.""

The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","COVID-19 linked to long-lasting reductions in smell even without noticeable symptoms","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250925/COVID-19-linked-to-long-lasting-reductions-in-smell-even-without-noticeable-symptoms.aspx","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 19:22:00 GMT","

People who suspect that their sense of smell has been dulled after a bout of COVID-19 are likely correct, a new study using an objective, 40-odor test shows. Even those who do not notice any olfactory issues may be impaired.

Led by the National Institutes of Health's RECOVER initiative and supported by its Clinical Science Core at NYU Langone Health, a team of researchers from across the country explored a link between the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and hyposmia - the reduced ability to smell.

The results revealed that 80% of participants who reported a change in their smelling ability after having COVID-19 earned low scores on a clinical scent-detection test taken about two years later. Of this group, 23% were severely impaired or had entirely lost their sense of smell.

Notably, 66% of infected participants who did not notice any smelling issues scored abnormally low on the evaluation as well, the authors say.

Our findings confirm that those with a history of COVID-19 may be especially at risk for a weakened sense of smell, an issue that is already underrecognized among the general population.""

Leora Horwitz, MD, study co-lead author 

Horwitz, a professor in the Departments of Population Health and Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, adds that 60% of uninfected participants who did not report olfactory problems also tested poorly during the clinical evaluation.

Hyposmia has long been connected to weight loss, reduced quality of life, and depression, among other concerns. Those with a diminished sense of smell may also struggle to detect dangers such as spoiled food, gas leaks, and smoke, experts say. In addition, scientists have flagged smelling dysfunction as an early sign of certain neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, which can affect the brain's scent-processing region.

While past research has identified hyposmia as a symptom of coronavirus infection, most of these studies have relied on patients' own assessments of their smelling ability. Such subjective measures are not always reliable and cannot effectively track the problem's severity and persistence, notes Horwitz.

The new study in 3,535 men and women, publishing online Sept. 25 in the journal JAMA Network Open, is the largest to date to examine loss of smell after COVID-19 by using a formal test, the authors say.

Along with Horwitz, Jacqueline Becker, PhD at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York is co-lead author. Hassan Ashktorab, PhD, at Howard University in Washington, D.C.; Andrea Foulkes, ScD, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston; and Joyce Lee-Iannotti, MD, at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, are study co-senior authors.

For the investigation, the research team assessed thousands of Americans who had participated in the RECOVER adult study, a multicenter analysis designed to shed light on the long-term health effects of the coronavirus. Throughout the study, those with and without a history of COVID-19 completed surveys about their symptoms every 90 days from October 2021 through June 2025.

To measure olfactory function, the team used a clinical tool: the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). In this scratch-and-sniff evaluation, which is considered the gold standard of its kind, participants were asked to identify 40 scents by selecting the right multiple-choice option for each odor. A correct answer earned one point, and the total UPSIT score was compared with a database of thousands of healthy volunteers of the same sex and as. Based on the results, smelling ability was characterized as normal, mildly impaired, moderately impaired, severely impaired, or lost altogether.

""These results suggest that health care providers should consider testing for loss of smell as a routine part of post-COVID care,"" said Horwitz. ""While patients may not notice right away, a dulled nose can have a profound impact on their mental and physical well-being.""

Experts are now exploring ways to restore smelling ability after having COVID-19, such as vitamin A supplementation and olfactory training to ""rewire"" the brain's response to odors. Having a deeper understanding of how the coronavirus affects the brain's sensory and cognitive systems may help refine these therapies, notes Horwitz.

Horwitz cautions that the study team did not directly assess loss of taste, which often accompanies problems with smell. In addition, it is possible that some uninfected participants were misclassified due to the lack of universal testing for the virus. This may help explain the surprisingly high rate of hyposmia identified in those without a supposed history of COVID-19, she says.

Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants R01HL162373, U01DC019579, OT2HL161847, OT2HL161841, and OT2HL156812.

Is it even a World Cup without a mascot?Well, how about three?

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup being the biggest edition (48 teams) of the marquee soccer extravaganza, we'll also have a plethora of mascots for next summer's edition. 

[WORLD CUP 2026: WHICH TEAMS HAVE QUALIFIED?]

Three co-hosts. Three distinct mascots. Each of these cuddly creatures represent the co-hosts of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and have their own special attributes on the pitch. 

(Courtesy: FIFA) 

A moose from our neighbors up north, Maple wears the No. 1 and is in charge of anchoring the net. From the name to his uniform color, Maple embodies some of the country's most recognizable emblems and is ""born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture.""

And although Les Rouges are better known for playmakers such as Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, it won't hurt to have Maple's antlers covering as much of the goal as possible. 

(Courtesy: FIFA) 

A jaguar who plays forward, donning the No. 9 in Mexico's iconic green kit. An elusive creature found in southern parts of the country, jaguars are a symbol to many of Mexico's ancient civilizations. Zayu is said to ""embrace Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. ‚Ä¶ a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride.""

And there's also no shortage of quality forwards for El Tri at the World Cup, including Javier ""Chicharito"" Hern√°ndez, Cuauht√©moc Blanco, and current striker Ra√∫l Jim√©nez. 

You need a maestro in the midfield, and Clutch should be up to the task. You need a keen eye and some sharp instincts when wearing the No. 10 shirt, so it's no surprise to have a bald eagle representing the United States.  Clutch is said to have ""an unquenchable thirst for adventure, soaring across the United States and embracing every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism.""

Christian Pulisic usually wears that number for the U.S. men's national team as a winger, so USMNT fans will hope he soars to new heights in 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Israel's future in Uefa could come to a head before World Cup qualifiers","https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/25/israel-future-in-uefa-october-world-cup-qualifiers-suspension-maccabi-tel-aviv","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:46:00 GMT","

National team and club sides may face suspension

Next Uefa international break begins on 6 October

Uefa could decide as early as next week whether to suspend Israel from its competitions, with the governing body facing growing pressure from inside and outside the game.

Reports on Thursday, initially in the Times, suggested a vote that would determine Israel's ¬≠participation in World Cup qualifying and that of ¬≠Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League could be held by Uefa's ¬≠executive committee before the ¬≠international break begins on 6 October.

Uefa said no meetings were ¬≠scheduled for next week, with the next exco gathering due on 3 ¬≠December. But sources inside national ¬≠federations said events appeared to be coming to a head and that Uefa and its ¬≠president, A¬≠leksander Ceferin, were ¬≠increasingly expected to take action.

There have been an ¬≠increasing number of interventions away from the game. On Tuesday, a group of ¬≠senior diplomats called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the ¬≠publication of a report by the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry that found Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Last week, the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York's Times Square to call for federations to boycott any matches with the country.

It is understood that voices within the game have also been speaking up in private, including those from the club world.

Italy is one of the countries under pressure to act. The Azzurri, along with Norway, are due to face Israel in the next round of ¬≠qualifiers, with their match scheduled for 14 ¬≠October in Udine. Italy is fresh from a 24-hour general strike in protest against ¬≠Israel's behaviour in Gaza.

Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said this week that any boycott ‚Äúwould only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament‚Äù. He also said he ‚Äúdenounced‚Äù the suffering in Gaza and that ‚Äúthere is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain‚Äù.

Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote by the 19 members of Uefa's exco. Insiders suggest if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of ¬≠passing with as few as three or four abstentions or votes against. It could, however, have considerable political consequences.

The United States government, for example, has warned it would stand against any such decision, with the country co-hosting the World Cup next summer. ‚ÄúWe will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup,‚Äù a spokesperson for the US Department of State told Sky News.

Any suspension would mean Uefa removing a participant from a Fifa-organised competition. Fifa, under its president, Gianni Infantino, has developed a strong relationship with the Trump ¬≠administration.

Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football

The global governing body is ¬≠investigating ¬≠allegations of teams staging matches in illegal ¬≠settlements in the West Bank, a review that ¬≠follows a request by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) in 2024.

On Thursday, Jibril Rajoub, the PFA president, said he will meet Ceferin and Kirsty Coventry, the president of the International Olympic Committee, to discuss the issue next week. ‚ÄúI believe that Israelis should not be allowed to participate in any matches, whether they are Uefa- or Fifa-regulated,‚Äù he told TV2 in Norway. ‚ÄúIsrael has violated principles, values and Fifa's statutes. Therefore, I believe that Israel should be sanctioned. I hope Uefa will follow the spirit of the statutes.‚Äù

In cycling, the Canadian sponsor of the Israel-Premier Tech team has called a name change. Its riders were targeted by protesters at the recent Vuelta a Espa√±a, causing ¬≠disruption to the Grand Tour event. It was estimated more than 100,000 people were on the streets in Madrid during the final stage, with protesters criticising the presence of the Israel Premier Tech team. In a statement reported by Radio ¬≠Canada, Premier Tech said: ‚ÄúThe current situation regarding the team name is no longer sustainable to achieve our goal.‚Äù","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

            The three mascots are also footballers in their own right.
    


            Maple is the goalkeeper of the trio, Zayu is a striker known for their ‚Äúexceptional ingenuity and agility‚Äù, with Clutch knitting it all together in midfield.

            The opening match of the 2026 World Cup is set to kick off in Mexico City at the Estadio Azteca on June 11, 2026. The final is scheduled to be played a little over a month later, near New York City, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.
    


            The final will include a halftime show for the very first time.
    


            The schedule will consist of 104 matches, as the tournament has been expanded to include 48 national teams, up from 32.

The updated lineup boasts improved comfort and stability without diminishing the frame's explosive power and spin-driven performance.ByJon LeveyPublished Sep 24, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 24, 2025

Some racquet updates are addition by subtraction. The manufacturer determines that a technology or feature has overstayed its usefulness and pulling the plug will actullay improve the frame's performance. For the second iteration of its Blackout, Solinco opted to keep the racquet's foundation and to continue build out. The frame already had a solid base of power, but enhancements to its stability and feel would make it superior across the board.There are two main advancements intended to better the Blackout. The first is the addition of Foam Tech Core. Racquets in the Blackout's class‚Äî100 square-inch, thick tapered beam width‚Äîare typically hollow; as was the original version. However, the V2 has PU density foam filling the head of the frame to reduce vibrations for a more comfortable feel at impact.It's already a feature in the brand's thinner-beamed, more control-oriented Whiteout franchise, but the added thickness of the Blackout created challenges. The trick was to keep the same weight and specs while accounting for the extra mass of the foam needed to fill out the beam. Ultimately, Solinco believes it gives the frame a friendlier ride than many of its competitors.

‚ÄúWe wanted to add that tech into the Blackout to dampen vibration and make it smoother,‚Äù says KT Kim, Director of Solinco Sports. ‚ÄúGenerally speaking a lot of people are thinking of arm health with this type of stiffer racquet.‚ÄùThe other notable addition is Arch-2 Construction.

This includes 40T Carbon Fiber, Liquid Crystal Technology and the innovative Weight Control Module‚Äîinterchangeable 5-gram and 10-gram butt-cap plates to fine-tune the racquet's weight and balance.‚ÄúWe feel it's now a racquet that can really be used across a wide spectrum of players,‚Äù says Kim. ‚ÄúBeginners to pros, it can handle heavy pace under fire and is an easier, more comfortable racquet to swing.‚Äù

The fact-based film centers on the U.S. women's gymnastics team's historic success at the 1996 Summer Games.

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Millie Bobby Brown is close to landing a role as an American sports icon for Netflix. 


	The Stranger Things standout is in final negotiations to star as Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug in director Gia Coppola‚Äòs feature Perfect. Brown would also join the film's producing team. 




	Coppola (The Last Showgirl) is helming the movie from a script by Ronnie Sandahl. The project is based on the real-life U.S. women's gymnastics team's historic success at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.

	Known as the Magnificent Seven, the American women's gymnastics team collected its first-ever team gold at the 1996 Olympics. Strug clinched the individual gold for the vault despite landing on an injured ankle, and the image of coach B√©la K√°rolyi carrying the athlete to the podium became a signature moment for those Summer Games.


	The team also included Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Dominique Dawes, Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps and captain Amanda Borden.


Perfect continues Brown's longstanding relationship with the streaming service, which includes such films as the Enola Holmes franchise, Damsel and The Electric State. The actress originated her breakout role of Eleven on the smash Netflix series Stranger Things when the show debuted in 2016. Its fifth and final season is set to be released later this year in three parts.

	











	Coppola, the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola and niece of Sofia Coppola, has previously directed the features Palo Alto (2013), Mainstream (2020) and the Pamela Anderson-led The Last Showgirl (2024).


Deadline was first to report on Perfect.

YouTube is taking flight with Delta Air Lines.


	The airline, which is celebrating its centenary, has inked a wide-ranging, multiyear partnership with the video platform, a deal that will bring YouTube content to the airline's seat-back in-flight video displays, free trials of YouTube Premium for Delta Skymiles members and a custom YouTube Music playlist (curated by flight attendants!) when passengers are boarding.




	‚ÄúThink about what Delta is all about, which is providing an amazing experience as they take travelers around the world. And from a YouTube perspective, we're really focused on bringing the best of the world to our users, through quality content,‚Äù says Miguel Quiroga, YouTube's vp product partnerships, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. ‚ÄúSo at the end of the day, like that intersection felt really compelling.‚Äù

	Passengers will be able to use Delta's inflight Wifi to access YouTube on their personal devices, of course, but a curated selection of YouTube content will also be added to Delta's inflight entertainment system, accessible via seatback screens, beginning Sept. 25.


	‚ÄúThe opportunity that we had is to be able to allow our customers to discover creators or talent or content that maybe they haven't yet been able to discover on their own.

	‚ÄúI think about it as featured content, and we do this, obviously, in partnership with Delta, and we'll periodically update it,‚Äù Quiroga says. ‚ÄúIt's designed for premium and longform content in nature that's generally widely popular and suited for in-flight viewing.

	In-flight entertainment has emerged as a surprisingly prime piece of real estate for media companies, but while some, like Peacock, may cut deals for exposure to their programming, YouTube isn't in need of such brand positioning.

	McCurry says that the playlist actually came about from an impromptu conversation between a YouTube Music executive and one of Delta's flight attendants. The YouTube exec mentioned the partnership to the flight attendant on a recent trip, ‚Äúand the flight attendant used this as an opportunity to connect with her entire crew, and wrote down a whole list of recommendations in terms of what the whole crew believed would be really great music for for our customers to play on board,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo it also provided really great feedback.‚Äù

Wade Robson and James Safechuck have been suing the estate for years - and new court filings claim they're seeking a monumental sum.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	Two men who have long accused Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children are seeking a whopping $400 million in their court cases, his estate revealed in recent court filings.


Wade Robson and James Safechuck have spent more than a decade litigating over their allegations of sexual abuse ‚Äì and in a motion filed last week in Los Angeles court, Jackson estate executors John Branca and John McClain say they're seeking a monumental sum.


	‚ÄúIt would be disastrous for the Estate to default in this case,‚Äù Branca and McClain wrote in the court filings, which were obtained by Billboard.


	The revelation came amid an intra-estate dispute with Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson, who claims Branca and McClain have paid too much in legal bills to certain law firms. In the new filing, the executors argue that not paying those fees would have ‚Äúprofoundly destabilizing consequences,‚Äù including a costly judgment for Robson and Safechuck.


	‚ÄúThe Estate would likely have to default in the Robson/Safechuck litigation, where numerous depositions, discovery matters, and other matters are scheduled to take place over the next several months, and where the plaintiffs are seeking $400 million.‚Äù


	In a statement to Billboard, the Jackson estate said: ‚ÄúThe lawsuit has no merit and Michael is innocent.‚Äù An attorney for Robson and Safechuck did not immediately return a request for comment on the estate's claims about the damages demand.


	Though Robson and Safechuck have being suing for years, it had never been reported that they were seeking such a massive award. The revelation was first reported by Us Weekly.


	Jackson, who died suddenly in 2009, was never convicted or held legally liable on any accusation of child molestation, but is still dogged by such allegations. Last year, the estate took legal action against a man named Frank Cascio, claiming he fabricated such claims as part of an alleged $213 million extortion attempt.


	Robson and Safechuck have spent years suing, and their allegations were amplified in 2019 by HBO docuseries Leaving Neverland, which laid out their claims in disturbing detail. In 2023, an appeals court revived their abuse lawsuits against Jackson's companies, and the cases remain pending with a trial currently scheduled for next year.


	Paris Jackson filed her petition in June, challenging how the estate had paid its lawyers. She claimed the executors had failed to ‚Äúprovide adequate responses‚Äù over how it spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to three firms. The executors later denied any wrongdoing, saying its conduct was ‚Äúnot unusual and in fact is quite common‚Äù in the music industry.


	In last week's new filing, they used the threat of a potential loss in the Robson and Safechuck cases to hammer that point home: ‚ÄúPetitioner's requested relief, if granted, could devastate the Estate. The Estate's attorneys ‚Äî and those of its constituent businesses ‚Äî are not going to work for free.‚Äù

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar nominee Josh Brolin, who is coming off box office smash Weapons, has come on board to headline the action-comedy Mister from Bright White Light and John Wick outfit Thunder Road.


	As we told you during Cannes, the film will mark the directorial debut of well known second unit and action director Wade Eastwood, whose credits include Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout and Jumanji: The Next Level. 


Mister follows a man (Brolin) who wakes up in a strange house covered in blood and comes to realize his true identity while fighting off contract killers from his past ‚Äî including everyone from his exes to his best friend. To get out, he teams up with his estranged daughter who also has ended up in the family business, but they will need to repair their relationship in order to survive.

	Principal photography is set to begin in early 2026 in Spain, with additional casting underway.


	Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee will produce for Thunder Road alongside Brolin for Brolin Productions. Nicki Cortese, who also penned the script with Nick Inglis, will produce with Wayne Marc Godfrey for Bright White Light (Runner), which also is financing the film.


	Executive producers include Chase Vergari, Ibrahim Mohammed, Eric Handler and Will Flynn. Black Bear represents international rights on the film, with CAA Media Finance handling domestic. Sophie Meyer and Alex Bigman will oversee for Bright White Light.


	Following his acclaimed performance in the breakout hit Weapons, Brolin next will be seen in Edgar Wright's The Running Man and Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Next year he stars in Ridley Scott's The Dog Stars and 20th Century's Whalefall.












	‚ÄúHaving the opportunity to collaborate with Josh is everything I could have hoped for,‚Äù said director Eastwood. ‚ÄúHis presence and gravitas define Mister and bring the film to life in every way. What excites me most about this project is the depth of the characters and complexity of their relationships, which allows me to build action around story, without ever losing the intensity the genre demands.‚Äù


	Brolin is represented by CAA and Eastwood by UTA.

International Investigations Editor


Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik, and Greg Berlanti are among 1,200 industry figures who have signed an open letter decrying an Israeli film boycott.


	Organized by non-profit Creative Community For Peace, the letter (read in full below) described the Film Workers for Palestine boycott, signed by the likes of Mark Ruffalo and Olivia Colman, as ‚Äúdiscriminatory and antisemitic.‚Äù


	The Creative Community For Peace letter, signed by others including Debra Messing and Sharon Osbourne, referred to the rival pledge as an act of ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù and ‚Äúerasure of art.‚Äù

	The letter said: ‚ÄúIsrael's entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.‚Äù

	











	It continued: ‚ÄúWe know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponized and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.‚Äù


	The letter concluded: ‚ÄúWe call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.‚Äù


	The Film Workers for Palestine boycott was published earlier this month. It has gathered signatories including Emma Stone, Peter Sarsgaard, Lily Gladstone, Elliot Page, and Joaquin Phoenix.


	The pledge said: ‚ÄúWe pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions‚Äîincluding festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies‚Äîthat are implicated* in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.‚Äù


Full Creative Community For Peace letter (signatories here):


To our fellow artists and the global film community,












We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.


The pledge circulated under the banner of ‚ÄúFilm Workers for Palestine‚Äù is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.


To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.


Israel's film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel's film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistently program dissent.


Israel's entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.


The pledge uses nebulous terms like ‚Äòimplicating' and ‚Äòcomplicity.' Who will decide which Israeli filmmakers and film institutions are ‚Äòcomplicit'? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is ‚Äòcomplicity' just a pretext to boycott all Israelis and Zionists ‚Äî 95% of the world's Jewish population ‚Äî no matter what they create or believe?


History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence filmmakers before: Nazi Germany's propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood's own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.


We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponized and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.


If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support filmmakers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.


Let art speak the whole truth.


We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.

As a Jew, it's incredibly insulting to have my fair criticisms of Israel for its egregious handling of Palestinian territory described as anti-semitic.

WELL DONE !!!!!!

I agree because that would be like other Countries boycotting our film industry because we have an evil orange monster for a President who constantly does horrific actions. They are blaming the wrong people. The film industry in Israel is not responsible for their evil leader just like we aren't responsible for the actions our evil leader is doing.

In general art and artists should not be boycotted. It won't end a war and may only incite more hatred toward Israel and possibly Jewish people. On the other hand if the Israeli film industry gets funding from the Israeli government then you can see why some might feel there is an issue. But I think there are better ways to oppose Israel's actions in Gaza than protesting their film industry.

Bravo that they are standing up and voicing the blatant antisemitism.

Taylor Swift is heading back to 30 Rock for another round with Jimmy Fallon.


	The pop star will appear on NBC's The Tonight Show on October 6 to promote her new album The Life of a Showgirl.


	It comes after Fallon teased the appearance with a roulette-themed video (see below). Fallon captioned the clip, ‚ÄúNot a lot going on at the moment,‚Äù which is a nod to a signature Swift line that she has used in the past and worn on a T-shirt in her ‚Äú22‚Äù music video. The roulette ball lands in slot 13, and Fallon sighs saying ‚Äúbaby, that's showbusiness for you‚Äù before walking out to a bunch of feather-clad showgirls.

	











	It marks Swift's seventh appearance on Fallon's show, having most recently appeared in 2022, to promote her Midnights record. That was the last time she appeared in coordination with a new album release, as she was in the middle of the Eras tour when The Tortured Poets Department came out.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Swift's previous appearances on the late-night show include a performance of New Year's Day in 2017 after Fallon's mother died, which featured lyrics that echoed Fallon's memories of his mom.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Paul Thomas Anderson was ahead of the curve with Philip Seymour Hoffman until the end","https://www.avclub.com/together-again-paul-thomas-anderson-philip-seymour-hoffman-the-master-boogie-nights","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 18:06:17 GMT","

With Together Again, Jesse Hassenger looks at actors and directors who have worked together on at least three films, analyzing the nature of their collaborations.

It wouldn't be right to call Philip Seymour Hoffman a chameleon. Even before he became an Oscar winner and frequent player of first and second leads, Hoffman was a ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù character actor too distinctive to fully disappear into his roles. You don't hire ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù for his mastery of disguise. Often, quite the opposite. Character actors take advantage of an unconscious sense of continuity: the idea that, say, the officious yet duplicitous prep-school prick from Scent Of A Woman could make sense as the humorless cop from Nobody's Fool and the toady from The Big Lebowski. That the lovelorn porn-movie boom operator from Boogie Nights could also be the lonely obscene phone-caller in Happiness, or a wild tornado chaser from Twister might branch into a gregarious Lester Bangs in Almost Famous or an imitation Jack Black in Along Came Polly.

Those are three major modes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, and far from the only ones. It's a tribute to his range and magnetism that they all seem like a natural fit without much superficial shapeshifting. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't completely avoid casting Hoffman in his various types across their five movies together. But he often seemed to stay a step or two ahead of the conventional wisdom around how to use one of his favorite actors‚Äîskipping, for example, over the early supercilious-prep phase entirely. This vein ran through some of Hoffman's supporting work for years, well after he was done playing actual prep-schoolers, eventually turning into a kind of malicious inquisitiveness. His characters in Red Dragon (a journalist) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (mostly just nosy) aren't the real bad guys, not compared to the murderers he side-eyes. But by virtue of identification with morally dubious characters, they're naturally antagonistic.

Anderson cast Hoffman in antagonistic parts, too, but never especially witty ones. His characters are guys who don't have the patience or the countenance to bother with insinuating. In Hard Eight, Anderson's first feature, Hoffman is on screen for less than three minutes, playing an obnoxious gambler at the craps table with the older, quieter, more experienced Sydney (Philip Baker Hall). A mulleted Hoffman intones his repetitive taunts‚Äîhe keeps calling Sydney ‚Äúold-timer‚Äù‚Äîlike a junior-level Nicolas Cage drawling through the kind of then-trendy Tarantino imitations that probably helped get Hard Eight a green light in the first place. He's a walking, braying counterpoint to Hall's stillness, as well as a calling card for a more expansive prickishness than Hoffman had shown in his Hollywood roles thus far.

Hoffman provides similar punctuation to Punch-Drunk Love‚Äîright down to sounding like Tarantino himself. (His orders repeatedly end with ‚ÄúAll right? Okay?‚Äù) He isn't on screen much more than he is during Hard Eight‚Äîmaybe five minutes as opposed to three‚Äîbut he looms more heavily over the proceedings as the would-be tormenter of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), via a phone-sex-line scam. Barry lacks Sydney's even keel, but his explosive bursts of rage are balanced by soft-spoken sweetness. Hoffman's Dean Trumbell, better known as the Mattress Man, defaults to rage and disgust in seemingly any interaction, paradoxically opening his side of several conversations with ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù

Hoffman's most famous moment in the movie is a variation on this: When Barry confronts him about his extortion on the phone, he unleashes a barrage of ‚ÄúShut! Shut! Shut shut! Shut up!‚Äù When Barry confronts him in person and Dean backs down, he still can't resist getting the last word in, screaming insults at Barry as he leaves, then immediately invoking Barry's proposed ‚ÄúThat's that‚Äù like a kid on a playground frantically touching base during a game of tag. Anderson leaves the Mattress Man's ultimate motivations‚Äîwhatever feelings he has beneath his contemptuous impatience‚Äîunspoken and offscreen, which makes him a sleaze-world version of the villain Hoffman would play in Mission: Impossible III a few years later.

‚ÄúShut the fuck up‚Äù is also how Boogie Nights introduces Hoffman's Scotty, though he's on the receiving end of the admonishment as he awkwardly makes his side-door entrance at a debauched afternoon pool party. A porn-film crew worker wearing a series of snug tank tops, Scotty is a more sensitive character that anticipates the sexual awkwardness he'd be asked to maximize in Happiness a year later. One of the sweetest, if also most limiting, aspects of Boogie Nights is how Anderson draws so many of its characters as essentially childlike; earlier in the party sequence introducing Scotty, Dirk (Mark Wahlberg) and Reed (John C. Reilly) are comparing gym bona fides and swimming-pool pointers like a couple of 14-year-olds.

Hoffman's Scotty fits perfectly into this schema, which is to say he doesn't especially fit at all; he's the kid at the class party, lingering on the sidelines, genially tolerated but unloved on a deeper level. In a movie that sometimes feels as if Anderson is doing the tracking-shot-introducing-all-the-characters bit on a loop, Scotty keeps unceremoniously appearing in the frame and popping up in the background; every time you wonder if Hoffman has quietly exited the picture during the characters' '80s-era downward slope, he pops up once more, sometimes with no more than a line or barely acknowledged reaction. Scotty's story as it relates to the bigger picture‚Äîhe's in love with an oblivious Dirk, he acts on it, and gets rebuffed‚Äîis pretty much over with an hour of the movie to go. But he sticks around, and doesn't meet the kind of end you might expect from the quiet tragedy of his unrequited love.

For an arrogant and reportedly drug-addled late-'90s enfant terrible, Anderson spared many of his early characters from the worst possible suffering. Like the Boogie Nights folks, the ensemble of Magnolia goes through a wringer, and one not so easily chalked up to the foolishness of youth or the allure of getting paid to have sex on camera. Yet only the absolute worst misdeeds seem likely to face great cosmic punishment. (Even then, an abuser's attempted suicide is thwarted by the same strange falling-frogs fate that throws the rest of the cast off.) Amid this assembly of Anderson's favorite actors, the filmmaker again zig-zags with Hoffman; having previously helped establish him as a jackass and then reshaped him as a socially awkward and emotionally needy type, he casts him here as Phil Parma, the home nurse caring for the dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). There's a feint early on, when Phil orders a few groceries for delivery, then casually tacks on copies of Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler; audiences could be forgiven for making an unconscious connection and wondering if Phil is meant to be some kind of creep. Yet, he turns out to be perhaps the most purely good person in Magnolia short of actual children. It may not be a coincidence that the character shares Hoffman's first name.

Though unalike in presentation and temperament, Phil Parma isn't so different from Scotty in function: He stays on the sidelines. That position gives him more to do this time, just as most of the characters in Magnolia are more multifaceted than their Boogie Nights counterparts. As Earl's nurse, witness to his decline, Phil has greater empathy for the man than someone who's spent decades with him (or estranged from him), though he seems more than faintly aware of how difficult the old bastard can be. When Earl feebly asks to get in touch with his son Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), Phil reaches out on his behalf and makes it happen. He's the one major character in the movie whose personal problems don't really enter the narrative, serving as the audience for Earl's big, rambling monologue about regret as well as Frank's bedside breakdown over his absentee father. 

In a monologue-heavy movie, Anderson trusts Hoffman with a mini-monologue that lampshades Magnolia‚Äòs go-for-broke melodrama, pleading with a sales rep on the phone to connect him with someone who can get in touch with Mackey. Phone to his ear, touching his hand to his face in that now-familiar Hoffman way, he says:

‚ÄúI know this sounds silly. And I know that I might sound ridiculous, like this is the scene in the movie where the guy's trying to get ahold of the long-lost son, you know, but this is that scene. This is that scene. And I think they have those scenes in movies because they're true. You know, because they really happen. And you gotta believe me, this is really happening. I mean, I can give you my number, and you can go check with whoever you gotta check with, and call me back. But do not leave me hanging on this. All right, please. See‚Ä¶see, this is the scene of the movie where you help me out.‚Äù

In one of the most impressive casts of its era, it's difficult to picture anyone else in the ensemble making that dialogue work. Maybe that emotional rawness helps explain why Hoffman only has a small part in Punch-Drunk Love, and nothing in There Will Be Blood; Anderson's work was becoming a bit more obtuse during a period where Hoffman (thanks in part to Anderson) was more frequently and traditionally ingratiating. Magnolia, State And Main, and Almost Famous came out in a row, forming a versatile trilogy of disarmingly lovable Hoffman.

Then, after a decade apart, during which Hoffman won an Oscar for his standard biopic transformation in Capote and Anderson directed Daniel Day-Lewis to another Oscar for There Will Be Blood, Anderson and Hoffman came full circle with The Master‚Äîsort of. As in Hard Eight, Hoffman antagonizes the lead character, this time as the older man of greater (if self-styled) authority set against a younger, wilder man. (The actual age difference between the lead actors is only seven years; it's made to feel like more.) But Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) isn't exactly the villain of The Master, any more than Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) registers as a hero. The movie's point of view sticks mostly with Quell‚Äîincluding several scenes that seem like hallucinations or dreams, most notably when he sees Dodd singing to a room full of women who are suddenly all unclothed. This is not happening in the objective reality of this scene; it's all bundled up with Quell's neuroses, as he returns home from World War II, adrift and alcoholic and almost ruinously horny.

Quell happens upon Dodd by chance, as the latter begins to build up The Cause, a Scientology-like religion full of pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy. Dodd rankles at challenges to his credentials, or his authority in general; at one Cause meeting, he haughtily dismisses one questioner with well-coiffed confidence until the man's persistence finally causes Dodd to rip the lid off of his rage and call out ‚ÄúPigfuck!‚Äù in a way that suggests he had been suppressing the epithet for the entire interaction. Yet Quell's far more insinuating way of challenging him‚Äîby quite evidently not being a true believer, by attaching his lostness to this temporary solution that probably can't last‚Äîelicits Dodd's admiration alongside his frustration. Quell's id-like, tortured soul reflects Dodd's own divided psyche, the raging, redfaced side of himself he attempts to hide behind a quasi-academic composure. 

Hoffman conveys all of this while saying almost none of it. His occasional outbursts recall Punch-Drunk Love, and his queasy fascination with Quell plays like a more refined version of Scotty's transparent longings; mostly, though, past Hoffman performances are only faint, ghostly echoes, with that character-actor ethos emerging again. Dodd puts that sensibility into lofty, borderline ridiculous words: ‚ÄúIf we meet again in the next life,‚Äù he tells Quell before he leaves The Cause for good, ‚Äúyou will be my sworn enemy, and I will show you no mercy.‚Äù

If Anderson was ahead of the curve in his casting of Hoffman, how Lancaster Dodd might be reflected in his future roles remains a mystery. The Master proved an unexpected culmination of Anderson and Hoffman's working relationship when Hoffman died in 2014. He was 46. He made a couple of small non-Hunger Games pictures in between The Master and his death, but The Master feels like his last big one‚Äîand his first really big one for Anderson, despite the pair serving as each other's most frequent major collaborator. Hoffman often lurks around the edges of Anderson's movies; that's true even for his co-starring role in The Master. Lancaster Dodd strives to be the focus of a mass movement, but the film's fixation is Freddie Quell's inability to fit in rather than Dodd's attempts to dictate the fitting.

So there's something both familiar and completely new about having Hoffman's son Cooper star outright in Licorice Pizza, a coming-of-age comedy released almost eight years after the older Hoffman's death. Cooper Hoffman is his own person, giving a lovely performance in Licorice Pizza that falls far afield from how his dad might have played it, had he somehow been given the chance as a teenager. The elder Hoffman brought spiritual weight to many of his performances; he's hilarious in Punch-Drunk Love, but the Mattress Man also appears profoundly unhappy. As teenage actor, entrepreneur, and all-around bullshitter Gary Valentine, Cooper Hoffman has a buoyancy that lifts him up even as he capably conveys jealousy, disappointment, pettiness, and anger as needed. Cast in the shadow of his father's death, subtly underlined by Gary's father never appearing in the film, that lightness never feels lightweight.

But that sadness isn't remotely part of the movie's text; Licorice Pizza is the highest-spirited of Anderson's career. Yet for those who love Hoffman's work, a melancholy awareness creeps in; in a barely perceptible way, Philip Seymour Hoffman lingers around the edge of this movie, too. The older Hoffman flashed an ingratiating star quality in certain parts; so far, the younger Hoffman leads with that quality, with flashes of something weightier. Towards the end of Licorice Pizza, when Gary is stalking around his latest business, throwing kids out of his Pinball Palace seemingly out of frustration that he's not enjoying himself more, Hoffman's brusqueness uncannily mimics his dad‚Äîin one mode, anyway. This was the scene of the movie where Philip Seymour Hoffman helps you out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Scarlett Johansson makes her directorial debut with the insultingly syrupy Eleanor The Great","https://www.avclub.com/eleanor-the-great-review","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

To know Eleanor Morgenstein is to love her‚Äîapparently. As played by June Squibb, the title character of Scarlett Johansson's feature directorial debut is a bitingly sarcastic, tell-it-like-it-is nonagenarian who, in the midst of profound grief, makes an unconscionable decision. Much of Eleanor The Great chronicles the aftermath of that decision, watching as a lie she tells snowballs out of control. This tonally tricky comedy-drama tackles aging, loss, the Holocaust, Jewishness, and the difficulty of determining the truth in a fake-news world. But Johansson's well-meaning film couldn't be more aggravating, and its biggest problem is its insistence that we find Eleanor so damn endearing, no matter what.

Eleanor lives in Los Angeles with her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar), whom she's known for 70 years. They've been roommates since their husbands died more than a decade ago, constantly trading quips and telling off whippersnapper grocery store employees. But, occasionally, Bessie has trouble sleeping, waking up from nightmares that take her back to her childhood in Poland, where she barely survived the concentration camps. At their kitchen table before the sun comes up, Bessie relates her horror stories to Eleanor, who tries to make her friend feel better. But those emotional scars are permanent, and Bessie knows she'll wear them to the grave.

When Bessie does die, the terribly alone Eleanor flies to New York to move in with one of her adult daughters, divorced mom Lisa (Jessica Hecht), with whom she's never been close. The tension between them is apparent instantly, the 94-year-old criticizing Lisa's apartment and life choices. She's especially unhappy once Lisa gently suggests checking out assisted-living facilities‚Äîand signs her up for Jewish Community Center events to keep her busy. Reluctantly attending one such event, Eleanor gets distracted by a separate meeting being held down the hall, only belatedly realizing she's accidentally joined a support group for Holocaust survivors. Rather than admit her mistake, though, Eleanor feels so welcomed by the group that she starts sharing her memories of the camps‚Äîexcept they're not her memories, they're Bessie's. She hasn't felt so included, so valued, since Bessie's passing, so she keeps up the charade. Who could it possibly hurt?

Tory Kamen's screenplay quickly provides the answer: A sweet NYU journalism student, Nina (Erin Kellyman), attends the meeting for an article she's writing, moved by Eleanor's harrowing tale. With her daughter and grandson (Will Price) wrapped up in their own lives, Eleanor doesn't have much human contact, so she lets Nina interview her, befriending this college student in the process. Turns out, Nina is going through her own grief: Her artist mother died only a few months ago. Unfortunately, the longer Nina spends with Eleanor, the more Eleanor draws on Bessie's stories, essentially creating an alternate identity based on her late friend. (Nina knows Eleanor's friend died, but not that Bessie lived the life Eleanor is pretending is her own.) Adding more complications, Nina's father Roger (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the charming host of a local TV news segment focusing on unique New Yorkers, becomes interested in doing a broadcast on Eleanor's remarkable (and wholly fabricated) past.

Squibb, who turns 96 in November, has enjoyed a prolific career later in life, receiving an Oscar nomination for 2013's Nebraska and landing her first starring role in last year's action-comedy Thelma. Her characters are surly, mischievous wiseasses, and Eleanor The Great capitalizes on that onscreen persona, giving us a woman who, early in the film, doesn't mind telling the occasional white lie to ensure that Bessie gets special treatment in the hospital. But once Eleanor starts stealing from Bessie's experiences, the deceit becomes troubling. Lying about being a Holocaust survivor is a serious ethical lapse, and one that will surely bring consequences. But for the most part, Eleanor doesn't display any sense of guilt or concern‚Äîshe's just so grateful to have a new friend. Is Eleanor The Great the melancholy story of a grief-stricken woman? Or is there something more devious (or demented) in Eleanor's flouting of the truth?

A sharper movie would have explored those intriguing questions. But Johansson is after something far tidier and syrupy. Her manipulative film introduces an inherently nervy premise but then quickly and unconvincingly pivots away from its more serious implications. Squibb plays Eleanor with blandly crotchety adorableness, her incurious movie ignoring any potentially compelling inner conflict. Eleanor The Great‚Äòs moral complications are insultingly sanded off in the name of treacly messages about forgiveness and grief. 

At a moment when many Jews have anguished feelings about both Israel's ongoing pummeling of Gaza and the Trump administration's exploiting of antisemitism to target universities, Eleanor The Great means to illustrate the struggles and the beauty of modern Judaism and the Holocaust's ugly lingering shadow. (Belatedly, Eleanor wants to finally have her bat mitzvah, inspiring an on-the-nose scene in which a rabbi discusses the Torah's teachings about lying.) But like another falsely feel-good film about bigotry‚ÄîJojo Rabbit, which earned Johansson an Oscar nomination‚ÄîEleanor The Great seeks uplift not insight. It wants to put a happy, tearjerking face on the trauma it's intending to memorialize. We're expected to sympathize with Eleanor because she's a lovable, lonely stinker who made an innocent mistake that got out of hand. But it's hard to forgive her when Eleanor never wants us to doubt how great she really is. Grief can make people do unimaginable things‚Äîtoo bad Johansson's debut lacks the imagination or courage to delve into the darkness in order to bring her audience (and Eleanor) back into the light.

‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù actor William Shatner, who played the role of Captain Kirk, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 24, TMZ reports. He is 94 years old.

The outlet adds that he ‚Äúexperienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon,‚Äù with the actor having ‚Äúcalled emergency medical service workers for help as a precaution and paramedics showed up in an LAFD ambulance.‚Äù

Shatner was taken to a local hospital, with TMZ reporting that he's doing ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúresting comfortably.‚Äù

TMZ posted on social media, sharing the news, and many fans left comments, showing support for Shatner. 

‚ÄúüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ,‚Äù one fan commented.  

‚ÄúOh no.. I hope he's not beamed up just yet.. Stay strong @WilliamShatner.. Engines need more Warp Speed,‚Äù someone wrote. 

‚ÄúWishing Captain Kirk well,‚Äù a fan said.

In June 2025, Shatner opened up about a medical condition he has been dealing with for years called tinnitus.

According to the Mayo Clinic, tinnitus is ‚Äúwhen you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears,‚Äù however, it isn't ‚Äúcaused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.‚Äù The condition began when he was filming ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù due to the special effects explosion.

In the video released by the nonprofit organization Tinnitus Quest, Shatner aimed to spread awareness.

‚ÄúOver the years, I've had many ups and downs with my tinnitus,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know from firsthand experience just how difficult it can get.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äùs a diverse condition that comes in different degrees of severity. About 1‚Äì2% of the population suffer from a chronic, debilitating form of tinnitus. There are no effective treatments‚Äîand that's why we need more research,‚Äù he added. 

A post shared by William Shatner (@williamshatner)

On Aug. 7, William Shatner took to Instagram, revealing to fans that, at the age of 94, he has decided to release a book. 

‚ÄúMy dear followers, I wanted to drop a bit of a teaser: I'm writing a new book. Even Better: the book's all about YOU, the fans, and you can be a part of it, maybe even be in it!,‚Äù he captioned the post. ‚ÄúGo to WilliamShatnerAndYou.com to find out more!‚Äù

Shatner has played many iconic roles, including Captain Kirk, Denny Crane, T.J. Hooker. So with that, he is asking fans to ‚Äúsubmit your own tale of how my characters: be it Kirk, T.J. Hooker, or even Denny Crane‚Äîhave touched your life.‚Äù And a lucky few will get the opportunity to be interviewed by Shatner about their stories, while will be featured in the book.

Stop us if you've heard this one before: a restrictive and repressive foreign country edited and censored an LGBTQ scene from a movie and now the American distributor is upset. We can think of a dozen movies that come to mind. 

In this case, a Chinese distributor caved to the government's pressure and edited a scene in the recent indie body horror movie ‚ÄúTogether,‚Äù changing a gay wedding to a straight one. Neon isn't pleased, and it demanded that Hishow, the Chinese distributor to whom it sold the foreign rights, stop showing ‚Äúthis altered version,‚Äù the company told IndieWire in a statement.

 










What's weird, however, is that Hishow didn't just cut the scene in question or edit it in such a way to make it look like it was a heterosexual couple getting married. Per some glaring social media posts that went viral last week, the distributor seemingly used AI to face swap a male character with the face of a woman.

Related Stories When ‚ÄòJimmy Kimmel Live!' Returns to the Air Tonight, It Will Not Be Available Everywhere ‚ÄòJimmy Kimmel Live!' to Return Tuesday Night as Suspension Ends 

Firstly, the Chinese distributor simply isn't allowed to edit the film in any way, which is normally the case in sales agreements. In the case of a major studio film where the studio is handling global distribution, it needs to go through government approval to get released in China or other countries prone to censoring LGBTQ+ content, and the studio itself would need to make that decision on an edited version.

 










But for an indie like ‚ÄúTogether,‚Äù which Neon bought the worldwide rights to (for $15 million out of Sundance this year), it handles North American distribution itself, and then it sells the movie to other territories for the rest of the world. 

But under the terms of any deal they make with another international distributor, Neon is selling ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù under the legal pretense that the distributor release Neon's IP as intended. Hishow has halted the release since. ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù officially opened on September 19.

It's also unclear if this is really ‚ÄúAI‚Äù or just some other slapdash edit that swapped a man's face with a female one. It's hard to tell when you have nothing to go on but a screenshot smuggled from Chinese social media. 

But people in China certainly seem to think this is an example of AI. China Digital Times reports that it wasn't just the same-sex image that was altered, but the distributor did also cut out some straight sex scenes from the film, just like they could've done with the scene that was digitally altered. China Digital Times also compiled a collection of commenters from film forum websites like Douban, Zhihu, and Xiaohongshu. As one user implies, the AI is a more sophisticated and ‚Äúterrifying‚Äù form of censorship because smart viewers have figured out ways to get around obvious censorship or can tell the difference, but that's much harder with AI. Here's a smattering of some of the comments, sarcasm implied on the last one:

 










‚ÄúIf they just deleted scenes, we could work it out by watching BluRay or streaming versions, and even scene alterations like cropping, dimming, or photoshopping in skirts could be fairly readily identified. But the evolution of alteration methods like this AI face-swapping is terrifying ‚Ä¶ in the future, we won't even be able to tell if we're watching the original film or not.‚Äú

‚ÄúWe've reached the point where it's not a matter of cuts, but of falsification and misrepresentation.

‚ÄúThis is nauseating because it not only interferes with the integrity of the plot, it disrespects the sexual orientation of the actors. Congrats to those Chinese with thin skins for pioneering this new mode of film import. Next time, they might as well straight-swap ‚ÄúCall Me by Your Name‚Äù for hetero screenings.

‚ÄúAwesome! Next, let's use one-click AI to re-release ‚ÄúBrokeback Mountain,‚Äù ‚ÄúGod's Own Country,‚Äù ‚ÄúLan Yu,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHappy Together‚Äù as ‚Äúrestored‚Äù hetero romances ‚Äî a faster and more effective conversion than drinking Chinese herbal medicine! What a beautiful country! There's hope for us yet!

The one commenter is especially right about the edit interfering with the integrity of the plot. Some SPOILERS! for ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù follow. The scene that was edited isn't just any old wedding. When stars Alison Brie and Dave Franco discover a video tape of the wedding, we learn the two men in the wedding eventually went through the same fusion process that is about to take place for them, and the two men ultimately formed into one single man, as played by Damon Herriman. When Brie and Franco eventually fuse at the end of the film, they become a single, androgynous, non-binary person. Erasing the same-sex marriage and making it a straight couple suddenly makes the Damon Herriman character make no sense.

 










That's the really terrifying part of this particular edit ‚Äî AI alterations that exist to serve censorship and degrade creators' original storytelling.

	Before the start of M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Las Vegas residency earlier this month, Vince Neil revealed that the band was forced to push the beginning of the run because he had a stroke in December. Well, now, the M√∂tley frontman has shared that he actually suffered at least four strokes ‚Äúthroughout the years‚Äù ‚Äî and this last one may just have been the worst.


	‚ÄúTwo of 'em I didn't even know I had. One of 'em was a mini stroke that happened, and I just lost feeling in my hand. And that was it,‚Äù he told Eddie Trunk on SiriusXM's Trunk Nation. ‚ÄúAnd I got over that pretty quickly. But then this last one, it was a big one.‚Äù


	Neil said doctors were able to discover that he had suffered the other strokes because they had ‚Äúscarred right around the same spot‚Äù and that there were four scars in his brain due to strokes. The last of the health scares really affected Neil's mobility, and he was forced to learn to walk again.

A post shared by Trunk Nation on SXM Faction Talk Channel 103 (@trunknationsxm)


	‚ÄúMy left leg wouldn't work, and my left arm wouldn't work. So I had to get help out of bed. I couldn't push myself up to get myself comfortable in bed. And I had to have help,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd slowly but surely, the sensation came back in my legs. And I had to learn to walk again. I went from a wheelchair to a walker to a cane to ‚Äî I can walk now, but for five months it was just off and on, not knowing what's gonna happen.‚Äù

	











	He continued: ‚ÄúAnd the doctor said that I probably wouldn't be onstage again. And I was, like, ‚ÄòNo, man. I can't do that.' And so I just tried. I worked my butt off to get back in shape to go onstage. And I was really sad to have to cancel those shows, but I just wasn't ready yet.‚Äù

	











	Back in March, Neil had shared that the band ‚Äî which he comprises with Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx, and new guitarist John 5 ‚Äî would push back the residency from March to September over a vocal procedure. ‚ÄúMy health is my top priority so I can bring you the awesome shows you deserve, and I can't wait to return to the stage,‚Äù Neil said in a statement at the time. However, the health issue was much more serious.


	To the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Neil explained that he did physical therapy for months in Nashville before being able to rehearse. While his voice wasn't affected, ‚Äúit takes a while to get your brain to start moving your legs, for them to do what your brain wants to do. You try to walk, but it doesn't come out right,‚Äù he explained, adding that he's around 95 percent back to ‚Äúwhere I was before.‚Äù


M√∂tley Cr√ºe: The Las Vegas Residency kicked off at Dolby Live at Park MGM in Las Vegas earlier this month. The Cr√ºe have shows scheduled on Sept. 26 and 27, and on Oct. 1 and 3.

	While the United States is mired in one Donald Trump controversy after another, much of the rest of the industrialized world is steadily moving into the future. Other nations can't ignore America, but they can try to figure out new ways to proceed with less American involvement, and many of them are doing just that. China, in particular, is taking advantage of this situation, and that's especially true when it comes to renewable energy.


	China has been leading the world in the production of renewable energy components for years, and it will only become more dominant in the sector as the United States withdraws from it. More than just withdrawing from what other countries see as the future of energy, the Trump administration is reportedly telling our European allies that climate change is ‚Äúoverhyped,‚Äù and to stop worrying about it so much and join the administration's fossil fuel agenda.


	‚ÄúIt's going to have exactly the opposite effect,‚Äù David Victor, a distinguished professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California, San Diego, tells Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúTrump. 2.0 is like Trump 1.0 in the sense that they do things and then the reaction from the rest of the world is to do the opposite.‚Äù

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	At the United Nations on Tuesday, Trump went on a bizarre rant about climate change and renewable energy, which he loves to attack whenever he can. The president railed against wind power, called the idea of a carbon footprint a ‚Äúhoax,‚Äù and told diplomats from around the world: ‚ÄúIf you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.‚Äù

	











	As for China, the country is continuing to produce massive amounts of components for solar energy, wind energy, and battery storage. It's also producing a huge number of affordable, trendy electric vehicles. China has invested more than $625 billion in clean energy last year, and the country has been investing hundreds of billions into its EV industry. 


	‚ÄúThey have so much capacity that they're exporting products at really low prices,‚Äù says David Hart, a senior fellow for climate and energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ‚ÄúThis is causing many other countries to adopt, especially solar, really quickly.‚Äù

	Thanks to the fact China's government under President Xi Jinping has near total control over the country's economy, it can basically move in whatever direction he wants it to, and he's betting big on the future of renewable energy. He has made it clear he wants China to dominate in this space for years to come. 


	‚ÄúThat's the thing about authoritarian governments. If they decide to do something and they really put their mind to it, they can turn much quicker than less authoritarian governments are used to,‚Äù says Catherine Wolfram, a professor of energy and applied economics at MIT. ‚ÄúChina has pretty clearly decided that that's where the world is going and has invested heavily in electric vehicles.‚Äù


	The Chinese car company BYD has been getting a lot of attention lately, because it's producing attractive EVs and hybrids that are affordable, dependable, and stylish. The company has over twice the global market share of Tesla, and it is quickly gaining traction in Europe ‚Äî but it likely won't be selling cars in the U.S. anytime soon.


	‚ÄúThey are aggressive competitors, especially for lower cost vehicles. It's incredible what they've done,‚Äù Victor says. ‚ÄúEurope and America have had two very different strategies. The European strategy has been to allow them in, but to kind of keep an eye on it, and then boom, they've come. ‚Ä¶ The U.S. strategy has been that almost no Chinese EVs are sold in the United States.‚Äù

	China's success can be seen as good news if you care about the world transitioning to clean energy. It's not such good news if you care about the U.S. remaining economically competitive on the world stage in the future. While other industrialized nations are making progress in building the markets of the future, the U.S. is slowing its pace and forcing reliance on antiquated fossil fuel technology. 

	











	‚ÄúIf we slow down, we're not walking away from renewables. The fundamentals are still there,‚Äù Victor says. ‚ÄúThe overall effect of it is we're going to just deploy fewer renewables.‚Äù 


	The U.S. isn't completely giving up on clean energy. It's integrated into the economy, and many American clean energy companies are doing well. However, at a time when the renewable energy sector is moving quickly and large sums of money are being invested, the U.S. is essentially ceding the space to other world powers. While China is investing billions, the Trump administration is withdrawing billions of dollars of federal funding from renewable energy projects around the country.


	If the U.S. decides to shift gears in the not-too-distant future and wants to increase its share of the renewable energy market, it may want to cooperate with China to some degree, rather than just trying to beat it. Wolfram says she thinks that could actually become a beneficial relationship.

	‚ÄúOutright competition might not be in the best interest of the U.S., because we are so far behind,‚Äù Wolfram says. ‚ÄúMaybe some kind of joint ventures or more cooperative approaches will make sense in the future. The U.S. is really good at innovating. We can work together.‚Äù


	Whether that ends up being the right move, the Trump administration is clearly putting the country in a position where it will have to play catch up in the future. Furthermore, considering the U.S. is one of the largest climate polluters in the world, it's actively making the fight against climate change substantially more difficult for the rest of the world. Trump reminded everyone in his address at the UN on Tuesday that as long as he's in charge, the U.S. will remain a disruptive force.

	Attorneys representing two groups of Disney shareholders are demanding records related to the company's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel under pressure from the Trump administration. 


	As Variety notes, the letters were sent to Disney CEO Bob Iger on behalf of the American Federation of Teachers (which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO) and the nonprofit Reporters Without Borders. It says the records request is ‚Äúto investigate potential wrongdoing, mismanagement, and breaches of fiduciary duty‚Äù by the Disney board, executives, or others connected with the decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live!.


	‚ÄúThere is a credible basis to suspect that the Board and executives may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and good faith by placing improper political or affiliate considerations above the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,‚Äù the letter reads. 


	While the AFT's and RWB's attorneys did write that the groups were ‚Äúpleased‚Äù that ABC ‚Äúdid the right thing and put Jimmy Kimmel back on the air,‚Äù they noted that Disney's ‚Äústock suffered significant declines‚Äù following the original decision. The letter also expressed concern over Trump's continued attacks on free speech, including his threat to sue ABC following Kimmel's return.

	‚ÄúThe fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech, triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney's stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship,‚Äù the letter read. ‚ÄúAnd the negative repercussions on Disney and its stockholders remain, given that, following the announcement that the show would be returning to the air, Donald Trump issued a new threat on his social media platform, Truth Social, stating on September 23, 2025, that ‚ÄòI think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do.'‚Äù

	











	The AFT and RWB are demanding the records be sent to them within five days of the letter (which is dated Sept. 24). Pending review of the documents, the two groups could file a derivative lawsuit, which allows shareholders to act on behalf of a company and sue the corporation's own directors and officers, as well as other third parties who may have harmed the company.

Controversy by Covering Brendan Carr in Cat Litter","https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/south-park-kimmel-controversy-brendan-carr-1235435269/","Thu, 25 Sep 2025 15:09:13 GMT","

	As if Jimmy Kimmel's return to late-night wasn't enough, South Park put FCC chair Brendan Carr through a grueling gauntlet of slapstick pain in its latest episode, Wednesday, Sept. 24. 


	The episode isn't a direct commentary on how the Trump administration pressured ABC and affiliate owners to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live!, though Trey Parker and Matt Stone made their views on the matter evident enough. Carr is part of an episode subplot involving Donald Trump's efforts to get rid of his unborn butt baby with Satan, but all the zany schemes the president concocts keep befalling the hapless FCC chair instead.


	These include: Slipping down a greased flight of stairs, eating a stew laced with Plan B, and finally, getting covered in dirty cat litter and infected with toxoplasmosis. The last trap puts Carr in the hospital, where a doctor quips about his condition: ‚ÄúHis bones are healing, so he may regain full range of motion. But if the toxoplasmosis parasite gets to his brain, I'm afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.‚Äù

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a more direct nod to the Kimmel controversy, J.D. Vance shows up at the hospital, delighted that Carr is in critical condition and thus unable to challenge the VP for the presidency. Vance even threatens Carr with the same words the FCC chair used on a podcast when revealing his desire to get Kimmel booted over a joke he made about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk: ‚ÄúWe can do this the easy way or the hard way.‚Äù

	Last night's South Park aired a week later than expected, after Parker and Stone admitted they were unable to get the episode ‚Äúdone in time.‚Äù The show's blockbuster 27th season has been airing every other week, as opposed to weekly, to ostensibly give the pair and their staff more time to craft episodes in response to current events. (Case in point: The Carr plot was almost certainly added after last week's episode was delayed, as Stone and Parker announced the postponement the same day, Sept. 17, ABC suspended Kimmel.)


South Park will air five more episodes this year, with the tentative schedule set as: Oct. 15, Oct. 29, Nov. 12, Nov. 26, and Dec. 10.

Pay or banish, there's always a cost to success!



Ôªø

Welcome back for today's CDP, and this time I am returning to the Teleport Psychic strategy while leveraging a Myutant core! The Myutant archetype is best known for its small Psychic monsters that tribute themselves and banish a card to Special Summon out a Level 8 Myutant, but today I'm only using Myutant Beast as an option for that. Instead, I am leveraging the Myutant engine to extend plays, especially through interruption, due to Myutant Fusion's option to use material in the Deck/GY as material if the opponent activates a card or effect. If they don't, you can always lean on Myutant Cry to Fusion Summon during the opponent's turn and destroy a card with Myutant Synthesis! Now that we've covered the Myutant core, let's talk about how this helps the Teleport Psychic strategy. If you happen to banish Myutant ST-46 from the deck earlier in the turn with Myutant Mutant, when you Synchro Summon Silent Psychic Magician, this allows you to get back your ST-46, tutor a Myutant S/T, then continue making further Synchro Summons such as Crossmind Archfiend or Psychic Blaster MK-II. 

Aside from Myutant plays, Serene Psychic Girl is probably the most important monster for this strategy, banishing a card from hand to Special Summon a Psychic from the deck on summon. Ideally, this is used to summon Mind Procedure to get a Teleport Quick-Play Spell search, but it essential to the deck mainly because it is a highly flexible Tuner. You see, it can increase the levels of any number of monsters on the field by 1, allowing you to access just about any Psychic Synchro. This is particularly helpful when you factor in the new Psychic Synchro from DOOD ‚Äì Serene Psychic Sorceress, as it sets a Teleport Spell when Synchro Summoned. Ideally you will be setting Teleport Fusion, as that will allow you to go into either Absolute Axon Kicker or Axon Kicker Oracle during the opponents turn, either banishing all face-up cards they control or letting you negate a Special Summon.

The last engine at play today is the PSY-Frame, obviously led by PSY-Framelord Lambda. This deck frequently has additional material left on board to make this Link Summon, so when you do, all you need is to banish a Psychic monster to get access to PSY-Framegear Delta or PSY-Framegear Gamma to interrupt the opponent during their turn. You don't even have to worry that much about PSY-Frame Driver being banished, since you have multiple ways to recover monsters from your banishment! At the end of the day, that's what this deck is all about ‚Äì leveraging your LP as a resource to win the grind game, and that's especially relevant now that we have with the new time rules for the TCG!

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) ‚Äî Republican Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's top public schools official who lauded President Donald Trump, pledged to put a Turning Point USA chapter in every high school to honor Charlie Kirk and end what he called ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù in public schools, is resigning to lead a conservative educators' group.

Walters, 40, said Wednesday night on Fox News that he is stepping down as state superintendent of public instruction to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a nonprofit that says it assists educators ‚Äúin their mission to develop free, moral, and upright American citizens.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're going to destroy the teachers unions,‚Äù Walters said on Fox. ‚ÄúWe have seen the teachers unions use money and power to corrupt our schools, to undermine our schools.‚Äù

Walters has leaned into culture-war politics and sought to infuse religion into classroom instruction, including a mandate that public schoolteachers incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for children in grades 5 though 12.

He has also tried to require social studies teachers to promote conspiracies about the 2020 election, track the immigration status of children in schools and require applicants for teacher jobs coming from California and New York to pass an exam designed to safeguard what he described as ‚Äúradical leftist ideology.‚Äù Many of his efforts have led to lawsuits against him and the agency, even as Oklahoma's national ranking in several education metrics has continued to decline.

Just Tuesday, Walters announced that Oklahoma high schools will have Turning Point USA chapters. He said parents, teachers and students ‚Äúwant their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values.‚Äù

‚ñ∂ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

Kirk founded the organization to mobilize young, Christian conservatives. It has seen a massive surge in interest and support since the activist's assassination on Sept. 10.




Walters, a former teacher, was elected to the superintendent's job. He had served as Oklahoma Secretary of Education from September 2020 to April 2023. He was appointed to that position by Gov. Kevin Stitt. 

Ever since then, ‚Äúwe have witnessed a stream of never-ending scandal and political drama,‚Äù Oklahoma Attorney General Genter Drummond said in a statement. 

‚ÄúIt's time for a State Superintendent of Public Instruction who will actually focus on quality instruction in our public schools,‚Äù Drummond, a Republican and candidate for governor in 2026, said.

New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli opens up about his campaign on 'Hannity.'

New Jersey gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Mikie Sherrill was blocked from walking with her graduating class at the US Naval Academy after being caught up in a massive cheating scandal, a bombshell report revealed.

Sherrill's name was not included on the commencement program during the May 25, 1994, ceremony, according to records obtained by the New Jersey Globe.

The congresswoman said she was barred from walking because she declined to rat out classmates who were involved in the scandal that impacted 130 midshipmen in her class.

""I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor,"" Sherrill (D-NJ) told the outlet.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the ramifications of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Capitol Hill hearing about his MAHA agenda on ‚ÄòAmerica's Newsroom.'

A congresswoman from Michigan announced Thursday that she will introduce articles of impeachment against Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing the ""health care chaos"" and rising costs during his tenure.

Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., has repeatedly called for Kennedy's removal, most recently citing funding cuts for cancer research, infant death syndrome and combating addiction, as well as increased health care costs.

Kennedy's restriction of vaccine access is another issue, as well as him spreading of ""absurd conspiracies"" that have put people's lives in danger, Stevens said.

""RFK Jr. is making our country less safe and making health care less affordable and accessible for Michiganders,"" Stevens said in a statement. ""His contempt for science, the constant spreading of conspiracy theories, and his complete disregard for the thousands of research hours spent by America's top doctors and experts are unprecedented, reckless, and dangerous.

""Enough is enough ‚Äî we need leaders who put science over chaos, facts over lies, and people over politics, which is why I am announcing today that I have begun drafting articles of impeachment against Secretary Kennedy.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said Kennedy ""remains focused on the work of improving Americans' health and lowering costs, not on partisan political stunts.""

Stevens also accused Kennedy of lying during his confirmation hearings about the promises he made that had not come to fruition. Chief among them is Kennedy's promise not to break up the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine panel of independent experts.

Stevens alleged Kennedy had failed to carry out the statutory duties of HHS in administering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC.

The congresswoman also said Kennedy has politicized the FDA and ended public comment for HHS rulemaking.

Stevens is one of several Democrats calling for Kennedy to step down. The secretary most recently faced scrutiny over his firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.

Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on Thursday argued that the Supreme Court should reject President Donald Trump's request that he be allowed to fire her pending the outcome of her lawsuit challenging her removal.

""The President's stay application asks this Court to act on an emergency basis to eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board,"" Cook's lawyers wrote in a new filing with the Supreme Court.

Trump has asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders that block him from firing Cook while her suit plays out.

The president said in late August that he was firing her because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud. She denies those claims.

Earlier Thursday, a group that included every living former Federal Reserve chair, along with a number of former Treasury secretaries and former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers urged the Supreme Court to deny Trump's request to fire Cook for now.

The Supreme Court could at any time rule on Trump's request.

If the high court allows Trump to remove her, it would leave the door open for her to be reinstated once the justices rule on the merits of her lawsuit.

The key question in Cook's case is whether Trump has legal cause as required by the Federal Reserve Act to fire her.

In their filing Thursday, Cook's lawyers said that Trump was citing ""flimsy, unproven allegations of pre-office wrongdoing ‚Äî allegations conveniently timed following the President's criticisms of the Board's policy decisions.""

Trump had complained for months that the Fed's board was not cutting interest rates as he wanted. The Fed last week lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point, with Cook participating in that decision.

""This Court should deny the President's extraordinary application because his arguments defy established precedent and longstanding practice,"" Cook's lawyers said in their filing.

""This litigation has barely begun, and further factfinding could avoid the need for this Court to decide the high-stakes legal issues raised in the President's application,"" her lawyers wrote. ""On the merits, this Court is likely to reject each of the President's legal theories. Specifically, the Court is likely to hold that because Governor Cook is removable only for cause, she is entitled to notice, opportunity for a hearing, and judicial review before she is removed.""

The lawyers wrote that the Supreme Court is ""likely"" to ultimately ruled that the ""for cause"" standard provided by the Federal Reserve Act is meaningful protection for a Fed governor, ""and is not satisfied by manufactured charges based on conduct that pre-dates her service on the Board.""

The gunman who killed one detainee and wounded two others at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas was trying to target ICE personnel and appeared to be planning his attack for months, authorities said Thursday.

The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn of Texas, ""specifically intended to kill ICE agents"" in Wednesday's ambush, said Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, at a news conference.

Rothrock said Jahn obtained a bolt-action rifle in August, suggesting his plans began ""months in advance.""

The strongest evidence of motive came from Jahn's own words in a collection of notes found when FBI agents searched the shooter's residence after the attack, Rothrock said.

Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said that Jahn described ICE employees as ""people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck"" in one of those notes.

The notes also included a plan of attack and target areas, and they indicated that he did not want to kill or harm detainees.

Jahn also explicitly states in the notes, ""Yes, it was just me,"" Larson said. Authorities said they believe the shooter acted alone, though the investigation is ongoing.

Jahn's actions are ""the very definition of terrorism,"" Larson said.

The news conference came hours after FBI Director Kash Patel said in an X post that Jahn had searched online for ""Charlie Kirk Shot Video"" as recently as the day of the attack.

Jahn also recently searched apps tracking the presence of ICE agents and downloaded a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said in the post.

Patel said agents recovered a handwritten note reading, ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'""

Those details and other accumulated evidence indicate ""a high degree of pre-attack planning"" by Jahn, Patel said.

Authorities said Jahn fired ""indiscriminately"" at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop on Wednesday.

He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound following the attack.

The two wounded ICE detainees remained in critical condition on Thursday, an agency spokesperson told NBC News. No ICE agents were wounded in the attack.

The shooter's search for video of the shooting of Kirk, the conservative activist who was assassinated during a crowded event in Utah earlier this month, could add to the evidence about his motive for the attack.

The FBI has already revealed that unspent shell casings found near the shooter bore ""anti-ICE"" messaging.

Jahn's brother, Noah Jahn, told NBC he was surprised by the political messaging.

""I didn't think he was politically interested,"" Noah Jahn said of his brother. ""He wasn't interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.""

Joshua Jahn was registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, NBC reported. He has also been linked to addresses in Texas.

ICE said in a statement Wednesday evening that the shooter opened fire on the building and at a transport van located at the facility's sallyport.

All three detainees were shot while inside that van.

There were five to seven others in the van who avoided the bullet spray, an ICE official told NBC. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told NBC's Tom Llamas that his agents pulled some of those detainees out of the line of fire.

""The shooter was just shooting at random vehicles inside,"" Lyons said. ""There were some brave men and women on the ground that went into those vans, were pulling those detainees out while they're under fire.""

Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said that because of the Dallas attack and other incidents, ""DHS will immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country.""

Migrant check-in appointments at the Dallas ICE facility scheduled for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have all been postponed until Monday.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped below $110,000 during Thursday's trading session. Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferr√© joins Market Domination host Josh Lipton to explain the cryptocurrency's movements.

Bitcoin slipping below 110,000 in Thursday's trade amid a broader sell off in crypto and stocks. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joins us now with more. Ines. 

Josh, heavy liquidations have been weighing on the crypto market. More than 1.6 billion in long positions were wiped out earlier this week. That's followed by another 500 million over the past 24 hours. 

That's forced selling consisting of leveraged trades. So liquidations have been really amplifying the pullback that we've seen, the rollover that we've seen with cryptocurrencies. Right now we're looking at Bitcoin down more than 3%. 

Eth down more than five, Ripple down more than five, but I just want to pull up that's five-day chart, those liquidations I was talking about. and take a look, Eth down 11% over the last five days, Binance down more than 8%. So you are seeing Solana down 15% over the last five sessions. So altcoins taking it on the chin even more so than Bitcoin. 

Uh, but remember that September tends to be a seasonally weak month for crypto. There is also another headwind that crypto bulls have been pointing to, and it has to do with liquidity. This is money that's sloshing around. 

So the Treasury General account, not to get too wonky here, basically the checking account of the government, has been getting filled up over the last several weeks. So through the issuance of T- bills and bonds, that soaks up liquidity and that fill up diverts cash from other assets like crypto. So that's putting pressure on these crypto uh assets. 

But uh that headwind though should be subsiding as the TGA is just about uh filled up. The next three months, the strategists say, tend to be bullish for Bitcoin. ","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Stablecoin blockchain Plasma launched its mainnet in beta on Thursday, with its native XPL token going live alongside it. 

Investors who bought into Plasma's massive initial coin offering, or ICO, earlier this year are up massively. And Plasma confirmed to Decrypt that every single participant in Plasma's pre-deposit ICO scheme has been sent $8,390 worth of XPL‚Äîeven if they didn't actually buy tokens via the ICO.

Plasma's XPL token peaked at $1.54 a piece shortly after its debut before dropping to $0.91 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. That puts Plasma's native staking token at a $8.6 billion fully diluted valuation, which is a 17.3x jump from the $500 million valuation at which the ICO was raised.

XPL is currently the 89th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $1.59 billion.

‚ÄúThis is the culmination of our team putting everything they had into making Plasma the perfect home for Money 2.0. The launch of our mainnet is just the beginning,‚Äù Paul Faecks, CEO and Founder, said on X.

Plasma is a layer-1 blockchain built with stablecoin optimizations at the forefront of the project. It uses the XPL token to power its staking-based consensus mechanism. Plasma has attracted funding from the likes of Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, with the pair also serving as advisors to the project.

The project caught headlines in June after it attracted $1 billion worth of pre-deposits ahead of its initial coin offering. Participants were allocated a portion of the tokens they could purchase based on how much they pre-deposited and for how long. 

Plasma later sold 10% of its 10 billion token supply at a $500 million fully diluted valuation to those who had locked up their funds in the pre-deposit wallet. The initial coin offering was conducted at the same valuation as its previous strategic funding round.

Stablecoin Titan Tether Seeks $500 Billion Valuation on $20 Billion Raise: Report

Plasma told Decrypt that half of the ICO participants had claimed their tokens within three hours of hitting mainnet beta. 

ICO depositors who received the unexpected bonus have taken to social media to flaunt the additional $8,390 of XPL that Plasma gifted them. For note, Plasma allocated 25 million tokens, worth approximately $25.5 million at its current price, to be evenly divided among all pre-depositors‚Äîmeaning those who deposited $1 or $10,000 got the same bonus.

‚ÄúThe team at Plasma is making sure their small supporters eat,‚Äù one X user wrote. ‚ÄúFOMO is about to hit HARD,‚Äù another said on X.

Plasma's mainnet beta and token debut come the same week that it announced Plasma One, a stablecoin-native neobank it plans to roll out. The neobank's card will use the Plasma blockchain as its payment rails, and claims to offer 4% cashback on spending.

Company leadership has described Thursday's launch as the first step forward, with many more to come.

‚ÄúThis is just the start,‚Äù Faecks told Decrypt. ‚ÄúNext is iterating at the chain level to make Plasma more optimized for stablecoin payments and shipping the best products that get stablecoins into the hands of everyone, everywhere.‚Äù

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Kurt Schlosser on Sep 25, 2025 at 8:58 amSeptember 25, 2025 at 11:32 am

Starbucks closed its flagship Reserve Roastery in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, nearly 11 years after the location opened as an especially technical and geeky ode to the coffee-making process.

Windows at the large facility at 1124 Pike St. were already boarded up on Thursday morning, following news of the Seattle-based coffee giant's major restructuring, announced by CEO Brian Niccol in a blog post. The company plans to lay off approximately 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Starbucks is also closing the Reserve store at the base of its corporate headquarters building south of downtown Seattle.

The $20 million Roastery, housed in a 1920s-era building which was once home to an auto showroom, opened in December 2014, just minutes from Starbucks HQ. Then-CEO Howard Schultz referred to it at the time as the ‚ÄúWilly Wonka of coffee.‚Äù

GeekWire toured the facility just before it opened to see how Starbucks planned to give customers a better understanding of the roasting process. For a city and a company steeped in coffee tradition and appreciation, the Reserve was a chance to experiment. Drinks at the mixology bar were created via processes such as Clover, pour-over, coffee press, Chemex, siphon or cold brew.

Technology was packed into the space, from sensors that prevented cross contamination of coffee beans to a 4K projector that showed footage of Starbucks' coffee farms on a smart glass window display. The two roasters were programmed to heat different types of beans at optimal amounts of time and temperature to ensure peak aroma, acidity, body, and flavor.

A company sign posted at the location on Thursday, captured by KIRO7, was addressed to ‚ÄúCap Hill neighbors and friends‚Äù and called the Reserve a ‚Äúdestination of coffee lovers from down the block and around the world.‚Äù

Workers at the Roastery voted to unionize in April 2022.

Niccol, who joined Starbucks after six years in the top job at Chipotle, has been charged with turning around the struggling company, which is dealing with slumping sales and criticism over everything from its complicated menu to wait times, prices, and more.

In his post Thursday, Niccol said Starbucks will end fiscal year 2025 with nearly 18,300 total Starbucks locations ‚Äì company operated and licensed. He said non-retail employees whose roles are being eliminated will be notified on Friday morning.

Starbucks has previously leaned heavily into its technology as a competitive advantage. It was early to mobile ordering, but this summer announced it was sunsetting smaller-format tech-driven pickup only stores. Niccol called them ‚Äúoverly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.‚Äù

Starbucks cut 1,100 corporate workers in February in one of the largest layoffs ever at the company.

                reading time 4 minutes
      

South Park returned with a new episode on Wednesday, focused on online betting, Israel's war on Gaza, and President Donald Trump's attempts to abort a baby that's due after he impregnated Satan. But FCC Chairman Brendan Carr seemed to take the most abuse during the episode, something that was to be expected after Carr tried to get Jimmy Kimmel Live! removed from ABC. Spoilers ahead.

South Park unexpectedly failed to deliver a new episode last week following the death of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk. And while creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone said it was due to their own procrastination, there was speculation that it may have had something to do with Kirk's death. South Park did an episode mocking Kirk's style of debate on Aug. 6, a month before he was killed on Sept. 10, and that episode has been pulled from the rerun schedule.

But the comedy show didn't address Kirk at all on Wednesday, even if it touched on some of the downstream effects of his murder. The episode put Brendan Carr, this month's great villain against free speech, through the ringer as he takes a tumble down some slippery stairs, explosively shits his pants, and is eventually hospitalized while making a Nazi salute.

The episode opens with the boys learning about prediction markets like Polymarket and how to make bets online. One of the bets available is whether Kyle's mom will strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital, something that enrages Kyle, who objects to the anti-semitism inherent in the idea and tries to contact someone to get the bet taken down. Kyle tries to complain to the betting company, run by Donald Trump Jr., before he's directed to a series of different agencies, also overseen by Donald Trump Jr.

Eventually, Kyle is told he needs to get in touch with the FCC, since the bet is ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù and the federal communications regulator apparently handles anything offensive these days. Meanwhile, Cartman realizes he can work all of Kyle's outrage to his advantage, getting people to bet that Kyle's mom will indeed order a strike on Gaza, while Cartman bets against it.

Trump, who's largely been the focus of Season 27's short five-episode run thus far, works hard to get Satan to have a miscarriage, spiking soup with an absurd amount of Plan B. Satan doesn't want the soup, but Carr dives in, getting diarrhea so explosive that he zooms around the room before crashing out the window into the sky.

JD Vance returned as a character from the 1970s TV show Fantasy Island, seemingly sycophantic and trying to suggest gifts that President Trump can give to Satan's child. Vance warns that one gift, a kitten, can be toxic for pregnant people, given that toxoplasmosis can cause miscarriages. This, of course, gives Trump the idea to outfit the White House attic with a bunch of cats and kitty litter, which can be released by a trap door onto Satan. Assuming Trump can get Satan to stand in the right place. Again, the FCC chair bears the brunt of Trump's scheming, getting buried underneath the mountain of kitty litter and cat shit.

Cartman panics when he learns that Kyle's mom is heading to the Middle East, worried that she may actually hit Gaza and his bet will be ruined. But Kyle's mom didn't travel to Israel to enact violence, just give Benjamin Netanyahu a piece of her mind.

Brendan Carr, battered and bruised, is visited by Vance in the hospital, where the vice president reveals himself to be more than just Trump's lackey. Vance knows exactly what he's doing by trying to get Satan to have a miscarriage. Because he knows that if Trump and Satan were to have a baby, it would be competition during Vance's ascendancy to the presidency.

Viewers never learn what happens to Carr, but it seems like a safe bet that he'll return in future episodes. And that's consistent with his current trajectory in real life. The FCC chairman successfully campaigned to get Jimmy Kimmel pulled from the airwaves, but that was short-lived. Kimmel returned on Tuesday, and the New York Times reports that he's still going to exert maximum pressure to get liberal voices purged from the airwaves.

President Trump, who also got Stephen Colbert cancelled, dropped the pretense Tuesday that the ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù around Kimmel had anything to do with Charlie Kirk's death.

‚ÄúI can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!‚Äù Trump posted on Truth Social.

‚ÄúSomething happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‚Äòtalent' was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE,‚Äù Trump continued.

Then Trump made it clear that he's never going to stop.

‚ÄúHe is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution,‚Äù Trump wrote about Kimmel. ‚ÄúI think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.‚Äù

On paper, South Park has been safe from cancellation, if only because Carr and the FCC only regulate the major broadcast stations, not cable. But Trump can apply pressure to private businesses in any number of ways. Disney is reportedly preparing for just that in the wake of Kimmel's return.

A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his primary care provider for a routine physical exam. His medications are metoprolol and lisinopril. His blood pressure is noted to be 170/100 mm Hg, and an ECG is obtained.

The correct diagnosis is sinus rhythm with isorhythmic dissociation (Figure 2).

The rhythm is regular at a rate of 95 beats/min. The QRS complex has a normal duration (0.08 sec) and morphology, with an axis between 0¬∞ and +90¬∞ (positive QRS complex in leads I and aVF). 

There is diffuse T-wave flattening, making it difficult to establish the QT/QTc intervals. P waves occur before each QRS complex (+), but the PR intervals are variable, not constant. This indicates atrioventricular (AV) dissociation. 

There are two etiologies for AV dissociation. The first is complete AV (heart) block or third-degree AV block. In this situation, the atrial rate is faster than the rate of the QRS complexes, which represent an escape rhythm. The escape rhythm may be junctional or ventricular based on the morphology of the QRS complexes ‚Äî not the rate of the escape rhythm. 

The second etiology is an accelerated lower pacemaker, which may be either junctional or ventricular (based on the QRS complex morphology, not the rate). In this situation, the atrial rate is slower than the rate of the QRS complexes. 

This ECG shows an atrial rate (‚îî‚îò) identical to the rate of the QRS complexes (‚îå‚îê). This is termed isorhythmic dissociation. It cannot be established whether this is complete heart block or an accelerated rhythm.

Philip Podrid, MD, is an electrophysiologist, a professor of medicine and pharmacology at Boston University School of Medicine, and a lecturer in medicine at Harvard Medical School. Although retired from clinical practice, he continues to teach clinical cardiology and especially ECGs to medical students, house staff, and cardiology fellows at many major teaching hospitals in Massachusetts.

They drop one spot after the September window.

The United States Men's National Team continue to take a dip in the rankings. Last week, the FIFA world rankings were updated for September, and the USMNT fell one spot to 16th in the world.

The drop in the rankings came after the USMNT lost to South Korea (remained at 23rd and beat Japan (who dropped 2 spots to 19th in friendlies during the September international window. The United States continue to be the second-highest ranked team in Concacaf, with archrivals Mexico falling a spot to 14th.

Spain is the new #1 in the world, moving up a place in the September rankings. They're joined in the top 10 by France (+1 spot), Argentina (-2), England, Portugal (+1), Brazil (-1), the Netherlands, Belgium, Croatia (+1), and Italy (+1). Within Concacaf, Canada moved up to 26th, while Panama rose to 29th in the world. Costa Rica, on the other hand, fell 7 spots to 47th in the world. The world rankings will help determine which pot qualified teams are placed in for the World Cup draw on December 5th, so teams will do what they can to move up in the rankings and potentially avoid some difficult matchups when the groups are formed.

USMNT have lined up some solid friendlies to close out 2025. In October, they will host friendlies against Ecuador (24th) and Australia (25th), and they will take on Paraguay (37th) and Uruguay (15th) in November. It has also been reported that U.S. Soccer is in talks with Portugal (5th) and Belgium (8th) to play friendlies in March, the last full window before the World Cup roster is named. The USMNT would love to reverse their trend and move up in the rankings by finishing out the year with some solid performances.

...

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it will work to keep Israel from being banned from the 2026 men's World Cup.

Israel's participation in global soccer has been questioned in the past week, with the United Nations calling on FIFA and UEFA, the respective governing bodies of world and European soccer, to suspend the nation from their competitions.

A State Department spokesperson told The Athletic: ‚ÄúWe will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup.‚Äù

Israel's national and club teams have continued to participate in FIFA and UEFA competitions throughout the conflict in Gaza, which began with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. Israel is in the middle of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign and is third in its group of five as it bids to reach next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The draw for the World Cup will be made in Washington D.C. on Dec. 5.

It is unclear if U.S. officials have already pressured UEFA or FIFA to not ban Israel. When asked by The Athletic to clarify, the State Department spokesperson declined to comment further.

The UN's statement on Tuesday called for the suspension of Israel from international competition due to what it described as an ‚Äúunfolding genocide‚Äù in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.

UEFA competition matches have not taken place in Israel since the 2023 attacks, in which 1,100 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.

More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza following Israel's ground invasion, according to local health officials.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed on Sunday that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood ‚Äî a move with which President Trump said he disagreed. France announced its recognition of the state of Palestine on Monday.

On Tuesday, four members of the United Nations human rights council ‚Äî independent human rights experts who are not employed by the UN or any government  ‚Äî called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer in response to the conflict in Gaza.

The human rights experts released their statement following an investigation into alleged violations of humanitarian and human rights law during the Israel-Gaza war. The UN's commission of inquiry concluded that ‚Äúthe Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip‚Äù ‚Äî crimes under international law.

Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC earlier this month that it rejected the report and described it as ‚Äúdistorted and false.‚Äù

The report was published on Sept. 16 and the human rights experts released a statement on Tuesday, arguing that ‚Äúsporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are clear that the boycott must be addressed to the State of Israel and not to individual players,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe have always maintained that individuals cannot bear the consequences of the decisions their government makes, so there should be no discrimination or sanctions against individual players because of their origin or nationality.

‚ÄúNational teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can and should be suspended, as has happened in the past (Russia is currently banned from global soccer due to the ongoing war in Ukraine).

‚ÄúWe urge FIFA to stop legitimising the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. There is a legal and moral imperative to take every measure possible to end the genocide in Gaza now.‚Äù

When approached by The Athletic regarding the UN's statement on Wednesday, FIFA and UEFA declined to comment.

In April 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) asked FIFA to suspend Israel from competition in a submission made before FIFA's 74th annual congress.

PFA president Jibril Rajoub spoke at the congress, calling on FIFA ‚Äúto stand on the right side of history‚Äù and asking whether FIFA considers ‚Äúsome wars to be more important than others and some victims to be more significant.‚Äù An Israel Football Association (IFA) spokesperson had described the attempt to suspend the country as ‚Äúnothing but a cynical and shameless move.‚Äù

FIFA did not suspend Israel but opened two investigations into alleged breaches of its statutes by Israeli football teams and authorities. The first was into whether teams from Israeli settlements in the West Bank competing in national Israeli competitions represent a breach of the FIFA statutes, and the second investigated allegations of discrimination by the IFA. The PFA has accused FIFA of failing to provide ‚Äúclarity or due process‚Äù with as yet no conclusion to the investigations.

The PFA again called for Israel's suspension at the 75th FIFA Congress in May. ‚ÄúOur issue, sadly again, is stuck in a highly politicized bureaucratic holding pattern,‚Äù said Susan Shalabi, vice president of the PFA.

In September, an IFA spokesperson said he was surprised Israel had yet to be suspended from international football.

‚ÄúI'm surprised we're still part of international tournaments. In many aspects, this is a miracle,‚Äù Shlomi Barzel, head of the IFA's public relations department, told Israeli newspaper The Globes. ‚ÄúThe miracle can be explained by action on our part and a lot of tolerance on the part of FIFA and UEFA, but historically countries have been suspended for much less than that.‚Äù

Israel has been a member of the European confederation UEFA since 1994.

Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and won the 1964 Asian Cup. They were later excluded from AFC competitions in 1974 following a vote after a number of teams refused to play against them.

Israel now participates in the European section for qualification to the World Cup. While it has never qualified for the European Championship ‚Äî the continental competition UEFA runs every four years ‚Äî it reached the play-offs for Euro 2020 and Euro 2024.

Domestic Israeli teams also participate in UEFA club competitions, with Maccabi Tel Aviv competing in the league phase of this season's Europa League.

UEFA confirmed in October 2024 that no matches would take place in Israel ‚Äúuntil further notice‚Äù in response to the Israel-Gaza war. The national team and club sides have played ‚Äúhome‚Äù UEFA competition fixtures elsewhere, including in Hungary, Cyprus and Poland.

UEFA's 55 member associations are meeting today (Thursday) at a regular gathering, although the issue of Israel's participation is not on the agenda. UEFA's next meeting of its 20-strong executive committee, the organisation's main decision-making body, is scheduled for Dec. 3, but president Aleksander Ceferin could call one sooner than that. Slovenia, where Ceferin is from, issued sanctions against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.

Israel is due to play Norway and Italy away in World Cup qualifiers next month. Norway has already said it will donate the proceeds from the game to the Doctors Without Borders charity working in Gaza.

Comparisons have been made between the situations of Russia and Israel, with former Manchester United player and France international Eric Cantona calling it ‚Äúa double standard‚Äù for Israel to remain a part of international soccer, via The Telegraph.

After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, FIFA suspended it from competing in international matches on Feb. 28.

Russia's men's team had been due to play Poland in a World Cup play-off in March 2022, with the winner scheduled to face either Sweden or Czech Republic. All three teams had said they would refuse to play against a Russian side. It was later confirmed that Russia would not participate in the women's European Championship in 2022.

Russian clubs were also suspended from European competition by UEFA.

UEFA and FIFA had announced plans in September 2023 to allow Russia's under-17 teams to participate in their competitions. However, UEFA backtracked in October.

Should Israel be banned by FIFA and UEFA, this would prevent the national team from competing in competitions organised by the two governing bodies.

At international level, this would cover the World Cup, with the 2026 men's iteration taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Israel is in a qualification group alongside Norway, Italy, Estonia and Moldova, and has played five of eight qualifying matches. Israel sits third, level on points with Italy. The top team from each UEFA group qualifies automatically for the World Cup, while the second-place team advances to a playoff round.

The ban would also include the women's World Cup ‚Äî a competition Israel has never qualified for. The European qualifying draw for the 2027 World Cup takes place in November.

A ban would also include UEFA international competitions: the men's and women's European Championships and Nations Leagues.

At club level, this would cover the men's and women's Champions League, the Europa League and Conference League. Maccabi Tel Aviv is the only Israeli team competing across the three competitions this season. Maccabi Tel Aviv is in the Europa League and is scheduled to play GNK Dinamo, Midtjylland, Aston Villa, Lyon, Stuttgart, Freiburg and Bologna during the league phase.

World Cup

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it will work to keep Israel from being banned from the 2026 men's World Cup.

Israel's participation in global soccer has been questioned in the past week, with the United Nations calling on FIFA and UEFA, the respective governing bodies of world and European soccer, to suspend the nation from their competitions.

A State Department spokesperson told The Athletic: ‚ÄúWe will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup.‚Äù

Israel's national and club teams have continued to participate in FIFA and UEFA competitions throughout the conflict in Gaza, which began with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. Israel is in the middle of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign and is third in its group of five as it bids to reach next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The draw for the World Cup will be made in Washington D.C. on Dec. 5.

It is unclear if U.S. officials have already pressured UEFA or FIFA to not ban Israel. When asked by The Athletic to clarify, the State Department spokesperson declined to comment further.

The UN's statement on Tuesday called for the suspension of Israel from international competition due to what it described as an ‚Äúunfolding genocide‚Äù in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.

UEFA competition matches have not taken place in Israel since the 2023 attacks, in which 1,100 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.

More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza following Israel's ground invasion, according to local health officials.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed on Sunday that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood ‚Äî a move with which President Trump said he disagreed. France announced its recognition of the state of Palestine on Monday.

On Tuesday, four members of the United Nations human rights council ‚Äî independent human rights experts who are not employed by the UN or any government  ‚Äî called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer in response to the conflict in Gaza.

The human rights experts released their statement following an investigation into alleged violations of humanitarian and human rights law during the Israel-Gaza war. The UN's commission of inquiry concluded that ‚Äúthe Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip‚Äù ‚Äî crimes under international law.

Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC earlier this month that it rejected the report and described it as ‚Äúdistorted and false.‚Äù

The report was published on Sept. 16 and the human rights experts released a statement on Tuesday, arguing that ‚Äúsporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are clear that the boycott must be addressed to the State of Israel and not to individual players,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe have always maintained that individuals cannot bear the consequences of the decisions their government makes, so there should be no discrimination or sanctions against individual players because of their origin or nationality.

‚ÄúNational teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can and should be suspended, as has happened in the past (Russia is currently banned from global soccer due to the ongoing war in Ukraine).

‚ÄúWe urge FIFA to stop legitimising the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. There is a legal and moral imperative to take every measure possible to end the genocide in Gaza now.‚Äù

When approached by The Athletic regarding the UN's statement on Wednesday, FIFA and UEFA declined to comment.

In April 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) asked FIFA to suspend Israel from competition in a submission made before FIFA's 74th annual congress.

PFA president Jibril Rajoub spoke at the congress, calling on FIFA ‚Äúto stand on the right side of history‚Äù and asking whether FIFA considers ‚Äúsome wars to be more important than others and some victims to be more significant.‚Äù An Israel Football Association (IFA) spokesperson had described the attempt to suspend the country as ‚Äúnothing but a cynical and shameless move.‚Äù

FIFA did not suspend Israel but opened two investigations into alleged breaches of its statutes by Israeli football teams and authorities. The first was into whether teams from Israeli settlements in the West Bank competing in national Israeli competitions represent a breach of the FIFA statutes, and the second investigated allegations of discrimination by the IFA. The PFA has accused FIFA of failing to provide ‚Äúclarity or due process‚Äù with as yet no conclusion to the investigations.

The PFA again called for Israel's suspension at the 75th FIFA Congress in May. ‚ÄúOur issue, sadly again, is stuck in a highly politicized bureaucratic holding pattern,‚Äù said Susan Shalabi, vice president of the PFA.

In September, an IFA spokesperson said he was surprised Israel had yet to be suspended from international football.

‚ÄúI'm surprised we're still part of international tournaments. In many aspects, this is a miracle,‚Äù Shlomi Barzel, head of the IFA's public relations department, told Israeli newspaper The Globes. ‚ÄúThe miracle can be explained by action on our part and a lot of tolerance on the part of FIFA and UEFA, but historically countries have been suspended for much less than that.‚Äù

Israel has been a member of the European confederation UEFA since 1994.

Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and won the 1964 Asian Cup. They were later excluded from AFC competitions in 1974 following a vote after a number of teams refused to play against them.

Israel now participates in the European section for qualification to the World Cup. While it has never qualified for the European Championship ‚Äî the continental competition UEFA runs every four years ‚Äî it reached the play-offs for Euro 2020 and Euro 2024.

Domestic Israeli teams also participate in UEFA club competitions, with Maccabi Tel Aviv competing in the league phase of this season's Europa League.

UEFA confirmed in October 2024 that no matches would take place in Israel ‚Äúuntil further notice‚Äù in response to the Israel-Gaza war. The national team and club sides have played ‚Äúhome‚Äù UEFA competition fixtures elsewhere, including in Hungary, Cyprus and Poland.

UEFA's 55 member associations are meeting today (Thursday) at a regular gathering, although the issue of Israel's participation is not on the agenda. UEFA's next meeting of its 20-strong executive committee, the organisation's main decision-making body, is scheduled for Dec. 3, but president Aleksander Ceferin could call one sooner than that. Slovenia, where Ceferin is from, issued sanctions against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.

Israel is due to play Norway and Italy away in World Cup qualifiers next month. Norway has already said it will donate the proceeds from the game to the Doctors Without Borders charity working in Gaza.

Comparisons have been made between the situations of Russia and Israel, with former Manchester United player and France international Eric Cantona calling it ‚Äúa double standard‚Äù for Israel to remain a part of international soccer, via The Telegraph.

After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, FIFA suspended it from competing in international matches on Feb. 28.

Russia's men's team had been due to play Poland in a World Cup play-off in March 2022, with the winner scheduled to face either Sweden or Czech Republic. All three teams had said they would refuse to play against a Russian side. It was later confirmed that Russia would not participate in the women's European Championship in 2022.

Russian clubs were also suspended from European competition by UEFA.

UEFA and FIFA had announced plans in September 2023 to allow Russia's under-17 teams to participate in their competitions. However, UEFA backtracked in October.

Should Israel be banned by FIFA and UEFA, this would prevent the national team from competing in competitions organised by the two governing bodies.

At international level, this would cover the World Cup, with the 2026 men's iteration taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Israel is in a qualification group alongside Norway, Italy, Estonia and Moldova, and has played five of eight qualifying matches. Israel sits third, level on points with Italy. The top team from each UEFA group qualifies automatically for the World Cup, while the second-place team advances to a playoff round.

The ban would also include the women's World Cup ‚Äî a competition Israel has never qualified for. The European qualifying draw for the 2027 World Cup takes place in November.

A ban would also include UEFA international competitions: the men's and women's European Championships and Nations Leagues.

At club level, this would cover the men's and women's Champions League, the Europa League and Conference League. Maccabi Tel Aviv is the only Israeli team competing across the three competitions this season. Maccabi Tel Aviv is in the Europa League and is scheduled to play GNK Dinamo, Midtjylland, Aston Villa, Lyon, Stuttgart, Freiburg and Bologna during the league phase.

The United States government says it will fight international calls for Israel to be banned from the 2026 World Cup, while Europe's governing soccer body is moving toward a vote to suspend Israel, the Associated Press reports.

Israel's men's national team currently sits third in its UEFA World Cup qualifying table with the group winner securing a spot in next summer's World Cup and the runner-up advancing to qualification playoffs. The next round of qualifiers is coming up in October, with Israel slated to face group-leader Norway and second-place Italy on the road.

Calls have intensified to ban Israeli teams banned from international competitions ‚Äì the same way Russia was following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 ‚Äì in the weeks since a United Nations inquiry concluded that Israel has committed genocide in its war on Gaza since being attacked on Oct. 7, 2023.

Spain's prime minister Pedro SaÃÅnchez expliticly expressed support for such a suspension, stating that ""Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image.""

The majority of the 20-member UEFA executive committee is ""expected to support any vote in favor of suspending Israeli teams from international play,"" according to the Associated Press report. A ban could end the country's hopes of qualifying for its first World Cup since 1970, the only time Israel has reached the tournament.

Pressure is also being exerted on FIFA, world soccer's governing body, to institute a ban of its own on Israel ‚Äì but the U.S. State Department told multiple outlets that ""we will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup.""

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has formed a close relationship with American President Donald Trump as the U.S. gets set to co-host the 2026 World Cup with Canada and Mexico. Trump and the State Department hold significant leverage over FIFA as the host nation with the power to process visas for hundreds of thousands of fans, players and officials coming from all over the world.

‚ÄúSports must reject the perception that it is business as usual,‚Äù the UN experts said in a statement. ‚ÄúSporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.‚Äù

Neatly two years into the war, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel is currently ramping up its assault on Gaza City.

Israel has rejected all claims that it is committing genocide in Gaza. The Israeli football association told Reuters earlier in September that calls for the country to face consequences from soccer's governing bodies ""feel like sickening anti-Semitism.""

The Los Angeles Festival of Movies (LAFM), heading into its third year April 9 ‚Äì 12 in 2026, has parted ways with MUBI as a presenting sponsor, as LAFM shared on Instagram Thursday.

The festival launched in 2024 with MUBI as a sponsor to bring the best of independent film to Los Angeles over one weekend. MUBI has been subjected to internal and external strife since receiving a $100 million investment from the venture capital company Sequoia, which has also supported companies tied to Israeli military technology amid the war on Gaza. 

 










MUBI CEO Efe Cakarel said in August that the distributor and streamer's profits have no relationship to other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. MUBI secured the investment at the end of May 2025, around the time it acquired the Jennifer Lawrence-starring film ‚ÄúDie My Love‚Äù out of Cannes for a reported $24 million. MUBI declined to comment on the LAFM news, and referred back to Cakarel's statement from August.

Filmmakers and MUBI staff have since implored the company to drop its relationship with Sequoia, with a request to remove Sequoia partner Andrew Reed from MUBI's board.

MUBI's fall slate includes, along with ‚ÄúDie My Love,‚Äù Kelly Reichardt's ‚ÄúThe Mastermind‚Äù and Jim Jarmusch's Venice Golden Lion winner ‚ÄúFather Mother Sister Brother.‚Äù At the Venice Film Festival this year, Jarmusch expressed discontent over MUBI's relationship with Sequoia and said he'd had conversations with its leaders about next steps.

Back in August, IndieWire obtained a letter signed by roughly half of MUBI's staff sharing frustrations over the investment. Cakarel said that Sequoia is a minor investor in the company with no oversight on programming or distribution. Expected on October 15 is an internal policy at MUBI, to be shared publicly, on guidelines to ethical investments.

Micah Gottlieb and Sarah Winshall co-founded the L.A. Festival of Movies as a response to the 2018 discontinuation of the L.A. Film Festival. Gottlieb's film non-profit Mezzanine also serves as a sponsor.

Here's the festival's full statement, as shared on Instagram, below.

In the spirit of continuing to build trust and transparency with our community, we want to share that LAFM has parted ways with our presenting sponsor MUBI, on account of its financial ties to Sequoia Capital, a company invested in Israeli military technology and the ongoing campaign of genocide in Gaza.

This was not a decision taken lightly. LAFM is still a brand-new festival run by a fledgling nonprofit organization, and we are still largely dependent on corporate sponsorships and donations. This decision definitively puts us behind on our fundraising goals for next year.
 










With MUBI, we were able to work with a marketing team that understood our mission of bold curation, and supported us in cultivating dynamic spaces for cutting-edge arthouse and independent cinema. We are now actively seeking sponsors and donors who share those values.

When we began in 2024, we arrived in an incredibly precarious environment for independent cinema. We planted a seed in a city dominated by the commercial film industry, in order to build a foundation for the kind of film culture we want to perpetuate.

Like many, we have been witnessing the genocide in real time on our social media feeds. And like many, we question our material ability to move the needle as a cultural arts organization. But we do not want to remain indifferent.

We are so lucky to proceed with intention, curiosity and warmth. It is these values that we want to imbue to our partners and to our audience.

The support that we get from you goes a long way. 

Please consider supporting us, and help us make it to 2026.
