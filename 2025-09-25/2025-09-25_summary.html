Books are heavily restricted behind bars, including some of the books that officials have fought for students to access.

The last several months of the Trump administration's reign have seen the deployment of language restriction as a tactic in the systemic erosion of civil rights. While the scale has intensified dramatically, this enforcement of social hegemony through literary and aesthetic regulation is not a new phenomenon. Historian Andrew Hartman contends that “the history of America, for better and worse, is largely a history of debates about the idea of America.” We are watching this ideological question play out violently, attempting to delineate which bodies are “American,” what behavior is “American,” and what art, what literature, what television is “American.” One of the many ways this debate is performed is through grand displays of moral outrage over literature, as well as through the banning of books and education material.

In the 2023-2024 academic year, schools and libraries across the country fought a record number of book bans — a figure that will likely rise as increasing restrictions are imposed on academic institutions, museums, and libraries. In late 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an assembly bill into law protecting school curricula from gender- and race-based bans. Tony Thurmond, state superintendent of public instruction, celebrated this victory, proclaiming that the measure “sends a strong signal to the people of California — but also to every American — that in the Golden State — we don't ban books — we cherish them.”

While these safeguards are undeniably important, Thurmond's conviction that “we don't ban books” is missing a caveat: We don't ban books here — except in our state prisons. Access to literature for people experiencing incarceration has always been heavily monitored; often the very same books that state officials fight for access to in public schools are restricted in jails and prisons.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Chuck Murdoch, 68, has experienced this firsthand. On August 19, 2024, his memoir Badfish: Stories from the Dark House was published by Blue Ear Books.

The book is a product of nearly three decades worth of Murdoch's writings, a chronicle of his past 30 years spent languishing across various California state prisons, despite abundant evidence pointing toward his innocence. He explains the title in the introduction: “Badfish” is the moniker Murdoch bestowed upon himself, inspired by the band Sublime's 1997 hit of the same name. “DARK HOUSE” is used throughout the book as a surrogate word for prison.

Murdoch's conviction derived from a 1983 robbery-murder in a bar in Long Beach, California — a case that went cold for 11 years, until a jailhouse informant offered Murdoch's name during questioning. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, despite large doubts remaining about his culpability. (He had not matched the description of initial reports, nor was he selected by any eyewitnesses in photo lineups conducted in the days after.) Further doubts emerged in post-conviction appeals: A senior Eighth Circuit judge decried the suppression of a note revealing that the informant had received a lesser sentence in exchange for a confession implicating Murdoch. Years later, another judge dissented the denial of federal relief, deeming the conviction a “truly spectacular miscarriage of justice.”

Despite these acknowledgements, Murdoch is still living out his sentence at the High Desert State Prison in Susanville, California, 30 years later. Having never been able to truly meet his children due to his incarceration, Murdoch wrote the book primarily for them to know their father. Over the course of three chronological sections, the book follows Murdoch's early life, his early passage through the jail system after his brief stint as the “Baskin-Robbins Bandit,” and the 30 years of prison time that followed his wrongful conviction. He documents the reality of life inside prison — the violence, abuse, and manipulation of truth. The book is a personal account of the sheer suffering perpetuated by the U.S. carceral system.

The day Badfish wasreleased in August 2024, Murdoch's sister sent him a copy. Weeks passed, and he did not receive it. In September, Blue Ear Books received a letter from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Division of Adult Institutions informing them that Badfish had been confiscated as contraband and placed on the centralized list of banned publications across California prisons. This decision, the letter said, was based on the belief that the work presented“a serious threat to facility security or the safety of incarcerated people and staff.” The letter did not specify which element of the book was so threatening, nor did the prison respond to sustained requests to clarify or review this ban.

“I have not ever seen my published book. I've never held it.”

Murdoch confirmed over the phone that one year after the publication of his life story, he has still never seen his completed work. “I have not ever seen my published book. I've never held it,” he told Truthout. “I talk about the prison system, how a lot of things are unfair, and kind of unreasonable, irrational. And for some reason, the California Department of Corrections decided to ban my book and disallow it. So they're not allowing it into prisons for any prisoners to read, not even myself.”

Recently, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was required to publicly list its Disapproved Publications, displaying the hundreds of titles that have been deemed a threat to security. There is no specific requirement for qualities that merit suppression, just that they present a “legitimate penological interest.” Basic Drawing by Louis Priscilla rests atop the “B” section — the list informs us that it “contains frontal nudity.” Considering nudity in art potentially dangerous seems ironic when the group “at risk” has nearly nonexistent privacy. Would a glimpse of Michelangelo's David present a security risk to those who are forced to shower with strangers? Further down, we are told that Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale is disallowed for lacking “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.” This murky phrasing does not reveal what qualities merit “serious value” in the eyes of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Further still, The Kite Runner allegedly“contains conduct which is or appears to be forceful, threatening or violent,” and Merriam-Webster's Visual Dictionary “presents a serious threat to facility security.”

As we fight the increasing suppression of material in our schools, libraries, and historical records, we must not forget the people living through incarceration.

These nonsensical justifications seem to be at odds with the newly minted “California Model” currently being implemented at San Quentin, inspired by the “Nordic Model” of imprisonment guided by rehabilitation. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation website claims that the model aims to expand education and job opportunities, reentry planning, and shift expectations for correctional officers to implement a more rehabilitative environment. However, the arbitrary limitation of reading material clashes with this vision.

Book bans are recognized by California officials at the public school curriculum level to be damaging and controlling. Why does this recognition not extend to populations beyond students? The vast majority of those behind bars will leave at some point — should we not ensure that those re-entering society are better educated, better informed? Murdoch himself reiterated this discrepancy. “I think that my book, getting my book published, is a testament to rehabilitation — I had to teach myself how to read and write … I would have hoped the Department of Corrections would have stood behind me and supported me in that, but instead they banned my book,” he said.

After one year of waiting and a lifetime plundered from him, Murdoch is still being denied the only thing he can call his own: his life story, his personal truth. Despite this suppression being a more subtle cruelty in the larger scale of incarceration, repressive control of information and abuse of power is destructive on any level. The State of California acknowledges that the diversity of representation and artistic form in the public arena is essential, and yet, censorship practices are utilized openly against some of the state's most vulnerable citizens. The strict regulation of art, news, and literature under the guise of “safety” or “value” or “obscenity” are smokescreens that have been employed to retain control over the voices and subject matter available to readers or viewers. As we fight the increasing suppression of material in our schools, libraries, and historical records, we must not forget the people living through incarceration — those who are all too familiar with navigating this erasure, arbitrary restriction, and state-sanctioned censorship.

NATO and the EU have "declared war" on Russia through Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed at a G20 foreign ministers' meeting on Sept. 25.

Lavrov's remarks come amid rising tensions between Russia and NATO following recent violations of the alliance's airspace by Russian drones and fighter jets.

Russia's chief diplomat reiterated the Kremlin's long-standing narrative that the West provoked the war in Ukraine and said NATO and the EU had moved beyond indirect support and were now parties to the war.

His comments echoed a similar statement made by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Sept. 15, who said that NATO is at war with Russia due to ongoing military support for Kyiv. 

Peskov's comments came days after Poland shot down Russian drones that entered its airspace.

Following multiple Russian airspace violations across NATO member states, U.S. President Donald Trump said allies should shoot down Russian aircraft breaching their airspace, a position backed by several European officials.

In response, Russian Ambassador to France Alexey Meshkov warned on Sept. 25 that such actions by NATO would amount to "war" against Russia.

Poland shot down at least three Russian drones that entered its airspace on Sept. 10, while a few days later, Romania reported a Russian drone flying over its territory for nearly an hour.

On Sept. 19, Estonia accused Russia of violating its airspace with three MiG-31 fighter jets, which remained in Estonian airspace for 12 minutes.

A recent surge in Russian airspace violations and other provocations on NATO territory, including disinformation campaigns, has heightened concerns in the West over the risk of a broader Russian military escalation.

The Russian aircraft — including three MiG-31s, a Su-30, and a Su-35 —flew over the Baltic Sea near Latvian airspace.

Sergey Lavrov alleged that NATO and the EU had moved beyond indirect support and were now parties to the war.



Olena Zelenska thanked Melania Trump "for her support of Ukraine, particularly for her attention to children who have become victims of Russia's brutal war."

"This creates a critical situation that threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also European countries," Energoatom said.

"With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land," Trump told the press in the White House during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

NORAD dispatched an E-3, four F-16s, and four KC-135 tankers to track two Russian Tu-95 bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets.



NATO potentially shooting down Russian planes in its airspace "would be war," Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25.

A DDoS attack on the SPB payment system and the telecom provider Transtelekom on Sept. 24 allegedly disrupted instant transfers and online payments for many users.

"Behind this surprising optimism lies a signal of reduced U.S. involvement and a shift of responsibility for ending the war to Europe," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. "Better truth than illusions."

The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for such strikes, saying, "We will work on it."

"It's not my goal — elections... My goal is to finish the war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Teachers' unions and civil rights groups say the legislation could stifle criticisms of Israel.

A controversial California bill that would appoint an “Antisemitism Coordinator” is heading to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk.

Teachers' unions and civil rights groups warn that the legislation, which is purported to combat antisemitism, will stifle criticisms of Israel and its genocidal assault on Gaza.

AB 715 was introduced by Assembly members Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Hollywood) and Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay). The legislation would require lawmakers to appoint an “Antisemitism Coordinator” for the state. That coordinator would be able to review the curriculum, and threaten schools with fines and dismissals for refusing to remove material deemed “factually inaccurate.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The bill would also allow Israel supporters to file unsupported complaints of antisemitism with the California Department of Education.

The bill was recently passed in both chambers, but the process was fast-tracked, as there were only three days left in the legislative session. Multiple lawmakers said they weren't given adequate time to assess it.

The Assembly Education Committee's hearing on AB 715 was only informational. A last-minute waiver enabled the legislation to proceed without committee approval.

“We've been robbed of the opportunity to demonstrate that people can trust us in this process,” said Assembly member Mia Bonta, who sits on the Education Committee.

Education advocates warn that, if signed into law, the bill would have a chilling impact on classrooms throughout the state. It's opposed by including the California Teachers Association, the California Faculty Association, the Association of California School Administrators and California County Superintendents, the California School Boards Association, and the Council of UC Faculty Associations.

 “It is very disappointing that our CA legislators are ignoring objections to this bill from every major teachers union, from every educational association and significant concerns of constitutionality from the ACLU to ramrod through this terrible bill at the very end of the legislative session without full opportunity for public input and without meaningful dialogue with Palestinians,” Jewish Voice for Peace Action national board member Seth Morrison told Mondoweiss.

“It is beyond shameful that California lawmakers are fast tracking a bill that mirrors Trump's right-wing playbook of silencing Palestinians, all while this government is enabling Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza,” said AROC Action Executive Director Lara Kiswani.

An earlier version of the bill identified examples where criticism of Israel crosses into antisemitism. These included “equating Jews or Israelis with Nazis or Nazi Germany” and “language or images directly or indirectly denying the right of Israel to exist.” 

In response to the backlash, the examples were removed. “We have compromised on numerous things with our colleagues who expressed concerns,” Assembly member Addis told the Jewish News of Northern California.

However, the lawmakers included information on anti-Israeli discrimination, which the aforementioned coordinator would have to take into consideration when reviewing teaching materials.

The bill's passage was celebrated by JPAC, Legislative Jewish Caucus, the ADL, and other pro-Israel organizations that helped lobby for it.

JPAC Executive Director David Bocarsly said it represented a “historic stand against antisemitism in our schools.”

“For far too long, Jewish students have endured slurs, bullying, and open hostility in their classrooms with nowhere to turn,” claimed Bocarsly. “AB 715 is a promise to those students — and to all children in California — that they are not invisible, that their safety and dignity matter, and that our state will not stand idly by in the face of hate. This bill is about more than policy. It's about protecting children, defending civil rights, and ensuring every student can walk into school proud of who they are.”

Organizers, educators, and activists are calling on Governor Newsom to veto the “Classroom Censorship Bill.”

“This is now Governor Newsom's test. He can either side with educators, civil rights advocates, and students whose voices are at risk of being silenced — or he can greenlight censorship that will make classrooms less free and less inclusive,” said CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said in a statement.

“California has some of the strongest civil rights protections in the country,” he continued. “Real harassment and discrimination must always be addressed — but this bill is not the way. Governor Newsom should reject this flawed measure and stand with educators and students who deserve classrooms where truth and justice are not censored.”

            Hundreds of US generals and admirals around the globe have been called to Virginia for a meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth next Tuesday, several US officials told CNN, though the reason for the meeting is unclear.
    


            The meeting is expected to be held at the military installation in Quantico, Virginia, multiple officials said, adding that no one seems to know what the meeting is about, including the general and flag officers themselves, or why it was suddenly added to the calendar.
    


            One source familiar said they'd heard theories ranging from a group physical fitness test, to receiving a briefing on the state of the Defense Department, to a mass firing of officers, but regardless of the reason the sudden convening of so many senior military officers is highly unusual.
    


            “It's being referred to as the general squid games,” one official quipped.
    


            Some officials also voiced security concerns about having so many high-ranking officers in one place at the same time. A congressional aide told CNN that unless Hegseth planned to announce “a major new military campaign or a complete overhaul of the military command structure, I can't imagine a good reason for this.”
    


            The Washington Post first reported news of the meeting early Thursday.
    


            Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed that Hegseth will be “addressing his senior military leaders early next week.” The Pentagon did not answer specific questions about the purpose of the meeting or if the directive was for all general and flag officers in the military.
    


            It's unclear if the order was for all general and flag officers — those with the rank of one star or higher — or just those in certain command or leadership roles
    


Hegseth shuts down group advising on women in the military



            The meeting comes as the Trump administration has fired a slew of high-profile general and flag officers since taking office in January, in many instances due to Hegseth's campaign against diversity-related issues, but often also for unspecified reasons. Hegseth also ordered the Defense Department in May to cut the number of four-star generals and admirals by at least 20%.
    


            The officers who have been fired thus far include former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown; Adm. Lisa Franchetti, former Chief of Naval Operations; Adm. Linda Fagan, former Commandant of the Coast Guard; Gen. James Slife, former vice chief of the Air Force; Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, former head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency; Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, former chief of the Navy Reserve; and Rear Adm. Milton Sands, former head of Naval Special Warfare Command.
    


            Before taking on the role of defense secretary, Hegseth repeatedly voiced disdain for much of the military's currently serving general and flag officer corps. In a podcast appearance last summer, Hegseth said a third of the military's senior officers are “actively complicit” in what he argued is a move towards politicization of the military. In a second podcast, he said senior officers are “playing by all the wrong rules” to cater to “idealogues in Washington, DC.”

UNITED NATIONS, September 25. /TASS/. NATO and the European Union have declared a real war on Russia through Ukraine, and are already directly participating in it, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a meeting of G20 foreign ministers.

He noted that the refusal to adhere to the principles of the UN Charter is "a manifestation of neocolonial ambitions, [which] leads to increased global instability and breeds regional conflicts."

"A clear example is the crisis in Ukraine, provoked by the collective West, through which NATO and the European Union want to declare, in fact, have already declared a real war on my country and are directly participating in it," Lavrov said at the event taking place on the sidelines of the high-level week of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly.

"The escalation in the Middle East is in the same row," Lavrov continued. "The unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has already claimed the lives of 65,000 people, and some UN officials working in the Middle East say there are estimates that the death toll is 10 times higher. None of Israel's neighbors can feel safe; we see this every day."

The head of Russian diplomacy also noted that the Foreign Ministers' meeting is taking place in a year of "two epochal anniversaries."

"Eighty years ago, with the Soviet Union playing a key role, German Nazism and Japanese militarism were crushed, with the Peoples' Republic of China making a special contribution to the victory. This victory made it possible to establish the United Nations, which the Founding Fathers called upon to 'save succeeding generations from the scourge of war' and 'promote social progress.' Reliance on the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in their entirety, comprehensiveness, and interrelationship, is the key to the peaceful, progressive development of all states without exception - both large and small," Lavrov stated.

            Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has the support of every living former chair of the central bank's powerful Board in her legal battle with President Donald Trump, who tried to fire her last month based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, according to an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court Thursday.
    


            An appeals court earlier this month kept Cook in her post through a preliminary injunction while her lawsuit challenging Trump's firing attempt moves forward — just days before the central bank's September policy meeting. The administration appealed that decision, and is now being considered by the nation's highest court.
    


            Former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen warned against overturning the injunction, stating that it would “threaten” the Fed's independence of politics and “erode public confidence in the Fed.” The brief was also signed off by some Republicans who once served in high-ranking government roles, such as former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Glenn Hubbard.
    


            The 32-page document details the historical importance of the Fed's policy decisions being free of political considerations, which is mostly the role it plays in keeping the US economy stable. At stake is the Fed's hard-fought reputation with investors and the rest of the world, according to the brief.
    


            Damaging the Fed's credibility could interfere with one of the institution's core missions of keeping inflation in check, the brief said.
    


            “The Fed's ability to fight inflation is directly related not only to its actual insulation from short-term political pressures but also to the public's perception of its independence—because if the public and financial markets believe that the Federal Reserve is sufficiently insulated, they will act in accordance with that expectation, resulting in lower and more stable inflation, which is consistent with lower long-term interest rates,” according to the brief.
    


            Meanwhile, the allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook haven't been taken to court. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte first raised the accusations on social media and it is now being investigated by the Justice Department. So far, the administration hasn't revealed a smoking gun.



            Cook's legal battle is part of Trump's broader attempt to reshape the Fed's top ranks.
    


            At the central bank's rate-setting meeting earlier this month, Cook deliberated the economy alongside the newest Fed Governor Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser to Trump and who is taking an unpaid leave to serve a vacated term on the central bank's Board of Governors. Miran was sworn in an hour before the Fed's September 16-17 meeting, he told CNBC last week.

            Amazon is paying a historic $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency announced Thursday, ending a 2-year dispute over allegations the company tricked consumers into signing up for its Prime subscription service and then made it hard to cancel.
    


            As part of the agreement, Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty and provide $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million customers that were “harmed by their deceptive Prime enrollment practices,” the agency said in a press release.
    


            The agency said that this is the largest civil penalty in a case involving an FTC rule violation. It's also the second-highest restitution award obtained by the FTC.
    


            The settlement comes just a few days into a trial between the FTC and Amazon. The lawsuit was filed in 2023 under the Biden administration over the company's cancellation policies.
    


            “Today, the Trump-Vance FTC made history and secured a record-breaking, monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel,” said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson.
    


            “The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” he added.
    


            “Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” said Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin in a statement. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.”
    


            The company and executives also did not admit to any wrongdoing.
    


            Amazon can also no longer have a “No, I don't want Free Shipping” button, the FTC said. The company needs to include “clear and conspicuous disclosures” about the terms of Prime during enrollment process and have “easy ways” to cancel the program.
    


            Prime, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 annually, is a hallmark of the company's offerings and generates billions of dollars. The service initially started as an add-on for fast delivery. Since then, Prime has ballooned into a multi-pronged service that offers streaming entertainment, grocery delivery, fuel and food delivery perks, as well as subscriber-only deals.
    


            The $2.5 billion payout represents 5.6% of Prime's subscription revenue last year, which raked in $44 billion, according to Emarketer analyst Zak Stambor. He added that the settlement might “streamline Prime's cancellation process, but it won't dent the program's dominance.”
    


            Amazon doesn't disclose how many US subscribers it has, but a third-party analysis from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that it has 197 million customers as of March 2025.

Several GOP-led states are hoping to mitigate midterm losses by redistricting their maps before the next census.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

This week, a group of senators — three Democrats and one independent — introduced legislation that aims to reform the redistricting process and eliminate gerrymandering in every state in the country.

The proposed bill would forbid redrawing maps between census cycles, which is currently being performed by several Republican-led states seeking to subvert the will of voters in order to ensure a GOP-majority Congress in the second half of President Donald Trump's term.

The Redistricting Reform Act, sponsored by Senators Alex Padilla (D-California), Adam Schiff (D-California), Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia) and Angus King (I-Maine), is similar to a House version of the bill introduced by a group of Democrats last week. The legislation aims to eradicate gerrymandering by placing certain conditions on states when it comes to redistricting, mimicking the way Maine produces its congressional maps.

Those conditions include:

The bill forbids any state commission from drawing maps that favor one political party over another. It also enacts strict rules regarding who parties can select to serve on the commission, stipulating that the commission can not include members who, for a certain period of time (as determined by the states), hold or have held public office, have been candidates for public office, or have served or currently serve “as an officer, employee, or paid consultant of a campaign committee of a candidate for public office.” 

Redistricting could only occur immediately after a census count is taken. Beyond that, states could only change their maps if they were required to do so by a judicial decree. 

Although the bill has been submitted by Democratic lawmakers in past congressional terms, it has recently taken on new importance, as Trump's political team is strategizing with several Republican states to redraw maps this year to mitigate potential losses in the 2026 midterm elections. Typically, the party of the president loses congressional seats in the midterms, but by redistricting now instead of waiting until the next census, Republicans can potentially keep control of both houses of Congress if the midterms end up being close.

Several states, including Kansas, Utah, and others, are considering redrawing their maps to eliminate Democratic-majority districts; Missouri and Texas have already redrawn their maps to do so. California, which is led by Democrats, will have a ballot initiative this year to redraw its maps, with hopes of matching the Democratic losses that will be felt by these Republican states' actions.

“Abusing the redistricting process is one of the most serious threats to democracy and our Constitution,” King said in a statement regarding the bill. “Not only does partisan and off-schedule redistricting damage and disenfranchise American citizens' fundamental right to vote, but it also contributes to rising polarization in Congress and further diminishes public faith in our political process.”

Several other House Democrats have called for passing the Redistricting Reform Act to address abuse of power by Republicans, noting that, with myriad polling data demonstrating Democrats are preferred by American voters to run Congress beyond 2026, this mid-census redrawing of maps is a flagrant attempt to game the system. 

“President Trump has unleashed a redistricting war across the country, calling up Republican-controlled states and demanding that they rig their maps. Why? Because he's an unpopular President who has stripped healthcare from millions, and he knows that rigging the redistricting process is the only way his party doesn't lose the House in 2026,” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-California) said regarding the House version of the bill. 

“Republicans are failing. Their policies are unpopular. Instead of trying to win on the issues, they are attempting to rig the outcome of the election and silencing Brown and Black voices,” Rep. Marc Veasy (D-Texas) said. “Texas was the beginning of their scheme, and we won't stand by as it happens across the country.”

Polling shows that, when it comes to how congressional and state legislative maps should be redrawn, the vast majority of Americans support ideas like those presented in the Redistricting Reform Act.

According to an NBC News Decision Desk poll published earlier this month, 82 percent of Americans back the idea of a nonpartisan commission producing maps. Only 18 percent of voters prefer the current method employed by most states, of allowing the political party in power to draw maps.

That sentiment crossed party lines — it was backed by 92 percent of Democratic voters, 79 percent of independents, and 76 percent of Republican-leaning voters, the survey found. 

A Common Cause poll published this month also suggested strong opposition to Republicans' current mid-census redistricting scheme.

According to that poll, 76 percent of Democratic-leaning voters said they opposed mid-census redistricting, with 72 percent of independents in agreement. And while Republicans were more likely to approve of redistricting in between census counts, a majority, 57 percent, still said they were opposed.

Restructuring comes after six quarters of falling sales and growing pressure from unions over working conditions

Starbucks will lay off around 900 staff and pull down the shutters on some 100 cafes across North America as part of a $1bn restructuring plan to revive the world's largest coffee chain.

The business, which eliminated 1,100 corporate positions earlier this year, will also close “many” open or vacant positions as it notifies affected employees affected by cuts on Friday.

The 900 Starbucks staff hit by the restructuring work in “non-retail” roles, the company said. It will also close 1% of the coffee houses it operates in North America.

Starbucks is scrambling to reverse its fortunes. The firm's US sales have dropped for six straight quarters as consumers, grappling with years of higher inflation, think twice before ordering its pricey coffees.

The latest cuts are designed to “reinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them”, the Starbucks CEO, Brian Niccol, wrote in a letter to employees on Thursday. “I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve.”

But Starbucks Workers United, a union representing workers at hundreds of its stores, said the move “makes it clear things are only going backwards” at the chain. “Fixing what's broken at Starbucks isn't possible without centering the people who engage with the company's customers day in and day out,” it said.

Starbucks attributed about 90% of the restructuring cost to its North American business, with $150m expected in employee separation costs and $850m in costs related to store closures.

Starbucks also plans to “uplift” more than 1,000 store locations in the next 12 months, Niccol added, “to introduce greater texture, warmth and layered design”.

In his letter, Niccol did not mention the union organizing efforts at Starbucks. More than 650 Starbucks stores in the US have unionized, with workers pushing for a first union contract.

Negotiations between the union and Starbucks faltered months after Niccol assumed the role of CEO last September, as the union launched its largest strike ever at the company in December.

Starbucks workers with the union have criticized the “Back to Starbucks” changes under Niccol, and have threatened further strikes to push the company to reach a first contract with the union. Starbucks has claimed it is committed to fair bargaining.

“I know these decisions impact our partners and their families, and we did not make them lightly,” Niccol said on Thursday. Shares in Starbucks dropped 1%.

The judge warned the Department of Justice that future violations may result in sanctions.

A federal judge has ordered prosecutors to respond to a letter from Luigi Mangione's legal team alleging that Trump administration officials' recent social media posts about the case appear to have violated his right to a fair trial.

“It appears … that multiple employees at the Department of Justice may have violated Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and this Court's order of April 25, 2025 specifically identifying the strictures of this rule,” U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Garnett wrote in her order on September 24 in response to the letter.

The rule stipulates that “non-lawyer personnel employed by a lawyer's office or subject to a lawyer's supervision” in a criminal case have a duty not to release an “opinion that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication” if there is a chance that the opinion will “interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.”

This includes any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, Garnett pointed out.

“The statements referenced in the [letter from Mangione's legal team] by two high-ranking staff members of the Department of Justice, including within the Office of the Attorney General, appear to be in direct violation of this Rule and the Court's April 25 Order,” the judge continued.

On September 19, the deputy director of the Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs reposted a clip of President Donald Trump saying that Mangione “shot someone in the back as clear as you're looking at me…he shot him right in the middle of the back – instantly dead…” The DOJ staffer wrote, “@POTUS is absolutely right.” The chief of staff and associate deputy attorney general retweeted the same post. The original post was later deleted.

Future violations may result in sanctions, including “relief specific to the prosecution of this matter,” Garnett wrote. 

The letter to the court from Mangione's lawyers includes numerous examples of Trump administration officials speaking about Mangione's alleged guilt in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City last year. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges. 

During a White House press briefing on September 22, the White House press secretary said Mangione was a “left-wing assassin [who] shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson right in the back in New York City.”

The following day, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller said on Fox News that “of course the healthcare CEO was brutally gunned down by another self-described so-called anti-fascist that was then celebrated by other self-described anti-fascists, so of course, really communist revolutionaries.” The White House deputy chief of staff for policy reposted the clip on X. 

Mangione's attorneys wrote that the government “knows this statement to be false.” 

“The Government has indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events, and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation,” the attorneys wrote.

“A recent, tragic, high-profile murder has only increased this prejudicial rhetoric,” the lawyers continued, referencing the fatal shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk. “The attempts to connect Mr. Mangione with these incidents and paint him as a ‘left wing' violent extremist are false, prejudicial, and part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case, especially one where the death penalty is at stake.”

More than 1,200 industry figures claim the pledge is ‘a document of misinformation' and that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are ‘often the loudest critics of government policy'

More than 1,200 entertainment industry figures have signed a new open letter rejecting the recent high-profile pledge by thousands of their peers to boycott Israeli films over the war in Gaza.

Stars including Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Debra Messing are among those who have lent their names to the letter, which says the previous pledge “advocates” for “the erasure of art”.

“We know the power of film,” begins the letter, which was released on Thursday by nonprofit bodies Creative Community for Peace and The Brigade. “We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.”

It accuses the pledge circulated by Film Workers for Palestine and signed by stars including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo of being not “an act of conscience” but rather “a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.”

The open letter makes the point that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are “often the loudest critics of government policy” – and frequently penalised by them for this. Last week, the winner of Israel's own academy awards, The Sea – about a Palestinian boy who risks death to go to the beach in Tel Aviv – was submitted as the country's entry to the Oscars. This led to the Israeli sports and culture minister vowing to cut funding from the awards.

“When artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,” added Messing in a statement.

The initial pledge was published on 8 September and was signed by some 1,200 professionals – rising overnight to 4,000 and now standing at around 5,000 – who vowed not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”.

“As film-makers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,” the pledge reads. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.”

In the immediate wake of the pledge, many in the Israeli industry expressed considerable disquiet about the boycott, with representatives from the country's producing, directing, screenwriting and documentary divisions saying the move was misguided and would only “deepen the darkness”.

The following week, studio Paramount also condemned the boycott in a statement which read: “Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace. The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication – not less.”

To our fellow artists and the global film community,

We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.

The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.

To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.

Israel's film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel's film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistently program dissent.

Israel's entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.

The pledge uses nebulous terms like “implicating” and “complicity.” Who will decide which Israeli film-makers and film institutions are “complicit”? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is “complicity” just a pretext to boycott all Israelis and Zionists – 95% of the world's Jewish population – no matter what they create or believe?

History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence film-makers before: Nazi Germany's propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood's own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.

We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponised and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimises falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.

If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support film-makers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.

Let art speak the whole truth.

We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.

Ryan Walters, who has led Oklahoma public schools since 2022, is quitting to run a conservative education non-profit

Oklahoma's superintendent, who has attracted national attention as he sought to install religion and rightwing viewpoints in Oklahoma schools, will resign to run a conservative education non-profit.

Ryan Walters, who has led public schools in Oklahoma since 2022, has put Donald Trump-endorsed Bibles into classrooms and required teaching 2020 election conspiracies.

He is leaving the post to lead the Teacher Freedom Alliance (TFA), which says its mission is to help teachers develop “free, moral, and upright American citizens”. On its website, the group is touting Walters as its new leader.

“Walters fearlessly fights the woke liberal union mob. TFA will take the fight straight to the unions and we will not stop,” the website says. “Together, we will build a national movement that is centered on freedom and common sense, not on bullying and intimidation. Educators will now be able to break free.”

Walters announced his move on Fox on Wednesday night, teasing his appearance by writing on X: “liberal's worst nightmare is about to become true”. On Fox, he said he wanted to “destroy the teachers unions” and “build an army of teachers to defeat the teachers unions once and for all”. He said that his plan is to take the fight he started in Oklahoma to a national scale.

A local Fox affiliate reported tallied more than 400 national media appearances in the last two years by Walters as he sought to raise his profile nationally while pursuing a Christian nationalist agenda in Oklahoma, rejecting church and state separation and installing Christian viewpoints in governance.

Walters has repeatedly pushed Christianity into public schools in Oklahoma. He once tried to require schools to play a video of him praying. He advocated for the country's first Catholic public charter school. This week, he called for chapters of Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA in all Oklahoma schools.

He also has fought against teachers, particularly claiming they are pushing “woke indoctrination” in Oklahoma schools. He wants teachers coming from liberal states to include an “America first” certification. He put prominent rightwing figures such as the activist behind Libs of TikTok and the leader of the Heritage Foundation on state education committees. Libs of TikTok and other conservative influencers advocated for Walters to become US education secretary under Trump.

Democrats accuse Trump of intimidation tactics after memo outlines much more aggressive step than previous shutdowns

The White House is telling federal agencies to prepare large-scale firings of workers if the government shuts down next week in a partisan fight over spending plans – prompting the Democrats to accuse Donald Trump of intimidation tactics.

In a memo released on Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is “not consistent with the president's priorities”.

That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan.

A mass firing would eliminate employees positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year, leading with the dramatic intervention by Elon Musk's “department of government efficiency” (Doge) early in the second Trump administration.

Once any potential government shutdown ends, agencies are asked to revise their reduction in force plans “as needed to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions”, according to the memo, which was first reported by Politico.

This move from OMB significantly increases the consequences of a potential government shutdown next week and escalates pressure on the US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats.

The two leaders have kept nearly all of their Democratic lawmakers united against a clean funding bill pushed by the US president and congressional Republicans that would keep the federal government operating for seven more weeks, demanding immediate improvements to health care in exchange for their votes to approve the short term plan, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

“We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X shortly after the OMB memo was released. “Get lost.”

Jeffries called Russ Vought, the head of OMB, a “malignant political hack”.

Schumer said in a statement that the OMB memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted the “unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.”

“It has never been more important for the administration to be prepared for a shutdown if the Democrats choose to pursue one,” the memo reads, which also notes that the GOP's signature law, a major tax and anti-immigration spending package, gives “ample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted.” OMB noted that it had asked all agencies to submit their plans in case of a government shutdown by 1 August.

Meanwhile, hundreds of federal employees who were fired in Musk's cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration ( GSA) has given the employees – who managed government workspaces – until the end of the week to decide, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press. Those who accept must report to work on 6 October after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation.

“Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official. “They didn't have the people they needed to carry out basic functions.”

Ana Reyes says firings likely violated federal law but do not justify reinstatement before lawsuit ends

A federal judge refused on Wednesday evening to reinstate eight former inspectors general who filed a lawsuit after the Trump administration fired them with no warning and little explanation.

US district judge Ana Reyes said that while Donald Trump likely violated the federal law governing the process for removing the non-partisan watchdogs from office, the president's firings didn't cause enough irreparable harm to justify reinstating the watchdogs before the lawsuit is resolved.

The eight plaintiffs were among 17 inspectors general who were fired by Trump on 24 January. Each received identical two-sentence emails from the White House that attributed their removal to unspecified “changing priorities”. The mass firings targeted all but two of the cabinet agencies' inspectors general.

Plaintiffs' attorneys said the firings were unlawful because the administration didn't give the US Congress the legally required 30-day notice or provide a “substantive, case-specific rationale” for removing them.

Government attorneys said the president can remove inspectors general “ without any showing of cause” and doesn't have to wait 30 days after providing notice to Congress.

The judge noted that even if the inspectors general were reinstated, Trump could simply give notice to Congress and have them removed from their positions 30 days later.

Inspectors general are responsible for rooting out waste and fraud and other malpractice in federal agencies. They are nominated by the president and confirmed by the US Senate.

Reyes said the inspectors general had provided “exceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations”.

“They deserved better from their government. They still do,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, this Court cannot provide Plaintiffs more.”

Reyes said the plaintiffs can be legally compensated later if they win their lawsuit.

The plaintiffs were inspectors general at the Small Business Administration and the departments of defense, state, veterans affairs, health and human services, agriculture, education and labor. Their attorneys say work by inspectors general in 2023 alone saved more than $90bn in taxpayer dollars.

Neither the White House nor the attorney representing the inspectors general immediately responded to requests for comment.

“Defendants' actions, moreover, telegraph to the public that many of the largest federal agencies now lack the institutional mechanisms to detect and stop fraud and abuse (or at a minimum those mechanisms have been greatly weakened), which will likely engender wrongdoing that could harm the public,” plaintiffs' attorneys wrote.

U.S. President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Thursday with the Republican leader signaling that the U.S. government's hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara may soon be lifted.

During Trump's first term, the United States kicked out Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after it purchased an air defence system from Russia. U.S. officials worried that Turkey's use of Russia's S-400 surface-to-air missile system could be used to gather data on the capabilities of the F-35 and that the information could end up in Russian hands.

Trump started his Oval Office meeting with Erdogan by offering hope that a resolution to the matter could be hatched during the day's talks.

“He needs certain things, and we need certain things, and we're going to come to a conclusion,” Trump said. “You'll know by the end of the day.”

The visit is Erdogan's first trip to the White House since 2019. The two leaders forged what Trump has described as a “very good relationship” during his first White House go-around despite the U.S.-Turkey relationship often being complicated.

U.S. officials have cited concerns about Turkey's human rights record under Erdogan and the country's ties with Russia. Tensions between Turkey and Israel, another important American ally, over Gaza and Syria have at times made relations difficult with Turkey.

Trump in remarks before reporters focused his concerns on Turkey's continued economic relationship with Russia.

Turkey has been one of the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuel since the European Union announced in early 2023 it would boycott most Russian seaborne oil.

Since January 2023, Ankara has purchased more than $90 billion in Russian oil, coal and natural gas. Only China and India have bought more from Russia in that period.

“The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,” Trump said of Erdogan.

Trump added that Erdogan is respected by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“I think he could have a big influence if he wants to,” Trump said.

The push on Erdogan to become more engaged in pressuring Putin comes after Trump earlier this week said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia in the war. It was a dramatic shift from Trump's repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war

Erdogan has made clear he is eager to see the hold on F-35s lifted, telling Trump that he came prepared to “thoroughly discuss” the issue.

The Turkish president was even blunter in a television interview this week. “I don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go,” Erdogan said in an interview this week on Fox News Channel's Special Report with Bret Baier.

President Joe Biden's administration kept Erdogan, who has served as Turkey's president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, at an arm's length during the Democrat's four years in office.

The reluctance to engage deeply was borne out of Turkey's record of democratic backsliding as well as Ankara's close ties to Moscow.

Opposition parties and human rights organizations have accused Erdogan of undermining democracy and curbing freedom of expression during his more than two decades in power. International observers say that baseless investigations and prosecutions of human rights activists, journalists, opposition politicians and others remain a persistent problem in Turkey.

Trump sees Erdogan as a critical partner and credible intermediary in his effort to find ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The Republican's administration is also largely in sync with Turkey's approach to Syria as both nations piece together their posture toward the once isolated country after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in December.

Trump and European leaders have followed Erdogan in embracing Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once commanded a rebel group that was designated a foreign terrorist organization.

Trump also said that Erdogan deserves credit for backing the rebel forces that ousted Assad from Syria.

“I think President Erdogan is the one responsible for Syria, for the successful fight in ridding Syria of its past leader,” Trump said. “He doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement.”

Trump's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, met with al-Sharaa Monday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

Erdogan has sought to position his country as a point of stability in a tumultuous moment. He believes Turkey can play an essential role for European security and is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine, Syria and U.S. tariffs that have sparked a global trade war.

Turkey also believes it has emerged as a credible broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia.

Turkey is an influential actor in neighbouring Syria as the rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power last December. However, the fall of Assad aggravated already tense relations between Turkey and Israel, with their conflicting interests pushing the relationship toward a possible collision course.

Trump has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be “reasonable” in his dealings with Ankara.

Erdogan on Tuesday took part in a group meeting hosted by Trump on the sidelines of the General Assembly, when Trump gathered the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim countries to discuss the war in Gaza.

Erdogan has been critical of Israel's handling of the war, which was launched after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and takin about 250 people captive. More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and about 90% of homes in the territory have been destroyed or damaged.

Erdogan, in his UN address, alleged that Israeli forces have committed genocide, an allegation contested by Israel and United States.

Stu Kedwell, senior portfolio manager and global head of equities at RBC Global Asset Management Inc.Craig Bagol/The Globe and Mail

Stu Kedwell was 19 when he inherited 40 shares of U.S. conglomerate 3M from his grandmother's estate. Although he launched a window-washing business and sold futons while earning a commerce degree at Queen's University, stocks still weren't on his radar. 

That changed after he joined RBC Dominion Securities, the wealth management arm of Royal Bank of Canada. He started as a trainee and did a stint with the portfolio advisory group before managing money. 

He and Doug Raymond co-run the $8.2-billion RBC North American Value Fund, a Canadian-focused equity offering that has outpaced the S&P/TSX Composite Total Return Index since 2005. We asked Kedwell why he's a gold bull and likes Berkshire Hathaway. 

Can you describe your investment strategy?

We buy growth stocks at reasonable prices. After identifying companies that we want to own, we do scenario analysis to understand different outcomes for them. We want businesses that can compound faster than the stock market over time.

What's your outlook for Canadian versus U.S. stocks?

We're finding more value in Canadian equities, which is 60% of the fund. All domestic sectors, except for technology, trade in line or below their long-term averages. Loan losses at the banks are a worry due to rising unemployment and falling condo prices, but they're well capitalized to deal with the challenges. Our top bank holdings are Royal Bank and TD Bank. We acquired shares of TD on weakness last year when it was dealing with money-laundering issues. We saw value in them. 

What's your outlook for Canada's energy sector? 

Oil prices have fallen, but the balance sheets of energy firms are strong, and their free cash flow generation is very reasonable. We own Canadian Natural Resources and Imperial Oil, which have long-life oil sands assets. These stocks are attractive if crude recovers in 18 to 24 months. In the meantime, we can collect attractive dividend income. We own pipelines, such as TC Energy and Enbridge, that have high-dividend yields and good prospects. TC Energy, which is more gas-focused, will also benefit from the build-out of liquefied natural gas plants in Canada. Enbridge has more of an oil focus but has acquired some utilities. 

You own the iShares S&P/TSX Global Gold ETF. Why?

I'm bullish long term on gold. More central banks and foreign countries want to own it versus the U.S. dollar for a variety of reasons, including their worries after sanctions were imposed on Russia when it invaded Ukraine. The dollar has arguably plateaued and is set to weaken, so that's good for gold, as well as concerns about the growing U.S. fiscal deficit. We prefer owning an ETF in the gold sector to reduce the risk of owning individual stocks.

Craig Bagol/The Globe and Mail

Berkshire Hathaway is a top holding. Is it still attractive given that its legendary investor, Warren Buffett, will retire at year-end?

If I own a security run by a 94-year-old man, it's because he has management in place for a successful succession. I like conglomerates like Berkshire because you get revenue from many sources, and it's reallocated back across their businesses. Berkshire gets a lot of cash from its insurance group. Some people say it's not being optimized, but I'm comfortable with it. When the skies are sunny, it's what you expect Berkshire to do. In a downturn, you'd expect the cash to be put to work successfully.

Among the so-called Magnificent Seven U.S. tech stocks, your fund owns Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple. Why? 

We also owned chipmaker Nvidia but sold it in July because its valuation had already priced in its growth potential. Microsoft has a more enduring business model. It's growing at a strong clip with the right products and services. We own Meta and Alphabet because they have a lot of advertising exposure. Meta benefits from a rising user base on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We like Alphabet based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, despite concerns about AI chatbot risks to its Google search engine. Apple is lagging in the AI race, but its service revenue is growing strongly.

MOSCOW, September 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's proposed initiative to cease the development of biological weapons is brilliant, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.

"The initiative itself is brilliant," Peskov said at a news briefing in response to a related question from a TASS correspondent.

The Kremlin spokesman noted that Russia was ready to take part in the process of the global rejection of biological weapons but US President Trump's initiative must be documented.

"Undoubtedly, this is a very important proposal and it can only be welcomed. Naturally, the Russian side is ready to participate in this process of the global rejection of biological weapons," he said pointing out that Moscow supports Trump's initiative.

"However, it is better to document it in some way, again, at an international level," Peskov added.

“Jimmy Kimmel Live” returned to ABC's late-night television on Sept. 23, after being suspended for six days over controversial remarks that the host made on air about the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.

The late-night show was suspended after Kimmel said in his monologue that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” MAGA stands for President Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” policy agenda.

TEL AVIV, September 25. /TASS/. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he will not allow the formation of the State of Palestine. He made the remarks before departing for the United States, where he is set to address the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York and meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington.

"I am heading to the UN General Assembly and to Washington. At the UN, I will tell our truth - the truth of Israeli citizens, the truth of Israeli soldiers, the truth of our state. I will call out leaders who, instead of condemning murderers, rapists, and those who burn children, want to establish a state for them in the heart of Israel. This will not happen," Netanyahu said in a video statement released by his office at the airport.

"In Washington, I will meet President Trump for the fourth time and discuss with him the enormous opportunities that have emerged thanks to our victories, as well as the need to achieve the goals of the war by bringing back all our hostages [from Gaza] and defeating Hamas," the Israeli prime minister added.

Earlier, at a conference at the UN headquarters in New York, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, San Marino, and France announced their recognition of the State of Palestine. Additionally, on September 21, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Portugal also recognized Palestine. According to their statements, upholding the two-state solution is key to peace and security for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.

Israel launched a military operation against Iran overnight on June 13, stating its goal was to destroy Tehran's nuclear and missile programs. Overnight on June 22, Trump announced that the US had successfully struck three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. He said Tehran should agree to end the conflict. Netanyahu, in turn, stated that the US strikes were carried out in close coordination with Israel, called the decision historic, and thanked Trump for the move.

Since 1999, there has been plenty of Albertan freedom-seeking political parties: Alberta First, Wexit Canada, Maverick, People, Freedom Conservative, Wildrose Independence and the Buffalo Party.TODD KOROL/Reuters

Francine Pelletier's latest book is Dream Interrupted: The Rise and Fall of Quebec Nationalism. She is a former co-host of CBC's Fifth Estate. 

After years of wanting “in,” the West now wants out. Alberta, at least, has been pumping out that message at high volume. On April 29, the new leader of the province's Republican Party, Cameron Davies, boasted that his election, coming on the heels of yet another Liberal victory in Ottawa, marked “the birthday of many new separatists in Alberta.” On the same day, Premier Danielle Smith wasted no time in introducing legislation that opens the door to a citizen-initiated referendum on sovereignty.

Seen from Quebec, where I live, it's impossible to observe this new separatist surge without a bemused sigh. After being Quebec's harshest critic for decades, Alberta is now ripping pages out of la belle province's hymn book to better belt out their grievances vis-à-vis the federal government. Oh, the irony.

I happened to be living in Alberta in the early 1970s when the discovery of oil and gas was giving the province a whole new stature, and the muscle that goes with it. (Who can forget Alberta premier Peter Lougheed's infamous line, “Let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark”?) It was also a time when a number of Albertans complained about bilingual text on their cereal boxes. It was such a profoundly different place from where I grew up – Ottawa and the Gatineau region – that it forced me to think long and hard about who I was and where I belonged in this vast expanse called Canada. So I am by no means indifferent to Alberta's belated identity crisis. No one better understands the resentment that comes from being used, dismissed or misjudged, as Albertans have been complaining about for years, than Quebecers. That said, Albertans should be wary of the hornets' nest they are stepping into.

Opinion: Alberta's separatism is hollow, artificial and all about money

Separating from Canada is no mean feat. It is a radical act that demands what radicalism often eschews: popular support as well as an established, credible political party at the helm. The art of secession demands a clear vision of what a new fiefdom is all about. It can't just be about more money, or fewer rules. If you are going to create that much trouble inside and outside the province, there has to be a higher goal, a moral imperative that everyone can respect, at least begrudgingly. As far as I can see, Alberta separatists have miles to go before they sleep. 

Support for Alberta sovereignty is indeed rising but remains underwhelming, registering at anywhere between 22 per cent and 36 per cent, depending on the poll. Since 1999, there has been a surfeit of Albertan freedom-seeking political parties: Alberta First, Wexit Canada, Maverick, People, Freedom Conservative, Wildrose Independence and the Buffalo Party, with one formation often begetting the next and all advocating for greater provincial autonomy. The latest separatist vehicle, the Republican Party, an updated version of the Buffalo Party, has upped the ante by calling for a binding referendum on Alberta independence. The party claims to have the wind in its sails and 26,000 members, though 20,000 of those memberships were handed out for free. Other than independence, the party stands for traditional conservative values (faith, freedom, family), fiscal conservatism, enhanced prosperity and, without spelling out what this means, pro-Americanism.

The combined triumph of Donald Trump in the U.S. and Mark Carney here in Canada has heightened Alberta's revulsion toward Ottawa while whetting its appetite for a MAGA second-coming, Francine Pelletier writes.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press

To muddle things further, nothing really distinguishes the separatists' goals from Ms. Smith‘s plan for a “sovereign Alberta within a united Canada.” The fourth consecutive election of a federal Liberal government has clearly united all manner of conservative politicians in Alberta in a high-stakes poker game. Never underestimate the power of resentment or economic anger – but, for now, this amounts to political grandstanding, reminiscent of the emotional speech given by Robert Bourassa, in June, 1990, after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord. It was quite a dance, with the sedate federalist Quebec premier going so far as to invoke sovereignty in response to having been denied a new constitutional status. But it was just a performance, and nothing came of it.

So what does Alberta want? 

When that question was first asked of Quebec, 30 or more years ago, the answer was straightforward: to protect a distinct French-speaking culture and identity in the midst of a mostly English-speaking continent. That has been the crux of the sovereigntist movement from day one: a home that would not only safeguard Quebec but help it thrive and, by the same token, be open to everyone. “The Quebec I'm talking about must also be for all Quebecers,” wrote René Lévesque in his 1968 manifesto. “We can become a model society if we choose.” It was an ambitious yet generous proposition which, despite two attempts, failed to materialize.

Opinion: Why is Alberta so grumpy? The truth is the West has been struggling badly

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the 1995 referendum. Lost by a mere 54,000 votes, the razor-thin defeat was borne with astonishing equanimity by the general population. There was no blood in the streets and few insults hurled at the other side. We kept calm and carried on. Little did we know, however, that there would be a heavy psychological price to pay, as well as a political one.

This is something I think most Canadians ignore and even many Quebecers haven't quite come to terms with. The 1995 referendum marked a turning point in the already fraught Quebec-Canada relationship. Until the late 1980s, there was still some sympathy in English-speaking Canada for Quebec's claim of a distinct society. But the fear that swept the country on October 30, 1995, extinguished much of that goodwill. In my opinion, relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada have never fully recovered.

Within Quebec, the consequences of two failed sovereignty bids have been more dramatic still. The outcome of the 1995 referendum not only deflated the sovereigntist movement, it brought back the old siege mentality of darker times. Jacques Parizeau's unfortunate outburst on referendum night was the first sign of this curious regression. By blaming the defeat on “money and ethnic votes,” Quebec's then-premier evoked a past when foreigners were seen as obstacles to French-Canadian survival. The toxic combination of failure, loss and shame, the inevitable aftermath of this stinging defeat, had suddenly shifted the province into reverse.

Though this was certainly not Mr. Parizeau's intent, a seed was planted that night that would continue to grow over the next decades, slowly transforming the progressive civic nationalism championed by René Lévesque (and Jacques Parizeau) into the more ethnic-minded nationalism of François Legault today. His government's controversial Bill 21, which prohibits teachers and soon daycare workers, among other public-service employees, from wearing religious symbols, is the most visible sign of Quebec's born-again conservatism. Quebec is not alone, of course, in discriminating against religious minorities. The rise of right-wing populism has opened the door to nativist and anti-immigrant sentiment throughout the Western world. But because of its long history of isolation, Quebec is particularly vulnerable to this worrisome drift. 

Alberta, I know, has a very different history than Quebec. But political gambles have a way of running their own course, no matter when or where they happen. In 1995, no one could have predicted that the progressive sovereigntist movement, which had dominated the Quebec political landscape for the last 30 years and transformed it for the better, would slowly morph into an undistinguished neoconservative one. Similarly, no one can predict where Alberta is heading today. In all likelihood, sovereignty is a red herring. That's not what Alberta (really) wants. More power, yes; more control over oil and gas, definitely. But that isn't sufficient to establish a spanking new country.

If not sovereignty for Alberta, then what? Joining the United States? The combined triumph of Donald Trump in the U.S. and Mark Carney here in Canada has clearly heightened Alberta's revulsion toward Ottawa while whetting its appetite for a MAGA second-coming. Make Alberta Great Again caps are everywhere and banned books in schools are dominating the headlines. There is a culture war happening in Alberta and it has Mr. Trump's name on it; 51st state, anyone? Might that be where the wannabe indépendantistes are really headed?

My message to Albertans: Be careful what you wish for, lest it come true.

Patriot.TV (OTCID:CBMJ) challenges Fox (FOX), Newsmax (NMAX), and Sinclair (SBGI) amid explosive growth, while legacy outlets Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Paramount (PARA), and Disney (DIS) face declining ratings and eroding trust.

ATLANTA, GEORGIA / ACCESS Newswire / September 25, 2025 / Conservative Broadcast Media & Journalism, Inc. (OTCID:CBMJ) and its flagship network Patriot TV, is proud to announce that nationally recognized TV and radio host, best-selling author, and political commentator Wayne Allyn Root is joining its lineup this week with his show, "WAR Zone with Wayne Allyn Root." This marks a major addition to Patriot TV's roster, bringing Root's high-profile, high-energy MAGA voice to a primetime slot on the burgeoning network.

Dubbed "the Conservative Warrior" and "the biggest MAGA mouth in the world" by the media, Wayne Allyn Root is known for his unapologetic, balls-to-the-wall, pedal-to-the-metal style of conservative commentary. He says, "WAR Zone" will be the antidote to mainstream media bias and "fake news," offering instead what he calls "WAYNE-Stream Media"- a rare blend of raw truth and world-class energy geared toward America-First patriots.

Root has been a popular national TV host for decades, as well as a nationally syndicated radio host, newspaper columnist, and best-selling author of 17 books. His bold, fiery approach has made him a household name among grassroots conservatives and liberty-minded MAGA patriots. Notably, President Donald J. Trump has appeared as Root's guest a record-setting 16 times, underscoring Root's prominence and credibility in the movement.

"What an honor to join Patriot TV and their millions of conservative viewers," said Wayne Allyn Root. "My weekend powerhouse TV show, " America's Top Ten Countdown" , reaches millions on Real America's Voice TV. Now my daily video podcast WAR Zone will be on multiple dynamic platforms from Patriot TV, to serving as the official podcast of " The Gateway Pundit", reaching their 2.5 million unique daily readers, as well as livestreamed on X, Gettr, and TruthSocial. The left has tried everything to stop me, ban me, censor me, harass me, yet the popularity and reach of my shows just keeps exploding. That's called WINNING! "

JD Rucker, President of Patriot TV, welcomed Root to the network with enthusiasm. "Wayne Allyn Root is a powerhouse in conservative media," said Rucker. "His addition to Patriot TV is a major win for our audience and our mission. We're excited to give him a platform that matches his reach and passion, and we know WAR Zone will be a cornerstone of our network." The new program debuts this week across Patriot TV's streaming channels, The Gateway Pundit, Rumble, and major social media platforms. "WAR Zone with Wayne Allyn Root" will air live each weekday from 6:00-8:00 PM ET (3:00-5:00 PM PT). Viewers can expect Root's trademark mix of hard-hitting MAGA political analysis, lively interviews with high-profile conservative stars, and an unyielding defense of President Trump, America First, and personal freedom, and free enterprise.

The addition of Wayne Allyn Root's hit show comes amid an explosive period of growth andmomentum for Patriot TV. Under the leadership of JD Rucker, who took the helm as President and COO in late June 2025, the network has rapidly expanded its content, audience, and market footprint. In just a few months, Patriot TV's parent company Conservative Broadcast Media & Journalism (OTCID:CBMJ) has celebrated a string of strategic victories and milestones that bolster its position as a rising force in conservative media.

Patriot.TV's momentum has been fueled by a series of strategic wins under the CBMJ umbrella. The acquisition of " The Conservative Playbook" , a popular newsletter and website with more than 40,000 dedicated subscribers, instantly broadened the network's reach and reinforced its challenge to legacy outlets. The company also expanded internationally with the hiring of Scarlett Karoleva as European Affairs Correspondent, adding a global perspective to its lineup and further solidifying Patriot.TV as "America's fastest-growing conservative news platform."

Domestically, Patriot.TV has brought in several prominent voices, including Wayne Dupree, Drew Berquist, and David Pollack, each adding nationally recognized programs and their loyal audiences to the network. On the business side, a new partnership with Evergreen Media Partners has opened up lucrative advertising opportunities, giving brands direct access to Patriot.TV's highly engaged viewers while accelerating the company's monetization strategy.

These moves have been translated directly into results. In July 2025, Patriot.TV hit a record 1.6 million live viewers on Rumble, its strongest month to date.

Each of these accomplishments has occurred since JD Rucker assumed leadership in June, highlighting the impact of his vision and execution. "Patriot TV is becoming the destination for truth-driven journalism," Rucker said in a recent statement. "Bringing in bold voices and investing in quality content underscores our commitment to fearless reporting that the American people can trust." Under Rucker's guidance, Patriot TV has transformed into a high-growth media platform, launching hit shows, forging partnerships, and unlocking value for its audience and shareholders alike.

Patriot TV's steady ascent is especially notable given the turmoil plaguing other political news outlets on a near-daily basis. The broader media landscape is in flux as audiences are rapidly abandoning traditional cable and broadcast networks in favor of independent streaming platforms. Many legacy outlets have been rocked by declining ratings, leadership shake-ups, and waning public trust, creating an atmosphere of instability in mainstream newsrooms. By contrast, Patriot TV has been consistently gaining viewers and momentum while avoiding the controversies that mire its competitors.

Industry trends underscore this shift. Major liberal-leaning media conglomerates, from Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN (WBD) to Paramount's (PARA) CBS News and Disney's (DIS) ABC, have suffered steep double-digit ratings declines and shrinking ad revenues. Even some conservative-leaning cable networks face stagnation as viewers seek unfiltered content. Meanwhile, digital-first outlets like Patriot TV are capitalizing on this exodus from legacy media. Patriot TV's meteoric rise is challenging the dominance of established conservative networks like Fox News (FOX) and Newsmax (NMAX), which remain relevant but now face mounting competition from more agile streaming platforms. In short, Patriot TV is surging ahead while old-guard media struggles, reflecting a broader seismic shift in viewer habits toward on-demand, values-aligned content.

With its authentic programming and innovative multi-platform distribution, Patriot TV has tapped into the growing demand for trustworthy conservative voices. The network's success comes as Americans increasingly bypass corporate media gatekeepers in favor of outlets that share their values and tell it like it is. Patriot TV's consistent positive growth, contrasted with the chaos and decline gripping much of the mainstream media, positions the company as a beacon of stability and opportunity in the current news ecosystem.

With over three million monthly video views and hundreds of thousands of engaged readers across its platforms, Patriot TV continues to expand its influence in the conservative media landscape. The addition of "Wayne Allyn Root's WAR Zone" further cements Patriot TV's position as a leading voice for Americans seeking news and commentary outside the mainstream.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) destroyed two Russian An-26 transport aircraft and two radar stations in a drone attack on occupied Crimea, the agency reported on Sept. 25.  

The strike is part of ongoing efforts to destroy high-value Russian assets on the peninsula, HUR said. 

According to the agency, its special forces set fire to the aircraft and destroyed a Russian surface surveillance radar system along with the MR-10M1 Mys M1 coastal radar station.

The An-26, a Soviet-era twin-engine turboprop aircraft, has been widely used for short- and medium-haul transport, capable of carrying up to 40 troops or 5.5 tons of cargo. 

The radar station is a coastal defense system that provides early warning and tracks surface sea targets.

"How well the Muscovites' An-26 transport aircraft burn - watch the video!" HUR said in a post on social media.

Occupied Crimea has remained a key target of Ukrainian strikes, with recent weeks seeing intensified operations against airfields, radar stations, and other military infrastructure on the peninsula.

HUR reported on Sept. 21 destroying three Russian Mi-8 helicopters and a radar station in Crimea. 

Just one day later, Ukrainian forces struck two Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft.

News Editor

Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Based in Warsaw, he is pursuing studies in International Relations, focusing on European Studies. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Sergey Lavrov alleged that NATO and the EU had moved beyond indirect support and were now parties to the war.



Olena Zelenska thanked Melania Trump "for her support of Ukraine, particularly for her attention to children who have become victims of Russia's brutal war."

"This creates a critical situation that threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also European countries," Energoatom said.

"With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land," Trump told the press in the White House during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

NORAD dispatched an E-3, four F-16s, and four KC-135 tankers to track two Russian Tu-95 bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets.



NATO potentially shooting down Russian planes in its airspace "would be war," Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25.

A DDoS attack on the SPB payment system and the telecom provider Transtelekom on Sept. 24 allegedly disrupted instant transfers and online payments for many users.

"Behind this surprising optimism lies a signal of reduced U.S. involvement and a shift of responsibility for ending the war to Europe," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. "Better truth than illusions."

The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for such strikes, saying, "We will work on it."

"It's not my goal — elections... My goal is to finish the war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Vladimir Plahotniuc, once seen as the most powerful figure in Moldova, faces charges in three criminal cases, including his alleged role in the 2014 "theft of a billion dollars" from major banks.

MOSCOW, September 25. /TASS/. European countries are preparing to secretly deploy aircraft and air defense systems on the border with Russia, with movements of aircraft from the UK and France already recorded, under the cover of reports of alleged airspace violations by Russia, Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Russian State Duma's Defense Committee, told TASS.

Earlier, several NATO countries claimed that Russia had violated their airspace and reported incidents involving drones. Moscow dismissed these accusations as baseless and did not rule out the possibility that they were provocations.

"They (the Europeans - TASS) don't have the courage to do anything more serious," the lawmaker said, commenting on the situation with the drones. "But we must understand that perhaps under the cover of this chatter, there is a secret deployment and preparation for redeploying aircraft and air defense systems to the border with Russia or Ukraine. We are closely monitoring the situation and have already recorded the movement of a number of aircraft from France and the UK," he emphasized.

Kartapolov noted that anything can be expected from modern Europe, "because it is run by completely irresponsible politicians who don't care about their own citizens." According to the lawmaker, the only exceptions are Hungary, Slovakia, and Serbia. "All the rest are EU puppets. Whatever they are told to do in Brussels or London, that's what they will do," he added.

The head of the Duma committee noted that it is now "absolutely pointless and useless" to talk to European leaders and try to explain anything to them. "Their intelligence level is extremely low, and unfortunately, their level of unscrupulousness is unimaginably high," Kartapolov concluded.

 Washington Must Adapt Its Playbook for a New Era of Nuclear Risk

 Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, Ernest J. Moniz, and Meghan L. O'Sullivan

In 1964, China detonated a 22-kiloton nuclear device at a test site in the arid northwestern Xinjiang region—and the political fallout reached Washington. Worried about the prospect that many countries around the world would soon gain nuclear weapons, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson convened a committee of seasoned foreign policy leaders to advise him on what Washington should do to prevent proliferation. Led by the former U.S. deputy secretary of defense Roswell Gilpatric, the group asked what an increase in nuclear-armed states would mean for U.S. security, what assurances the United States could realistically offer states that decided to forgo nuclear weapons, and how far Washington should go to prevent more states from acquiring them.

The Gilpatric committee's conclusion was unanimous: averting the spread of nuclear weapons to any state, friend or foe, should be a top national security priority. To achieve that end, the committee provided a policy blueprint that Washington then went about implementing. Acting on the group's advice, U.S. officials began negotiating multilateral nonproliferation treaties and agreements, including, controversially, accords with the Soviet Union. The United States also developed measures to cajole and coerce other countries into remaining nonnuclear, including extending security assurances, supporting civilian scientific endeavors, and threatening to cut off military support and impose economic penalties on proliferating states. Thanks in large part to such initiatives, U.S. efforts to combat proliferation over the last 60 years have succeeded more often than they have failed. Only nine states possess nuclear weapons, and only North Korea has acquired them in the twenty-first century.

But the nuclear landscape is changing in ways that are bringing proliferation back to the fore. An increasingly powerful China is scaling up its nuclear arsenal. Russia has backstopped its war in Ukraine with threats of nuclear use. Iran's nuclear program was set back by recent U.S. and Israeli attacks, but it was not destroyed. U.S. allies, worried about their security and unsure about Washington's commitment to their defense, are also mulling going nuclear. And evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence are making it easier than ever for states to build the bomb. Against this backdrop, the Cold War–era tools and tactics that Washington has long relied on to manage proliferation challenges are eroding. The international treaties and regimes that govern nuclear issues, particularly the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), are badly frayed. Great-power cooperation on nuclear dangers has stalled.

These are storm clouds that American policymakers cannot ignore. So last year, drawing inspiration from the Gilpatric committee, we convened a bipartisan task force of senior national security leaders and experts to assess how nuclear proliferation is evolving and to make recommendations on how the United States can reinvigorate its approach. Despite differing views on a variety of security issues, the group, like Gilpatric's, reached a clear consensus: nuclear proliferation by any additional country would diminish U.S. power, complicate strategic planning, and increase the likelihood of nuclear use, accidents, and disasters.

But preventing proliferation will require a revamped approach. Instead of relying extensively on international treaties and great-power cooperation to control the supply of nuclear technologies, Washington will need to focus more on reconfiguring security alliances and pursuing new risk-reduction measures, including with competitors, that curtail the demand for nuclear weapons. The U.S. government will have to reassure its allies that it will come to their defense and harness new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that can strengthen international monitoring capabilities and make it harder to conceal illicit activities.

None of these steps will be easy, given the world's many divisions. But they are essential to preventing the emergence of new nuclear states—and thus enormous new risks.

The Soviet Union and the United States agreed on little. But throughout the mid-to-late twentieth century, the two countries sustained a high degree of cooperation in establishing and enforcing a global network of treaties, institutions, technology controls, and practices to inhibit nuclear proliferation. The cornerstone of this system is the NPT, which opened for signature in 1968 and now enjoys close to universal membership. Moscow and Washington upheld nonproliferation cooperation across all kinds of ups and downs in their relationship, including after the Cold War ended.

China was historically more skeptical of nonproliferation institutions and policies. But after joining the NPT in 1992, it also began participating, albeit selectively, in efforts to avert the further spread of nuclear weapons. For example, China, Russia, and the United States cooperated to stop North Korea's nuclearization during the 1990s and early 2000s, although they ultimately failed. They later partnered with European powers to negotiate and implement the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. This successfully limited Iranian enrichment of uranium—until U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord three years later.

But recently, both Moscow and Beijing have begun to dial down their efforts. To advance its war against Ukraine, Russia has embraced military cooperation with both Iran and North Korea. In exchange for their support, it has ignored Tehran's and Pyongyang's nuclear advances, voting in international forums to protect Iran from censure and bartering for North Korean weapons in violation of a UN arms embargo on North Korea. More concerning, Russian nuclear saber rattling has reanimated concerns in Europe and elsewhere that revisionist powers might use nuclear coercion to pursue wars of aggression. In 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he was suspending Moscow's participation in the New START treaty, which was negotiated with the United States in 2010 and is the last remaining bilateral agreement governing strategic nuclear arsenals. For now, Russia continues to adhere to the treaty's central limits, and Putin recently offered to extend those limits for an additional year. But the details of what Russia has proposed, let alone what it will do, remain unclear, and the prospects of a successor treaty to replace New START when it expires in early 2026 appear dim. It is now common to hear people in Kyiv and other European capitals say that only the bomb can guarantee a state's survival.

China's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and more aggressive regional military posture add yet another layer to this challenge. What has historically been a bipolar nuclear order is transforming into a tripolar one. Beijing and Washington share common interests in preventing other states from developing nuclear weapons, but they have far less experience cooperating on nuclear issues than Moscow and Washington do. Moreover, Beijing likely sees solidifying a geopolitical counterweight to the United States and its allies as more important than preventing Iranian proliferation or reining in North Korea's nuclear expansion.

Like its adversaries, many allies and close partners of the United States have flirted with the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons. In fact, many of Washington's greatest nonproliferation success stories involved these states. American officials used a variety of tools to stymie their nuclear weapons ambitions, but one of the chief instruments was a willingness to extend protection to allies by bringing them under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. These arrangements played a crucial role in preventing the wave of proliferation that appeared imminent in the 1960s and 1970s. In practice, this involves maintaining a large defense and security network in key regions, including the forward deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe.

The U.S. alliance system is expensive, but it has done much to help Washington. U.S. officials have long believed that it would be harder to manage crises and prevent the use of nuclear weapons if more partners acquired nuclear arsenals. Extending deterrence has also afforded Washington significant influence over security dynamics in East Asia and Europe, where the United States has used its nuclear umbrella to cultivate valuable economic, political, and military relationships.

Yet growing threats from China, North Korea, and Russia have made U.S. allies question the credibility and sustainability of the security umbrella, particularly given the recent shifts in U.S. policy. Although doubts about whether the United States would truly risk nuclear war on behalf of its allies have always existed, such concerns have deepened in light of Washington's costly trade disputes, its criticisms of allies' “free-riding,” and its discussions on reducing the U.S. military presence abroad. These allies are also unsettled by Washington's periodic overtures to long-standing adversaries, particularly Russia. As a result, in recent years, current and former leaders and prominent security analysts in a variety of U.S. partner countries—including Germany, Japan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea—have openly discussed the need for independent nuclear arsenals or alternative security arrangements that would reduce their dependence on the United States.



Some American analysts and officials have argued that the prospect of nuclear weapons acquisition by select allies may not be so bad and that it would help reduce the United States' defense burden and vulnerability to a nuclear attack. But in reality, nuclear proliferation by U.S. allies could trigger destabilizing reactions from adversaries, increasing the likelihood of escalating regional conflicts. It could also make it harder for the United States to influence the behavior of allies and undercut efforts to thwart the nuclear weapon ambitions of unfriendly states, such as Iran.

Rather than encourage allies to develop nuclear weapons of their own, Washington should work with them to develop a new extended deterrence compact by updating the basic security bargains and divisions of labor that provide for mutual defense. Such an agreement should retain the U.S. nuclear umbrella for strategic deterrence while strengthening the conventional defenses of allies so they are better equipped to handle military threats from China, North Korea, and Russia. In turn, allies must better understand that their conventional military forces and American capabilities, conventional and nuclear, are part of one system for deterring threats and responding to attacks.

The United States can encourage its allies to invest more in deterrence by pairing steps to reinforce U.S. commitments with reciprocal and timely contributions from partners. Many allies are already increasing defense spending and augmenting their military capabilities, but this is only a start. In terms of hardware, allies need to acquire additional military systems, including conventional strike capabilities and integrated and layered missile defenses, that complement U.S. capabilities. Nonnuclear weapons have more range and utility than they did when extended deterrence arrangements were first established during the Cold War; as a result, they can serve as the first line of defense against aggression. But these countries must also invest in newer systems, such as anti-drone weapons. Recent events, including the incursion of Russian drones into Polish and Romanian airspace this month, underscore the urgency of adjusting to evolving forms of warfare. Poland, for example, was able to shoot down the drones, but only by scrambling its fighter jets. And relying on expensive missiles and planes to intercept cheap drones is not sustainable.

Equally critical, the United States and its allies must improve military and political coordination. Tokyo and Washington's decision last year to elevate alliance discussions on extended deterrence to the highest levels of government is a positive step in this direction. Deeper coordination to prepare for nuclear crises would also help allies understand how their contributions are critical to deterrence and increase their confidence that the United States would take action on their behalf. Washington can further reassure its friends by repeatedly and publicly reiterating its commitment to protect them.

As it strengthens its alliances, the United States should also pursue pragmatic engagement with China and Russia to mitigate proliferation. The most direct way to do this would be for the three countries to engage in arms control and risk-reduction efforts. But realistically, the prospects for significant progress today are slim. Attempts to engage China and Russia in recent years have borne little fruit. Engaging with Russia is likely to be especially difficult as long as the war in Ukraine continues. And even if the United States suddenly found receptive partners in Beijing and Moscow, the emergence of a tripolar nuclear order calls for a fundamentally different approach to arms control. Attempting to equalize nuclear capabilities across the three powers cannot work.

The United States should nevertheless seek openings where it can. To begin, Washington should take up Putin's suggestion to maintain the existing caps on their respective nuclear arsenals, which will otherwise be lifted when the New START treaty expires. U.S. officials should also propose a longer extension to New START while negotiators work on an agreement to replace it. In parallel, a senior U.S. official should signal to Chinese counterparts that Washington would be willing to discuss issuing a public statement in which the United States and China recognized their mutual nuclear vulnerability—a concept that has underpinned the nuclear relationship between Washington and Moscow for decades—as the first step in a bilateral process to identify and reduce nuclear risks. Separately, China, Russia, the United States, and the world's other recognized nuclear weapons powers could jointly commit not to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against countries that do not have them. This would demonstrate nuclear restraint and perhaps reduce the incentives for countries to seek nuclear weapons.

Both China and Russia can make unique contributions to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. As a close neighbor and key transit point for illicit North Korean activities, China could, for instance, step up efforts to uphold the UN arms embargo on North Korea. It could also address concerns about its own opaque and rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal. As the United States should tell China (behind closed doors), its nuclear buildup is stoking security anxieties in Asia and leading other countries in the region to contemplate developing their own nuclear weapons.



Russia was particularly integral to negotiating and implementing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and it has powerful leverage as the primary supplier to Iran's civilian nuclear program. Should it choose to, it could help push Tehran into a new nuclear pact with limits and monitoring mechanisms that go beyond what was in the original. But even if Moscow won't use its power to force through a new agreement, the United States can enlist Russia's help in preventing the present situation from getting worse. Moscow could, for instance, press Tehran to fully restore its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which requires that Iran provide unimpeded access to inspectors, and avoid escalatory actions such as withdrawing from the NPT.

China, Russia, and the United States have reason to cooperate on other elements of nuclear security, even if they do not directly address rising proliferation threats. The states are all leaders in civilian nuclear technologies, with ambitious goals to expand nuclear energy projects domestically and abroad. Even as they compete for contracts and influence in the nuclear export marketplace, they maintain shared goals. Washington should therefore seek reinvigorated technical dialogues on promoting high standards for nuclear security and making sure that nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of smugglers or terrorists.

Addressing the intersection of nuclear proliferation and emerging technologies will also require global buy-in, including from China and Russia, and the updating of international safeguards and multilateral export regimes. Already, powerful AI models can be exploited by states to weaponize nuclear materials more quickly and cheaply or to circumvent monitoring and verification. Other developments, such as 3D printing and specialized machine tools, have likewise reduced some of the technical chokepoints to proliferation. At the same time, the United States and other countries can and should harness emerging technologies to thwart proliferation more effectively. Cheaper and more advanced sensor technologies could aid in the detection of illicit nuclear activities, making it harder for proliferators to hide.

Fortunately, the vast majority of states still do not want nuclear weapons—in no small part because of the successes of U.S. strategy. But if even a handful of governments pursue the bomb, the world will be more volatile and dangerous. The United States thus retains an abiding interest in curtailing nuclear proliferation. American policymakers, after all, do not want to live in a world in which they must neglect key security priorities, such as homeland defense and technological competition, to focus on nuclear crises.

But to stop the further spread of nuclear weapons, Washington must address the rising interest in the bomb among its allies and bear in mind evolving threats from new technologies. It needs to bring Cold War–era security commitments into the twenty-first century, making them more reciprocal and responsive in ways that can mitigate allies' fears of abandonment, strengthen collective defenses, and make U.S. defense burdens more sustainable. American strategy also needs to reflect a tripolar nuclear order. In the past, U.S. cooperation with Russia could focus mostly on building up the nonproliferation regime. Today, Washington will need to push Beijing and Moscow to temper behaviors that are driving countries to consider nuclear weapons of their own.

Averting proliferation in this geopolitical moment may seem difficult, and it will indeed require strong, bipartisan support to update U.S. strategy. But consensus is within reach when it comes to halting the spread of nuclear weapons, if only because the alternative would be far more costly for the United States and the world.

 A Divide Is Growing Between the Region's Continental and Maritime Countries

 Susannah Patton

Policymakers and scholars in the West talk about Southeast Asia as a coherent region, but it has always been divided. The region's 700 million people speak hundreds of languages and follow different religions, and its 11 countries vary in political system, size, geography, and level of economic development. Throughout the Cold War, Southeast Asia was divided between the five original founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that were aligned with the United States—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—and the three countries of Indochina—Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam—that aligned with China or the Soviet Union.

After the Cold War ended, ASEAN expanded to include Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, as well as the tiny sultanate of Brunei, increasing the salience of Southeast Asia as a geopolitical entity. Yet despite ASEAN's achievements in fostering cooperation between its members, a cohesive Southeast Asia remains more myth than reality.

The reality is of two regions, not one. According to the Lowy Institute's Southeast Asia Influence Index, which maps the sway of foreign partners across the region, two distinct networks persist among countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam form a continental group that leans toward China. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore make up a maritime group in which the countries are well connected to one another, work with a wider array of governments from outside the region, and hedge between the United States and China. The Philippines is an outlier. It lacks close friends among other ASEAN countries and relies on non-Asian partners, particularly the United States, more than any of its neighbors.

The gap between these two networks of Southeast Asian countries is set to grow in the decades ahead, leading to a de facto Chinese sphere of influence in continental Southeast Asia. To prevent Beijing from encroaching even further, the United States should deepen ties with the countries that straddle Southeast Asia's two subregions: Thailand and Vietnam.

Rugged, mountainous jungle separates China from Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, and through these countries, Cambodia and Thailand. The anthropologist James Scott referred to this difficult landscape as “Zomia” and described how it prevented any state from fully controlling these highlands for much of the region's history. In fact, these geographic barriers kept continental Southeast Asia apart from China for millennia and provided a natural limit to the expansion of the Chinese state. By the twenty-first century, however, technology has overcome terrain. Roads, railways, and special economic zones have facilitated more exchanges of people and goods between China and continental Southeast Asia.

Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has provided financing for new infrastructure megaprojects, especially railways, across the region. Many of these projects have physically linked continental countries to China, which has changed the nature of their relationships with Beijing in a way that is not true for maritime states. In 2021, for instance, southern China was connected by rail to the Laotian capital, Vientiane. China's ultimate vision is to attach this line to projects across Thailand and Malaysia to establish a rail link between Singapore and the Chinese city of Kunming. The effects of the railway have been profound for Laos, a small developing country that is now heavily indebted to China. The value of trade between the two countries has soared since the railway opened, much of it from agricultural exports farmed by Laotians on land leased to Chinese investors.



Laos's connections to China have a darker side, too. In the early years of this century, Laos set up special economic zones in a legitimate effort to encourage foreign investment. But today, they are ungoverned spaces in which Chinese businesspeople and even security forces can operate outside the confines of the law. Drug trafficking, wildlife crime, the unregulated migration of workers from Myanmar and other neighboring countries, and cyber-scams have proliferated in these areas. In effect, Laos lacks full sovereignty over much of its own territory. In Myanmar, civil war has slowed progress on the road and rail projects aiming to connect China with the Indian Ocean. But an oil and gas pipeline has continued to operate despite fierce fighting.

Even Vietnam, traditionally wary of Chinese influence, has drawn high levels of Chinese private investment because of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Already, many companies have moved their supply chains from China to Vietnam, particularly its north—a shift from the historical norm in which southern Vietnam has been a more important center for trade and commerce. The U.S. tariff on Vietnamese products, at 20 percent, is still lower than those applied to Chinese goods, so China will likely continue to invest in Vietnam.

China has also funded railway projects in maritime Southeast Asia. In 2023, for example, a $7.3 billion high-speed domestic railway opened joining Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, with Bandung. Construction is underway on a project linking Malaysia's east and west coasts by rail, at a cost of around $12 billion. Although these projects in maritime countries add to Beijing's clout as an economic partner, they have not yet meaningfully connected either Indonesia or Malaysia to China.

Whereas continental Southeast Asia has, through its connection to China, been transformed over the past decade, this is not true of maritime Southeast Asia, which has always been exposed by its geography to many trading partners. The region's two largest maritime countries, Indonesia and the Philippines, are immense archipelagos, and together with Singapore and Malaysia, straddle key waterways connecting Asia with the world. Just as Scott dubbed the highlands of continental Asia “Zomia,” the journalist Philip Bowring coined the term “Nusantaria” to describe Southeast Asia's vast maritime expanses.

China has tried to assert control over the region's central waterway, the South China Sea. This has alarmed countries around the globe, which need shipping lanes to remain free and open for trade. In 2016, a UN tribunal rejected China's claims to the area within its “nine-dash line,” which covers almost the entire South China Sea. Since then, dozens of countries, as far afield as the United Kingdom, have supported the ruling, underscoring the global importance of these waterways.

Because maritime Southeast Asian countries are bigger and more important to worldwide commerce than continental states, they tend to receive investment and development finance from a larger pool of foreign donors. They also draw more interest when it comes to defense. Of the new defense cooperation initiatives between Western and Southeast Asian governments since 2017, most have been with maritime countries and Vietnam. Maritime countries, under more pressure from China's sweeping maritime claims and steady encroachment in their exclusive economic zones, see the need to work with the United States and other Western countries. And the United States and its allies, particularly Australia and Japan, use maritime Southeast Asian countries to advance their own goals in relation to China. The United States views combined military exercises with the Philippines as a way to maintain access within the so-called first island chain, which separates China from the Pacific Ocean. Washington has stepped up military sales and cooperation with the Philippines, which has borne the brunt of China's aggression at sea, as an investment in maintaining respect for international law and an attempt to prevent China from bending smaller countries to its will.

Southeast Asia's two sets of countries will continue to diverge. The region's maritime states will remain open to many partners. China will be their biggest source of external influence but not by a huge margin, and many other countries, including the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, will attenuate Beijing's sway. Continental Southeast Asia, on the other hand, is likely to become part of Beijing's de facto sphere of influence. China won't wield absolute power over these countries, but it will have much more leverage than any other state outside the region.

U.S. President Donald Trump appears drawn to the idea of spheres of influence. He seeks to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere while showing greater deference to Russia's interests in Europe. Perhaps the United States will ultimately see continental Southeast Asia as part of a natural sphere of influence for China. For a United States that is looking to reduce its international commitments, a decision to stop competing with China there may make sense.

Yet Washington should beware the consequences of such an arrangement. And if it does not want to undermine its own position in Southeast Asia, it should shore up ties with countries on the margins of Beijing's zone of influence: Vietnam and Thailand. Vietnam is continental in character. It has a closed political system, history of aligning with the Soviet Union, deep ties with Cambodia and Laos, and growing links to China. But Vietnam is becoming more maritime in its outlook. For example, in 2023, it upgraded its relationship with the United States to a comprehensive strategic partnership—a sign it considered the United States to be a vital partner. The Trump administration has squandered such goodwill, treating Hanoi as an adversary in one-sided tariff negotiations, a move that risks long-term damage to U.S. standing in Vietnam.

The United States should also pay more attention to Thailand. The country, a Cold War ally and an advanced economy, has historically been friendly to many external partners, including Western ones. Yet since 2006, Thailand's democracy has eroded, and Bangkok has deepened both economic and defense ties with Beijing. The United States must invest more in this alliance and avoid punitive actions that push Thailand into Beijing's arms officials. Washington, for example, sanctioned Thai officials in March for deporting 40 Uyghur asylum seekers to China. By shoring up its ties with Vietnam and Thailand, the United States can help ensure that maritime Southeast Asia remains open, imposing a natural limit on China's ability to dominate Asia and preserving U.S. interests in the wider Indo-Pacific region.

President Volodymyr Zelensky discussed Russia's recent airspace violations and other matters in separate meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24. 

Zelensky has been holding high-level meetings at the 80th U.N. General Assembly in New York, where leaders from nearly 150 countries have convened. He met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Sept. 23 and delivered an address to the Assembly on Sept. 24. 

The president's latest meetings included talks with the leaders of NATO and France. Both meetings touched on Russia's recent aerial incursions in Europe, which Zelensky said were "not mistakes, but targeted actions," according to the Presidential Office. 

In the past month, Russian drones have breached Polish and Romanian airspace, while Russian fighter jets have entered Estonia. Unidentified drones were also spotted in Denmark. 

Zelensky and Rutte "coordinated their positions and agreed on the next joint steps," the Presidential Office said. 

The two leaders also discussed the PURL (Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List) program, the Trump-backed scheme to sell U.S. weapons to NATO countries who will then provide arms to Ukraine. 

In the two months since the program's inception, contributions to PURL have already reached $2.1 billion, the Presidential Office said. 

Expanding the program — in terms of both higher contributions and broader participation — remains a NATO priority, Rutte said. 

In his meeting with Macron, Zelensky not only discussed Russia's airspace violations, but also Ukrainian air defense needs, sanctions against Moscow's shadow fleet, and the use of frozen Russian assets. 

"The leaders paid particular attention to the use of frozen Russian assets for the benefit of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron discussed specific instruments that would make this possible," the Presidential Office said. 

Macron said in recent interview with CBS News that he opposed confiscating frozen Russian assets, as that would violate international law. 

At the start of Russias full-scale invasion in 2022, the Group of Seven (G7) countries froze approximately $300 billion in Russian central bank assets, with about two-thirds held by the Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear.

European governments and G7 allies have been exploring ways to generate revenue from these immobilized funds without outright seizing them, which would have legal and political ramifications.

"This creates a critical situation that threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also European countries," Energoatom said.

"With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land," Trump told the press in the White House during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

NORAD dispatched an E-3, four F-16s, and four KC-135 tankers to track two Russian Tu-95 bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets.



NATO potentially shooting down Russian planes in its airspace "would be war," Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25.

A DDoS attack on the SPB payment system and the telecom provider Transtelekom on Sept. 24 allegedly disrupted instant transfers and online payments for many users.

"Behind this surprising optimism lies a signal of reduced U.S. involvement and a shift of responsibility for ending the war to Europe," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. "Better truth than illusions."

The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for such strikes, saying, "We will work on it."

"It's not my goal — elections... My goal is to finish the war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Vladimir Plahotniuc, once seen as the most powerful figure in Moldova, faces charges in three criminal cases, including his alleged role in the 2014 "theft of a billion dollars" from major banks.

Three typhoons are near Japan on Thursday morning, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

According to the Japan Weather Association, none of the typhoons will have a direct impact on Japan, but caution is advised over high waves in the Pacific Ocean.

According to the agency and the association, Typhoon Ragasa (Typhoon No. 18), which is moving westward across southern China, is expected to weaken into a tropical depression on Thursday afternoon.

Typhoon Neoguri (Typhoon No. 19) is located far east of Japan and moving north-northeast. It is expected to move westerly and slow down on Saturday, but shift to an easterly track on Sunday, picking up speed and becoming an extratropical depression on Monday.

Typhoon Bualoi (Typhoon No. 20) is located east of the Philippines and strengthened to strong status at 3 a.m. Thursday. As of 9 a.m. Thursday, its central pressure is 965 hectopascals, with maximum instantaneous wind speeds of 198 kph. It is expected to maintain its strength and move westward through the South China Sea, heading toward Vietnam on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump's recent about-face on Ukraine's ability to defeat Russia followed briefings from American officials on the current battlefield situation and a possible future Ukrainian offensive, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Sept. 24. 

"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sept. 23., following a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. 

The statement marked a stunning reversal from Trump, who has repeatedly stressed Russia's military might and prioritized warmer ties with Moscow over aid to Ukraine. 

In recent days, U.S. officials have briefed Trump about current battlefield conditions and a planned Ukrainian offensive that would require American intelligence support, the WSJ reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. 

These officials reportedly included Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg — seen as the administration's strongest advocate for Ukraine — and the recently appointed U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz. 

The briefing emphasized Russia's failure to make significant territorial gains despite mounting large-scale offensives in multiple regions of Ukraine. While Russia has concentrated thousands of troops in eastern Ukraine, Moscow continues to make incremental gains at the cost of staggering personnel losses. 

No additional details were provided regarding the planned Ukrainian offensive and the role the U.S. would play in the operation. 

Ukraine's last major offensive — the surprise Kursk incursion launched in August 2024 — ended in Kyiv's withdrawal from most of the captured territory after Russia staged a spring counteroffensive with support from North Korean troops. 

Ukraine has seen increased success with its long-range strikes against Russia, dealing major blows to Russian oil industry operations and disrupting aviation. Operation Spiderweb, a mass drone strike on Russia's military airfields, reportedly disabled over a dozen heavy bombers and caused billions in damage. 

While Trump's comments signal a dramatic shift in rhetoric towards Russia and Ukraine, it is unclear to what extent, if any, U.S. policy will substantively change.

"This creates a critical situation that threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also European countries," Energoatom said.

"With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land," Trump told the press in the White House during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

NORAD dispatched an E-3, four F-16s, and four KC-135 tankers to track two Russian Tu-95 bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets.



NATO potentially shooting down Russian planes in its airspace "would be war," Russian Ambassador to France, Alexey Meshkov, said in an interview with the RTL news channel published on Sept. 25.

A DDoS attack on the SPB payment system and the telecom provider Transtelekom on Sept. 24 allegedly disrupted instant transfers and online payments for many users.

"Behind this surprising optimism lies a signal of reduced U.S. involvement and a shift of responsibility for ending the war to Europe," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. "Better truth than illusions."

The disruption follows a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries in August, which have strained supplies and forced Moscow to cut exports. 

According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for such strikes, saying, "We will work on it."

"It's not my goal — elections... My goal is to finish the war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Vladimir Plahotniuc, once seen as the most powerful figure in Moldova, faces charges in three criminal cases, including his alleged role in the 2014 "theft of a billion dollars" from major banks. 



"Naval drones targeted key logistics facilities belonging to the aggressor state on the Black Sea coast," the source said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told CNN on Sept. 24 that shooting down intruding jets should be considered if Moscow ignores other warnings.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — With China leading the way by announcing its first emission cuts, world leaders said Wednesday they are getting more serious about fighting climate change and the deadly extreme weather that comes with it.

At the United Nations' high-level climate summit, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced the world's largest carbon-polluting country would aim to cut emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035. China produces more than 31% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, and they have long been soaring.

The announcement came as more than 100 world leaders gathered to talk of increased urgency and the need for stronger efforts to curb the spewing of heat-trapping gases.

With major international climate negotiations in Brazil 6½ weeks away, the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened a special leaders summit Wednesday during the General Assembly to focus on specific plans to curb emissions from coal, oil and natural gas.

In a video address, Xi pledged that China would increase its wind and solar power sixfold from 2020 levels, make pollution-free vehicles mainstream and “basically establish a climate adaptive society.”

Europe then followed with a less detailed and not quite official new climate change fighting plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said last week, member states agreed that their emissions cutting targets would range between 66% and 72%. The EU will formally submit its plan before the November negotiations.

While the new promises are in the right direction and show stronger commitment to fighter climate change, “these targets will not be enough to keep us safe from climate destruction,” said Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director for international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Xi and Brazil's leader also made statements on Wednesday afternoon that may have referred to U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks a day earlier on renewable energy and the concept of climate change. “While some countries are acting against it, the international community should stay focused on the right direction,” Xi said.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is hosting the upcoming climate conference, said, “no one is safe from the effect of climate change. Walls at borders will not stop droughts or storms,” Lula said. “Nature does not bow down to bombs or warships. No country stands above another.”

Said Guterres: “The science demands action. The law commands it. The economics compel it. And people are calling for it.”

Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said she was there to issue “a demand for us all to wake up from a community whose hospitals and schools are being destroyed'' by rising tides. She said she has regularly been awakened by floods and drought emergencies in her small island nation and that it will soon be others' turn.

“If we fail to wake up now and end our dependence on fossil fuels the leaders of every country in this room will be woken up by calls about catastrophes of wildfires, of storms, of heatwaves, and of starvation and drought,” she said.

Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif said his country knows this all too well, with recent floods that have affected 5 million people across over 4,000 villages, killing over 1,000.

“As I speak to you, my country is reeling from intense monsoon rains, flash floods, mudslides and devastating urban flooding,” he said. “We are facing this calamity at a time when the scars of the 2022 floods that inflicted losses exceeding $30 billion and displaced millions are still visible across our land.”

Anthony Albanese, prime minister of Australia, called this a decisive decade for climate action and said Australians know the toll of more frequent and extreme weather events like cyclones, floods, bush fires and droughts. “Australia knows we are not alone,” he said.

“Warming appears to be accelerating,” climate scientist Johan Rockstrom said in a science briefing that started the summit. “Here we must admit failure. Failure to protect peoples and nations from unmanageable impacts of human-induced climate change.”

“We're dangerously close to triggering fundamental and irreversible change,” Rockstrom said.

Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe told leaders that every tenth of a degree of warming is connected to worsening floods, wildfires, heat waves, storms and many more deaths: “What's at stake is nothing less than everything and everyone we love.”

In a news conference, Lula said he invited both Trump and Xi to the November climate negotiations, saying it's important that leaders listen to scientists.

Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, 195 nations are supposed to submit new more stringent five-year plans on how to curb carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Technically the deadline was in February and about 50 nations have filed theirs. Several countries filed or announced plans Wednesday.

U.N. officials said countries really need to get their plans in by the end of the month so the U.N. can calculate how much more warming Earth is on track for if nations do what they promise. Former U.S. President Joe Biden submitted America's plan late last year before leaving office and the Trump administration has distanced itself from the plan.

Before 2015, the world was on path for 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, but now has trimmed that to 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), Guterres said.

However, the Paris accord set a goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 19th century and the world has already warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since.

Simon Stiell, UN's climate chief, said the Chinese plan “is a clear signal that the future global economy will run on clean energy. And that for every country, stronger and faster climate action means more economic growth, jobs, affordable and secure energy, cleaner air, and better health, for all of us, everywhere.”

Lula also praised China's announcement, but some advocates were underwhelmed, but they said China has reputation for under-promising and over-delivering on climate action.

“China's latest climate target is too timid given the country's extraordinary record on clean energy,” said former Colombia President Juan Manuel Santos, chair of the group The Elders. “China must go further and faster”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told global leaders Wednesday that the world is in “the most destructive arms race in human history” and urged the international community to act against Russia now, asserting that Vladimir Putin wants to expand his war in Europe.

In a bleak view of today's world, he told the annual high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly that weak international institutions including the United Nations haven't been able to stop wars in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere, and international law can't help nations survive.

“Weapons decide who survives,” the Ukrainian leader said. “There are no security guarantees except friends and weapons.”

Zelenskyy spoke from the podium of the vast assembly chamber a day after he met with President Donald Trump, who expressed support for Ukraine's efforts and criticized Russia. Trump said Tuesday that he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia, a dramatic shift from the U.S. leader's repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war sparked by President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor.

Zelenskyy did not comment on the surprise U.S. pivot, saying only that he had “a good meeting” with Trump and with many other “strong leaders.”

“Together, we can change a lot,” he said, expressing appreciation for support from the United States. and Europe and urging all U.N. member nations to condemn Russia while it “keeps dragging this war on.”

If Putin isn't stopped now, the Ukrainian president warned the assembly that he will keep driving the war forward, “wider and deeper.”

“Ukraine is only the first, and now Russian drones are already flying across Europe, and Russian operations are already spreading across countries,” he said.

Zelenskyy said neighboring Moldova is defending itself again from Russian interference and should not be allowed to move toward dependency on Russia as Georgia and Belarus are. “Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova, too,” he said, stressing that the country needs funding and energy support, not just “political gestures.”

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, weapons and especially drones “are evolving faster than our ability to defend ourselves.”

While drones previously were used by major countries, he said, “Now, there are tens of thousands of people who know how to professionally kill using drones.”

Recently, European airports had to shut down because of drones, Zelenskyy said, and last week North Korea announced the test of “a tactical drone” which means even countries with limited resources can build dangerous weapons.

“We are now living through the most destructive arms race in human history, because this time it includes artificial intelligence,” he said. “Companies are already working on drones that can shoot down other drones, and it's only a matter of time — not much — before drones are fighting drones, attacking critical infrastructure and attacking people all by themselves – fully autonomous and no human involved except the few who control AI system.”

Zelenskyy echoed U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in calling for global rules on how AI can be used in weapons, stressing that “this is just as urgent as preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.”

Stopping Putin now is cheaper than trying to protect every port and airport and every ship from drone attacks, and having to build underground schools and health centers as Ukraine has been forced to do to protect its citizens, he said. “Stopping Russia now is cheaper than wondering who will be the first to create a simple drone carrying a nuclear warhead.”

“So we must use everything we have together to force the aggressor to stop, and only then do we have a real chance that this arms race will not end in catastrophe for all of us,” the Ukrainian leader said.

The Ukrainian leader said his country doesn't have “big fat missiles dictators love to show off in parades” but it is producing drones that can fly 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers which have been used against Russia.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine is building a new security architecture, and more than 30 countries are part of its coalition, and “we have decided to open up for arms exports – and these are powerful systems tested in a real war when every international institution failed.”

US President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on what he described as “radical left terrorism” after a gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others.

The authorities identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn, 29, who died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing from a rooftop overlooking the ICE Field Office. Investigators said shell casings recovered at the scene bore the words “ANTI-ICE” written in blue marker.

No ICE agents were harmed in the attack. The three victims were detainees inside a transport van at the facility's sally port, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Mexican Foreign Ministry confirmed that one of the injured was a Mexican national.

In light of today's horrific shooting that appears to be motivated by a hatred for ICE, Secretary Noem has ordered DHS to immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country.This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric… pic.twitter.com/PKZRc8F8jZ

In a post on Truth Social, Trump called the attack “despicable” and directly blamed Democratic rhetoric for inciting violence against law enforcement.

“The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, must be stopped,” he wrote, pledging to sign an executive order this week to “dismantle these domestic terrorism networks.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that more ICE officers would be hired and that security would be increased at ICE facilities nationwide. She described the shooter as “evil” and accused Democratic lawmakers of “demonizing” law enforcement.

Vice President J.D. Vance also labeled Jahn a “violent left-wing extremist,” saying evidence not yet made public indicates that the attack was politically motivated. “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell,” he said.

Jahn's brother, Noah, expressed shock at his involvement, saying he had not known him to hold strong political views or hostility toward ICE. Public records show Jahn had past drug-related convictions and was registered as an independent voter.

The FBI described the Dallas incident as “targeted violence.” It was the second attack on an ICE facility in Texas in recent months, following the July shooting of a police officer outside a detention center in Alvarado.

New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli opens up about his campaign on 'Hannity.'

New Jersey gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Mikie Sherrill was blocked from walking with her graduating class at the US Naval Academy after being caught up in a massive cheating scandal, a bombshell report revealed.

Sherrill's name was not included on the commencement program during the May 25, 1994, ceremony, according to records obtained by the New Jersey Globe.

The congresswoman said she was barred from walking because she declined to rat out classmates who were involved in the scandal that impacted 130 midshipmen in her class.

"I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor," Sherrill (D-NJ) told the outlet.

News of the scandal comes hours after a shocking poll showed her dead even with Republican Jack Ciattarelli after months of polling pegged her as the clear front-runner.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the ramifications of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Capitol Hill hearing about his MAHA agenda on ‘America's Newsroom.'

A congresswoman from Michigan announced Thursday that she will introduce articles of impeachment against Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing the "health care chaos" and rising costs during his tenure.

Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., has repeatedly called for Kennedy's removal, most recently citing funding cuts for cancer research, infant death syndrome and combating addiction, as well as increased health care costs.

Kennedy's restriction of vaccine access is another issue, as well as him spreading of "absurd conspiracies" that have put people's lives in danger, Stevens said.

"RFK Jr. is making our country less safe and making health care less affordable and accessible for Michiganders," Stevens said in a statement. "His contempt for science, the constant spreading of conspiracy theories, and his complete disregard for the thousands of research hours spent by America's top doctors and experts are unprecedented, reckless, and dangerous.

"Enough is enough — we need leaders who put science over chaos, facts over lies, and people over politics, which is why I am announcing today that I have begun drafting articles of impeachment against Secretary Kennedy."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said Kennedy "remains focused on the work of improving Americans' health and lowering costs, not on partisan political stunts."

Stevens also accused Kennedy of lying during his confirmation hearings about the promises he made that had not come to fruition. Chief among them is Kennedy's promise not to break up the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine panel of independent experts.

Stevens alleged Kennedy had failed to carry out the statutory duties of HHS in administering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC.

The congresswoman also said Kennedy has politicized the FDA and ended public comment for HHS rulemaking.

Stevens is one of several Democrats calling for Kennedy to step down. The secretary most recently faced scrutiny over his firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.

Panelists Joshua Ritter and George Terwilliger assess the mounting evidence against Tyler Robinson, the man charged with killing Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

EXCLUSIVE: OREM, Utah — Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University earlier this month, "made contact" with a police officer near where investigators recovered the alleged murder weapon wrapped in a towel in the woods at the edge of campus, according to two law enforcement sources.

It happened around 6:30 p.m. on Sept. 10, roughly six hours after a sniper's bullet struck Kirk in the neck as he was engaging the audience during a speaking event sponsored by the UVU chapter of his organization in Orem, Utah.

The officer was guarding the perimeter after authorities placed the campus on lockdown, and the encounter appears to have thwarted the suspect's attempt to recover the Mauser .30-06 rifle prosecutors allege was used to kill Kirk.

Prosecutors released excerpts from a text message conversation they say Robinson had with his roommate and romantic partner, Lance Twiggs, that occurred at an unspecified time on the evening of Sept. 10, in which Robinson allegedly discussed wanting to retrieve a rifle before returning home from Orem, which is about a four-hour drive from where he lived in Washington County.

While law enforcement searched the area, Robinson texted Twiggs, telling him to "look under my keyboard," according to court documents.

The roommate found and photographed a note there that read, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it." Authorities say Twiggs has cooperated with investigators.

In another message, Robinson allegedly wrote he was "stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you."

"You weren't the one who did it right????" the roommate texted back.

"I am, I'm sorry," Robinson allegedly replied.

"I thought they caught the person?"

"No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing," came another alleged reply from Robinson. "I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. Its (sic) quiet, almost enough to get out, but theres (sic) one vehicle lingering."

Later in the conversation, he allegedly reiterated that he was looking for a chance to grab the rifle: "There is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't wanna chance it."

Eventually, he allegedly wrote that, "I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle... I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpas (sic) rifle."

Robinson eventually surrendered to authorities in his hometown in southern Utah 33 hours after the slaying, after his parents and a family friend convinced him to turn himself in rather than take his own life, according to authorities.

Authorities say a shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing a detainee and wounding others before killing himself.

DALLAS (AP) — The gunman who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas, killing a detainee and critically wounding two others, left behind a note saying that he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” the FBI director said Thursday.

The post by Kash Patel on the social platform X offered the first hint of a motive behind the shooting on Wednesday that targeted the ICE building, including a van in a gated entryway. The detainees were in the van. No ICE personnel were wounded.

The assailant, who authorities said fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop, was involved in a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said, and agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from a Dallas-area home.

“One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'” Patel wrote, quoting an apparent abbreviation for armor-piercing bullets.

The gunman had also downloaded a document titled “Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management” containing a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said.

Hours before the shooting, the assailant conducted multiple internet searches for ballistics information and video of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus this month, Patel said. Last month, the man searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents, he added.

Joshua Jahn, 29, was identified as the shooter by a law enforcement official who could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.




On Wednesday, Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by the DHS on X.

The attack was the latest high-profile targeted killing in the U.S. It happened two weeks after Kirk was killed by a shooter on the roof of a building at Utah Valley University and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted a backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

Authorities have given few details about the shooting and did not publicly release the names of the victims. The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

“I was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them,” Cardona said, adding that they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a home in suburban Fairview, outside Dallas, that public records link to Jahn.

The house sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a police vehicle, and officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He's a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told the AP.

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence. 

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4, attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was wounded. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a responding police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump's administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Dozens of immigration field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

A manhunt is underway in Oregon as authorities search for an accused murderer who was accidentally released this week due to a clerical error. 

Ty Anthony Sage, 26, was reportedly set free from the Multnomah County Detention Center in Portland after posting bail on Monday, according to FOX 12. 

Sage reportedly appeared for a hearing last Wednesday, where a judge issued a ruling denying him bail the next day. However, a Sept. 17 release form shows Sage's bail was set for $5,000 and he was permitted to bail out – a direct violation of the judge's order.

Sage was arrested in connection to a 2021 robbery and shooting that killed 15-year-old Lowgunn Ivey and injured two others.

"It's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years," mother Jodie Ramsey told the outlet. "My world stopped the day my son died."  

Both Sage and 26-year-old Kevin Rivas-Ramirez were arrested in May, and face murder and robbery charges.

"The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office recognizes that we hold the ultimate responsibility for a person's release from custody," the sheriff's office told FOX 12. "We are committed to conducting a review of the incident to have a full understanding of what occurred.

Sage's release appears to be an "isolated incident," according to Sheriff Nicole Morissey O'Donnell, who added that "this mistake should not have happened." 

"I recognize that the system has failed, and it's failed Lowgunn's family and our community. We hold the ultimate responsibility for a person's release. In this case, we fell short. But we are committed to doing everything we can to restore community trust and confidence in our organization," Sheriff O'Donnell said, according to FOX 12.

Ramsey blasted the mistake made by authorities and expressed her frustration surrounding her son's alleged killer's release. 

"It's a major mess up, it's a monumental mistake that should have never occurred," Ramsey said. 

Ramsey added that Sage's release has left her and her family in fear as authorities work to locate the alleged killer. 

"Very fearful, very fearful, it's going to be a constant fear for me until he is back in custody, because he is [out of] custody doing God knows what," Ramsey said.

However, as Sage remains on the loose, Ramsey reportedly said she has lost any sense of hope that her son will receive justice after his death. 

"I don't have any hope," Ramsey said. "I mean, once they finally caught him and they had him in custody, I had all the hope in the world. I was hopeful, I was completely hopeful. Now that he is no longer in custody, I have 100% doubts."

President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House Thursday as the Republican leader has indicated that the U.S. government's hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara may soon be lifted.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Thursday and signaling that the United States might soon lift its hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara.

During Trump's first term, the U.S. removed Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after Turkey purchased an air defense system from Russia. U.S. officials worried that Turkey's use of Russia's S-400 surface-to-air missile system could be used to gather data on the capabilities of the F-35 and that the information could end up in Russian hands.

Trump started his Oval Office meeting with Erdogan by offering hope that a resolution to the matter could be found during the leaders' talks.

“He needs certain things, and we need certain things, and we're going to come to a conclusion. You'll know by the end of the day,” Trump said. The president added to Erdogan, “And I think you'll be successful with buying the things” you would “like to buy.”

It was Erdogan's first trip to the White House since 2019. They forged what Trump has described as a “very good relationship” during his first White House term.

Over the years, U.S. officials have cited concerns about Turkey's human rights record under Erdogan and the country's ties with Russia. Tensions between Turkey and Israel, another important American ally, over Gaza and Syria have made relations difficult with Turkey at times.




Trump in remarks before reporters focused his concerns on Turkey's continued economic relationship with Russia.

Turkey has been one of the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuel since the European Union announced in early 2023 it would boycott most Russian seaborne oil.

Since January 2023, Ankara has purchased more than $90 billion in Russian oil, coal and natural gas. Only China and India have bought more from Russia in that period.

“The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,” Trump said of Erdogan. 

Trump added that Erdogan is respected by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

“I think he could have a big influence if he wants to,” Trump said.

The push on Erdogan to become more engaged in pressuring Putin comes after Trump earlier this week said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia in the war. It was a dramatic shift from Trump's repeated calls for Kyiv to make concessions to end the war.

Erdogan has made clear he is eager to see the hold on F-35s lifted, telling Trump that he came prepared to “thoroughly discuss” the issue.

The Turkish president was even blunter in a television interview this week. “I don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go,” Erdogan said in an interview this week on Fox News Channel's “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

Democratic President Joe Biden's administration kept Erdogan, who has served as president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, at an arm's length during Biden's four years in office.

The reluctance to engage deeply was borne out of Turkey's record of democratic backsliding as well as Ankara's close ties to Moscow.

Opposition parties and human rights organizations have accused Erdogan of undermining democracy and curbing freedom of expression during his more than two decades in power. International observers say that baseless investigations and prosecutions of human rights activists, journalists, opposition politicians and others remain a persistent problem in Turkey.

Trump sees Erdogan as a critical partner and credible intermediary in his effort to find ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The Republican's administration is also largely in sync with Turkey's approach to Syria as both nations piece together their posture toward the once isolated country after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in December.

Trump and European leaders have followed Erdogan in embracing Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once commanded a rebel group that was designated a foreign terrorist organization. 

Trump also said that Erdogan deserves credit for backing the rebel forces that ousted Assad from Syria.

“I think President Erdogan is the one responsible for Syria, for the successful fight in ridding Syria of its past leader,” Trump said. “He doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement.”

Trump's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, met with al-Sharaa on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.

Erdogan has sought to position his country as a point of stability in a tumultuous moment. He believes Turkey can play an essential role for European security and is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine and Syria as well as U.S. tariffs, which have sparked a global trade war.

Turkey also believes it has emerged as a credible broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. 

Turkey is influential in neighboring Syria. The rebel groups it supported during the civil war took power in December. But the fall of Assad aggravated tense relations between Turkey and Israel.

Trump has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be “reasonable” in his dealings with Ankara.

Erdogan on Tuesday took part in a group meeting hosted by Trump on the sidelines of the General Assembly, when Trump gathered the leaders of eight Arab and Muslim countries to discuss the war in Gaza.

Erdogan has been critical of Israel's handling of the war, which was launched after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and takin about 250 people captive. More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and about 90% of homes in the territory have been destroyed or damaged.

Erdogan, in his U.N. address, alleged that Israeli forces have committed genocide, an allegation contested by Israel and United States.

A young Gazan boy dubbed "Amir," who traveled to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution site and was reported as having been killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in May, has been found alive hiding out with his mother. 

Both were safely extracted from the Gaza Strip earlier this month, though the location has not been disclosed for their security.

The boy, whose full name was later discovered to be Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, nicknamed Abboud, and who is 8 years old but will turn 9 in October, appeared with his mother, Najlaa, at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 late last month in a heavy disguise to avoid detection, a GHF representative involved in the operation confirmed to Fox News Digital.

An extensive internal operation by the GHF was launched to uncover the identity of the boy in late July after a former GHF employee, Anthony Aguilar, a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Army and retired Green Beret Lt. Col. turned alleged "whistleblower," gave a series of explosive interviews in which he said a 10-year-old boy he called Amir had been killed by IDF forces after leaving a GHF aid site on May 28.

In his account, Aguilar showed images taken using his cellphone of the boy approaching himself and another contractor clutching bags of food and barefoot. 

The former Green Beret turned GHF contractor for UG Solutions — a subcontractor of the GHF which received $30 million in U.S. government funding to support its "critical work" — described to multiple outlets an emotional encounter he had had with the Palestinian child, in which he claimed the boy had kissed his hand, touched Aguilar's face, and thanked him for the supplies of rice and lentils he had found. 

But the footage taken by Aguilar and handed over to GHF officials before it was obtained by Fox News Digital, did not show this interaction ever took place.

The GHF contested Aguilar's account on several fronts and pointed out the hand the boy kissed was that of Aguilar's colleague standing to his left, which the footage also showed.

When asked by Fox News Digital why he said the boy engaged with him in this manner despite what the footage shows, he maintained his story and said, "Amir kissed my right hand. He kissed my forehead, too. He thanked us and told us he was very hungry and thankful." 

In multiple interviews with various outlets, Aguilar described how the boy then returned to the group where other Palestinians were gathered at the distribution site before they were then dispersed by GHF contractors through the use of pepper spray, tear gas, stun grenades and bullets fired into the air, forcing them to flee the compound.

However, Fox News Digital was told that the GHF did not yet have access to non-lethal arms in the early days of the operations, according to a GHF colleague who was aware of Aguilar's position at SDS 3 on May 28. 

Additionally, Aguilar claimed that once the Palestinian civilians had been pushed out of the SDS center, IDF forces then opened fire on the crowd and killed "Amir," along with other Palestinians. He reiterated this claim in an interview late last month in which he had told Dialogue Works that the boy had received a "shot to the torso, a shot to the leg — dead."

But the GHF challenged Aguilar's story — including the location of where he claimed the event had occurred.

In one of his first accounts of the incident on July 29 to Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Aguilar claimed the killing happened first outside GHF aid site SDS 1 before telling MSNBC on Aug. 2 that the shooting happened near SDS 2, and then telling Dialogue Works last month the events had occurred outside SDS 3. 

On Sept. 9, Chris Hayes gave an update on the report, telling viewers that the boy who was reported dead was, in fact, found to be alive. He said NBC producers had confirmed that the boy was now out of Gaza in an unnamed country. 

Multiple GHF sources confirmed that no such incident was reported at or outside SDS 1 or SDS 3, and SDS 2 was not yet even operational on May 28. 

Fox News Digital confirmed in speaking with multiple sources that Aguilar was on SDS 3 on May 28.

In comments to Fox News Digital, Aguilar said, "I sincerely, and with bated breath and joy, hope that Amir is alive. I've always said as much. I have been in contact with his family and others, and Amir's family is not aware that he is alive, only that he is 'gone.' 

"I have always said that due to GHF and IDF restrictions from UG S[olutions] personnel moving beyond the concentration camp style corals extending from the North entrance, that I was NOT, say again, NOT able to verify Amir's death," he said. "But I did in fact see Palestinians gunned down by IDF machine gun fire at the intersection of the SDS 3 exit and the military corridor, north of SDS 3, where an IDF Merkava tank was located."

ISRAEL SAYS UN MISLEADS WORLD AS GAZA AID STOLEN AND DIVERTED FROM CIVILIANS

Abboud's stepmother also later told the GHF that the boy hadn't gone missing until July 28, two months after Aguilar said he had been killed.

Abboud ran away to be with his birth mother on July 28 amid a rift with his stepmother's family, whose custody he was put in following the death of his father, per Palestinian law. 

A GHF representative involved in the operation explained the search to find Abboud became not only a matter necessary to uncover what allegedly happened on May 28, but because there was increasing concern regarding threats posed by Hamas as traction picked up around the story.

The official explained that Hamas had a vested interest in making sure this child was not found, as it would discredit Aguilar's story that a Palestinian boy had been gunned down by Israeli forces outside a GHF site.

Ultimately, the GHF were able to locate the boy and his birth mother by speaking with local Palestinians and later, a family member who agreed to speak with the team before connecting them with Najlaa.

She then brought Abboud to the GHF site so that she, her son and four other male family members whose identities Fox News Digital has agreed to conceal, could be extracted from the Gaza Strip, after at least one of the male family members received direct threats from the Hamas terrorist network.

In an interview shared with Fox News Digital, Najlaa is seen sitting with Abboud and another young male, who was also set to be extracted with them, speaking with GHF officials. 

In the video, which Fox News Digital did not post to protect multiple identities, Abboud refers to Najlaa as his "mama" and, according to a translation of the comments, he says he is happy to be with her while smiling and sitting next to her. 

The identities of Abboud, his mother and his relatives were verified by GHF using facial recognition software that compared the images of the boy with those captured by Aguilar. 

Facial recognition software, biometric data and the death certificate of Abboud's father were used by GHF to verify the family members' identities and relationships, and were also shared with Fox News Digital.

Abboud also brought the shirt he was wearing in the footage taken by Aguilar, which is what the former GHF contractor said the boy was wearing when he was allegedly gunned down.

Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, arrived with the T-shirt he was wearing on May 28, 2025, in the footage taken by Anthony Aguilar at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation )

Aguilar did not respond to Fox News Digital regarding the intact shirt, and said, "The new pictures are not Amir."

When pressed on where specifically he thought there were discrepancies in the images of the boy, he said, "Amir in my photos had a scar on his left clavicle. The boy featured by GHF does not. The Amir in my photos from SDS 3, does not have a scar on the right side of his forehead as the GHF's photos show."

The GHF representative confirmed that the boy's scars were in fact used to verify his identity.

"I believe that is a boy of similar appearance," Aguilar said, noting he believes the outcome of the investigation "is a lie."

The GHF spokesperson for the organization, Chapin Fay, called Aguilar's story regarding the boy and his alleged murder by the IDF "false" during a press conference earlier this month.

Aguilar told Fox News Digital that the GHF statements made against him during a July 29 press conference were "libel and slanderous."

Fay described him as a "disgruntled former employee" who was "terminated for cause" after he engaged in "volatile conflicts with staff and erratic behavior." 

According to text messages shared with Fox News Digital, Aguilar also did not handle being removed from his role well, and threatened in a text exchange with a GHF official that he "could be your best friend, or your worst nightmare" if they didn't "put [him] back to work."

David Panzer, counsel for UG Solutions, echoed this belief in a statement he gave on July 29 in which he said, "Mr. Aguilar was terminated from his contract with UG Solutions on June 13, 2025, due to poor performance, volatile conflicts with staff, and erratic behavior. 

"Since termination, Mr. Aguilar has spread a false narrative to media outlets around the world, all at the same time begging UG Solutions to hire him back," Panzer added. "Mr. Aguilar's activities in the last several weeks make clear that he's making good on his threats to, in his own words…be UG Solutions's ‘worst nightmare' if they didn't hire him back."

Panzer said Aguilar's comments "raise[d] substantial questions of motive."

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the Military is going back to the basics on 'The Will Cain Show.'

The Pentagon next week is convening a meeting of top U.S. military leaders from across the globe. 

Multiple War Department officials confirmed to Fox News that top military commanders had been asked to fly to Virginia for a meeting next week, though the topic of the discussion is unclear. 

The Pentagon confirmed the meeting but did not offer details.

"The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week," chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.

A meeting of this size and scope is highly unusual and would usually take place on a secure video teleconference — around 800 generals and admirals are spread across the U.S. and world. 

The lack of details surrounding the gathering has some fearing a looming purge. War Secretary Pete Hegseth has previously said he wants to cut 20% of senior generals and admirals. 

The order, first reported by The Washington Post, applies to senior officers with the rank of brigadier general or above or their Navy equivalent and their top enlisted advisers. 

In May, Hegseth issued a directive to slash about 100 generals and admirals, along with a "minimum" 20% cut to four-star officers. He ordered an additional 10% reduction in general and flag officers across the military.

The secretary called the reductions part of his "less generals, more GIs policy." 

According to Hegseth, there are currently 44 four-star and flag officers across the military, making for a ratio of one general to 1,400 troops, compared to the ratio during World War II of one general to 6,000 troops.

It comes as administration officials have been preparing for a new national defense strategy that makes homeland defense a top priority, where the strategy had long had a focus on pivoting to the Indo-Pacific. 

That strategy is expected to guide a global force posture review that could see major changes to the positioning of U.S. troops at bases across the globe.

A gunman fired upon a Dallas immigration field office from a nearby roof Wednesday morning, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

All three victims were in a transport van outside the facility at the time, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Authorities said the shooter was involved in a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” and investigators found ammunition with anti-ICE messaging at the scene.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof. After the shooting in Dallas, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide.

Here are some of the things to know about the shooting.

All three were detainees, but officials have not released any additional information about their identities.

Mexico's foreign affairs ministry said one of the wounded was from Mexico and was hospitalized with serious injuries. The consulate reached out to the family to offer support and legal help, it said.

DHS initially said two victims were dead, but hours later it issued a correction saying one was killed and two were critically wounded.

No law enforcement officers were injured, authorities said.

Authorities say the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but they have not released his identity.




A law enforcement official identified the suspect as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

FBI agents could be seen Wednesday afternoon at a house in suburban Dallas that public records link to Jahn.

Jahn briefly worked at a Texas-based solar company and in the marijuana industry, including a stint in Washington in 2017, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in that state. Jahn slept in his car during that time, he added. 

“He was lost, and I didn't expect him to be crazy,” Sanderson told AP. “Didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age.”

“I don't remember him being that abnormal, he didn't seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble, he kept his head down and stayed working,” Sanderson said. 

In 2016, Jahn pleaded guilty to felony charges of marijuana delivery, according to court records in Collin County, Texas. He served five years' probation.

The gunman in the Dallas shooting used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. The FBI on Wednesday said ammunition found at the scene had anti-ICE messaging, and FBI Director Kash Patel released a photo on social media showing a bullet with the words “ANTI-ICE” written on it. 

On Thursday, Patel announced that FBI agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from the shooter's home.

“One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'” Patel wrote. “AP” is an abbreviation for “armor-piercing.” 

Patel also said the shooter researched DHS facilities, Kirk's killing and “searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.”

At a news conference Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz said, “This is the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP. This must stop. To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop.”

But Democrats accused Cruz and others of selectively releasing information and trying to “control the narrative” to fit Republican arguments that ICE agents are under siege.

Immediately after the initial news conference in which authorities refused to say whether detainees were among the victims, Democratic U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey called in to Dallas' WFAA-TV newscast and said he was “absolutely sickened” by officials' comments.

“If they are trying to control this narrative and they don't want migrants to be the victim in this story, then they may want to slow-walk giving us any information about this so they can still keep on talking about attacks on ICE,” Veasey said.

The shooting occurred at the local field office in Dallas, where agents conduct short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by ICE.

ICE facilities have varying security levels, with some heavily secured and others more exposed. 

John Torres, a former acting director of the agency, says facilities like the one in Dallas have vulnerabilities, including exposed loading areas for detainee buses.

The Dallas facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

On July 4, a police officer was shot in the neck at a Texas immigration detention center. Attackers dressed in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

On July 7, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, which abuts Mexico. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks in his car.

Two Syracuse University students are facing hate crimes charges after authorities say one of them threw a bag of pork into a Jewish fraternity house during a Rosh Hashanah celebration on Tuesday.

Members of Zeta Beta Tau gathered at their fraternity house to mark the Jewish New Year when the "deeply troubling incident" happened, the New York school's chief student experience officer, Allen Groves, said in a community message.

A student, who is not part of the fraternity, entered the house around 6 p.m. and threw the meat inside while fraternity members were eating dinner, Groves said.

The meat, identified as pork, was in a clear plastic bag and was splattered against an interior wall and the floor, university police said.

According to Jewish law, consumption of pork is prohibited as pigs are not kosher.

The student then fled the home and got into a vehicle driven by a second student. The two, both 18, were soon captured and charged with burglary as a hate crime and criminal nuisance.

"Tonight's incident as reported to us is abhorrent, shocking to the conscience and violates our core value of being a place that is truly welcoming to all," Groves said. "It will not be tolerated at Syracuse University."

Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the hate crime charge came about because it happened on a Jewish holiday at a historically Jewish fraternity.

"This incident is not a foolish college prank and will not be treated as such," Fitzpatrick said. "It will be treated for what it is, a crime directed against a group of Jewish students enjoying a celebratory dinner and seemingly secure in their residence."

The two students accused in the hate crime attack were also referred for potential disciplinary action under the school's student conduct code. (iStock)

Team Europe Ryder Cup members practice on the driving range in front of hundreds of fans at Bethpage Black on Long Island, New York.

FARMINGDALE, N.Y. – Rory McIlroy is going to do everything in his power to make Americans upset this weekend.

The reigning Masters champion will represent Team Europe at Bethpage Black this weekend as he plays in his eighth Ryder Cup.

McIlroy was part of the last team to win a road Ryder Cup in 2012, and he surely hopes to repeat history, in fact, he predicted it shortly after Europe's win over Team USA two years ago.

However, McIlroy spoke of his appreciation for what he called "the best country in the world."

"Everyone wanted to make it in America," McIlroy said of his thoughts on the United States as a kid. "It's the land of opportunity. And I still believe it's the best country in the world, and if you come here and work hard and dedicate yourself, you can be or do whatever you want.

"I am unbelievably grateful and lucky that I got to come to America early on. I think success is celebrated here. I think there's a wonderful sense of work ethic. And yeah, I live here. My wife is American. My daughter is American. I have a lot of affinity towards this country, and I think everyone that lives here should have that same affinity because it is, it's a wonderful -- it is a wonderful place."

            Former President Barack Obama on Wednesday said the Trump administration engaged in “violence against the truth” with its announcements this week linking autism and Tylenol.
    


            “We have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved,” Obama said during remarks at London's O2 Arena, according to a transcript provided to CNN by the former president's office.
    


            “The degree to which that undermines public health, the degree to which that can do harm to women who are pregnant, the degree to which that creates anxiety for parents who do have children who are autistic, which by the way itself is subject to a spectrum, and a lot of what is being trumpeted as these massive increases actually have to do with a broadening of the criteria across that spectrum, so that people can actually get services and help,” Obama added. “All of that is violence against the truth.”
    


            At a White House press conference Monday, President Donald Trump announced that the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” drawing immediate pushback from doctors in the US and abroad. Trump promoted a range of unproven theories about autism, Tylenol and vaccines, going beyond his administration's plans to highlight a cautious new warning on Tylenol, $50 million investment in further autism research and approval of a potential treatment.

            Obama said Wednesday that “it is important for those who believe in the truth and believe in science, to also examine truth when it is inconvenient for us.”
    


            Obama also said the country is being “tested” by threats against free speech and the rule of law but called it a “clarifying moment” of what Americans should stand for.
    


            “It's fair to say that what I see repeatedly in my own country in the loss of leadership in promoting values like democracy and rule of law and free speech, and economic fairness, the fact that not only do we not promote them, but we actively oppose those values now, in many cases, it's fair to say I find appalling. I don't feel good about it,” Obama said.
    


            “I think we got complacent and smug and comfortable posturing that we believed in all these values because they were never tested. And now they're being tested,” he said. “It's easy to believe in free speech when everybody kind of agrees with it. It's much harder when the people next to you seem just terrible and are promoting ideas that feel like they're inciting violence towards you.”
    


            The comments reflect the Democratic former president's increasingly outspoken posture. Throughout a series of public appearances this year, Obama has amped up his criticism of Trump's second term and expressed concern about the state of American politics.
    


            During stops at colleges and community centers, he's called the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and law firms “unimaginable,” and warned that the US is “dangerously close” to a more autocratic government.
    


            And earlier this month, Obama commented on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, calling it a “horrific tragedy” and saying that “the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resort to violence.”

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Republican Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's top public schools official who lauded President Donald Trump, pledged to put a Turning Point USA chapter in every high school to honor Charlie Kirk and end what he called “wokeness” in public schools, is resigning to lead a conservative educators' group.

Walters, 40, said Wednesday night on Fox News that he is stepping down as state superintendent of public instruction to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a nonprofit that says it assists educators “in their mission to develop free, moral, and upright American citizens.”

“We're going to destroy the teachers unions,” Walters said on Fox. “We have seen the teachers unions use money and power to corrupt our schools, to undermine our schools.”

Walters has leaned into culture-war politics and sought to infuse religion into classroom instruction, including a mandate that public schoolteachers incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for children in grades 5 though 12.

He has also tried to require social studies teachers to promote conspiracies about the 2020 election, track the immigration status of children in schools and require applicants for teacher jobs coming from California and New York to pass an exam designed to safeguard what he described as “radical leftist ideology.” Many of his efforts have led to lawsuits against him and the agency, even as Oklahoma's national ranking in several education metrics has continued to decline.

Just Tuesday, Walters announced that Oklahoma high schools will have Turning Point USA chapters. He said parents, teachers and students “want their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values.”

Kirk founded the organization to mobilize young, Christian conservatives. It has seen a massive surge in interest and support since the activist's assassination on Sept. 10.




Walters, a former teacher, was elected to the superintendent's job. He had served as Oklahoma Secretary of Education from September 2020 to April 2023. He was appointed to that position by Gov. Kevin Stitt. 

Ever since then, “we have witnessed a stream of never-ending scandal and political drama,” Oklahoma Attorney General Genter Drummond said in a statement. 

“It's time for a State Superintendent of Public Instruction who will actually focus on quality instruction in our public schools,” Drummond, a Republican and candidate for governor in 2026, said.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has likely carried out an undeclared missile test at its Imam Khomeini Spaceport, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed Thursday, underlining Tehran's effort to maintain its weapons program despite the 12-day war with Israel in June. 

Iran has not formally acknowledged last week's test at a circular pad that has hosted other major launches by the country's civilian space program. A single lawmaker in Iran's parliament, however, claimed, without offering evidence, that Tehran tested a possible intercontinental ballistic missile. 

The test and the claim raise concerns that Iran may be trying to expand the reach of its missiles as tensions remain high ahead of United Nations sanctions, which are likely to be reimposed this weekend over Tehran's nuclear program — as it also repairs missile sites that were struck by the Israelis.

“Israel's successes in the 12-day war against Iran's missile attacks reinforced for Tehran the importance of developing more ballistic missiles and qualitatively better versions of them,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The think tank has long been critical of Iran and has been sanctioned by Tehran. 

“Consider this part of Tehran's efforts to build back better, and as quickly as possible,” he added.




On Sept. 18, Iranian social media users posted images of the sky over Semnan province, showing what appeared to be a rocket's contrail at sunset. Iranian officials did not acknowledge what caused the contrail, nor did Iranian state media report on the incident. 

Satellite photos taken prior to that by Planet Labs PBC show the circular pad at Imam Khomeini Spaceport — about 230 kilometers (145 miles) southeast of Iran's capital, Tehran, in Semnan — painted blue ringed with red, white and green lines — the colors of the Iranian flag. 

But in satellite images since Sept. 18, the pad appeared discolored, though it wasn't fully clear until a more-detailed Planet image requested by the AP taken this Wednesday. That image shows significant scorch marks, the pattern of which resembled scorching seen at the pad following past launches. When rockets launch, the flames from their engines pour down onto pads. 

Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who studies missiles, said the scale of the scorching suggested Iran launched a solid-fuel missile, as burning aluminum oxide particles cause such marks. 

The north-south marks suggest a blast deflector being used as well to channel the flames, he said.

Iranian parliament member Mohsen Zanganeh, appearing on Iranian state television on Saturday, claimed that the Islamic Republic had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday. He portrayed it as a sign of Iran's strength as it faces challenges from Israel and the West. 

“We have neither abandoned (nuclear) enrichment, nor handed uranium over to the enemy, nor backed down from our missile positions,” said Zanganeh, a member of parliament's budget committee from Iran's Khorasan Razavi province. 

“The night before last we tested one of the country's most advanced missiles, which until now had not, so to speak, been trialed — and that test was successful,” he said.

“In other words,” he added. “I mean to say that even under these conditions we are conducting a security test of an intercontinental-range missile.”

Zanganeh did not elaborate on where he got his information, nor did he provide any evidence to support his assertion. Iranian parliament members have made exaggerated claims in the past.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles typically have ranges greater than 5,500 kilometers (3,415 miles). That would extend far beyond the range reportedly allowed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which is 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).

The range of 2,000 kilometers encompasses much of the Middle East, including Israel and American military bases in the region. An intercontinental missile would at least put all of Europe in rage. The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees its Mideast operations, did not respond to a request for comment. 

Despite the lawmaker's claims, there are still many questions surrounding the launch — including just what Iran sent into the sky. 

Iran has in the past used the pad to launch solid-fueled missiles called Zuljanah, named after a horse of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and a key figure in the Shiite faith who was massacred with his fighters at Karbala in the 7th century.

The Zuljanah can launch satellites in space. However, the fact that it uses solid fuel and is capable of reaching space has raised concerns by the U.S. government that Iran could potentially build an intercontinental ballistic missile. 

“If, as is increasingly being alleged, the test was of a space-launch vehicle, it represents a desire by Tehran to potentially threaten targets outside the Middle East, like the European continent and even the American homeland,” Taleblu said. 

Such missiles can deliver nuclear weapons, but Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess that Iran is not actively pursuing an atomic bomb, though it had been enriching uranium to up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran also would need to miniaturize any possible nuclear bomb to put it atop a ballistic missile.

With Iran not formally acknowledging the launch and the erratic contrail that was left behind, the likelihood is that the launch may have failed. There's also no acknowledgment by U.S. space officials of Iran putting any new satellites into space on Sept. 18. 

Iran may also have used the launch to signal to the West that it will continue its missile program, despite sanctions and pressure — though without a formal confirmation, it remains unclear just what Tehran was trying to do. 

“The problem is that so much happens with Iran,” Hinz said. “It's hard to say what is coincidental and what is a pattern.”

            Israeli authorities have arrested an American-Israeli dual citizen on suspicion of spying for Iran, accusing him of sharing information on public figures and sending videos and pictures of locations across the country to his handlers.
    


            Yaakov Perl, 49, was arrested earlier this month after an investigation by the Shin Bet security agency and the National Crime Unit of the Israeli police.
    


            Perl had lived in Morocco in recent years, authorities said, and he first contacted the Iranian embassy there by phone in 2017.
    


            Police and the Shin Bet said in a joint statement Perl requested asylum for himself and his family but received no response. In 2023, he began engaging with Iranian news outlets on social media and publishing content critical of Israel and Zionism.
    


            In January, Perl wrote an article that authorities say supported Hezbollah following Israel's killing of the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.
    


            After the article's publication, he was approached by Iranian operatives, with whom authorities say he agreed to cooperate. When Perl was unable to recruit people in Israel to work with him, authorities say he traveled to Israel himself in July and began gathering intelligence at the direction of his Iranian handlers.
    


            “He provided the Iranians with information on Israeli public figures and citizens, including former IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir,” police and the Shin Bet said. “As part of his activities, Perl also took photos and videos of various streets and locations throughout Israel. He was paid in cryptocurrency for his work.”
    


            The statement said that Perl's actions were “all based on ideological motives and opposition to Zionism.”
    


            Since October 7th, Israeli police have been involved in investigating more than 25 cases related to espionage activity linked to Iran, resulting in approximately 46 arrests, according to a police spokesman.

WASHINGTON (AP) — An uptick in consumer spending helped the U.S. economy expand at a surprising 3.8% from April through June, the government reported in a dramatic upgrade of its previous estimate of second-quarter growth.

U.S. gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by fallout from President Donald Trump's trade wars, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.

The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports — which are subtracted from GDP — as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.

Consumer spending rose at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%. 

“The U.S. consumer remained a lot stronger than many thought, even in the midst of a stock market sell-off and a lot of trade uncertainty,” Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, posted on social media. 




A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. 

But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth. 

Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter. 

Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% — “not great but much better than initially thought.''

Since returning to the White House, Trump has overturned decades of U.S. policy in support of freer trade. He's slapped double-digit taxes — tariffs — on imports from almost every country on earth and targeted specific products for tariffs, too, including steel, aluminum and autos. 

Trump sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the United States and to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4. 

But mainstream economists — whose views Trump and his advisers reject — say that his tariffs will damage the economy, raising costs and making protected U.S. companies less efficient. They note that tariffs are paid by importers in the United States, who try to pass along the cost to their customers via higher prices. Therefore, tariffs can be inflationary — though their impact on prices so far has been modest. 

The unpredictable way that Trump has imposed the tariffs — announcing and suspending them, then coming up with new ones — has left businesses bewildered, contributing to a sharp deceleration in hiring.

From 2021 through 2023, the United States added an impressive 400,000 jobs a month as the economy bounded back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Since then, hiring has stalled, partly because of trade policy uncertainty and partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve's inflation fighters in 2022 and 2023.

Labor Department revisions earlier this month showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of fewer than 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has slowed even more — to an average 53,000 a month.

On Oct. 3, the Labor Department is expected to report that employers added just 43,000 jobs in September, though unemployment likely stayed at a low 4.3%, according to forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet.

Seeking to bolster the job market, the Fed last week cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December and signaled that it expected two more cuts this year. But the surprisingly strong second-quarter GDP growth may give the central bank less reason to cut rates — despite intense pressure from Trump to do so. Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge — the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index — comes out Friday.

Thursday's GDP report was Commerce Department's third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30. 

Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet currently expect the GDP growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the third quarter.

It's been only a year since Hurricane Helene hammered the southeast U.S. from Florida to the Carolinas. The worst wreckage has been cleared away, but cleanup crews are still at work plucking smaller debris from waterways throughout the region. (AP video by Brittany Peterson)

WOODFIN, N.C. (AP) — Bracing himself against the current in waist-deep water, Clancy Loorham wrestles a broken length of PVC pipe from the rocky bottom of the French Broad River and peers inside.

“I got a catfish in the pipe,” the 27-year-old with wispy beard and mustache shouted to fellow cleanup workers floating nearby in rafts, canoes and kayaks piled with plastic pipe and other human-made detritus. “He's right here. I'm looking him in the eyes!”

It's been just a year since floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Helene washed these pipes out of a nearby factory with such force that some pieces ended up in Douglas Lake, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Tennessee. But they're already slick with algae and filled with river silt — and creatures.

Helene killed more than 250 people and caused nearly $80 billion in damage from Florida to the Carolinas. In the North Carolina mountains, rains of up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) turned gentle streams into torrents that swept away trees, boulders, homes and vehicles, shattered century-old flood records, and in some places carved out new channels.

In the haste to rescue people and restore their lives to some semblance of normalcy, some fear the recovery efforts compounded Helene's impact on the ecosystem. Contractors hired to remove vehicles, shipping containers, shattered houses and other large debris from waterways sometimes damaged sensitive habitat.

“They were using the river almost as a highway in some situations,” said Peter Raabe, Southeast regional director for the conservation group American Rivers.




Conservationists found instances of contractors cutting down healthy trees and removing live root balls, said Jon Stamper, river cleanup coordinator for MountainTrue, the North Carolina-based nonprofit conducting the French Broad work.

“Those trees kind of create fish habitats,” he said. “They slow the flow of water down. They're an important part of a river system, and we've seen kind of a disregard for that.”

The Army Corps of Engineers said in a statement that debris removal missions “are often challenging” due to the large volume storms can leave behind across a wide area. The Corps said it trains its contractors to minimize disturbances to waterways and to prevent harm to wildlife. North Carolina Emergency Management said debris removal after Helene took into account safety and the environment, and that projects reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency met that agency's standards for minimizing impact.

Hannah Woodburn, who tracks the headwaters and tributaries of the New River as MountainTrue's Upper New Riverkeeper, said waters are much muddier since Helene, both from storm-related vegetation loss and from heavy machinery used during cleanup.

She said it's been bad for the eastern hellbender, a “species of special concern” in North Carolina. It's one of only three giant salamanders found in the world, growing up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) long and weighing more than 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).

“After the storm, we had so many reports and pictures of dead hellbenders, some nearly a mile from the stream once the waters receded,” said Woodburn.

Of even greater concern is the Appalachian elktoe, a federally endangered mussel found only in the mountains of North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Helene hurt the Appalachian elktoe, but it also suffered from human-caused damage, said Mike Perkins, a state biologist.

Perkins said some contractors coordinated with conservation teams ahead of river cleanups and took precautions. Others were not so careful. 

He described snorkeling in the cold waters of the Little River and “finding crushed individuals, some of them still barely alive, some with their insides hanging out.” On that river, workers moved 60 Appalachian elktoe to a refuge site upstream. On the South Toe River, home to one of the most important populations, biologists collected a dozen and took them to a hatchery to store in tanks until it's safe to return them to the wild.

“It was shocking and unprecedented in my professional line of work in 15 years,” Perkins said of the incident. “There's all of these processes in place to prevent this secondary tragedy from happening, and none of it happened.”

Andrea Leslie, mountain habitat conservation coordinator with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, said she hopes the experience can inform future recovery efforts.

“To a certain degree, you can't do this perfectly,” she said. “They're in emergency mode. They're working to make sure that people are safe and that infrastructure is safe. And it's a big, complicated process. And there are multiple places in my observation where we could shift things to be more careful.”

Like the hellbender and the Appalachian elktoe, humans cling to the river, too.

Vickie and Paul Revis' home sat beside old U.S. 70 in a bend of the Swannanoa River. As Helene swept through, the Swannanoa took their home and scraped away a big chunk of their half-acre lot.

With the land paid for and no flood insurance payment to move away, they decided to stay put.

“When you own it and you're not rich, you know, you can't,” Vickie Revis said, staring across the river at a row of condemned commercial buildings.

After a year in a donated camper, they'll soon move into their new house — a double-wide modular home, also donated by a local Christian charity. It sits atop a 6-foot mound that Paul Revis piled up near the front of the property, farther from the river. 

Using rock, fill dirt and broken concrete dumped on his property by friendly debris-removal contractors, Paul has reclaimed the frontage the Swannanoa took. His wife planted it with marigolds for beauty and a weeping willow for stability. And they've purchased flood insurance.

“I hope I never see another one in my lifetime, and I'm hoping that if I do, it does hold up,” Vickie said. “I mean, that's all we can (do). Mother Nature does whatever she wants to do, and you just have to roll with it.”

Back on the French Broad, the tedious cleanup work continues. Many on the crew are rafting guides knocked out of work by the storm.

MountainTrue got a $10 million, 18-month grant from the state for the painstaking work of pulling small debris from the rivers and streams. Since July, teams have removed more than 75 tons from about a dozen rivers across five watersheds.

Red-tailed hawks and osprey circle high overhead as the flotilla glides past banks lined with willow, sourwood and sycamore, ablaze with goldenrod and jewelweed. That peacefulness belies its fury of a year ago that upended so many lives. 

“There are so many people who are living in western North Carolina right now that feel very afraid of our rivers,” said Liz McGuirl, a crew member who managed a hair salon before Helene put her out of work. “They feel hurt. They feel betrayed.”

Downstream, as McGuirl hauled up a length of pipe, another catfish swam out.

“We're creating a habitat, but it's just the wrong habitat,” crew leader Leslie Beninato said ruefully. “I'd like to give them a tree as a home, maybe, instead of a pipe.”

Two American TikTokers show why Japan's 7-Elevens are going viral, from matcha lattes and onigiri to the famous egg salad sandwich.

American 7-Elevens may soon look more like their Japanese counterparts – with fresh meals and cult-favorite items that have long lured tourists to Tokyo's convenience stores.

Seven & i Holdings, the parent company of 7-Eleven, is planning a major upgrade to U.S. stores, adding higher-quality prepared foods, such as Japan's beloved egg salad sandwich.

"We have consistently emphasized our focus on food," the company told Fox News Digital in a statement. "In Japan, fresh food accounts for over 30% of total sales," it said, noting that the strategy helps its stores pull in about 30% more revenue per day than rivals.

The company is weighing more than $13 billion in international investments over the next several years, much of it earmarked for upgrades and supplier networks to bring prepared meals to roughly 13,000 North American stores. 

It also plans to double U.S. store openings from 125 to more than 250 per year, adding 1,300 in the next five years.

"There is significant growth potential, but to fully realize it, we must enhance our organizational capabilities and are actively working on these initiatives," Seven & i said.

Japan's 7-Elevens – nearly 22,000 nationwide – are famed for everything from cheap meals to bill-pay services. By comparison, the U.S. has some 9,500 total stores.

One of the top offerings expected in this country is the egg salad sandwich, made with fluffy milk bread and Kewpie mayonnaise. 

A Texas-based team is already working with Japanese suppliers to replicate the recipe, CEO Stephen Dacus, who took the helm in May, told The New York Times.

The hype has fueled a wave of foodie tourism online.

"I flew 14 hours all the way to Japan just to try 7-Eleven," Washington, D.C.-based influencer Darcy McQueeny said in an April TikTok video that got over 4 million views.

She stocked up on the egg salad and another fan favorite, the strawberries and cream sandwich. She also perused other hot sellers like onigiri – a type of rice ball stuffed with fillings like tuna and wrapped in seaweed – and a massive selection of fresh fruit.

"And it's so affordable," McQueeny said.

During a July visit to Tokyo, Los Angeles model and influencer Summer Marshall grabbed much of the same, plus ice cream in a squeeze pouch, a sealed cup of ice and an iced latte to try an internet-famous ice coffee hack.

"7-Eleven in the U.S. could never," Marshall captioned a TikTok video that got over 1 million views.

Singer Sabrina Carpenter went to a Japanese convenience store while touring in 2023 and received over 600,000 likes in a video about it. "I've wanted to do a 7-Eleven Japan haul since the day I was born," she joked in her video.

The craze sparked a 5,000% spike in Google searches for "7/11 Japan" over the summer, according to Fast Company, and some travel companies now offer guided convenience store visits.

Despite the buzz, the U.S. market could be tougher. For decades, 7-Eleven has been linked more with sodas, snacks and hot dogs.

Rivals have tried and failed. FamilyMart shuttered its U.S. stores in 2015 after struggling to attract customers beyond gas-station food.

Alongside food upgrades, the company plans to expand its 7Now delivery app.

Cultural differences also play a role. In Japan, small kitchens and apartments drive people to convenience stores multiple times a day. Frequent deliveries – often two or three times daily – keep shelves stocked with fresh meals, a logistical model not yet standard in the U.S.

"There is significant growth potential, but to fully realize it, we must enhance our organizational capabilities and are actively working on these initiatives," Seven & i said.

Jeff Lenard, vice president of media and strategic communications at the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), said demand is strong within the $650 billion convenience store industry, and profit margins are far higher on prepared food and beverages than on fuel.

"The average driver fills up once a week but eats three times a day," Lenard told Fox News Digital.

He said cultural trends are also helping. "There's already an appetite for Asian culture, from music to streaming shows," he said.

Over the past 20 years, food service sales have more than doubled from 11.9% in 2004 to 27.7% in 2024, according to the NACS.

Lenard said the shift has changed public perception.

"In 'National Lampoon's Vacation' from 1983, Clark Griswold got laughs saying, 'I'm so hungry I could eat a sandwich from a gas station.' Today, that joke wouldn't land because convenience stores have become destinations for sandwiches and meals."

            The US Commerce Department said Wednesday that it had opened new national security investigations into the import of personal protective equipment, medical items, robotics and industrial machinery.
    


            The “Section 232” investigations, which were opened on September 2 but not publicly disclosed previously, could be used as a basis for even higher tariffs on a wide swath of medical and industrial goods including imported face masks, syringes and infusion pumps, as well as for robotics and industrial machinery like programmable computer-controlled mechanical systems and industrial stamping and pressing machines.
    


            The probe asks companies to detail projected demand for robotics and industrial machinery and the extent to which “domestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand,” as well as the role of foreign supply chains in meeting US demand.
    


            The US Commerce Department is particularly interested in the role of major exporters like China in meeting US medical needs and the “impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices.”
    


            The potential tariffs could also cover surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves, gowns and other medical and surgical instruments and supplies including IV bags, gauze/bandages, sutures, wheelchairs, crutches and hospital beds.

            The probe also covers pacemakers, insulin pumps, coronary stents, heart valves, hearing aids, prosthetics, blood glucose monitors, orthopedic appliances, computed tomography scanners and magnetic resonance imaging machines.
    


Pharmaceuticals including prescription drugs, as well as drones, are part of separate 232 probes.
    


            The robotics probe includes machine tools for cutting, welding and handling workpieces, autoclaves and industrial ovens. Laser and water-cutting tools and machinery are also included.
    


            The department has opened numerous probes into the national security ramifications of imports of wind turbines, airplanes, semiconductors, heavy trucks, polysilicon, copper, timber and lumber and critical minerals.

President Donald Trump's hints at bringing a new lawsuit against ABC appear to lack legal teeth, according to experts and recent judicial precedent.

Trump on Tuesday responded to Jimmy Kimmel's return to airwaves by alleging that the late-night host “is yet another arm of the DNC” representing “a major illegal Campaign Contribution.”

“I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative.”

Trump has leaned heavily on the courts during his second term to challenge media outlets, but as of Wednesday night, the president's legal team has not brought a new lawsuit against ABC, for predictable reasons, according to experts.

Brett Kappel, a campaign finance attorney with Harmon, Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg, told Forbes that Kimmel's on-air comments are “clearly covered” as protected speech by the Federal Election Commission's media exemption and do not amount to campaign contributions, as Trump claimed.

While the FEC explicitly bars media corporations from directly contributing to campaigns, the media exemption specifically allows for broadcasting stations or periodical publications to publish “any news story, commentary, or editorial” that may influence an election, as long as an involved candidate or political party does not own the station or publication.

Election law scholar Ned Foley similarly wrote in a Wednesday blog post that Trump's threat is “incredibly alarming” on First Amendment and election law grounds. 

“Accusing ABC of being an arm of the DNC and its content as being an illegal campaign contribution is the equivalent of accusing any media outlet of engaging in prohibited speech simply for engaging in political commentary,” he wrote, pointing to the FEC's media exemption. “There is no credible claim, despite Trump's insinuation, that ABC is ‘owned or controlled by' the Democratic National Committee, just as there would be no credible claim that The New York Times or any other liberal-leaning media outlet is.”

White House officials directed inquiries about a possible new lawsuit against ABC back to the president's Tuesday statement on Truth Social.

The Supreme Court previously ruled in 1963's Bantam Books v. Sullivan that government officials or bodies cannot leverage government authority to censor private parties.

“People do not lightly disregard public officers' thinly veiled threats to institute criminal proceedings against them if they do not come around,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote at the time. “It would be naïve to credit the state's assertion that these blacklists are in the nature of mere legal advice, when they plainly serve as instruments of regulation independent of the laws against obscenity.”

And the court itself reaffirmed Bantam Books last year, when the National Rifle Association, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union, claimed a New York state official had violated the First Amendment by pressuring companies to end their ties to the NRA in the wake of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

“Bantam Books stands for the principle that a government official cannot do indirectly what she is barred from doing directly: A government official cannot coerce a private party to punish or suppress disfavored speech on her behalf,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a unanimous opinion for the court.

Trump does have a long history of suing media companies, including a handful of successful lawsuits filed on the 2024 campaign trail and since entering office in January.

In December of last year, as referenced in Trump's Tuesday night statement responding to Kimmel's return, ABC settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos for $15 million.

Paramount settled a lawsuit with the president's legal team in July for $16 million regarding an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired ahead of the 2024 general election.

Though the White House technically lost a lawsuit brought by the Associated Press this spring, the president was still able to spin it as a win for his base by amending the way that all wire publications were included in the routine press pool rotations.

Still, a number of the president's legal fights with the media remain unresolved or have been thrown out of court.

Earlier in September, a federal judge threw out Trump's $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times, although the decision did give Trump's legal team a month to refile.

And in July, the president brought a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and owner Rupert Murdoch regarding the paper's coverage of a letter, allegedly penned by Trump to disgraced financier and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, to be included in a book gifted to the latter for his 50th birthday.

Trump administration officials and Republicans are pointing the finger at Democrats as having incited violence against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.

The latest in a string of physical attacks against federal immigration officers this year occurred on Wednesday at an ICE field office in Dallas, where a gunman whose rounds espoused an “anti-ICE” sentiment opened fire and killed one detainee while critically wounding two others.

The attack came two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a university in Utah.

Republicans are now seeking to draw a direct correlation between the threats and claims that Democratic politicians and far-left leaders have made against ICE and the increase in political violence.

Vice President JD Vance spoke about the incident in Concord, North Carolina, and said evidence not yet made public confirmed that the shooter was “politically motivated to go after people who are enforcing our border.”

“Here's what happens when Democrats like Gavin Newsom say that these people are part of an authoritarian government, when the left-wing media lies about what they're doing, when they lie about who they are arresting, when they lie about the actual job of law enforcement — what they are doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence,” Vance added. “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees ICE, blamed the attack on “hatred” for ICE preached by politicians in the Democratic Party.

“For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Noem said in a statement. “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also blamed Democrats' “demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee said the violence seen on Wednesday was “the direct result of Democrats' long pattern of dangerous anti-ICE rhetoric, consistently putting criminal illegal immigrants first and demonizing law enforcement.”

Last month, the same ICE field office received a bomb threat from a man identified as Bratton Dean Wilkinson. Wilkinson allegedly showed up at the entrance to the building and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack, prompting the facility to go on lockdown as the SWAT team responded.

A dozen individuals who showed up in tactical gear carrying weapons at ICE's detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, in early July have been charged with attempting to ambush the building and shooting a local police officer.

On July 4, rioters assaulted federal agents at an ICE facility in Portland and targeted them with an “incendiary device.”

Back in May, a city council member in Worcester, Massachusetts, helped to incite a mob into attacking ICE officers and local police as they attempted to make an arrest. A Massachusetts police union called on Etel Haxhiaj to face federal charges for organizing the violence.

Many incidents of sitting Democratic members of Congress comparing ICE to Nazis and the Gestapo have been made on social media and in public settings since the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown commenced in January.

Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-CA) shared an ICE officer's personal information with protesters. Officers cover their faces and names for personal safety, given the doxing and stalking incidents they have seen from those who oppose the agency's work.

Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (R-NJ), attempted to break past the fence into an ICE facility in New Jersey earlier this spring. McIver was arrested on charges of assaulting a federal officer while attempting to enter. McIver was indicted on federal charges in June and faces up to 17 years in prison if convicted.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said ICE was comparable to “some 1800s bank robber or some KGB officer in Russia.”

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Congressional Hispanic Caucus chairman, said in July that the Trump administration's refusal to facilitate the visitations was a “threat to our democracy.”

Over the weekend, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law meant to curtail ICE from carrying out as many arrests throughout the state on the basis that Trump's immigration raids were “lawless.”

Other laws included policies barring ICE from accessing schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and requiring schools, colleges, and universities to alert parents when ICE is on campus.

One such law, SB 627, made it illegal for local police and sheriff's department employees, federal police, and state police from states other than California to wear face masks while working. California state police were exempt from the face mask ban.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has previously threatened to unmask ICE agents, even comparing their operations to “the Soviet Union.”

On Wednesday afternoon, Jeffries joined House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (D-TX) to issue a statement that called the Dallas shooting “horrifying” and went on to thank police who responded.

“No one in America should be violently targeted, including our men and women in law enforcement who protect and serve our neighborhoods, and the immigrants who are too often the victims of dehumanizing rhetoric,” the three House Democrats said in a joint statement, before blaming Trump for the violence. “The political and ideologically-motivated violence in America has reached a breaking point this year. We need leaders who bring the country together in moments of crisis – and that is what is required right now.”

ROUNDS FOUND NEAR DALLAS SHOOTING SUSPECT HAD ‘ANTI-ICE' MESSAGE: FBI

Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin also followed suit and thanked police “who ran toward danger” before adding that the violence was not one-sided.

“It will take all of us — not just one side of the aisle or the other — to quell this epidemic of violence, which has no place in our democracy,” Martin said in a statement. “Democrats remain committed to resolving differences through debate and elections, not with weapons. We also remain committed to enacting commonsense solutions to curb gun violence all across our country.”

Recruitment flyers featuring the words engraved on the bullet casings of the man who shot and killed Charlie Kirk were reportedly distributed and hung around Georgetown University‘s campus. 

Advertisements for the “John Brown Club” used the words, “Hey, fascist! Catch!” some of the very words engraved on bullet casings by alleged Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson. The circular included a QR code to scan for those interested in joining. It advertised the club as “the only political group that celebrates when Nazis die.”

Upon scanning the code, users are directed to a Google Docs sign-up page welcoming them to join the club. The page informs interested parties of the club's intentions before asking for email addresses. The greeting describing the club includes a misspelling of “know.”

“We're building a community that's done with ceremonial resistance and strongly worded letters. If you want to make a real change in your community, let us now [sic] below.”

Georgetown University officials removed the flyers later in the day. The “John Brown Club” does not appear to be officially associated with Georgetown University, as no club or organization by that name was listed among the existing undergraduate or graduate student clubs and organizations. 

The Washington Examiner emailed Georgetown University for clarification and comment about the posters and the “John Brown Club.”

John Brown was a 19th-century abolitionist in the United States. He first gained prominence during the violent clashes of the “Bleeding Kansas” crisis in the 1850s between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in Kansas before it achieved statehood. Brown is particularly known for his roles in violent abolitionist efforts in the Pottawatomie massacre and the raid on Harpers Ferry, a federal arsenal in West Virginia. Brown was caught after the raid failed and was charged with treason. He was eventually executed for his actions. 

Education Secretary Linda McMahon criticized the posters in a post on X on Wednesday evening. She mentioned she spoke with university officials, who agreed to take them down. 

I am aware of the appalling posters that were displayed on Georgetown's campus today. At a moment like this, Georgetown has to determine what it stands for as an institution. ED officials have spoken to Georgetown administrators, who made the decision to remove the flyers.…

“I am aware of the appalling posters that were displayed on Georgetown's campus today,” McMahon posted. 

“At a moment like this, Georgetown has to determine what it stands for as an institution,” she added. “ED officials have spoken to Georgetown administrators, who made the decision to remove the flyers. Campus police are investigating the incident and will deploy resources to protect students as necessary.” 

Allowing violent rhetoric to fester on our nation's campuses without consequences is dangerous. It must be condemned by institutional leaders,” McMahon said.

The education secretary also thanked the people who “spoke out against this and made noise about the posters on campus.

“I am grateful to those who spoke out against this and made noise about the posters on campus — you made a difference. There is power in speaking up to reveal these hateful ideologies that have incited deadly violence. Keep fighting for good!”

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” audience members say the late-night host was emotional but didn't apologize when he returned after a nearly weeklong suspension. (Sept. 23)




NEW YORK (AP) — Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night television Tuesday after a nearly weeklong suspension and, in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, said that he wasn't trying to joke about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

“I have no illusions about changing anyone's mind, but I do want to make something clear, because it's important to me as a human and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” Kimmel said. “I don't think there's anything funny about it.”

He added that he wasn't trying to blame any specific group “for the actions of what ... was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make.” He said he understood his remarks last week to some “felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both.”




But he made no apologies. And he criticized the ABC affiliates who took his show off the air. Two stations groups that represent about a quarter of ABC stations, Sinclair and Nexstar, ordered their outlets not to show Kimmel on Tuesday.

“That's not American. It's un-American,” he said.



The incident triggered a national discussion about freedom of speech and President Donald Trump's ability to police the words of journalists, commentators and even comics. ABC suspended Kimmel's show last Wednesday following criticism of his remarks about the aftermath of Kirk's killing. But the network brought him back following a backlash against parent company Disney.

Kimmel thanked many supporters, including fellow late-night hosts past and present and even a former boss at a radio station in Seattle who checked in with him last week. He also singled out people he knows aren't fans of his comedy but stood up for his right to speak, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

“It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration,” he said. “They did, and they deserve credit for it.”

Kimmel nearly broke down again in praising Kirk's widow, Erika, who publicly forgave her husband's killer.

“That is an example we should follow,” he said. “If you believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was ... A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply. And I hope it touches many. And if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that. And not this.”

Kimmel admitted that he was mad when ABC suspended him, but praised his bosses for putting him back on the air. “Unjustly, this puts them at risk.”

He mocked Trump for criticizing him for bad ratings. “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show,” Kimmel said.

The decisions by Sinclair and Nexstar left ABC stations in Washington, D.C.; St. Louis; Nashville, Tennessee, and Richmond, Virginia among the cities airing something else. WJLA-TV, the Sinclair-owned station in Washington, instead aired a newscast and an episode of the chain's show, “The National Desk.”

Kimmel's suspension came after an angry reaction to comments he made in monologues early last week. A relentless Trump critic in his comedy, Kimmel suggested that many Trump supporters were trying to capitalize on Kirk's death and were “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”



Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr last week said it appeared that Kimmel was trying to “directly mislead the American public” with his remarks about Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old Utah man charged with Kirk's killing, and his motives. Those motives remain unclear. Authorities say Robinson grew up in a conservative family, but his mother told investigators his son had turned left politically in the last year.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said before ABC announced the suspension. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

Those remarks were key to the backlash, with Cruz saying that Carr acted like “a mafioso.” Hundreds of entertainment luminaries, including Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand and Jennifer Aniston, signed a letter circulated by the American Civil Liberties Union that called ABC's move “a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.”

Podcaster Joe Rogan weighed in Tuesday on Kimmel's side. “I definitely don't think that the government should be involved — ever — in dictating what a comedian can or can't say in a monologue,” Rogan said. “You are crazy for supporting this because this will be used on you.”

Some consumers punished ABC parent Disney by canceling subscriptions to its streaming services.

Trump had hailed Kimmel's suspension and criticized his return, writing on his Truth Social platform: “I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back ... Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE.”

Actor Robert De Niro appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Tuesday, impersonating Carr being interviewed by Kimmel. De Niro, as Carr, said the FCC had a new motto, “Sticks and stones can break your bones.”

Isn't there more to the saying, Kimmel asked, that words can never hurt you?

“They can hurt you now,” De Niro responded, saying you have to make sure to say the right ones.

Kimmel took the stage to a long standing ovation and chants of “Jimmy, Jimmy.” One audience member, Walter Bates, said after the taping that Kimmel's discussion of Kirk's widow “was a very moving moment. I got very emotional and so did my wife.”

Trump's administration has used threats, lawsuits and federal government pressure to try to exert more control over the media industry. Trump sued ABC and CBS over news coverage, which the companies settled. Trump has also filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, and successfully urged Congress to strip federal funding from NPR and PBS.

After pulling out of her planned performance at the premiere of Hulu's Lilith Fair documentary in protest over Kimmel's suspension, singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan appeared on Kimmel's show as the musical guest. McLachlan had been booked on the show prior to the preemption, a representative told The Associated Press.

The other guest was actor Glen Powell.

The suspension happened at a time when the late-night landscape is shifting. Shows are losing viewers, in part because many watch highlights the next day online. CBS announced the cancellation of “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert's show over the summer. Kimmel's contract with ABC reportedly lasts through May.

Colbert, in his own monologue Monday shortly after ABC announced Kimmel would return, grabbed his recently won Emmy Award for outstanding talk series, saying, “Once more, I am the only martyr on late night!”

Violet Affleck, the 19-year-old daughter of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, took the stage at the United Nations this week, calling for urgent action on clean air, pandemic protections, and broader social justice issues.

Speaking at the “Healthy Indoor Air: A Global Call to Action” event in New York, the Yale freshman framed her generation as one already living with the failures of global leadership.

“I represent a generation that in many ways already knows how we've been failed,” she said. “We are no strangers to protesting injustice. This summer alone has seen youth uprisings in Nepal, Angola, and Indonesia, to say nothing of ongoing youth mobilization worldwide for a free Palestine. And wherever we live, we've grown up in the shadow of the climate crisis with the threats, sacrifices, and scarcities that [it] will entail, looming over us.”

She added: “We know what that means for our lives in no small part, thanks to the people in this room. And we are told by leaders across the board that we are the future. But when it comes to the ongoing pandemic, our present is being stolen right in front of our eyes.”

Affleck, who wore a face mask while delivering her remarks, then shifted her focus to COVID-19 and long-term health concerns.

“Here's what we know about SARS-CoV-2. It is airborne floating and lingering in the air. One infection can result in disabling damage to almost every cell in the body from the brain and heart to the nerves and blood vessels,” she said. “Every subsequent infection increases the risk of long COVID and places people who already have it in greater danger.”

She described her fears for children facing a lifetime of post-viral illness.

“I am terrified for the children who do not, or soon will not, know a world without debilitating pain and exhaustion,” she said. “And I am furious on their behalf. It is neglect of the highest order to look children in the eyes and say, ‘we knew how to protect you and we didn't do it.'”

The 19-year-old urged the international community to treat clean indoor air as a basic right, comparing it to the historic fight against indoor smoking. 

“We can recognize filtered air as a human right, as intuitively as we do filtered water,” she said. “We can create clean air infrastructure that is so ubiquitous and so obviously necessary, tomorrow's children don't even know why we need it.”

Affleck closed by urging older generations to keep their promises made during the height of the pandemic. 

“We need the people who remember 2020, who were not like me, 14 in 2020, to be loud about the world that we were promised at the onset of the pandemic … And we need the people who are born now, we owe it to the people who are born now, that they take that world for granted.”

Her remarks quickly drew strong responses online.

“The U.N. is an increasingly unserious place. Why are they just letting rich nepo babies get up there and rant with masks on?” influencer Link Lauren asked.

“What the hell did those two do to their daughter,” Newsmax host Rob Schmitt said on X.

“Ben Affleck's daughter needs an immediate Psychiatric Evaluation. She has been wearing a mask for 5 YEARS,” another user claimed.

“Can celebrities have normal children?” one commenter asked.

“Why is an Affleck child speaking at the UN? Why would she get to speak anywhere??” Jennifer Sey, former Levi's executive and gymnast, asked on X.

“Hey @BenAffleck, come get your kid,” another person posted.

“Her speech just gave me the strength to keep the work going,” an X user cheered her on.

This is not Violet Affleck's first time making headlines with her activism. In 2023, she was spotted wearing a watermelon “freedom” sweatshirt, widely recognized as a pro-Palestinian symbol. Wear The Peace sells the garment, and the proceeds go to Gaza aid efforts.

In 2024, she testified before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, demanding expanded access to masks, ventilation improvements in government buildings, and opposition to mask bans.

KIMMEL DOESN'T APOLOGIZE, OFFERS CLARIFICATION ON CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS IN RETURN TO TALK SHOW

Her mother, actress Jennifer Garner, has also waded into politics and activism. She campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race and supported Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Garner has also publicly celebrated Pride Month, wrapping rainbow-colored decorations around her yard trees, and was photographed in June 2024 drumming alongside activists wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh.

Affleck's younger sibling, Fin, formerly known as Seraphina, publicly used the memorial service of Garner's father to share their new name and identity for the first time in April 2024.

The White House budget office is urging federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans if the government shuts down next week.

An Office of Management and Budget memo obtained by Punchbowl News on Wednesday detailed the administration's personnel plans for a shutdown, which go beyond the standard furloughs.

The memo asks agencies to find programs, projects, and activities, or PPAs, for which discretionary funding will lapse on Oct. 1, no alternative funding source is available, and the cuts are not consistent with “the president's priorities.” These cuts would be part of the standard reduction-in-force plans.

These PPAs would be permanently eliminated, turning the government shutdown into an opportunity for the Trump administration to further slim down the government. The OMB says programs “that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown.”

The memo largely blames Democrats for any possible shutdown. Both parties have been at a standoff concerning how to fund the government. President Donald Trump recently refused a meeting with Democratic leaders, citing their alleged “unserious and ridiculous demands.”

“Unfortunately, congressional Democrats are signaling that they intend to break this bipartisan trend and shut down the government in the coming days over a series of insane demands, including $1 trillion in new spending,” the memo says.

“We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown, and the steps outlinedabove will not be necessary. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree,” the memo concludes.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries ripped OMB Director Russell Vought over the plans, calling him a “malignant political hack,” while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said of the plans, “This is an attempt at intimidation. Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one—not to govern, but to scare.”

“These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today,” Schumer added.

Vought spearheaded the administration's initial government cuts.

An anonymous OMB official told Politico that programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and air traffic control will continue regardless of the shutdown.TRUMP TO TARGET ‘RADICAL-LEFT' GROUPS FUNDING VIOLENCE THAT LED TO CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH

Trump issued a statement Wednesday calling for the government to remain open and telling Democrats that the ball “is in your court,” to which Schumer and Jeffries both responded on X, “We're realistic about what the country needs so we're ready. When and where?”

The Washington Examiner reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response.

DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and wounding two others in a transport van before taking his own life, authorities said.

The suspect was identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S., coming two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on a deadly shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Texas.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety, and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that shots were fired “indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport,” a secure and gated entryway.




The wounded detainees were in critical condition at a hospital, said DHS, which previously said two detainees were killed and one was wounded before issuing a correction.

No ICE agents were injured.

By the evening, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by DHS on the social platform X.

At a midday news conference, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”




Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. and determined that someone had opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathan E. Maner said via email.

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

“I was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God, no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a suburban Dallas home that public records link to Jahn.

It sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a Fairview police vehicle, but officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

Martyna Kowalczyk, CEO of Texas-based Solartime USA, said in a statement that Jahn worked for her company for less than a few months “many years ago.”

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, according to Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He's a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told AP. “I don't remember him being that abnormal. He didn't seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

Sanderson said he tried to keep Jahn longer because he “felt bad for him.”

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence. 

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson called the shooting not just an attack on law enforcement and the victims but “an attack on our community and on our nation's heritage of civil and democratic discourse.”

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

“Violence must never be allowed to define how we respond to migration,” said Anna Gallagher, the group's executive director. 

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside the Dallas ICE facility every Monday said: “Violence doesn't heal anything.” 

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and report for check-ins.

Sipe said she has noticed in recent months that people who enter are shuttled away on buses.

“They're taking them away, and we don't know where they're taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4 attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him.

And in suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump's administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center. Sixteen people have been arrested outside, according to authorities who called the activists “rioters.”

Dozens of field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some located in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

Some, like Dallas, have exposed loading areas for buses, which pose risks for escape and outside attack, Torres said. Other vulnerabilities are nearby vantage points for snipers and long lines forming outside without protection.

“I would assure you that ICE, after today, is going to be a taking a hard look at physical security assessments for all of their facilities,” said Torres, currently head of security and technology consulting at Guidepost Solutions.

Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on Thursday argued that the Supreme Court should reject President Donald Trump's request that he be allowed to fire her pending the outcome of her lawsuit challenging her removal.

"The President's stay application asks this Court to act on an emergency basis to eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board," Cook's lawyers wrote in a new filing with the Supreme Court.

Trump has asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders that block him from firing Cook while her suit plays out.

The president said in late August that he was firing her because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud. She denies those claims.

Earlier Thursday, a group that included every living former Federal Reserve chair, along with a number of former Treasury secretaries and former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers urged the Supreme Court to deny Trump's request to fire Cook for now.

The Supreme Court could at any time rule on Trump's request.

If the high court allows Trump to remove her, it would leave the door open for her to be reinstated once the justices rule on the merits of her lawsuit.

The key question in Cook's case is whether Trump has legal cause as required by the Federal Reserve Act to fire her.

In their filing Thursday, Cook's lawyers said that Trump was citing "flimsy, unproven allegations of pre-office wrongdoing — allegations conveniently timed following the President's criticisms of the Board's policy decisions."

Trump had complained for months that the Fed's board was not cutting interest rates as he wanted. The Fed last week lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point, with Cook participating in that decision.

"This Court should deny the President's extraordinary application because his arguments defy established precedent and longstanding practice," Cook's lawyers said in their filing.

"This litigation has barely begun, and further factfinding could avoid the need for this Court to decide the high-stakes legal issues raised in the President's application," her lawyers wrote. "On the merits, this Court is likely to reject each of the President's legal theories. Specifically, the Court is likely to hold that because Governor Cook is removable only for cause, she is entitled to notice, opportunity for a hearing, and judicial review before she is removed."

The lawyers wrote that the Supreme Court is "likely" to ultimately ruled that the "for cause" standard provided by the Federal Reserve Act is meaningful protection for a Fed governor, "and is not satisfied by manufactured charges based on conduct that pre-dates her service on the Board."

The gunman who killed one detainee and wounded two others at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas was trying to target ICE personnel and appeared to be planning his attack for months, authorities said Thursday.

The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn of Texas, "specifically intended to kill ICE agents" in Wednesday's ambush, said Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, at a news conference.

Rothrock said Jahn obtained a bolt-action rifle in August, suggesting his plans began "months in advance."

The strongest evidence of motive came from Jahn's own words in a collection of notes found when FBI agents searched the shooter's residence after the attack, Rothrock said.

Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said that Jahn described ICE employees as "people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck" in one of those notes.

The notes also included a plan of attack and target areas, and they indicated that he did not want to kill or harm detainees.

Jahn also explicitly states in the notes, "Yes, it was just me," Larson said. Authorities said they believe the shooter acted alone, though the investigation is ongoing.

Jahn's actions are "the very definition of terrorism," Larson said.

The news conference came hours after FBI Director Kash Patel said in an X post that Jahn had searched online for "Charlie Kirk Shot Video" as recently as the day of the attack.

Jahn also recently searched apps tracking the presence of ICE agents and downloaded a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said in the post.

Patel said agents recovered a handwritten note reading, "Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'"

Those details and other accumulated evidence indicate "a high degree of pre-attack planning" by Jahn, Patel said.

Authorities said Jahn fired "indiscriminately" at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop on Wednesday.

He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound following the attack.

The two wounded ICE detainees remained in critical condition on Thursday, an agency spokesperson told NBC News. No ICE agents were wounded in the attack.

The shooter's search for video of the shooting of Kirk, the conservative activist who was assassinated during a crowded event in Utah earlier this month, could add to the evidence about his motive for the attack.

The FBI has already revealed that unspent shell casings found near the shooter bore "anti-ICE" messaging.

Jahn's brother, Noah Jahn, told NBC he was surprised by the political messaging.

"I didn't think he was politically interested," Noah Jahn said of his brother. "He wasn't interested in politics on either side as far as I knew."

Joshua Jahn was registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, NBC reported. He has also been linked to addresses in Texas.

ICE said in a statement Wednesday evening that the shooter opened fire on the building and at a transport van located at the facility's sallyport.

All three detainees were shot while inside that van.

There were five to seven others in the van who avoided the bullet spray, an ICE official told NBC. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told NBC's Tom Llamas that his agents pulled some of those detainees out of the line of fire.

"The shooter was just shooting at random vehicles inside," Lyons said. "There were some brave men and women on the ground that went into those vans, were pulling those detainees out while they're under fire."

Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said that because of the Dallas attack and other incidents, "DHS will immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country."

Migrant check-in appointments at the Dallas ICE facility scheduled for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have all been postponed until Monday.

In this article

Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi's MGX will be main investors in TikTok's U.S. business, sources told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday. 

Those three entities will control roughly 45% of TikTok USA, Faber reported. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent, will own 19.9%, with the remaining 35% in the hands of ByteDance investors and new holders.

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday backing the proposed deal that will keep the social media app running in the U.S. ByteDance has faced an ultimatum under a federal law requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S. That law passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress who expressed national security concerns about the app and its potent content algorithm.

Last week, Trump signed an executive order delaying the divestiture deadline until Dec. 16.

Trump has been trying to keep the app afloat, repeatedly mentioning how important it was to his presidential victory in November. Billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass is a major ByteDance investor through Susquehanna, and he also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social, Trump's social media company.

Backers of ByteDance, including General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok USA, sources told Faber.

The deal does not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a so-called golden share in TikTok's U.S. operations, CNBC reported Monday. The new joint venture will have a board of directors comprised of a majority of American members, and Oracle will oversee the app's security operations.

Trump said Sunday that conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch could be involved in the TikTok deal as well as Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.

Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission on Thursday, resolving a case over its Prime subscription sign-up and cancellation practices that Business Insider exposed in an exclusive investigation.

The settlement is the largest civil penalty in a case involving an FTC rule violation, the regulator said.

BI's 2022 report, based on internal Amazon documents, showed that the company had known since at least 2017 that its website design misled customers into joining Prime, the membership program that offers perks such as free delivery and video streaming.

Despite years of complaints, Amazon took little meaningful action, and in some cases, abandoned proposed fixes after internal tests showed slower subscription growth, according to Business Insider's investigation. Following the story, the FTC revived a long-dormant probe, according to its earlier complaint.

"On March 14, 2022, Business Insider published information leaked from current and former Amazon employees regarding the problems with Amazon's Prime checkout enrollment flow and the Iliad Flow," the FTC wrote in a previous filing. "The Commission quickly ascertained that Amazon had failed to disclose much of the now-leaked documents and information to the Commission, despite the fact that at least some of it was responsive to the outstanding CID. Amazon withheld the information."

As part of Thursday's settlement, Amazon will pay a $1 billion penalty and refund consumers $1.5 billion, the FTC announced. The deal, reached three days after a Seattle jury was seated, bans Amazon and two executives from continuing the unlawful practices. It also requires Amazon to implement "meaningful changes" to its Prime enrollment and cancellation processes, ensuring transparent disclosures and streamlined procedures.

"The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription," FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement.

An Amazon spokesperson told BI in an email that there was "no admission of guilt in this settlement by the company or any executives."

"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers. We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we'll deliver for Prime members in the coming years," the spokesperson said.

Citadel CEO Ken Griffin on Thursday knocked the Trump administration for making deals with large corporations to avoid the full extent of its tariff policies, describing such agreements as anti-American.

"Is that our country, that we're going to favor the big and the connected?," Griffin told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from Miami. "That's not the American story."

"When the state becomes involved in picking winners and losers, there's only one way this game ends: All of us lose," added Griffin, a billionaire and top Wall Street figure.

Griffin's comments come as U.S. companies have raced to make agreements with the White House that allow them to avoid the steepest levies placed on imports from many foreign countries. Multiple well-known businesses including Apple and Nvidia have announced significant domestic investments in recent months, which have been viewed by some as ways to gain favor from the Trump administration.

"I spoke about my concerns with the crony capitalism if we went down the path of tariffs," Griffin said. "The line outside the White House of every business arguing why they should be exempt from paying tariffs on what they import into their products is nauseating."

The Wall Street bigwig said tariffs can be considered similar to a "national sales tax." Because the levies would make up a higher proportion of household income for lower earners, Griffin said there are "issues of equity and fairness" involved with Trump's tariff policy.

Griffin warned that companies should act carefully when it comes to trying to win favor of a current White House team. He said those companies could find themselves disliked or having to make new deals when a new person takes the nation's highest office.

"It's the government's engagement in picking winners and losers. And we should tread carefully on that water," Griffin said. "In fact, we should just stay out of it. That's where the crocodiles live."

"The core competency won't be that you can drive innovation," he added. "It's that you can drive the right favors from D.C."

Microsoft said Thursday that it has stopped providing certain services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The company did not say which specific services it had stopped providing.

The decision comes after the software company investigated an August report from The Guardian saying the Israeli Defense Forces' Unit 8200 had built a system for tracking Palestinians' phone calls.

"While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, wrote in an email to employees. "This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services."

Microsoft's decision to stop providing those services follows pressure from employees who have protested Israel's use of the company's company's software as part of its invasion of Gaza. Over the last few weeks, Microsoft has fired five employees who participated in protests at company headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

The move comes a week after a United Nations commission said that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians with its invasion of Gaza.

Microsoft told Israeli defense officials that it had decided to disable cloud-based storage an artificial intelligence subscriptions the agency was using, Smith wrote. He said Microsoft does not look at customer data for the type of review it conducted, and he thanked the British newspaper for its reporting on the development.

"As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust," Smith wrote.

On Thursday The Guardian reported that unnamed intelligence sources had said Unit 8200 was planning to migrate its supply of the phone calls to Amazon Web Services, the market-leading public cloud. AWS did not immediately comment.

WATCH: Israel's global standing is 'desperately at risk because of the suffering of Palestinian civilians,' says Sen. Chris Coons

Amazon will pay $2.5 billion to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that the company duped users into paying for Prime memberships, the regulatory agency announced Thursday.

The surprise settlement comes as Amazon and the FTC were just three days into the trial in a Seattle federal court. Opening arguments in the case occurred Tuesday, but the settlement allows Amazon to avoid having a jury at the trial return a verdict with potentially larger damages than the settlement with the FTC.

The lawsuit, filed by the FTC in June 2023 under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon deceived tens of millions of customers into signing up for its Prime subscription program and sabotaged their attempts to cancel it. Three senior Amazon executives were at risk of being held individually liable if the jury sided with the FTC.

Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty to the FTC and will refund $1.5 billion to an estimated 35 million customers impacted by "unwanted Prime enrollment or deferred cancellation," the agency said. Under the terms of the settlement, Amazon will give $51 to eligible customers within 90 days. 

Amazon admitted no wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, the FTC said.

The agreement prohibits Amazon from misrepresenting the terms of Prime. It also requires the company to make clear and conspicuous disclosures about the terms of the program during enrollment, and says Amazon must get consumers' express consent before charging them for a subscription. Amazon also has to provide an easy way for users to cancel their subscription, the agency said.

As part of the settlement, Amazon and two of its executives, Prime boss Jamil Ghani and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in the company's health division who previously held a role in the Prime business, will be prohibited from unlawful conduct.

FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson called the penalty a "monumental win" for the agency under the Trump administration.

"The Trump-Vance FTC is committed to fighting back when companies try to cheat ordinary Americans out of their hard-earned pay," Ferguson said in a statement.

Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin said in a statement that the company and its executives "have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers."

The penalty is one of the largest ever imposed by the FTC. The agency in 2019 hit Facebook, now known as Meta, with a $5 billion fine for violating consumers' privacy.

Still, the $2.5 billion fine is equivalent to roughly 0.1% of Amazon's market cap, which now sits at close to $2.4 trillion. Shares of Amazon were up slightly following the announcement.

Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. Data has shown that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members.

Amazon still faces a bigger legal case with the FTC.

In 2023, the regulator accused the company of illegally stifling competition in the e-commerce market. The FTC was joined by attorneys general from 17 states, in alleging Amazon used "monopoly power" to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.

Amazon won partial dismissal of the case last year, but is still slated to go to trial against the FTC in 2027.Earlier this month, the U.S. district judge overseeing Google's antitrust case ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Google lost the case against the government last year, but was spared of having to divest of any key assets.

Robert Kraft, who paid $172 million for the New England Patriots in 1994, has agreed to sell 8% of the NFL team to two groups in a deal that values the franchise at $9 billion, according to two sources who have first-hand knowledge of the deal but are not authorized to speak about it publicly.

The money the team will get from selling the 8% stake is going to stay on the Patriots' balance sheet, according to one person close to the situation, meaning the post-money valuation of the Patriots is greater than $9 billion.

The sale does not include the New England Revolution, the Major League Soccer team also owned by the Kraft family, according to one source close to the deal.

The buyers are Sixth Street Capital, at about 3%, and Dean Metropoulos with about 5%, according to a person with first-hand knowledge of the deal who is not authorized to speak about it. Metropoulos is listed by Forbes as having a net worth of $4.1 billion.

The minority stake sale of the Patriots must still be approved by the NFL's finance committee.

Two other minority stake sales are slated to be voted on by the league's finance committee in October. First, a 10% sale of the New York Giants to Julia Koch, which would give the team a $10.3 billion valuation, according to an NFL owner. And Sports Business Journal reported about a vote on a 3.2% sale of the San Francisco 49ers to Fortress Investment Group Chairman Pete Briger Jr. at a $8.6 billion valuation.

Several days ago, a 2.35% stake of the Chicago Bears changed hands at a valuation of $8.9 billion.

The Patriots also own Gillette Stadium, which opened in 2002 and was renovated at a cost of $250 million in 2023. According an internal NFL document obtained by CNBC, last season the Patriots raked in $118 million in ticket receipts, 11th-highest in the league.

Earlier this month CNBC valued the Patriots at $9.25 billion, fifth-most among the league's 32 teams. The Patriots have won six Super Bowls, all under Kraft's ownership, and are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in football.

Every living former chair of the Federal Reserve, as well as a slew of ex-Treasury secretaries and former White House economic advisors, urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to block President Donald Trump from firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook as her lawsuit challenging her removal proceeds.

The signers said in a legal brief, "The independence of the Federal Reserve, within the limited authority granted by Congress to achieve the goals Congress itself has set, is a critical feature of our national monetary system."

"Allowing the removal of Governor Lisa D. Cook while the challenge to her removal is pending would threaten that independence and erode public confidence in the Fed," the amicus brief said.

Signers of the brief included the former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen; former Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, Hank Paulson, Jack Lew, and Timothy Geithner; former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairs Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, Christina Romer, Cecilia Rouse, Jared Bernstein, and Jason Furman; and former Fed Governor Dan Tarullo.

Members of the group had served under, and been appointed by, both Democratic and Republican presidents.

The economists  Ken Rogoff, Phil Gramm, and John Cochrane also signed the brief, as did Phil Gramm, a Republican who previously served as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.

The brief said that allowing Cook to be removed now "would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed's independence and jeopardizing the credibilityand efficacy of U.S. monetary policy."

The filing comes as Cook's lawyers face a 4 p.m. ET Thursday deadline to respond to arguments by the Justice Department that Trump should be allowed to remove her from the seven-member Fed Board of Governors while the Supreme Court considers whether the president has legal cause to fire her.

Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with applications she filed for two residential properties she owns. Cook denies any wrongdoing.

Cook sued Trump in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asking a judge to block her removal.

That judge on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing Cook as her suit plays out. A three-judge panel on the federal appeals court in D.C., in a split decision, later upheld that order.

Trump then asked the Supreme Court to lift those rulings and allow him to remove Cook.

It's been a terrific year for stocks so far. Despite some turbulence in the spring, the S&P 500, a measure of the broad U.S. stock market, is up more than 12% since the year began.

It's a runup that has some market watchers wondering if investors have gotten out over their skis. In a speech in Rhode Island on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell fielded a question about how central bankers factor market prices into their decision making.

"We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we're trying to achieve," Powell said. "But you're right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued." 

Powell doesn't just mean that stock prices are flirting with record highs. He means that stocks are looking overvalued — a sentiment that sent markets slightly lower.

"Probably the oldest tenet in investing is 'buy low, sell high,'" Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, previously told CNBC Make It. While a long-term, diversified approach is typically recommended for everyday investors, the professionals are also attuned to the market's cycles. They typically hope to buy when stocks are cheap and sell when they're expensive.

It's impossible to know which "measures" Powell is looking at. But often, when experts value stocks, they generally they look at price-to-earnings ratio. The popular valuation metric, also known as P/E, currently shows that stocks are, indeed, pricey. In fact, the S&P 500 currently trades at a 41% premium to its 20-year average, according to CFRA.

To determine how attractively a stock is priced, Wall Street analysts don't just look at the share price. Instead, they compare the price with one of the company's underlying fundamentals, such as sales, cash flow or, most popularly, earnings.

Because investors reap the rewards of corporate profitability over time, they're willing to pay more than the company brings in, in order to own a piece of it, in the form of stock. This amount is expressed by dividing the share price by the company's earnings per share to get the price-to-earnings ratio.

If a stock sells for $10 and is projected to realize $2 in earnings per share over the next 12 months, it has a P/E of 5.

In a vacuum, that doesn't mean much. But it's a great way to compare one investment to another, or to compare an asset or an index to a historical average.

Looking at the S&P 500, stocks in the index currently trade at 23.8 times their projected earnings over the next 12 months. Over the past two decades, the index has an average P/E of 16.8. That means stocks are about 41% more expensive now than they have been over the past 20 years.

Applying the same logic, you could say that the S&P's P/E high ratio means that U.S. stocks are more expensive than international firms, whose S&P indexes trade at a P/E of 15.7. You could also say that a small-company index, such as the S&P SmallCap 600, with its P/E of 17.1, trades at a discount to the large-company S&P 500.

None of that is to say that the S&P will go down tomorrow or that foreign stocks or smaller-company stocks will outperform over the next year. Historically, the market operates in cycles, with different asset classes taking turns in the proverbial lead.

Over the long run, the fast-growing names that lead the market lose their luster, and prices come down, while under-loved, "value" stocks return to the fore, Charles Rotblut, vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors, previously told CNBC Make It.

He doesn't advise making wholesale changes to your portfolio based on short-term conditions in the market, but says it's worth paying attention to where things stand in a cyclical market and making sure you're adequately diversified.

"We know over the long term, there are periods where growth outperforms and there's periods where value outperforms, so we do see that pendulum swinging back and forth," Rotblut says. "I don't think this time is any different."

The White House warned federal agencies to prepare for mass firings if Congress does not reach a deal to fund the government before next Wednesday.

A memo released Wednesday by the Office of Management and Budget told agencies whose funding expires Oct. 1 — and which do not have alternative funding sources and are "not consistent with the President's priorities" — to consider issuing reduction-in-force notices for employees.

The warning ratchets up the pressure on Congress to strike a deal to avert a government shutdown, as thousands of government workers' jobs could be on the line.

In past shutdowns, federal workers were typically temporarily furloughed until a budget deal was reached.

In 2013, the last year that there was a full government shutdown, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown," OMB said in the memo, which was first reported on by Politico. CNBC separately obtained the document.

The memo is the latest attempt to pressure Congressional Democrats to agree to a deal with Republicans to avert a shutdown.

"We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary," the memo said.

But with just days to go until late Tuesday night, when government funding is set to expire, lawmakers are still far from striking a deal.

Democrats are holding firm on demands that any legislation must include an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits, which are currently set to expire at the end of the year.

Earlier this month, the House passed a stopgap spending measure that would have funded the government through Nov. 21.  But Senate Democrats blocked the measure.

Democrats quickly condemned the OMB memo.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it "an attempt at intimidation."

"Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare," Schumer said. "This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government," he said.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Trump and "MAGA extremists" of "plotting mass firings of federal workers starting October 1."

Jeffries, D-N.Y., an X post blasted OMB Director Russell Vought.

"Listen Russ, you are a malignant political hack. We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings," Jeffries wrote. "Get lost."

"Their goal is to ruin your life and punish hardworking families already struggling with Trump Tariffs and inflation," Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote in another tweet. 

"Remember in November," he said, referring to next year's mid-term elections, when every House seat will be up for grabs.

OpenAI and Databricks are two of the most highly valued tech startups on the planet. Now they're working together.

Databricks, a data analytics software vendor, said Thursday that it has committed to spending $100 million over multiple years with OpenAI. Databricks is making it easier for customers to connect their data stored in its cloud service with GPT-5, announced in August, and other OpenAI models.

OpenAI, which was recently valued by private investors at $500 billion, has become a household name in the years since the launch of its ChatGPT in late 2022. In partnering with Databricks, valued at more than $100 billion in its latest funding round, OpenAI has landed its first formal integration with a business-focused product vendor, said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's operating chief, in a news conference Wednesday.

Lightcap said the company's "aspiration is a multiple" of the $100 million spending commitment in terms of revenue the agreement will generate.

Databricks has formed similar partnerships with Google and with Anthropic. But OpenAI is leading the way with more than 700 million people using its ChatGPT assistant, powered by GPT-5, every week.

The company was making enterprise more of a focus even before the Databricks deal. Microsoft has been bringing OpenAI models into businesses, governments and schools. And OpenAI has been building up its own sales function.

Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said the partnership will simplify the process for its customers when it comes to accessing OpenAI's models, which they've already been using in large numbers.

Until now, if a Databricks customer wanted to tap a proprietary OpenAI model to help analyze internal data, it would have required extensive configuration, as well as legal and security sign-off.

"The key difference here is that any database customer automatically now, just by clicking in the UI, can start using this product," Ghodsi said, referring to the user interface. Ghodsi said the price is similar to what it would cost if the user went directly to OpenAI.

Greg Ulrich, Mastercard's chief AI and data officer, said he's optimistic about the integration.

"It enables opportunity for research and targeted experimentation, using AI to solve new problems, bringing value to customers, enhancing employee productivity, in an environment that we trust, that we know," Ulrich said.

It's an increasingly competitive space.

Databricks rival Snowflake, which has a market cap of $75 billion, announced an expansion of its Microsoft partnership in February, enabling the use of OpenAI models. Oracle, which has a $300 billion cloud contract from OpenAI, said two weeks ago that in October it will launch a service for running Google, OpenAI and xAI models on data stored in its database software.

Databricks said earlier this month that it now generates more than $4 billion in annualized revenue, growing over 50% year over year, with $1 billion coming from AI products. The company's $100 billion valuation was announced alongside a $1 billion funding round.

OpenAI and Databricks ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.

U.S. startup airline Breeze Airways is planning to fly internationally for the first time early next year, aiming to win over sun-seeking travelers as the carrier enters its fifth year of flying.

The airline's host of seasonal service kicks off on Jan. 10 with a Saturday-only route between Norfolk, Virginia, and Cancun, Mexico, followed by roundtrips between Charleston, South Carolina, and Cancun on Jan. 17, also only on Saturdays.

Other routes include Saturday service to Cancun starting from New Orleans on Feb. 7 and from Providence, Rhode Island, a week later. In March, Breeze is also planning to start Thursday and Saturday service between Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina and Montego Bay, Jamaica, and Wednesday and Saturday service to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Flights from Tampa, Florida, to Montego Bay start on Feb. 11.

Breeze was launched by JetBlue's founder, David Neeleman, and debuted during the pandemic, in May 2021. The airline now serves 81 cities, with 291 nonstop routes, and a spokeswoman for the carrier said Breeze is the only airline serving 83% of them.

The carrier has been working for years with the Federal Aviation Administration to win certification to fly internationally, Lukas Johnson, Breeze's chief commercial officer, said in an interview.

It's the first sizeable U.S. passenger airline to win that certification since Virgin America, which was acquired by Alaska Airlines in 2016, Johnson said.

He said Breeze is continuing its business model of flying its Airbus A220-300s between cities that have little to no competition from rivals and added that the new routes are "an exciting starting point for us."

"We feel really confident that it's going to be a great guest response," he said.

Fares for the new routes start as low as $99 one way, but Johnson said premium-class demand for its pricier, roomier seats has been strong and that there is a double-digit percentage of guests who book to a more expensive seat the second time they fly Breeze.

Initial claims for unemployment insurance were well below expectations last week, helping to douse caution at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere that the labor market is in danger.

First-time filings for the week ended Sept. 20 totaled a seasonally adjusted 218,000, down 14,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised figure and significantly less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 235,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

Continuing claims, which run a week behind, were little changed, falling 2,000 to 1.926 million.

The release comes just a week after the Federal Reserve voted to lower its benchmark borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 4%-4.25%.

In its post-meeting statement released Sept. 17, the Federal Open Market Committee said that part of the reasoning for the easing, the first in 2025, was that "downside risks to employment have risen." Indeed, nonfarm payrolls growth has slowed to a crawl and the level of job openings is at a multiyear low.

However, the claims data, despite a bump earlier in the month, has shown that companies are still reluctant to part with workers even if hiring has declined considerably.

The claims data can be volatile, with Texas showing big gyrations in recent weeks. The state recorded a decline of nearly 7,000 filings last week, according to unadjusted figures.

Despite concerns rising that the economy could be slowing into the back part of the year, the economic data has remained fairly solid, and other reports Thursday confirmed underlying strength.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic growth, posted a gain of 3.8% in the second quarter, according to the last of the three estimates that the Commerce Department released Thursday. The report reflected an unusually large upward adjustment of half a percentage point, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis attributed to a revision to consumer spending. GDP declined 0.6% in Q1, a slight downshift from the prior estimate.

Personal consumption expenditures, which drive about two-thirds of the $30 trillion U.S. economy, increased 2.5%, well above the 1.6% figure in the second estimate and better than the 0.6% rate in the first quarter.

In yet another sign of strength, spending on long-lasting items such as airplanes, appliances and computers increased 2.9% in August, compared with the forecast for a decline of 0.4% and better than the July figure, which showed a drop of 2.7%.

Even excluding transportation, new orders of so-called durable goods rose 0.4% and were up 1.9% when excluding defense.

Fed officials are watching the economic data closely for clues about where they should take policy next, and recent reports have indicated a mostly upbeat picture.

Housing, which has been the weakest spot, has showed some signs of life lately, with sales of newly built homes soaring 20.5% in August, the biggest gain since January 2022. Existing home sales totaled an annualized rate of 4 million for the month, slightly better than expected.

Despite the solid data, markets still expect the Fed to cut twice more this year, at its meetings in October and December.

In a speech Tuesday, Chair Jerome Powell said the economy "is showing resilience in the midst of substantial changes in trade and immigration policies, as well as in fiscal, regulatory and geopolitical arenas."

Still, he left room for additional easing, noting that policy is still "modestly restrictive" on growth.

In this article

Starbucks announced a $1 billion restructuring plan Thursday that involves closing some of its North American coffeehouses and laying off more workers as it moves ahead with its "Back to Starbucks" transformation under CEO Brian Niccol.

The number of company-operated stores in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal 2025, accounting for both openings and closures, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That figure translates to roughly 500 gross closures, according to TD Cowen estimates.

Approximately 900 nonretail employees will be laid off on Friday, Starbucks said.

Starbucks estimates that 90% of the expected $1 billion restructuring cost will be attributable to the North America business. In total, the company expects to incur about $150 million in employee separation costs, plus about $850 million in restructuring charges related to the store closures, according to the filing. A significant portion of expenses will be incurred in fiscal 2025, it said.

The company plans to end its fiscal year with almost 18,300 North American locations, including both company-operated and licensed cafes. Starbucks plans to start growing its footprint again in fiscal 2026.

Starbucks said in the filing it is prioritizing investment "closer to the coffeehouse and the customer" as it looks to reverse a sales slump in its biggest market. The company's same-store sales have fallen for six straight quarters, hurt by increased competition and price-conscious consumers.

This is the second round of layoffs in Niccol's tenure, after 1,100 corporate workers were let go earlier this year. Starbucks ended 2024 with about 16,000 employees who work outside of store locations.

"These steps are to reinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them," Niccol wrote in a letter to employees Thursday. "I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve."

In July, the company announced its biggest investment ever into labor and operating standards, "Green Apron Service," which involves a more than $500 million investment in labor hours across company-owned cafes in the next year.

In an interview earlier this month, Niccol told CNBC, "I really hope we're moving towards being the world's greatest customer service company, [and] the world's greatest customer-centric company."

In the message to employees Thursday, Niccol said the company had reviewed and identified stores where the company would be "unable to to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance." TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note to clients that the store closures are "more than we anticipated."

Starbucks executives had previously said that the company would be slowing new openings in favor of remodeling existing locations this year. The renovated cafes are meant to encourage customers to linger, taking the coffee chain back to its roots as a "third place" for consumers, outside of home and the office.

Baristas from closing locations will be transferred to nearby locations or, in some cases, receive severance packages, Niccol said in his letter to employees. Starbucks Workers United, which represents 12,000 baristas across more than 650 cafes, said in a statement to CNBC that it will be sending a formal request to the company about the closures.

"We expect to engage in effects bargaining for every impacted union store, as we have done elsewhere, so workers can be placed in another Starbucks store according to their preferences," the union said in the statement.

Following Thursday's announcement, share of Starbucks were down less than 1% in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen more than 8% this year.

In addition to focusing on the customer experience, Niccol has enacted additional changes to operations including a return to four days in office, beginning next month.

He's also brought on a new executive team including CFO Cathy Smith, Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman and Chief Operating Officer Mike Grams. Lieberman and Grams worked with Niccol in his previous roles at Chipotle and Yum Brands.

Read Niccol's full memo to Starbucks staff:

Partners,

I'm grateful for the work everyone is doing to put world-class customer service at the center of everything we do and focus on creating an elevated Starbucks experience for every customer, every time.

While we're making good progress, there is much more to do to build a better, stronger and more resilient Starbucks. As we approach the beginning of our new fiscal year, I'm sharing two decisions we've made in support of our Back to Starbucks plan. Both are grounded in putting our resources closest to the customer so we can create great coffeehouses, offer world-class customer service and grow the business.

Changes to some of our coffeehouses

First, I shared earlier this year that we were carefully reviewing our North America coffeehouse portfolio through the additional lens of our Back to Starbucks plan. Our goal is for every coffeehouse to deliver a warm and welcoming space with a great atmosphere and a seat for every occasion.

During the review, we identified coffeehouses where we're unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect, or where we don't see a path to financial performance, and these locations will be closed.

Each year, we open and close coffeehouses for a variety of reasons, from financial performance to lease expirations. This is a more significant action that we understand will impact partners and customers. Our coffeehouses are centers of the community, and closing any location is difficult.

To put it into context: Since we've already opened numerous coffeehouses over the past year, our overall company-operated count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025 after accounting for both openings and closures.

We will end the fiscal year with nearly 18,300 total Starbucks locations – company operated and licensed – across the U.S. and Canada. In fiscal year 2026, we'll grow the number of coffeehouses we operate as we continue to invest in our business. Over the next 12 months, we also plan to uplift more than 1,000 locations to introduce greater texture, warmth and layered design.

Partners in coffeehouses scheduled to close will be notified this week. We're working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them.

For those we can't immediately place, we're focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages. We also hope to welcome many of these partners back to Starbucks in the future as new coffeehouses open and the number of partners in each location grows.

Reducing non-retail partner roles

Second, we're further reducing non-retail headcount and expenses. This includes the difficult decision to eliminate approximately 900 current non-retail partner roles and close many open positions.

As we build toward a better Starbucks, we're investing in green apron partner hours, more partners in stores, exceptional customer service, elevated coffeehouse designs and innovation to create the future. We will continue to carefully manage costs and stay focused on the key areas that drive long-term growth.

Non-retail partners whose roles are being eliminated will be notified tomorrow morning (Friday). We will offer generous severance and support packages including benefits extensions.

Unless your job specifically requires you to be on site in the office, we're asking you to work from home today and tomorrow.

What's next

These steps are to reinforce what we see is working and prioritize our resources against them. Early results from coffeehouse uplifts show customers visiting more often, staying longer and sharing positive feedback. Where we've invested in more green apron partner hours so that there are more partners working at busy times, we saw improvements in transactions, sales, and service times, alongside happier, more engaged partners.

I know these decisions impact our partners and their families, and we did not make them lightly. I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers and the communities we serve.

To those partners who will be leaving, I want to say a profound thank you. To those continuing on our turnaround journey, I deeply appreciate your commitment to helping us get back to Starbucks.

Brian

Starbucks on Thursday announced it would close many of its North American stores in addition to sweeping layoffs.

The closures will target locations where Starbucks has found it is "unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect" or where it doesn't "see a path to financial performance," according to a statement published by the company.

The company said it was only closing company-operated stores, of which it had 11,453 as of June 29, 2025. While the exact number of stores to be closed remains unclear, the closures will represent about 1% of those stores.

Starbucks ended its 2024 fiscal year with 18,424 open stores in North America, including 7,281 licensed storefronts, which aren't affected by the announcement. It will end fiscal year 2025 — which ends on September 29 — with 18,300 open stores across the continent, per the company's announcement.

Starbucks staff in affected stores will be notified of the changes this week, with efforts made to transfer employees in closing stores to open locations nearby, the company said. Where transfers cannot be made, employees will be eligible for severance packages, the company added.

In a statement provided to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United, which represents 12,000 baristas across 45 states and Washington, DC, said the union would bargain with the company to ensure those affected are assigned to new stores in accordance with their preferences.

"Fixing what's broken at Starbucks isn't possible without centering the people who engage with the company's customers day in and day out," the statement said.

According to an SEC filing released Thursday, the restructuring, which was approved by the Starbucks board of directors on Tuesday, will cost the company around $1 billion.

The filing shows that roughly $150 million in expenses will be related to employee separation benefits, a further $400 million related to the disposal of store assets from closed locations, and about $450 million in costs related to early lease terminations at affected stores.

The company said that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, it will continue to grow the number of coffeehouses it operates and refurbish more than 1,000 existing locations as it continues to invest in the business.

In addition to the store closures, the company announced that about 900 non-retail employees will be laid off on Friday. It also announced it would offer severance packages in addition to benefits extensions to affected employees.

"I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve," CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement about the changes.

Thursday's announcement is the second round of layoffs for Starbucks employees this year. Business Insider previously reported the company laid off 1,100 corporate staffers in February.

The European Commission launched an antitrust probe into German software behemoth SAP on Thursday, citing concerns about the company's practices in software support services.

According to the Commission, the investigation will assess "whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies' business operations."

SAP, in a statement on Thursday, said it believed its policies and actions were fully compliant with EU competition rules.

"However, we take the issues raised seriously and we are working closely with the EU Commission to resolve them," a spokesperson said. "We do not anticipate the engagement with the European Commission to result in material impacts on our financial performance."

SAP is one of Europe's most valuable companies, with a market cap of almost 282 billion euros ($331 billion). Shares of the firm moved lower on Thursday, losing 2% by 12:45 p.m. in London (7:45 a.m. ET).

The EU probe relates to a piece of SAP software called Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP.

ERP is widely used by large corporations to manage their everyday finance and accounting needs. SAP is a major player in the space — but it isn't alone. The company competes with the likes of Microsoft and Oracle, which offer their own ERP products.

Specifically, the European Commission said it was addressing the so-called "on-prem" version of SAP ERP. On-prem refers to software that is hosted on a company's own servers, as opposed the cloud where it can be remotely accessed via SAP data centers.

Much of SAP's business still comes from its on-prem IT services. However, the company has for years been attempting to shift more of its focus to the cloud — particularly as it faces competition from technology giants like Microsoft and Amazon, which dominate the market for public cloud services.

The latest EU antitrust probe is noteworthy as it doesn't involve Big Tech.

Much of the bloc's work on competition policy has focused on the market power of U.S. technology giants. This has led to criticisms from both the tech sector and politicians in the U.S., who say American tech firms are being unfairly targeted. On Wednesday, Apple urged a repeal of the Digital Markets Act, the EU's landmark digital competition law, saying it was "leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU."

British artificial intelligence infrastructure firm Nscale is raising heaps of cash as it looks to ramp up the deployment of AI data centers across Europe.

Nscale, which is based in London, said Thursday that it has raised $1.1 billion in a bumper Series B funding round. The investment was led by Aker, the Norwegian industrial investment company, with additional participation from a raft of firms including Nvidia, Nokia and Dell.

The investment highlights continued demand for high-powered computing infrastructure, which is required to train and run powerful foundational AI models from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google.

Nscale has become a central player in Britain's ambition to become a global AI powerhouse. Last week, the likes of Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI announced multibillion-dollar projects involving Nscale to build out AI computing infrastructure across the U.K.

"We are creating one of the largest global [infrastructure] platforms of its kind – purpose-built to meet surging demand and unlock breakthroughs at unprecedented scale," said Josh Payne, Nscale's CEO and co-founder, in a statement.

"This allows Nscale to provide our customers access to scarce, and highly sought after, compute capacity and rapidly accelerate the build-out of secure, compliant and energy-efficient AI infrastructure," he added.

Nscale was spun out from Arkon Energy, an Australian cryptocurrency mining firm, in 2023 to address soaring demand for data centers capable of handling AI workloads.

It is working with OpenAI in the U.K. and Norway to build new data centers as part of the ChatGPT maker's Stargate investment project. Nscale said that part of the Series B funding would go toward "enabling the rapid rollout" of the Stargate data center projects in Europe.

The company is committing $1 billion for the Norwegian project, with the goal of racking up 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) at the site before 2027. The U.K. site, meanwhile, will house 8,000 GPUs in its first phase early next year, with the option to expand capacity to around 31,000 GPUs over time.

Thanks to President Donald Trump, Uncle Sam has a burgeoning portfolio.

Once considered rare, Trump and his team have pushed the US to consider taking stakes in private companies.

"You have stupid people say, 'That's a shame.' It's not a shame, that's called business." Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on August 25.

At the time, Trump defended his decision to take a 9.9% stake in Intel, a once-dominant chipmaker, over criticism that such industrial policy isn't how the US typically operates. He said that he wants "to get as much as I can."

"I hope I'm going to have many more cases like it," Trump said of the Intel deal.

The deals keep coming. Most recently, the Trump administration has entered talks with Lithium Americas to take a small stake in the Canadian mining company.

Here is a look at all the companies that Trump is targeting.

Under Trump's leadership, the US converted roughly $11 billion in Biden-era Chips Act grants into a 10% equity stake. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who helped lead the talks with the chipmaker, said it was a mistake to award grants without securing anything in return.

"America should get the benefit of the bargain," Lutnick told CNBC before the deal ultimately came together. "I mean, that is exactly Donald Trump's perspective, which is, Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money? What is in it for the American taxpayer?' And the answer Donald Trump has is we should get an equity stake for our money."

Intel shares have gone up over 25% in the month since the announcement. The company has also cautioned in securities filings that the US stake could pose some risks, including potentially hurting international sales.

In July, the Defense Department announced that it would become the largest shareholder in MP Materials after agreeing to buy $400 million worth of shares.

MP Materials owns the operational rare earth mine in the US. Trump administration officials have said it is a national security risk for the US to continue to rely on China and other foreign nations for the key minerals needed for everything from iPhones to military jet engines.

MP Materials CEO James Litinsky said that he views the deal as a "public-private partnership" that is different than the government's agreement with Intel.

"Those are scenarios where you had commitments from a past administration, where the Trump administration has come in and said, wait a second, you had no-strings attached commitments to companies, we think we should get a piece of the action," Litinsky told CNBC.

Shares in MP Materials have roughly doubled since the deal became public.

A Trump administration official confirmed to Business Insider that the Trump administration is asking for a small equity stake in Lithium Americas as part of a broader renegotiation of a $2.26 billion government loan.

Lithium Americas said it is in discussions with the Department of Energy and General Motors, its partner in a mining project in Thacker Pass, as first reported by Reuters. The Nevada area where the mine is located is believed to have one of the world's largest lithium deposits.

Trump approved the project during his first term, but the Energy Department loan was finalized during the Biden administration.

The administration official said the Energy Department agreed to restructure the loan by pushing out part of its repayment. In exchange, the Trump administration wanted a "very, very small equity share" to "create more of a cash buffer for the project."

Shares in Lithium Americas went up over 93% on September 24 after news of a potential stake became public.

In August, Lutnick said that the Pentagon was considering taking stakes in defense contractors. He specifically named Lockheed Martin as a potential example.

"They are essentially an arm of the US government," Lutnick said of Lockheed.

Asked about any possible discussions, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson praised the contractor's relationship with the Trump administration.

"As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense," a spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.

The Swiss National Bank said Thursday that tariffs on goods to the U.S. present a "major challenge" for exporters, with its economy set to take a hit.

The country has swallowed some of the highest duties imposed by President Donald Trump's administration, with a 39% tariff rate implemented in August. It came after a Swiss delegation led by the country's President Karin Keller-Sutter failed to secure a trade deal after meeting with Trump in Washington D.C.

"The U.S. tariffs present a major challenge for affected companies and are likely to dampen economic activity," Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel said in a press conference following the central bank's latest interest rate decision.

"Against this backdrop, our monetary policy is also supporting economic development."

The SNB held interest rates at 0% in a widely expected move on Thursday.

Schlegel told CNBC that the tariffs are expected to hit exporters, but that the impact on the economy more broadly should be muted.

"The exporters that are directly affected, for them this is very challenging, very difficult, but if you look at the economy as a whole, the impact is limited," he told CNBC. "We don't see a recession in the coming quarter so for 2025, we have growth of 1 to 1.5%, in 2026 we still see growth of roughly 1% so we don't see a recession."

Petra Schudin, a governing board member at the central bank, said in the press conference that the economic outlook for Switzerland had "deteriorated due to significantly higher U.S. tariffs," which were likely to hit exports and investments.

The machinery and watchmaking industries will be most affected by the levies, according to Schudin.

"As a result of the tariffs and the high level of uncertainty, we expect growth of just under 1% for 2026," he added.

It marks a downgrade from the 1%-1.5% growth expectation for next year stated at the central bank's June policy meeting.

Consulting firms may be less outspoken than tech CEOs, but they're staring down the same staffing problem as Silicon Valley after President Donald Trump introduced a $100,000 H-1B application fee last Friday.

The H-1B program temporarily allows employers to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized jobs.

The Department of Labor reports that nearly 50% of H-1B applications are related to "professional, scientific, and technical services" — with professional services typically referring to the consulting and accounting work carried out by firms like Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC.

James Ransome, a partner and strategy consulting lead at Patrick Morgan — a firm focused on executive recruitment and industry analysis — said that Friday's executive order had raised concern over talent acquisition among consulting leaders.

"For many firms, the H-1B route has been a steady pipeline for mid-level consultants with strong technical and analytical skills, roles that are difficult to fill at scale in the US domestic market. Leaders are concerned this change adds further friction at a time when competition for talent is already high," said Ransome.

According to the US government's H-1B employer data hub, Deloitte, EY, and Accenture are the professional services firms that hire the most employees with H-1B visas.

In the last three years up to April 2025, Deloitte hired 7,535 workers on H-1B visas, making it the eleventh largest US employer of H-1B visa holders. The number represents roughly 1% of its most recently reported US head count.

At Accenture and EY, H-1B visa holders hired in the last three years — 5,862 and 5,298, respectively — represent almost 10% of each firm's last reported US headcounts of around 60,000. The data does not reflect how many remain employed by the firms.

Deloitte, EY, and Accenture did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Ransome said he expected the Big Four and top-tier firms to absorb some of the higher costs of the visas to maintain staffing continuity. But they would likely take a "dual approach" and shift their staffing models alongside any cost absorption, he said.

Smaller players in the consulting industry will need to up their ability to attract domestic talent, especially mid-level hires, he added.

Competition over tech talent has become a defining pressure point for consulting firms as they race to develop the strongest AI offering for clients, and the H-1B executive order will add to that pressure.

Consulting firms competing for data scientists and other highly technical specialists will feel the competition increase, Tom Rodenhauser, a consulting analyst and the managing partner at Kennedy Intelligence, told Business Insider.

The two experts told BI that Trump's executive order is also likely to make offshoring hubs more attractive to firms.

"Consulting is mobile in the sense that individuals don't need to be based in the US to serve customers," said Rodenhauser. Firms can simply relocate resources to bypass the disruption caused by the visa situation, he said.

For years, top firms have used labor arbitrage to bolster their revenue streams, setting up nearshore and offshore centers in countries like India, Mexico, Argentina, and the Philippines.

The reliance on foreign hubs has increased as technical capabilities within offshore centers have improved, and AI has reduced the demand for junior workers in US offices.

In August, BI obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. One of the three reasons the firm gave in the presentation was "further AC integration," referring to PwC's acceleration centers, its name for its offshore hubs.

Ransome said consultancies have already been reassessing the balance between onshore client-facing teams and offshore delivery hubs, and the potential changes around H-1B visas would accelerate those strategies.

"Rather than simply paying more across the board, they'll use this moment to rethink leverage models: higher-value, client-facing work anchored onshore, with more delivery capability shifted offshore."

Nearshore hubs, like those in Canada, would start looking more attractive. Toronto, given its proximity to New York and Chicago, would be particularly appealing, Ransome said.

For midsize firms, without the infrastructure or scale to rely on foreign hubs, the H-1B price hike will be more disruptive, he said.

The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering.

On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The White House told Business Insider that the fee would only apply to new applicants, not those renewing their H-1B visas.

The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. All three companies told their employees on the visa not to leave the US or to quickly return to the country if they were overseas.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday.

"We want all the brightest minds to come to the US, and remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream. And we represent the American dream," Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

"Immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making," Huang added.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Trump administration's introduction of a $100,000 fee to the H-1B visa program was the right move.

"We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday.

Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a "great solution" compared to the existing lottery system.

Hastings said in an X post on Sunday that he has "worked on H-1B politics for 30 years."

"It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote.

"Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent.

"Apple, Oracle, Google all started in a garage. They could have not afforded to do this. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew," O'Leary told Fox Business's "Varney & Co." on Monday.

"I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries," he added.

O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US.

"Why train them and kick them out? And if they're available, let's take them all and not charge a 100 grand. We should give them a 100 grand to come here," he said.

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India.

In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only "buying massive amounts of Russian Oil" but also "selling it on the Open Market for big profits."

The US and India are in the middle of trade negotiations. More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India.

"It's a negotiation with India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US," Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that "caught everyone off guard."

In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports "merit-based immigration " and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order.

"I would beg the president," he said. "He has accomplished border control, that's great, I mean, I think all nations want real border control, that helps make a nation, but after that, we should have good immigration," he said.

A Business Insider analysis earlier this year showed that JPMorgan is a top user of H-1B visas. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them.

Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada.

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a "material opportunity" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector.

"So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America — I'll come to Canada,'" McKay said.

The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help "build and drive" technology forward.

"Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears," Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday.

"Some sand in the gears is acceptable. It is going to be the competitive landscape and we will comply with it," he said. "But it does decelerate access to certain talents."

In an editorial published in the Financial Times on Wednesday, Michael Moritz, a longtime partner in Sequoia Capital, criticized the H-1B visa reform and how it was announced.

"As usual with the Trump administration, the announcement was chaotic and half-baked," Moritz wrote. "It was yet another distraction for the management teams of America's leading companies, already whipsawed by various other presidential edicts."

"The large tech companies hire foreign nationals because they possess particular skills," he added. "They don't do so, as Trump seems to believe, to deprive Americans of jobs or for cost reasons."

Moritz said that the $100,000 fee will scatter jobs to other tech hubs like Istanbul, Warsaw, or Bengaluru, where engineers are as qualified as their American counterparts.

"Like other Trump schemes, this H-1B caper will backfire," he wrote.

At the 80th anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Pakistan took a visible step forward in shaping the global debate on technology, youth, and sustainable development. Represented by Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, Bilal Bin Saqib, who spoke at two high-level side events: one on Social Business, Youth and Technology and another on AI Capacity Building, co-hosted by Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and ICAIRE with the support of the UN Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies.

Across both engagements, Bilal Bin Saqib and Pakistan's message was clear: for the developing world, technology is not an optional add-on but an essential tool for survival, resilience, and progress. In the social business forum, Pakistan underscored the reality that millions of young people are already using digital tools to receive remittances, fund micro-enterprises, and connect with the global economy. This adoption is not driven by speculation but by necessity, families seeking faster payments, entrepreneurs looking for capital, and communities searching for solutions. The challenge, as Pakistan framed it, is how to channel this grassroots energy into transparent, accountable, and socially productive systems that can scale.

The second intervention on artificial intelligence reinforced the same theme but through a broader lens. Pakistani Crypto Minister stated that AI is not a luxury reserved for advanced economies, but a necessity for developing nations seeking to leapfrog structural barriers. His call was for global cooperation to ensure equitable access, ethical safeguards, and collaborative models that allow the Global South to build capacity rather than fall further behind.

What made these interventions significant was not only the content but also the context. Pakistan was not speaking from the sidelines. At UNGA80, it was treated as an active participant in shaping the global conversation on the intersection of technology, development, and youth empowerment. 

The progress made in digital adoption, particularly in crypto and blockchain, was acknowledged in New York as a case study of how emerging economies can move quickly when driven by need.

For Pakistan, this marks a subtle but important shift in perception. No longer simply a recipient of development agendas, the country is positioning itself as a contributor of ideas and models, demonstrating how digital assets, social business frameworks, and AI can converge to tackle challenges of poverty, inequality, and climate vulnerability. The UNGA80 discussions showed that Pakistan is increasingly being viewed not as a follower, but as a country ready to lead in the Global South's engagement with emerging technologies.

Bilal Bin Saqib also met with Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, the President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, and Kazakhstan's Minister of Digital Development and Innovation, Zhaslan Madiyev, during his visit to New York.

This week's crypto crash continued today, Sept. 25, with Bitcoin plunging to $110,000 and the market capitalization of all coins falling to $3.81 trillion.

Only five top-100 coins were in the green today, with popular tokens like Avalanche (AVAX), Aster (ASTER), and Dogecoin (DOGE) falling by over 10%. 

Avalanche has plunged by 16% from its highest point this month, while Aster and Dogecoin have fallen by over 15% in the same period.

One major reason for the crypto crash is the fear that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as many times as it hinted in its meeting last week.

In a statement this week, Jerome Powell suggested that the Fed was still concerned about inflation. Other Fed officials, including Beth Hammack and Austan Goolsbee, urged the bank to exercise caution when cutting rates.

Their message was that U.S. inflation remains high and that the labor market is still tight, with the unemployment rate hovering at 4.3%.

Cryptocurrencies do well when the Fed is cutting interest rates, as that leads to a risk-on sentiment.

Bitcoin and altcoins like Avalanche, Aster, and Dogecoin also plunged as sentiment in the industry worsened. This situation is demonstrated by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has dived from this month's high of 73 to 41. It is at risk of plunging to the fear area.

In most cases, cryptocurrencies drop when the index moves to the fear zone. In contrast, most coins rally when there is greed, as this stimulates fear of missing out among investors.

The other reason why the crypto market is going down is that liquidations have jumped this week. Crypto liquidations jumped by 100% on Thursday to $585 million. 

Liquidations also jumped by over 800% on Monday to more than $1.65 billion. Avalanche had liquidations worth over $9.4 million on Monday and $5.5 million on Thursday.

Similarly, Dogecoin liquidations jumped to $58.6 million and $11.8 million on the two days, respectively. 

Soaring liquidations are bearish for the crypto market, as they mean that long positions are being closed. Also, traders often stay on the sidelines when this happens. Data shows that the futures open interest of all coins fell by 2% on Thursday to $203 billion.

Real-world asset specialist Centrifuge has launched what it calls the first licensed S&P 500 index fund on blockchain rails, opening one of the world's most recognized equity benchmarks to on-chain investors.

The Janus Henderson Anemoy S&P 500 Fund, dubbed SPXA, went live on Thursday on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by crypto exchange Coinbase.

The offering is the first tokenized index fund licensed by the S&P Dow Jones Indices. It allows the S&P 500, a wide basket of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies that covers roughly 80% of the U.S. equity market, to trade around the clock with transparent holdings.

FalconX, a digital asset brokerage, was an anchor investor in the product, while Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, will handle future expansion to other blockchains. Janus Henderson, a London-based global asset manager with nearly $500 billion in AUM, is serving as sub-investment manager, while Centrifuge's asset management arm Anemoy oversees the fund.

The initiative fits into a broader trend of bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and equities, often called real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails. Proponents explore tokenization for operational gains, speedier settlements and around-the-clock trading.

Centrifuge, which has built infrastructure for tokenizing private credit and fixed income since 2017, sees SPXA as its entry point into equities, a tokenization trend that has recently taken off.

"Indices are the best way to bring stocks on-chain," Bhaji Illuminati, CEO of Centrifuge, said in a statement. "They're simple, collateral-ready and unlock liquidity in ways individual securities can't."

For S&P Dow Jones Indices, the offering is a stepping stone to "build the future of index-linked financial products" traditional finance products are beginning to migrate to blockchain environments, said Cameron Drinkwater, chief product officer at S&P DJI.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slipped below $112,000 on Thursday amid a broader sell-off in crypto and stocks.

While the largest cryptocurrency declined 2%, ethereum (ETH-USD), solana (SOL-USD), and other coins saw larger declines in what has been a rocky week for the crypto market.

Ether fell roughly 5% to below $4,000 before paring losses, marking its lowest level since August, as ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net outflows over the past 24 hours.

"The persistent downward pressure is rooted in the absence of sufficient buying power to defend prices following the massive wave of liquidations seen on Monday," wrote Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at asset brokerage platform XS.com.

"Another round of long liquidations today further weakened sentiment, while corrections in the broader equity market amplified the cautious tone," he added.

More than $1.6 billion in long positions was liquidated earlier this week, spooking investors. According to CoinGlass, over the past 24 hours, $511 million across all cryptoassets was liquidated.

The action comes as stocks decline from recent records amid investor concerns of frothiness driven by AI enthusiasm and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's path for interest rates.

Strategists have pointed to September as a seasonally volatile month for crypto, with the last three months of the year typically ushering in tailwinds.

Crypto bulls point to another headwind stemming from the Treasury General Account, which essentially serves as the government's checking account at the Federal Reserve.

The Treasury has been refilling this account in recent weeks by issuing T-bills and bonds, serving as a type of liquidity drain for crypto. The diversion of cash into government debt can reduce demand for risk assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The rout in bitcoin and ether extended into crypto-related stocks on Thursday. Trading platforms Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN) each declined more than 1%.

Bitcoin holder Strategy (MSTR) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) also declined.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

SharpLink Gaming, the Nasdaq-listed affiliate marketing and gaming software firm-turned ETH treasury company, plans to become the first public company to natively issue its common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

SharpLink has appointed Superstate as its digital transfer agent, according to a statement on Thursday, using its Opening Bell onchain issuance solution to tokenize SBET equity in a legally compliant way. The firm said it aims to demonstrate how public companies can use blockchain infrastructure to create shareholder value, improve market efficiency, and drive forward the next generation of capital markets.

The two companies also plan to explore compliant ways for tokenized equities to trade on automated market makers and other DeFi protocols, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's Project Crypto initiative to modernize securities regulation for digital assets and onchain markets.

"SharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate's Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company," Superstate CEO Robert Leshner said. "We're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond."

SharpLink joins other public firms such as the recently-formed Solana treasury company Forward Industries and crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital in leveraging Superstate's Opening Bell for stock tokenization, albeit on the Solana blockchain in their case. Robinhood, xStocks, and Coinbase are also pursuing onchain solutions for public equities as the tokenization trend gains traction.

Chaired by Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin, SharpLink embarked on its Ethereum treasury strategy in June and has since accumulated more than 830,000 ETH ($3.3 billion) and generated over 3,815 ETH ($15.3 million) in staking rewards. It is currently the second-largest corporate Ethereum holder behind Tom Lee's BitMine, according to SER data.



"We're proud to have been the first public company to become a Digital Asset Treasury company on Ethereum, onboarding traditional finance to Ethereum. And now we are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum," Lubin said Thursday. "As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink's conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built."

SBET is trading down 5% in Thursday trading, according to The Block's SharpLink price page, echoing a broader correction across the crypto market.

Oops, something went wrong

Stablecoin blockchain Plasma launched its mainnet in beta on Thursday, with its native XPL token going live alongside it. 

Investors who bought into Plasma's massive initial coin offering, or ICO, earlier this year are up massively. And Plasma confirmed to Decrypt that every single participant in Plasma's pre-deposit ICO scheme has been sent $8,390 worth of XPL—even if they didn't actually buy tokens via the ICO.

Plasma's XPL token peaked at $1.54 a piece shortly after its debut before dropping to $0.91 as of this writing, according to CoinGecko. That puts Plasma's native staking token at a $8.6 billion fully diluted valuation, which is a 17.3x jump from the $500 million valuation at which the ICO was raised.

XPL is currently the 89th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $1.59 billion.

“This is the culmination of our team putting everything they had into making Plasma the perfect home for Money 2.0. The launch of our mainnet is just the beginning,” Paul Faecks, CEO and Founder, said on X.

Plasma is a layer-1 blockchain built with stablecoin optimizations at the forefront of the project. It uses the XPL token to power its staking-based consensus mechanism. Plasma has attracted funding from the likes of Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, with the pair also serving as advisors to the project.

The project caught headlines in June after it attracted $1 billion worth of pre-deposits ahead of its initial coin offering. Participants were allocated a portion of the tokens they could purchase based on how much they pre-deposited and for how long. 

Plasma later sold 10% of its 10 billion token supply at a $500 million fully diluted valuation to those who had locked up their funds in the pre-deposit wallet. The initial coin offering was conducted at the same valuation as its previous strategic funding round.

Plasma told Decrypt that half of the ICO participants had claimed their tokens within three hours of hitting mainnet beta. 

ICO depositors who received the unexpected bonus have taken to social media to flaunt the additional $8,390 of XPL that Plasma gifted them. For note, Plasma allocated 25 million tokens, worth approximately $25.5 million at its current price, to be evenly divided among all pre-depositors—meaning those who deposited $1 or $10,000 got the same bonus.

“The team at Plasma is making sure their small supporters eat,” one X user wrote. “FOMO is about to hit HARD,” another said on X.

Plasma's mainnet beta and token debut come the same week that it announced Plasma One, a stablecoin-native neobank it plans to roll out. The neobank's card will use the Plasma blockchain as its payment rails, and claims to offer 4% cashback on spending.

Company leadership has described Thursday's launch as the first step forward, with many more to come.

“This is just the start,” Faecks told Decrypt. “Next is iterating at the chain level to make Plasma more optimized for stablecoin payments and shipping the best products that get stablecoins into the hands of everyone, everywhere.”

Ohio has taken a decisive leap into the digital economy, formally approving a vendor to process cryptocurrency payments, including Bitcoin, for various state fees and services. This landmark decision, finalized on September 25, 2025, marks a significant re-engagement by the state with digital assets, building on previous efforts and positioning Ohio at the forefront of governmental crypto adoption. The move reflects a broader initiative to modernize public finance, respond to growing demand for digital payment alternatives, and foster an environment conducive to blockchain innovation.

This renewed commitment to integrating cryptocurrencies into state operations is a clear signal of Ohio's progressive stance on emerging financial technologies. By allowing citizens and businesses to pay state obligations with digital currencies, Ohio aims to enhance convenience, streamline transactions, and attract tech-savvy enterprises. The state's approach, which involves a third-party processor immediately converting crypto payments into U.S. dollars, safeguards against market volatility while leveraging the efficiency of digital transactions.

The unanimous approval by the Ohio State Board of Deposit on September 25, 2025, signifies the culmination of months of legislative and administrative efforts. The chosen third-party vendor will now facilitate the acceptance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for a range of state fees, ensuring immediate conversion to U.S. dollars before funds are deposited into state accounts. This strategy shields the state from direct exposure to crypto market fluctuations. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose confirmed that his office, responsible for nearly half a million transactions annually, is poised to be among the first agencies to implement this new payment method. Complementing this, the recently advanced Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) further solidifies the state's crypto-friendly environment by exempting cryptocurrency transactions under $200 from capital gains taxes, a measure designed to encourage everyday crypto usage.

Ohio's journey into cryptocurrency payments has been a dynamic one. The state first made headlines in 2018 under then-Treasurer Josh Mandel, becoming the first U.S. state to accept Bitcoin for business taxes via OhioCrypto.com, with BitPay as the processor. However, this initial program was suspended in 2019 due to legal and procedural concerns. The current initiative, championed by Secretary LaRose and Treasurer Robert Sprague, began gaining traction in April 2025 with a formal request to the State Board of Deposit to re-authorize cryptocurrency payments, citing updated legal guidance. This proposal received unanimous approval in May 2025, paving the way for the vendor selection finalized this September. The Ohio House of Representatives further bolstered these efforts by passing the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) in June 2025, signaling strong legislative support for broader digital asset integration.

Key players instrumental in this development include the Ohio State Board of Deposit, which granted the final approval; Frank LaRose, Ohio Secretary of State, a vocal proponent of the initiative; Robert Sprague, Ohio Treasurer of State, who supported the modernization of state financial practices; and Representative Steve Demetriou, the primary sponsor of the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act. Industry leaders like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter have publicly praised Ohio's forward-thinking approach, recognizing its potential to set a national precedent.

Initial reactions from the cryptocurrency industry have been overwhelmingly positive. The approval is widely seen as a validation of digital assets' growing legitimacy and utility. Proponents within Ohio and the broader tech community view it as a strategic move that positions the state as a leader in the digital economy. Ohio now joins a select group of U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana, that have formally embraced cryptocurrency for government payments, with its progress expected to serve as a significant "test case" for other states considering similar integrations.

Ohio's progressive stance on cryptocurrency payments creates a new landscape of opportunities and challenges for various public and private companies, particularly those in the crypto payment processing, blockchain technology, and financial services sectors. While the specific name of the newly approved vendor has not been publicly disclosed, the broader implications are clear.

Potential Winners:

Crypto Payment Processors: Companies specializing in facilitating cryptocurrency transactions are direct beneficiaries. While the current vendor is unnamed, BitPay, which processed Ohio's initial 2018 Bitcoin tax payments, could regain or strengthen its position in the government sector. Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), a major publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange and infrastructure provider, stands to gain significantly. Its Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, has been a vocal supporter, and Coinbase's role as a licensed money transmitter in Ohio positions it well to either be the chosen vendor, a partner, or simply benefit from increased crypto adoption that drives users to its platform. Similarly, Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), through its Square and Cash App ecosystems, offers crypto buying and selling, and could see indirect benefits as more Ohioans engage with crypto for payments. Increased government acceptance of crypto payment rails will likely lead to higher transaction volumes and greater institutional trust for these and other crypto payment gateway providers.

Blockchain Technology Providers: Companies that provide the underlying blockchain infrastructure, security, and consulting services to payment processors or directly to state governments could see increased demand. This includes firms offering enterprise blockchain solutions, distributed ledger technology (DLT) services, and secure digital identity solutions that complement crypto payment systems. The overall trend towards integrating blockchain technology into public finance opens new avenues for these companies.

Companies with Crypto Exposure and Traditional Payment Networks: Public companies that have already invested in cryptocurrencies or offer crypto-related investment products may see a positive impact as mainstream adoption increases the perceived stability and utility of digital assets. Furthermore, traditional payment networks like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA), which have been actively exploring and partnering with blockchain and crypto companies, could integrate crypto payment rails into their existing systems or partner with approved processors. This ensures their continued relevance in an evolving payment landscape.

Potential Losers (or those facing pressure to adapt):

Traditional Payment Processors and Banks: Companies primarily focused on fiat-based payment processing for government fees might experience a marginal decrease in transaction volume if a significant portion shifts to crypto. However, the immediate financial impact is likely minimal given the nascent stage of crypto adoption for state fees. The larger risk for traditional banks and payment processors is failing to innovate and integrate crypto solutions. Many major banks are already exploring blockchain and crypto services, aiming to integrate rather than compete directly. Since Ohio's system converts crypto to USD, funds will still flow into the traditional banking system, mitigating direct losses but increasing the pressure for adaptation.

Companies Resistant to Crypto Innovation: Any public company in the financial services or technology sector that entirely dismisses or is slow to adapt to the growing demand for and regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency payments could lose market share or relevance in the long run. Ohio's approval signals a broader governmental acceptance, which could accelerate consumer and business adoption of digital assets, leaving laggards behind.

In essence, Ohio's move provides a significant boost to the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as a payment method, potentially leading to new revenue streams and enhanced market positioning for proactive crypto and blockchain companies. Conversely, traditional financial entities will face increased pressure to evolve their offerings to remain competitive.

Ohio's renewed commitment to accepting crypto payments for state fees is far more than an isolated local event; it's a potent indicator of the mainstreaming of digital assets and reflects profound shifts in broader industry trends. As of September 25, 2025, this initiative fits squarely into a national movement towards the institutionalization and regulated utility of cryptocurrencies, promising ripple effects across various sectors and setting important regulatory precedents.

The state's current efforts build upon its pioneering but ultimately suspended 2018 OhioCrypto.com initiative. This time, however, the approach is more robust, underpinned by unanimous approval from the Ohio State Board of Deposit and supported by comprehensive legislation like the "Ohio Blockchain Basics Act." By formally authorizing a vendor to process crypto payments, Ohio joins a growing cohort of U.S. states, including Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana, that are actively integrating digital assets into their financial infrastructure. This collective state-level innovation signals a bottom-up pressure for federal clarity and further legitimate crypto's role in public finance.

This development aligns with several key industry trends. Firstly, there's an undeniable increase in government and institutional adoption of digital assets. Beyond Ohio, states like Arizona, Colorado, and Florida are exploring or implementing crypto for taxes, fees, and even state reserve funds. Approximately 40 states have introduced or are considering crypto-related legislation in the 2025 session, with 47 states exploring "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve" bills. This growing governmental embrace signifies a maturation of the asset class, moving beyond speculative trading to practical utility. Secondly, cryptocurrencies are increasingly recognized as a maturing asset class. Regulatory clarity, such as the SEC's settlement with Ripple and anticipated XRP ETF approvals, is boosting institutional confidence. Stablecoins are gaining traction as mediums of exchange, integrated by major players like Visa (NYSE: V) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), underscoring their growing utility for payments and settlements.

The technological advancements in payments are also a crucial backdrop. Innovations in blockchain scalability, AI, and Web3 are enhancing transaction speed, security, and efficiency, making crypto payments a more viable option for large-scale operations like state governments. Furthermore, the evolving regulatory landscape in 2025 is pivotal. The U.S. is witnessing a shift towards clearer, more supportive crypto regulations, exemplified by the "GENIUS Act" signed by President Trump in July 2025, which provides a federal framework for stablecoins. This move away from "regulation by enforcement" to a more defined legal structure is expected to drive greater institutional engagement. While states like Ohio lead, federal efforts to clarify oversight and establish consistent rules (e.g., for the SEC and CFTC) will ultimately shape the national environment. The IRS's introduction of Form 1099-DA in 2025, requiring crypto exchanges to report customer transactions, also highlights the increasing focus on tax enforcement for digital assets.

The ripple effects of Ohio's decision are substantial. It will intensify competition among payment processors, encouraging both traditional and crypto-native providers to innovate for government use cases. It will also serve as a magnet for blockchain and fintech firms, with Ohio's supportive legislation aiming to attract talent and investment. For traditional financial institutions, while not directly losing out (as crypto is converted to fiat), there's increased pressure to offer crypto-related services or partner with crypto firms to remain competitive. The recent rescission of SAB 121 by the SEC, making it easier for banks to provide crypto custody, further encourages this collaboration.

Historically, the adoption of cryptocurrency by a state government mirrors past shifts in payment technologies, from the gradual acceptance of credit cards to electronic funds transfers. Each new technology necessitates addressing concerns about security, reliability, and regulatory frameworks. Ohio's repeated foray into crypto payments, learning from its 2018 experience, demonstrates a persistent willingness among states to explore digital asset utility. This state-level experimentation, alongside the global discussion around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), underscores a fundamental evolution in how money and value are exchanged, blurring the lines between private and public monetary systems. Ohio is effectively serving as a crucial laboratory for this ongoing financial transformation.

Ohio's recent approval of a crypto payment processor for state fees sets the stage for a dynamic period of implementation, observation, and potential expansion. The immediate and long-term implications will be closely watched by other states, federal regulators, and the broader financial industry.

In the short term, the focus will be on the seamless rollout of the new payment system. The selected third-party processor will begin integrating its services with various state agencies, with the Secretary of State's office leading the charge. Initial offerings are confirmed to include Bitcoin, with the potential for additional cryptocurrencies to be supported based on demand and technical feasibility. The state will meticulously monitor public and business adoption rates, using this data to refine and expand the program. Crucially, the Ohio Blockchain Basics Act (HB 116) will advance to the Senate for a vote. Its passage would cement a favorable legal framework, clarifying regulations for crypto users and businesses within the state. Ohio's progress will undoubtedly serve as a benchmark for Colorado, Utah, Louisiana, and other states exploring similar initiatives.

Looking to the long term, Ohio's vision extends beyond mere payment acceptance. A successful implementation could pave the way for widespread government adoption of crypto, potentially encompassing a broader range of services and even individual income tax payments. The state aims to cultivate a thriving blockchain ecosystem, attracting businesses and talent to establish Ohio as a "Silicon Heartland" for digital innovation. Discussions around establishing an "Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve" (HB 18/SB 57) are ongoing, which could see a portion of state funds allocated to digital assets, aligning with trends in nearly 50 other states. This could enhance financial efficiency and transparency for the state, leveraging blockchain's inherent capabilities. Ultimately, Ohio's successful integration could influence federal lawmakers, pushing for clearer and more supportive national regulations for digital assets.

However, this journey will require strategic pivots and adaptations. Scalability and user experience will be paramount as adoption grows, demanding efficient transaction handling and intuitive interfaces. The state must remain agile in response to the constantly evolving federal and state regulatory landscape for crypto. Robust cybersecurity and risk management protocols will be critical, especially if a crypto reserve is established. Expanding supported cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin will likely be necessary to meet diverse user needs. Perhaps most importantly, sustained public education campaigns will be crucial to overcome skepticism and ensure broad understanding and adoption, learning from the lower-than-anticipated uptake of the 2018 program.

Market opportunities are significant. Ohio's crypto-friendly environment could attract a wave of blockchain businesses, fostering job creation and economic growth. Clear regulatory frameworks often boost investor confidence, drawing more capital into Ohio's digital asset market. Conversely, challenges include the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies (though mitigated by immediate fiat conversion), the potential for conflicting or unclear federal regulations, and the ongoing need for robust technological infrastructure. Adoption barriers, such as unfamiliarity or perceived complexity, could also slow uptake.

Potential scenarios and outcomes range from Ohio becoming a leading crypto hub, with high adoption rates and significant blockchain investment, to a more moderate integration where crypto payments become a viable but niche option. A less favorable outcome could see limited impact due to technical glitches, user hesitancy, or new regulatory hurdles, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of ambitions. The most impactful scenario might involve federal preemption or harmonization of crypto regulations, which would require Ohio to adapt its policies to a new national standard, potentially streamlining some aspects while introducing new constraints. Ohio's commitment in 2025 positions it at a pivotal juncture, with its success offering a blueprint for the future of digital assets in public finance.

Ohio's recent approval of a vendor to process cryptocurrency payments for state fees, effective September 25, 2025, represents a significant and well-considered advancement in the state's digital economic strategy. This move, building upon previous exploratory efforts, firmly establishes Ohio as a leader in governmental crypto adoption, alongside states like Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana. It's a clear signal that digital assets are moving beyond niche speculation into the realm of practical, everyday utility within public finance.

Key Takeaways: The core of this initiative is the modernization of state payment systems, driven by a growing demand for diverse payment options. By leveraging a third-party processor to instantly convert cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into U.S. dollars, Ohio effectively mitigates volatility risks while offering cutting-edge payment flexibility. This strategy is complemented by robust legislative efforts, including the "Ohio Blockchain Basics Act" (HB 116) and discussions around an "Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve," which collectively aim to create a comprehensive, crypto-friendly ecosystem within the state. This holistic approach distinguishes Ohio's current endeavor from its earlier, more limited foray into crypto payments.

Assessment of the Market Moving Forward: The market is clearly moving towards greater institutional and governmental acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Ohio's actions align perfectly with broader national trends, where numerous states are exploring or implementing similar digital asset initiatives. The federal regulatory environment, particularly under the current administration, is showing a distinct shift towards clarity and support for cryptocurrencies, exemplified by the "GENIUS Act" for stablecoins. This evolving landscape fosters greater investor confidence and encourages broader market participation. Globally, crypto adoption continues to accelerate, with Bitcoin remaining a dominant force, increasingly accepted by traditional financial institutions and governments alike.

Significance and Lasting Impact: Ohio's proactive stance in 2025 holds profound significance. It not only legitimizes cryptocurrencies as a viable payment method but also sets a crucial precedent for other states and potentially influences federal policy. By demonstrating a successful model for integrating digital assets into government services, Ohio contributes to the normalization of crypto and accelerates its mainstream adoption. The lasting impact will likely be seen in a more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial system for citizens and businesses interacting with state governments. Furthermore, Ohio's efforts to cultivate a thriving blockchain ecosystem aim to attract innovation, talent, and investment, positioning the state as a vital hub in the emerging digital economy.

What Investors Should Watch For: In the coming months, investors should closely monitor several key indicators. Firstly, observe the actual implementation and usage rates of crypto payments for state fees in Ohio. High adoption would validate the initiative's practical utility. Secondly, track the progress of Ohio's supportive legislation, particularly the "Ohio Blockchain Basics Act" in the Senate and any further developments regarding the "Ohio Strategic Crypto Reserve." These legislative outcomes will shape the long-term regulatory environment. Thirdly, keep an eye on other states' follow-through on their crypto initiatives, as broader governmental adoption across the U.S. could create significant market opportunities. Fourthly, watch for further federal regulatory harmonization, especially from the SEC and CFTC, as clearer national guidelines will reduce uncertainty and boost institutional engagement. Finally, monitor technological advancements in crypto payment processors and general market sentiment and volatility. While regulatory clarity is a strong tailwind, the inherent fluctuations of crypto markets will continue to influence adoption and investment decisions.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

The hottest technology in crypto right now is the stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that is typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. While Tether and Circle's USDC are the clear leaders right now, it's very possible a yet-to-be-released stablecoin could emerge as the long-term winner. That's according to Austin Campbell, a professor and former executive at stablecoin firm Paxos, who shared his thoughts on the latest edition of Fortune's Crypto Playbook (available on Spotify, Apple, and YouTube).

Stablecoins such as Circle's USDC and Tether have long been popular among crypto traders as a form of settlement, but a series of high-profile acquisitions and IPOs—as well as Congress passing comprehensive legislation this summer to regulate the technology—have catapulted them into the mainstream. Now, big tech firms and banks alike are exploring integration, while new challengers are entering the market every week.





According to Campbell, there is fierce competition between entrenched stablecoins like Tether and new entrants like Agora—whose appeal lies in the fact that their value doesn't fluctuate like Bitcoin or Ethereum—but that doesn't mean a new contender can't take the throne.





On the latest episode of Fortune's Crypto Playbook podcast, Campbell compared the current moment in stablecoins to the 1990s for the internet, when services like AOL and Netscape were just getting started. “The stablecoin that will probably dominate the future has not been created yet,” he said. “It's my prediction.” 





While many crypto proponents make a similar argument for blockchain technology as a whole, Campbell has more claim to the potential growth for stablecoins. Congress's passage of the Genius Act in July is one catalyst, along with their clear use case over traditional payment rails, with stablecoins touting lower fees and faster transaction speeds. “The lesson of the internet has been … consumers writ large win, and intermediaries just get destroyed.” 




He pointed to payment firms from Mastercard and Visa to Stripe embracing stablecoins, even though their adoption might upend existing business models. But unlike other corners of the crypto industry, from NFTs to decentralized finance, the presence of established firms might make stablecoins more appealing to companies that would otherwise shy away from the volatile industry. “It does seem like a chicken-and-egg problem to some degree, where you have to convince people to come on board,” Campbell said. “But if you have a major company like Stripe putting so many resources into it, obviously that could create demand.”





Still, Campbell said, the biggest barrier for the technology is the poor design around user experience, which is why existing players might not have the advantage. “If I'm betting on horses, it's probably the outsiders laying siege to the current thing,” he said.

PayPal and decentralized finance platform Spark have teamed up to grow liquidity for PYUSD$0.9996 onchain, aiming to scale deposits from $100 million today to $1 billion in the weeks ahead.

PYUSD, issued by Paxos and pegged to the U.S. dollar, was recently onboarded to SparkLend, Spark's lending marketplace. The integration gives users the ability to supply and borrow PYUSD, with liquidity supported by Spark's $8 billion stablecoin reserve pool. 

This approach contrasts with traditional liquidity programs that rely on expensive market-maker incentives, instead offering predictable depth at set borrowing costs.

“Predictable access to deep liquidity is what allows stablecoins like PYUSD to scale quickly,” said Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs, a Spark contributor. He framed the initiative as a blueprint for how fintech firms can use DeFi to bootstrap adoption of new stablecoins.

The partnership comes as stablecoins see renewed momentum, with global supply climbing nearly $30 billion in three months to $263 billion and daily transaction volumes topping $100 billion. 

Spark previously deployed $630 million in on-chain Bitcoin-backed loans to Coinbase.

“With total DeFi value approaching $150 billion, platforms like Spark are crucial to advancing PYUSD as a cornerstone for defi with deep liquidity,” said David Weber, Head of PYUSD Ecosystem, PayPal in a press release.

 ETH's breakdown from a key chart pattern can now lead to more losses for Ether price, targeting the $3,600–$3,400 zone in the short term. 

Key takeaways:

One ETH trader lost $36.4M in a single liquidation, cementing over $45M in total losses.

Ethereum now faces heavy long liquidation clusters at $2,370–$2,500.

Ether price technicals hint at another 10%–15% drop this month.

An Ethereum trader lost $36.4 million following the liquidation of a massive long bet, after Ether (ETH) slid below the $4,000 mark on Thursday.

Wallet “0xa523” had staked 9,152 ETH on a price rise, only to be wiped out in one of the largest single-trader losses in the past 24 hours. 

Wallet “0xa523” was left with just $500,000, with its total realized losses exceeding $45.32 million, leading Lookonchain to call it Ethereum's “biggest loser.”

The wipeout came amid a $331.66 million long squeeze that has punished bullish traders over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

This week alone, Ethereum traders have suffered over $718 million in long liquidations versus $79.62 million in short liquidations. Ether's price has dipped 10.56% in the same period.

CoinGlass's liquidation heatmap highlights a huge build-up of leverage between $2,370 and $2,500. 

Therefore, if ETH keeps falling, many longs are set to be liquidated in that range, making it a likely area where selling could intensify before the market regains its footing.

On the upside, a big cluster sits at $4,760–$5,000. Short sellers will be in trouble and could be forced to buy back, driving prices higher, if ETH rebounds to those levels.

Ethereum has confirmed a breakdown from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, typically a bearish reversal setup if it occurs after a strong uptrend. 

The move shifts immediate bias to the downside, with the next target sitting near the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $3,595, down by around 10% from current levels in the short term.

The downside target falls in the support zone — the $3,600–$3,400 area — highlighted by ETH's Volume Profile (VPVR). 

It further overlaps with ETH's 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $3,392, indicating that the price can drop by 15% in the worst-case scenario if the sell-off gains steam into October.

Popular analyst Kamran Azghar highlighted around $3,600 as a “key demand” zone, noting that the ETH price may rebound to seek $4,900 or higher.

Meanwhile, Ethereum's weekly chart showed price retesting a key horizontal support zone around $3,800–$4,000, as highlighted by analyst Cold Blood Shiller.

The area had acted as a resistance during the 2022–2023 cycle. A successful defense of this level would strengthen the case for bullish continuation, turning former resistance into support.

A rebound toward the $4,760–$5,000 cluster, as highlighted by many bullish analysts in the past, remains possible if ETH bulls defend the $3,800–$4,000 levels in the coming days.

First Public Company to Natively Issue Equity on the Ethereum Blockchain; Collaboration to Explore Regulated Trading of Tokenized Shares on Automated Market Makers

Minneapolis, MN, Sept.  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) (“SharpLink” or the “Company”), one of the world's largest corporate holders of Ether (“ETH”) and prominent industry advocate of Ethereum adoption, today announced its intention to tokenize its SEC-registered common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain, appointing financial technology firm Superstate as its Digital Transfer Agent.

By enabling its equity to be tokenized natively onchain, SharpLink aims to demonstrate how public companies can use blockchain infrastructure to create shareholder value, improve market efficiency and drive forward the next generation of capital markets. SharpLink intends to partner with Superstate to tokenize its equity on Ethereum through its Opening Bell platform, expanding Superstate's multichain capital markets infrastructure. 

SharpLink and Superstate also intend to closely collaborate on advancing how tokenized public equities can ultimately trade on Automated Market Makers (“AMMs”) and other decentralized finance (“DeFi”) protocols in a fully compliant manner. This initiative aligns with the SEC's broader Project Crypto innovation agenda aimed at modernizing U.S. securities regulation to better enable digital assets, blockchain and onchain markets. 

This work has the potential to position SharpLink's tokenized equity, along with future Opening Bell tokenizations, for secondary market trading on AMMs. Doing so would demonstrate how compliant tokenized securities can deliver broader utility, enhance liquidity and modernize capital flows for a new era of investor and issuer engagement. 

Commenting on the new partnership with Superstate, SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, stated, “Tokenizing SharpLink's equity directly on Ethereum is far more than a technological achievement – it is a statement about where we believe the future of the global capital markets is headed. At SharpLink, our core mission is two-fold: to build the world's most trusted digital asset treasury and to pursue initiatives that accelerate the global adoption of the Ethereum network. By working with Superstate, not only are we enabling our shareholders to hold SBET shares natively on Ethereum, but we are also embarking on entirely new frontiers for how compliant, tokenized public equities could one day trade seamlessly through AMMs – an evolution we believe could redefine market structure itself.”

Joseph Lubin, SharpLink's Chairman of the Board, Founder and CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum, added, “We're proud to have been the first public company to become a Digital Asset Treasury company on Ethereum, onboarding traditional finance to Ethereum. And now we are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum. As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink's conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built.”

Launched in 2025, Opening Bell is a regulated onchain issuance and tokenization platform that allows companies to tokenize SEC-registered equity via blockchain infrastructure. Shares tokenized with Opening Bell remain fully compliant and legally equivalent to traditional book-entry equity, but can also be held in self-custodied wallets, integrated with digital financial products and made available to global investor segments. 

“SharpLink will be the first public company to tokenize their shares on Ethereum using Superstate's Opening Bell, a milestone worthy of such an important Ethereum-aligned company,” said Superstate CEO Robert Leshner. “We're very pleased to be partnering with SharpLink as they build the ecosystem for tokenized equity on Ethereum and beyond.”

Following the appointment of Lubin as Chairman and the forging of its strategic partnership with Consensys, one of the most important companies in the Ethereum ecosystem, SharpLink launched its ETH treasury strategy in early June 2025. Since that time, the Company has accumulated more than 838,000 ETH and generated 3,815 ETH in native and liquid staking rewards as of late September, establishing itself as one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum in the world.

About SharpLink Gaming, Inc:

Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: SBET) is one of the world's largest publicly traded companies to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset – a move that aligns the Company with the future of digital capital and gives investors direct exposure to Ethereum, the world's leading smart-contract platform and second largest digital asset.

Forward-Looking Statement

Statements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects, as well as any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such statements include, but are not limited to, the Company's intention to tokenize its common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain, the execution of the Company's treasury strategy and other statements that are not historical facts, including statements which may be accompanied by the words “intends,” “may,” “will,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “estimates,” “aims,” “believes,” “hopes,” “potential” or similar words. Actual results could differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements due to certain factors, including without limitation, the Company's ability to repurchase shares of SharpLink's common stock, if any, in the open market through its stock repurchase program, potential use of the Company's ATM facility, the Company's ability to achieve profitable operations, fluctuations in the market price of ETH that will impact the Company's accounting and financial reporting (see accounting rules discussed below), government regulation of cryptocurrencies and online betting, changes in securities laws or regulations, customer acceptance of new products and services, the demand for its products and its customers' economic condition, the impact of competitive products and pricing, the lengthy sales cycle, proprietary rights of the Company, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and its competitors, general economic conditions and other risk factors detailed in the Company's annual report and other filings with the SEC. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, entities are generally required to measure certain digital intangible assets at fair value, with changes reflected in net income each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of crypto assets could result in significant fluctuations to the balance sheet and income statement results. Additionally, for other certain types of crypto assets that are considered digital intangible assets, the Company uses the historical costs less impairment model. This model may require the Company to record an associated impairment charge reflected in net income as a result of a decrease in the market price of ETH below the cost value at which the Company's ETH are carried on its balance sheet. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof, and the Company does not undertake any responsibility to update the forward-looking statements in this press release.

Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have become one of the most dynamic fundraising mechanisms in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. By issuing tokens to investors, startups and enterprises can secure capital to develop projects and scale operations. However, with thousands of ICOs launched over the past decade, competition for investor attention has become fierce. This is where ICO marketing plays a crucial role. It goes beyond basic promotion, focusing on building trust, creating awareness, and establishing a credible project identity. A strong ICO marketing strategy helps projects reach their target audience, communicate their vision, and ensure long-term sustainability in a highly competitive market.

Launching a successful ICO requires more than just an innovative idea it demands a carefully structured foundation that instills confidence among investors. Core marketing components act as the backbone of any ICO strategy, ensuring that every touchpoint reflects professionalism, credibility, and transparency. From detailed whitepapers and roadmaps to polished branding and a credible team presence, these elements build the narrative around the project. Investors need clarity on not just what the project does, but also how it plans to achieve its vision. Without these essentials, even the most promising ideas risk fading into obscurity.

Every successful ICO begins with a deep understanding of its target audience and the market it operates in. Without knowing who the project is meant for, even the most innovative solution can miss its mark. An experienced ICO Marketing Agency can provide in-depth investor research, helping identify whether the token offering appeals more to institutional investors, retail traders, or crypto enthusiasts. Market analysis further uncovers trends, opportunities, and gaps within the industry. Competitor benchmarking and regulatory awareness refine positioning, ensuring that messaging resonates with investors while staying compliant in a complex and evolving blockchain landscape.

A thriving community is one of the most powerful assets an ICO can have. In the decentralized world of blockchain, community members aren't just spectators they are advocates, investors, and contributors who help spread awareness and drive growth. Active engagement fosters loyalty, while open communication channels create trust between project teams and supporters. Hosting discussions, answering questions, and providing updates ensures that investors feel valued and informed. Strong communities are also resilient, helping projects withstand challenges and build long-term momentum. Ultimately, an engaged community turns an ICO from just another token sale into a movement that investors want to back.

Content is the bridge that connects complex blockchain ideas to investors in a clear and compelling way. A well-designed content strategy helps projects simplify technical details, showcase their expertise, and establish authority within the crypto ecosystem. Educational resources such as whitepapers, blog posts, and case studies offer transparency, while visually engaging formats like videos and infographics make information accessible to a broader audience. Beyond attracting investors, consistent content builds long-term trust and enhances search visibility. In a market flooded with hype, authentic and informative content ensures that projects stand out for the right reasons.

In today's digital ecosystem, credibility is often amplified by voices of influence. Strategic partnerships with influencers, industry leaders, and media outlets can significantly boost an ICO's visibility and reputation. Influencers serve as trusted intermediaries, helping projects reach audiences that already value their opinion. Media partnerships and interviews further validate the project's credibility, placing it on reputable platforms. By leveraging these collaborations, ICOs can tap into established communities, generate buzz, and foster trust at scale. When executed effectively, social and influencer partnerships create powerful endorsements that can make the difference between a successful and overlooked ICO.

While organic growth and community building form the backbone of long-term success, paid marketing accelerates reach and ensures visibility in competitive markets. Paid advertising channels allow projects to precisely target investors who are actively seeking blockchain opportunities. From crypto-friendly networks to search engine marketing, paid campaigns put the project directly in front of potential backers. Banner ads, display marketing, and retargeting campaigns ensure consistent visibility, driving traffic and conversions. When integrated with organic efforts, paid advertising provides a balanced approach, ensuring both immediate traction and sustainable growth for an ICO launch.

The real measure of ICO success isn't just in the funds raised but in the trust sustained afterward. Investors want assurance that the project will continue delivering value long after the token sale ends. This is why transparency, consistent communication, and post-ICO support are essential. Verified audits, performance monitoring, and milestone reporting reinforce credibility. Regular updates and responsive support foster loyalty and community strength. Additionally, analyzing campaign performance helps improve future strategies. By focusing on long-term growth and investor trust, projects transform their ICO from a one-time event into a lasting ecosystem.

Public relations (PR) and media exposure play a crucial role in building awareness and credibility for ICO projects. Unlike paid ads, PR is often perceived as more authentic because it comes from third-party publications or journalists. Strong media coverage can amplify a project's reach, attract attention from investors, and position the team as innovators in the blockchain space. By sharing updates, press releases, and thought leadership pieces, projects can gain authority in both crypto-specific and mainstream financial publications. PR acts as a bridge between technical innovation and public perception, making it a vital component of ICO marketing.

A successful ICO launch requires far more than innovative technology or token economics it depends on the strength of the marketing strategy. From building strong communities and crafting compelling content to leveraging influencers and ensuring transparency, each element plays a vital role. Projects that partner with the right experts, such as a reputable ICO Marketing Agency, gain the advantage of experience and strategic insight. By focusing on trust, engagement, and credibility, ICOs can not only achieve a successful launch but also build a sustainable future in the competitive blockchain ecosystem.

Decentralized applications (dApps) have transformed digital ecosystems by providing transparency, security, and direct user control. However, scaling these applications on traditional blockchain networks presents significant challenges. High transaction costs, slow confirmation times, and limited throughput hinder the ability to serve large user bases effectively. Layer 2 blockchain solutions are designed to overcome these limitations by offloading operations from the main chain while maintaining security through cryptographic proofs. Leveraging these solutions allows developers to build high-performance, cost-effective, and scalable dApps capable of handling increasing user demands without compromising decentralization or application reliability.

The stablecoin ecosystem has entered a new era where blockchain innovation meets tangible assets. Beyond fiat-backed tokens, a growing niche is emerging: commodity-backed stablecoins. These tokens are pegged to physical reserves such as gold, silver, oil, or a basket of metals, offering a hedge against inflation and bringing real-world assets on-chain. In this article, we explore the 10 commodity-backed stablecoin projects reshaping digital asset stability and why they matter in the broader conversation about Asset-Backed Stablecoins.

That we lived in the house so long after what happened is something I'll never understand. We sealed up her room but the house itself was an altar to her presence. You couldn't walk over a creaky floorboard or see a line on a wall from one of her markers that didn't flood your mind with memories so vivid and strong it felt like a stroke. God, did we miss her.

The chief crypto analyst at crypto media platform Real Vision, Jamie Coutts, says Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins possess more upside potential.

Coutts tells his 45,700 followers on X that a looser monetary policy could set the conditions necessary for a Bitcoin and altcoins rally, and a bear market thereafter.

“Central banks, if (when) they reverse their balance sheet tightening, will set off another leg higher — with the move likely accentuated in altcoins. With that will likely come the conditions for a peak and potentially the setup for a deeper fall than what I would expect, worst case approximately 50%. We aren't anywhere near that yet.”

According to Coutts, it is unlikely that the crypto market has reached a cycle top yet despite the recent pullback.

“Liquidity's still supportive, but momentum refuses to deliver fireworks, frustrating everyone chasing a parabola. Looking ahead, global liquidity is lagging debt growth—cycle peak? Not likely.”

On what the lack of “fireworks” could portend for the market, Coutts says,

“Bitcoin's so-called ‘boring' climb actually echoes the slow crawl in global liquidity this cycle. Ironically, a dull cycle could mean a shallow bear drawdown, but also a longer grind down.”

Over the long term, Coutts says two factors support the bullish case for Bitcoin.

“Still, two secular trends are bulletproof: blockchain adoption and monetary debasement. And for these reasons, it's best to zoom out and remember Bitcoin is fast becoming global collateral, it's an AI-beneficiary technology, the driver of energy grid stabilization/modernization and the anchor asset for global portfolios.”

Bitcoin is trading at $113,128 at time of writing.

 Transaction reversibility may help stablecoins become an intrinsic part of the legacy financial system, according to the president of Circle. 

Update, Sept. 25, 9:52 am UTC: This article has been updated to include comments from Andrei Grachev, founding partner at synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance.

Circle, the world's second-largest stablecoin issuer, is reportedly examining reversible transactions to help recover funds from fraud and hacks, which appears to counter one of crypto's founding principles: That transactions are final and beyond centralized control.

Circle president Heath Tarbert told the Financial Times on Thursday that the company is examining mechanisms that could allow transactions to be rolled back in cases of fraud or hacks, while still maintaining settlement finality.

“We are thinking through [. . .] whether or not there's the possibility of reversibility of transactions, right, but at the same time, we want settlement finality,” Tarbert told the FT. “So there's an inherent tension there between being able to transfer something immediately, but having it be irrevocable [...].”

Supporters of reversibility argue it could help scam victims and bolster mainstream trust in stablecoins. Still, the idea challenges the decentralized model that underpins crypto, where transactions are permanent and immune from unilateral changes by issuers or validators.

Cointelegraph has asked Circle for comment on the details of transaction reversibility and the parameters that would be used to decide on reversals.

Despite the centralization risks, transaction reversibility proved useful when decentralized exchange Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22, of which validators managed to freeze $162 million.

A week later, Sui validators approved a governance proposal to return the frozen $162 million to Cetus.

While some decentralization advocates criticized validators' ability to freeze the funds, other industry watchers praised the rapid response as a step forward against crypto industry hacks.

While the blockchain industry is often touted as the future of finance, it may benefit from adopting certain features from the traditional finance (TradFi) industry, according to Tarbert.

But there are some benefits of the current system that aren't necessarily currently present,” he said, adding that some developers see the need for “some degree of reversibility for fraud,” provided that all parties agree.

The comments come amid a broader push into institutional-grade infrastructure by Circle.

At the beginning of August, Circle announced the launch of its layer-1 (L1) blockchain, Arc, a new network designed to offer an “enterprise-grade foundation” for stablecoin payments, foreign exchange and capital markets applications.

Arc will leverage Circle's USDC (USDC) as its native gas token for blockchain transactions.

Circle plans to roll out Arc as a public testnet this fall, ahead of a full launch by the end of 2025, after integrating with Fireblocks' digital asset custody and tokenization platform for its custody and compliance support solutions, Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 18.

Arc's debut with Fireblocks will give banks and asset managers access to the blockchain from day one, as Fireblocks is serving over 2,400 banks.

While immutability is “central” to blockchain design, the idea of every transaction being “irreversible under all conditions” has only served the ethos of the early crypto industry. 

But this “certainly does not reflect how financial systems operate at an institutional scale,” Andrei Grachev, founding partner at synthetic dollar protocol Falcon Finance, told Cointelegraph. “In that context, reversibility is not a flaw. Instead, it can be a functional feature when designed with clear rules, user consent and onchain enforcement.”

He added that this could involve smart contracts capable of issuing refunds in fraud cases, or permission-based stablecoins that allow temporary settlement changes without depending on opaque intermediaries.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum's price dipped below $4,000 for the first time since early August during Thursday morning trading hours.

According to The Block's Ethereum price page, the cryptocurrency traded around $3,999 at around 1:00 a.m. on Thursday. It has since recovered to $4,037, down 2.91% in the past 24 hours.

"Ethereum's recent dip below the psychological $4K mark was triggered by a mix of technical breakdowns, macroeconomic jitters, and cascading liquidations," said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. "A failure to hold the $4,200 support zone led to over US$1.7 billion in altcoin liquidations, with ETH alone accounting for US$212.9 million."

While the U.S. Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in September, the 25 basis point rate cut failed to ignite a sustained bull rally as once expected. One of the factors was Chair Jerome Powell's comment, saying that he is in no hurry to further lower rates.



On top of that, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds have seen reduced inflows this month. So far in September, ETH ETFs have collectively accumulated only $110 million in net inflows, where August's inflow amount exceeded $3.8 billion.

However, the crypto analyst said long-term holders of ETH are doubling down on the contrary — "On-chain data shows over 420,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges this week, suggesting accumulation rather than panic."

Nassar Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW, also pointed out that Ethereum exchange balances have fallen to lowest levels in nine years, with millions worth of ETH being withdrawn from centralized exchanges.

"[This underscores] a profound shift toward long-term holding amid growing institutional confidence," Achkar said. "This sustained outflow signals a potential supply shock on the horizon, as whales and retail buyers prioritize self-custody and staking yields over short-term trading, potentially setting up ETH's next major price rally towards new all-time highs."

The Philippines has launched a blockchain-based transparency system for its Department of Public Works and Highways after mass protests over alleged corruption in flood-control projects worth billions.

Integrity Chain, developed by BayaniChain Ventures, was unveiled on Wednesday as a platform to record DPWH contracts and project milestones on a tamper-proof ledger.

The goal is to turn “government records into digital public assets that are immutable, verifiable, and openly validated,” BayaniChain CEO and co-founder Paul Soliman told Decrypt.

Once expanded from the DPWH to other agencies, the initiative could later help “protect the entire annual budget of the Philippines,” estimated at roughly $98 billion, he said.

The project is part of a broader effort “to reshape accountability across every department and every peso spent,” making accountability “permanent, measurable, and unavoidable,” Soliman said.

“Public trust will be rebuilt not on promises, but on cryptography, open validation, and a system where citizens themselves can verify outcomes,” he added.

The rollout comes in the wake of mass protests drawing an estimated 130,000 people on September 21, which marked the 53rd anniversary of martial law declared by former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr., father of the current president. The declaration is remembered for widespread human rights abuses, censorship, and corruption.

Protests demanded accountability after revelations of overpriced contracts, substandard construction, and ghost projects in the country's flood-control program under the DPWH's oversight.

Over $33 billion was allocated to flood-control projects across 15 years, according to the Australian Institute of International Affairs.

Similar to an earlier implementation at the Department of Budget and Management, Integrity Chain ingests data directly from DPWH systems, minting each contract, budget release, and project milestone as a digital public asset.

Prismo, the orchestration layer, manages data handling, encryption, and validation. The platform runs on Polygon's Proof-of-Stake network, an Ethereum-compatible scaling solution that serves as its consensus and transparency layer.

The records are then cryptographically time-stamped and anchored on-chain before reaching independent validators, so that “any attempt to withhold or manipulate information becomes visible rather than hidden,” Gelo Wong, chief growth officer and co-founder at BayaniChain, told Decrypt.

Validators include independent civic organizations, non-governmental organizations, universities, and media groups, among other sectors. These validators would review and attest to the entries, with their own actions logged as public records to maintain accountability.

Keys for validators are “hardware-secured, rotated periodically, and assigned to reviews through randomization,” with each validator action “recorded on-chain as its own public asset, ensuring that misconduct or bias is transparently logged,” Wong explained.

Asked about safeguards, Wong pointed to the framework's one-organization-one-vote model, which prevents any sector from dominating the process. More than 40 non-governmental organizations participated at launch, providing a “wide and diversified base of civic accountability,” he added.

The output of new enforcement actions from the Commodity Future
Trading Commission (CFTC) has virtually ground to a halt in 2025,
with a slowdown that greatly exceeds the slower pace of new
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions. But,
the CFTC Division of Enforcement has not gone away. A commodity
trading adviser (CTA) as well as a commodity pool operator (CPO)
and its principal, who previously pled guilty to orchestrating a
novel cryptocurrency-related fraudulent scheme, have agreed to pay
more than $2.8 million as part of a settlement with the CFTC,
announced on September 17, 2025.1 The CFTC's
announcement stated that it had obtained this judgment against
Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), the CTA and CPO, and Peter
Kambolin, its owner and registered associated person (collectively
the "Defendants"). In the parallel criminal case,
Kambolin previously pled guilty in October of 2023.2

According to the consent order, these Defendants improperly
allocated profitable trades between two commodity pools and certain
proprietary accounts, misled pool participants, and violated CFTC
requirements on trade allocation. The court found from January 2019
through November 2021 that the Defendants marketed SAM as a CTA and
CPO offering strategies in exchange-traded cryptocurrency and
foreign exchange futures.

The Defendants ran at least two pools but executed those pool
trades alongside trades of their proprietary accounts and then
allocated the trades across the accounts each day. More
specifically, the Defendants consistently directed profitable
trades to their own accounts and assigned losing or less profitable
trades to the pools, defrauding participants and violating CFTC
requirements that customer trades be allocated fairly and
equitably. They also misrepresented that the pools would primarily
trade cryptocurrency and FX futures. To the contrary, more than
half of the trades in question actually involved equity index
futures.

Returning to the criminal case and his guilty plea,
Kambolin's case marked the first time that prosecutors brought
criminal charges related to cherry-picking against a commodity pool
trader focused, at least in part, on digital asset futures.
Kambolin was sentenced in January 2024 to two years in prison,
followed by three years of supervised release and a year-and-a-half
of home confinement. He also was ordered to pay $1.63 million in
criminal forfeiture and $1.2 million in restitution. The CFTC
consent order specified that money paid toward forfeiture and
restitution in the criminal case will be credited dollar-for-dollar
toward the civil amounts.

Studies indicate that a simple treatment could halt a leading cause of death for millions of people.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

We all have moments when we start to worry about our memories. You lose your keys. You forget the name of someone you know well. That alone is scary. And then there's dementia: You forget recent conversations; whole hours or afternoons become blank. You struggle with simple tasks you've done a million times: tying your shoes, making coffee. The person who used to plan trips while cooking dinner with friends and being the DJ for the party now lies awake at night in fear and spends days staring, because they don't know where they are or what to do next. Anger, depression, and confusion grow. You can remember enough to know—this isn't your life.

It is possible that microscopic structures in your nerve cells are unraveling—and with them, your sense of who you are. 

It is also possible that putting a $150 object the size of a hairdryer against your head for a short period each day could stop dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Even reverse it. If it works, there would be no more watching people disappear bit by bit. And we'd see a huge reduction in one of the leading causes of death. 

Evidence is building that exposing the brain to short bouts of an extremely low-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) signal can slow or reverse the impacts of Alzheimer's. Anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, has studied the minute structures of the brain for decades–especially those microscopic structures called microtubules that may contain our memories. Hameroff is the Senior Scientist at Arizona Astrobiology Center, former director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona and Co-Director of the Science of Consciousness Conference. He was an early voice among a growing body of scientists who think electromagnetism encourages microtubules to hold together.

Microtubules are protein structures that look something like cylindrical tubes made of beads, forming part of the cytoskeleton of all living cells. They're like the bones of the cell. But they're also oscillators that generate, propagate, and amplify electrical signals; so they're effectively the nerve center of the cell. Hameroff has been studying microtubules for decades as the possible biological structure that enables consciousness. He says he believes microtubules store our memories. After all, neurons last our entire lives, unlike most of the rest of our cells, which are constantly replaced.

There are tens of thousands of microtubules in every neuron. The most prevalent protein in them is called tau, which serves key functions for the microtubule, including possibly stabilizing it. When scientists have examined the neuronal cells of people who have died from Alzheimer's, they discovered piles of tau that appear to have fallen off the microtubules and stuck together in clumps called Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), or tau tangles. These tangles show tau in a specific state that is an Alzheimer's marker. When tau shows up in the bloodstream or urine, you know the disease is worsening. 

In Alzheimer's disease, Hameroff says, scientists don't know whether the microtubules disintegrate and release the tau or whether the tau falls off because of a malfunction that weakens the bond. The result is that the microtubules disintegrate. But there's a clear correlation between this breakup and Alzheimer's.

“So imagine, God forbid, your bones started to dissolve,” Hameroff says. “You get really short and you lose all this mass. And if your bones are also your nervous system (the electrical signaling), you lose your nervous system.” This is what he believes happens in Alzheimer's. The microtubules, which serve as both the bones and the nervous system of the neuron, fall apart, so the neuron shrinks. When it does so, synapses are pulled away from one another. As the system collapses, memories and cognition are lost.

Another key marker of Alzheimer's is the presence of amyloid plaques—a sticky substance in the brain that can build up along the neural pathways outside the neuron. For decades the pharmaceutical industry has been creating drugs to remove the plaques. But many researchers say there's no convincing evidence that plaques cause Alzheimer's. People with the plaques don't always have symptoms; people with symptoms don't always have the plaques. 

Drug companies' efforts to use anti-amyloid antibodies over the last 20 to 30 years haven't worked to make patients better, Hameroff says. And there is no drug to address what is causing the tau tangles, though the tangles themselves aren't toxic, he adds.

The cost to treat the plaques can be enormous. A 2024 article published by Northeastern University noted that a new IV infusion therapy Kisunla, given once a month to people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, was $32,000 a year. Leqembi, another amyloid-destroying IV therapy for Alzheimer's, costs $26,500 a year.

Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organization, 55 million people globally live with dementia, with another 10 million cases diagnosed annually. Most people think Alzheimer's Disease and dementia are a normal part of aging, but they're not. While these diseases only affect about 10 percent of older people, they're also the seventh leading cause of death, and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. In 2019, dementia cost economies $1.3 trillion globally; approximately half of these costs are attributable to informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average five hours of care and supervision per day.

That's where the inexpensive brain zapper comes in.

Several studies have indicated that subjecting the brain to various ELF-EMF treatments can positively impact several systems in the microtubule. And that results in better brain function.

Researchers published a study in February in the European Journal of Neuroscience where they tested the theory that a 40Hz signal would reverse microtubule-tau disintegration. Not only did cells that had microtubule-tau separation damage stay intact when treated with multiple bouts of ELF-EMF, but it also significantly reduced the cause of weakened bonds between tau and the microtubule. Researchers also found that other frequencies in neuron-like cultures could help with microtubule development and regeneration.

Hameroff has been working with quantum mechanics expert Anirban Bandyopadhyay, PhD, who heads the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan. Bandyopadhyay previously discovered that numerous bands of electromagnetic energy exist within microtubules, at multiple frequencies and time signatures. 

It's important, Hameroff notes, that the only safe treatment strictly uses just the very low frequencies. Mid-range frequencies will open the blood-brain barrier which, as he says, is there for a reason. Higher frequencies are used to cause lesions, like zapping a tumor. 

Hameroff had made his own efforts to test these theories in 2011. He proposed to colleagues at one point that they experiment with using ultrasound to try to ease depression in some of their chronic pain patients. He reckoned the ultrasound machine the hospital was already using to find brain bleeds in infants might be safe enough to test on the brain.

“And they said, yeah, great idea, Hameroff. You go first. You got a nice shaved head. Go ahead. We'll watch.” At the end of a long day in the operating room, his colleagues wheeled in an ultrasound machine. “So I put the goop on. I put it to my head and turned it on. I kept it there for about 30 seconds, maybe, and I didn't feel anything. I was disappointed, so I put it down. But about a minute later, I got a buzz, and I started being buzzed for like two hours. And I was really creative, energetic. I felt tremendous,“ Hameroff says.

The next day he recommended trying the treatment on patients experiencing pain. During a double-blind study—in which doctors didn't know whether a patient received true treatment or a placebo—they asked people about changes in their mood, 10 minutes and 40 minutes after the treatment. 

“So it was not the best study in the world,” Hameroff says, “but it showed a positive effect in a double-blind study, and no side effects. We published it in the journal Brain Stimulation.”

Over the last decade, more studies have found that electromagnetic brain stimulation can address myriad issues. As a result, neuroscientists have used it to treat specific parts of the brain for specific conditions.  

So a budget brain zapper for Alzheimer's would do a lot of good. Because memory is stored all over the brain, with emotions, skills, spatial awareness, and sensory recall located in various parts of the cortex, Hameroff believes that treating the whole brain with ultrasound is probably the ticket. 

An ultrasound machine at a hospital, he says, costs around $70,000. The machine they're considering, the USPro2000, costs around $150. (Ironically he suspects that's one reason he's finding it difficult to get funding for medical trials: if it works, nobody will get rich. People will just get better.) 

A friend of Hameroff's, Sterling Cooley, had basically been doing informal tests using the device—a process Hameroff kept his distance from, given that he has a medical license to protect. However, after Hameroff talked with people at The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)—an American non-profit parapsychological research institute—they offered to use their institutional review board to validate Cooley's results and make further research legal. 

“We have to be careful what we say,” Hameroff says. “We're not treating Alzheimer's. We're treating mental memory problems. And we call it brain massage, ultrasonic brain massage. Which sounds a little bit better. It's kind of what it is.”

IONS Institutional Review Board also insisted that if the patients wanted to enroll, they had to have their doctor's permission. That slowed things down, Hameroff says. He's hoping for more funding to advance this treatment effort. “But in the meantime, more and more papers are coming out showing improvement in Alzheimer's with ultrasound,” he says. One paper showed that cognition and memory improved significantly, and neural degeneration in the part of the brain responsible for  higher-order functions was reversed.

“My dream, I guess, is to go to the memory care facility near my house, which has gone from one city block to five city blocks since I've lived there, and go room to room and give everybody, you know, five minutes.” 

Then he'd like to modify the machine to use all the microtubule resonant frequencies Bandyopadhyay has discovered. He wants to call it The Tubulator 5000. 

“Yeah,” he says, “maybe we'll do that.”

Colossal Biosciences as a company name was picked to engage children, says chief executive Ben Lamm.Credit: Colossal Biosciences

Colossal Biosciences, in Dallas, Texas, describes itself as the world's first de-extinction company. It aims to revive lost species using CRISPR gene-editing technology, including the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.). It attracted controversy when it announced it has ‘de-extincted' the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago. Its co-founders are technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm, Colossal's chief executive, and George Church, the company's genetics adviser, who also holds academic research positions at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. 

In the third article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Lamm describes how the name ‘Colossal Biosciences' came about. 

The fact that the world will lose up to 25% of all biodiversity between now and 2050 is a huge problem. At my company, we asked ourselves, how do we come up with a name that encompasses three elements: the problem, the solution and our flagship species, the mammoth? 

Climate change, biodiversity, CRISPR and gene editing, artificial intelligence, computational analysis and advanced embryology can be difficult concepts for the public to fully grasp. We came up with ‘Colossal Biosciences' because losing species is a colossal problem, our solution is colossal and the mammoth is a colossal animal.

We felt that our brand and name should not only reflect the problem and solution, but also be approachable to children, including some who will grow up to read Cell, Nature and Science. Every week, we get little pictures of dodos and baby mammoths that kids draw, and their parents mail us physical letters, saying things such as: ‘Thank you so much for doing what you're doing. My kid is excited about science. You're making science cool.' 

To come up with Colossal, I worked with Chris Klee, executive vice-president of design at the company, and Chris Stevens, co-founder of Maven Creative, our branding agency, in Orlando, Florida.

We've worked together for the past 20 years. We had a list of seven or eight potential names — including ‘Huge', ‘Macedon' (an ancient kingdom) and ‘Footprint' (because every species has a unique one). Everything was centred around the concept of ‘big and awesome'. Obviously, ‘Mammoth' was on the list because the world is facing a mammoth challenge, but we felt that calling it that would have pigeonholed us to one species. 

We also liked ‘Colossus', and the idea of using ‘us' to signify a team effort. But Colossus is a character in the Marvel Universe media franchise, and we didn't want to be too Hollywood. We also considered names linked to evolution, and thought ‘Darwin' could be a cool one. But when we said ‘Colossal' out loud, we were like, ‘That's it!' 

Alongside the name, there's the brand — so before we decided on Colossal, we underwent a process to come up with a brand that encapsulated ‘Harvard University meets 1980's MTV'.

According to experts, the building may have once been a royal “water palace.”

The Konbaung Dynasty (1752 to 1885)—also known as the Third Burmese Empire—was the last dynasty to rule Burma (now Myanmar), eventually toppled by the British. A recent natural disaster may give researchers a rare look into remnants of the empire, or at least one remnant in particular. 

Back in March, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake revealed an ancient structure in Tada-U Township, Myanmar. According to a translated report from the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, some believe the remains could have been part of a royal “water palace” from the Konbaung era. 

Part of the archaeological site—a set of stairs—was originally uncovered in 2009 while locals were baking bricks. But the recent earthquake caused a fissure that revealed more parts of the structure that were previously hidden beneath layers of soil. Exploratory excavations began on April 9, led by the Mandalay branch of the Department of Archaeology. Researchers say that additional ruins, including a handrail, brick platforms, and an 18-inch riser step, are now visible. According to the report, some of these features resemble sketches from ancient palm-leaf manuscripts called “Pura-pike.” 

Historically, water has been a religious symbol in Myanmar culture, so water palaces served as important places for rituals, the Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports. The water palace described in the palm-leaf manuscript—supposedly penned by Minister Letwe Nawrahta (a prominent minister during the Burmese Kingdom)—has five grand staircases and 18 to 20 dormitories shaded by mango trees. 

Though the prospect of finding a royal water palace is exciting, it's much more likely the structure is something simpler. Researchers suggest the building may have been a wooden residence, spanning about 200-250 feet long and 200 feet wide. According to experts, the structure resembles the Inwa Varkara Wooden Monastery and the Shwenandaw (Golden Palace) Monastery in Mandalay. 

Some commenters are critical of researchers not unearthing the structure when it was initially discovered in 2009. Because of the possible religious significance of the site and how little is currently known, Myanmar's Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports that further research will continue and, in the future, the structure will be preserved for public education.

A drug that regrows hair and a switch that restores eyesight could soon change medicine forever.

Some animals in the world have a pretty cool superpower: the ability to regenerate. Salamanders can regrow lost tails, for example, while zebrafish can regenerate fins, damaged heart tissue, and even spinal cords. Unfortunately, while humans can heal wounds and fractures, we can't regenerate major limbs and organs … yet. 

That hasn't stopped scientists from chasing the incredible idea, using regeneration as a potential tool to treat human disease and injury. And this quest to hack biology is exactly the kind of breakthrough story Pop Mech readers can't get enough of, from reversing hair loss to restoring eyesight. The treatments may sound like sci-fi now, but with continued testing, they could soon move from the lab to your medicine cabinet. 

Scientists at UCLA created a new topical drug, PP405, that stimulates new hair growth. PP405 regrows hair by reactivating dormant hair follicle cells, unlike the other common hair-loss treatments (finasteride, minoxidil) that merely delay hair loss.

So, how did scientists “wake up” dormant stem cells? Since active hair follicle cells contain more lactate, which helps them create energy without oxygen, researchers determined they needed to increase cell lactate in these dormant cells. Enter PP405, which inhibits the protein that moves pyruvate into mitochondria, and therefore yields more lactate. When tested on mice, sure enough, they began regrowing hair.

PP405 has undergone two safety clinical trials so far, and will go into testing for its effectiveness next year. 

A research team at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology may have discovered a new way to regrow retinal cells, and it comes with incredible implications for treating blindness.

By blocking PROX1, a protein that inhibits retinal cell development in mammals, the researchers saw retinal regeneration in a group of mice suffering from a disease that results in photoreceptor deterioration. And the regeneration stuck around: Scientists observed the effects from the regeneration in the mice for six months, making it the first successful “induction of long-term neural regeneration” in the retinas of mammals.

A judge in New York rejected a request on 23 September to disqualify the use of cutting-edge DNA sequencing as evidence in a case against an alleged serial killer. The ruling paves the way for a type of DNA analysis known as whole-genome sequencing — used to decipher ancient DNA in fossilized remains, for example — to be admitted as evidence in US criminal trials.

“This is a big step forward for the use of DNA evidence, because it will allow comparisons and matches with evidence that was previously considered too minuscule, too old or too badly degraded to be considered useful,” says Nathan Lents, a biologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. “You can bet that cold-case units all over the country are going back through their evidence lockers to see if there are samples that can now be tested with a reasonable chance of success.”

The Gilgo Beach killings were a series of murders that occurred in Suffolk County, New York, between 1993 and 2011. Many of the victims were sex workers, and the bodies of some of them were found near the eponymous beach. New York architect Rex Heuermann was charged with seven of the murders in 2023 and 2024 partially on the basis of hairs found on the victims.

In 2010, investigators concluded that there wasn't enough genetic material in the hairs for conventional forensic technology to identify whose they were. But since then, genomic technology has matured at a fast pace.

Forensic scientists still identify suspects from hair and other samples using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which can amplify snippets of DNA called short tandem repeats (STRs). Today, however, scientists can also sequence whole genomes and look at single-letter variations in the DNA to zero in on a person of interest. This technology has the added benefit of being able to analyse severely degraded samples — from Neanderthal remains to hairs in the Gilgo Beach case. But it has typically been used only during investigations, and the results have not been widely presented as evidence before juries.

The prosecution in the Gilgo Beach case contracted the company Astrea Forensics in Santa Cruz, California, to analyse the hairs found on the victims. Because they were rootless, they hadn't yielded enough DNA for conventional STR profiling. (Rootless hairs are mostly made of keratin and don't contain much genetic material, Lents says.)

But Astrea was able to sequence the small amount of genetic material in the hairs and then use statistical-analysis software to scan the DNA for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) — single-letter differences in people's genetic codes. Even in a degraded sample, whole-genome sequencing followed by this statistical analysis can spot thousands of SNPs: enough to pinpoint an individual's unique pattern, Lents says.

Next, scientists at Astrea compared the SNP profiles they obtained with profiles stored in genealogy databases and looked for matches. People submit their DNA to genealogy services, such as 23andMe and Ancestry, and these companies return SNP profiles that people can then upload to websites such as GEDMatch to locate potential relatives. Users have the option to make the data available to forensic genealogists — and these data are what Astrea used to zero in on Heuermann and his family.

The defence team in the Gilgo Beach case initially challenged the validity of Astrea's DNA-analysis methods — which were developed by palaeogenomics researcher Richard ‘Ed' Green at the University of California, Santa Cruz. (Green declined to comment for this article, given the ongoing prosecution.) The defence argued that the statistical methods used by Astrea were unique, and questioned whether they had been sufficiently validated.

To study how dialects change over time, you need a single speaker who's lived in different regions and has been recorded a lot. Taylor Swift fits the bill.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the winter of 2000, researchers from Macquarie University in New South Wales wondered exactly how regional dialect changes over time, and specifically, how younger speakers can impact a well-established dialect. To explore this idea, they needed a single person who'd given many public, recorded speeches over the span of decades. Being residents of a Commonwealth nation, they chose to analyze the speeches of Queen Elizabeth II, and eventually found that the she no longer spoke the “Queen's English” of the 1950s. The study proved that attempts to preserve a specific pronunciation couldn't withstand social pressures over time. 

Fast-forward 25 years, and researchers at the University of Minnesota pondered a similar question: How exactly does dialect ebb and flow over the course of one's life? Similar to the previous research, the scientists needed someone with lots of recordings of their speech (a significantly more common phenomenon in the 21st century) and, ideally, someone who'd been exposed to various regional dialects. The scientists this time around also opted for royalty—pop royalty, that is. 

“Taylor Swift is perfect for this type of longitudinal analysis because she has been interviewed and recorded many times over the years and had motivations for changing her accent at specific times,” Matthew Winn, a researcher from the University of Minnesota and co-author of a new paper in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA)  said in a press statement.

The team collected recordings and interviews of Swift from when she was living in Nashville, Tennessee, her home state of Pennsylvania, and New York City. From this audio, the team compiled 1,400 vowel sounds and used software to specifically measure vocal resonances. 

“The key thing about analyzing dialects is measuring the movement of the vowel through the mouth from the start to the end of the vowel—that's what makes it distinct across dialects,” Winn said in a press statement. “We made ten measurements per vowel to show this movement, which was key to showing how her articulation changed in the different cities.”

One change highlighted by the researchers—specifically present while Swift lived in Nashville—was the monophthongization (diphthong migrates into a monophthong) of the /aɪ/ vowel, so “ride” becomes more like “rod.” They also mentioned the fronting the u vowel, so that words like “two” were now pronounced more toward the front of the mouth, sounding like “tee-you.” The authors also mentioned that Swift lowered her voice while living in New York City, possibly (they theorize) to project a sense of authority. 

Of course, dialect changes are not exclusive to Taylor Swift—or even to people who live in different areas of the country. Social status, for instance, can impact how one person talks to another, and even the difference between talking to a stranger and talking to a friend or a lover can be perceptible in our speech. Additionally, dialects themselves are constantly changing, in part through a process known as “dialect leveling” where regional dialect differences are lost over time through social (or even economic) pressure to pronounce certain words a certain way. Whether the person speaking it or the dialect itself is changing, the way we talk is far from static over the course of our lives. 

“Dialects are a key component of communities that can be defined by geographic region, social characteristics, and shared interests,” the authors wrote. “[Swift's] adaptive use of these dialect features builds on foundational work to demonstrate how the ways that talkers use their spoken language to convey identity and community belonging are malleable across the lifespan.”

Good Conversations Don't Require Everybody to Agree, Neuroscience Shows

Brain imaging is illuminating the patterns linked to productive, positive dialogue, and those insights could help people connect with others

By Emily Falk edited by Daisy Yuhas

With each turn of the news cycle, you may wonder how anyone in their right mind, seeing what they're seeing, could still hold differing political views from your own. I wrestle with some of these feelings myself. When I talk with people on the other side of a debate, I'm often tempted to push them to see things how I do. Or I may stay close to issues where I know we agree so we can have a conversation that feels safe and easy.

But there is a third option for navigating these conversations: curious exploration. My and my colleagues' research into the ways brain activity across people aligns or diverges as they converse suggests that seeking to persuade may not be the most fruitful way to approach a conversation. Instead an open attitude, allowing ourselves to traverse a range of ideas and to learn from other people's experiences, may be both more enjoyable and productive.

In recent years, neuroscientists have identified an important phenomenon: brain synchrony, in which brain activation in two or more people increases and decreases in similar regions at similar times. When people's brain activity is in sync, it seems to indicate a common interpretation and understanding of what they are experiencing. For example, when one person tells a story, and another understands it in the same way, the listener's brain aligns with the speaker's and even begins to anticipate what will come next. On the other hand, when people interpret the same story in markedly different ways, perhaps because they've been given different background information, their brain activity is less synchronized than people who are given the same background facts and therefore share the same assumptions coming in.

These insights apply not only to hearing stories or watching movies but also to responding to news media and political content. Strong political speeches can bring people's brains into sync with one another, for instance. But people get their news from politically polarized sources, which means that they encounter news coverage of different events and receive diverging analyses of the same events. This shapes their views of those issues and creates conflicting background assumptions when they encounter new political stories. In parallel, studies show divergence in brain responses when people with different political views engage with the news, as though they were making sense of different stories altogether. In research initiated by the late Emile Bruneau at the University of Pennsylvania, who died in 2020, and carried forward by Nir Jacoby, now at Dartmouth College, our team scanned the brains of participants who identified as Democrats or Republicans while they watched video clips of people talking about policies. We found that participants' brain activation in social and emotional processing systems was more aligned with people from their own party than it was with those from the opposing party.

All of this work hints that our interactions might be more harmonious if we were more in sync with one another. But evidence from a new technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hyperscanning, which can track brain activity during real conversations, complicates that idea. This method is exciting because it allows researchers to observe two brains in action at the same time. With hyperscanning, we can see how people's brains respond to one another during real-time conversation. My collaborators and I have been using it to understand the dynamics of good conversations—exchanges where people enjoy themselves, reach consensus on how to solve hard problems or help each other navigate emotional challenges. We've discovered that even if one's goal is to simply enjoy the conversation, sticking to safe topics where everyone is on the same page might not be the best solution. In a hyperscanning study, our team, including psychologists Lily Tsoi of Caldwell University, Shannon Burns of Pomona College, Sebastian Speer and Diana Tamir, both at Princeton University, gave friends and strangers instructionsto get to know each other better. We found that the conversations participants enjoyed the most were not those where their brain activity stayed perfectly in sync the whole time.

Strangers, on average, gradually increased their neural synchony over the course of a conversation, whereas friends typically started out more in sync with one another early on. Then something interesting happened: after starting off more in sync, friends' patterns of brain activity in regions that process social interactions began to diverge. They covered more topics and explored wider ground than strangers and, on average, enjoyed the conversations more. Strangers explored fewer topics and had less enjoyable conversations. But some pairs of strangers showed a pattern more like friends. These pairs seemed to use synchrony as a jumping-off point for exploring more ideas rather than an end. In turn, these pairs of strangers, whose brain activity diverged as the discussion unfolded, also rated their conversations as more enjoyable.

And in conversations where people needed to discuss their differences of opinion, we encountered a similarly intriguing finding. In still unpublished work, our team studied what happened as people discussed policy issues, such as the future of higher education and environmental concerns. We coached these participants to enter these conversations in one of two ways: with a goal to compromise or a goal to persuade. When people came into the conversation looking to compromise, we found, this led to more expansive exploration (for example, covering more topics, mental states and brain patterns). Ultimately, this more expansive exploration led to greater consensus about how to solve large societal problems. On the other hand, the people who came in trying to persuade their partner explored less in their conversations and were ultimately less successful in achieving a shared vision for a path forward.

Recently I tried to put these findings into practice while speaking with a colleague who held different views than I did and learned how events that had unfolded in his job and community had shaped his opinions and decisions. Although the conversation was tiring and did not end in complete agreement, it renewed our connection to each other and left me open to talking more.

To be sure, individual conversations in isolation can't fix society's polarization. Institutions—including media, industry and government—play a major role in shaping culture, assumptions and divides. Still, these institutions are also composed of people, and conversations are a key tool for reimagining the world we want together. Our findings suggest one set of possibilities for people navigating conversations with those across divides. We can be more open, curious and exploratory when speaking with others rather than avoid controversies or start off pushing our viewpoint.

Widespread, persistent and toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a major threat to water systems and human health. Current detection methods are relatively expensive, slow and complex, underscoring the need for more accessible alternatives to meet increasingly stringent PFAS regulations. Here we present an ultrasensitive sensing platform for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid detection in tap water with a reporting limit ( ~ 250 parts per quadrillion) lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory standard (4 parts per trillion), using a remote gate field-effect transistor featuring β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-modified reduced graphene oxide as the sensing membrane. The sensor exhibits excellent selectivity against common inorganic ions, natural organic matter and select organic pollutants in tap water. The reversible and rapid response ( < 2 min) indicates the potential of remote gate field-effect transistor for continuous in-line monitoring. Mechanistic studies using quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulations reveal key roles of analyte adsorption and charge properties in sensing performance and offer insights for designing more selective PFAS capture probes.

Cow Udders Could Brew Up Dangerous New Bird Flu Strains

Cells in cow udders could act as a site for human flu and bird flu viruses to swap genes and generate dangerous novel strains

By Chris Simms edited by Tanya Lewis

Cow udders may provide a hotspot for bird flu and human flu viruses to mingle.

The prospect of an outbreak of avian influenza among dairy cattle triggering a pandemic in humans is one step closer than scientists thought. New research shows that cow udder cells can be infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time, which means the viruses could exchange genes and generate novel strains that would be better adapted to infecting people. The risk of this happening is low, but if it does, the consequences could be severe, experts say.

H5N1 avian influenza is widespread in wild birds, and there have been many outbreaks in poultry since 2020. In the U.S., a highly infectious form of the virus has also spread through dairy cattle herds, and 70 cases in people have been detected since February 2024. One of those human cases was fatal.

Virologists have been concerned about bird flu for decades because it has such a high mortality rate in humans. Globally, between 2003 and May 2025, there have been 976 reported cases in humans, almost half of which were fatal.

Fortunately, H5N1 hasn't historically spread easily between people. But many researchers are concerned that if it keeps circulating in cattle, it might adapt to better infect mammals in general.

“It's really important to stop the virus being able to spread from cow to cow because, as it does this, it adapts to be better at infecting cows,” says Eleanor Gaunt, a virologist at the University of Edinburgh. “If the virus is adapting to replicate in cows, it's probably also improving its ability to replicate in humans and therefore increasing pandemic risk.”

Although the recent spread of bird flu in cattle confirmed that the animals can catch that virus, it wasn't clear whether they could catch human versions of influenza. Through tests with cells in a lab, Gaunt and her colleagues have now shown that not only can cows' mammary glands can be infected with a human flu virus but also that many different types of influenza are able to replicate in the cow cells and that a single udder cell can be infected with human and avian flu viruses at the same time.

The researchers have concluded that cow udders are a site where viruses could swap genetic material—a process known as reassortment—and generate new flu viruses that could potentially spread more easily or cause worse illness. Their work has been posted as a preprint paper on bioRxiv and hasn't yet been peer-reviewed.

Richard Webby, an expert in animal and human viruses at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who was not involved in the research, agrees the findings suggest that cow udders could be infected with both forms of virus. “The concern with that is that we could get a reassortment event generating a virus that maybe has more of an ability to infect and transmit between humans,” he says.

It is hard to predict the properties of any novel virus, Webby notes. “There's a good chance it wouldn't be any worse than the H5 virus that's out there. But it might just increase the replication in the human respiratory tract, giving it a little bit more opportunity for further adaptation, so it's a concern.”

If a new virus emerges that is like nothing humans have encountered before, people won't have immunity to it, Gaunt says.

Gaunt and her colleagues studied cells in a lab, so they haven't seen co-infection happening in a cow on a farm. And infecting a living cow is harder, says Robert de Vries, a virologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who was also not involved in the study. But he says cow udders could be a potential viral mixing pot.

Many researchers suspect human flu viruses may infect cows. No one has yet detected this, but that doesn't mean such infections don't happen, de Vries says. “People haven't been testing for it because we considered this species as a nonhost,” he adds. Nevertheless, “if you set up surveillance for this, you will find it.” There is evidence that some cows have antibodies to human flu viruses, which suggests the animals have been infected by these pathogens even if the viruses themselves haven't been detected, Gaunt says.

How U.S. cows initially caught bird flu isn't known. Scientists suspect contact with infected wild birds seeded the initial infections, but the virus seems to have spread among cows via contaminated milking equipment, Gaunt says.

She suggests a cow could be infected with human flu if an ill farmworker wasn't wearing personal protective equipment (if they had access to any) and if the milking equipment wasn't disinfected between uses. Thoroughly cleaning milking equipment could help stop the spread, she says.

Just because co-infection with avian and human influenza is possible doesn't mean it is likely, however, Webby says. Bird flu jumping into cattle in the first place is a relatively rare occurrence—as a human virus infecting the animals most likely would be, he says. “It would require a couple of rare events occurring at the same time,” he says.

But with bird flu circulating widely in U.S. herds, one of the two types of virus is already present in some cattle, which boosts the likelihood of co-infection, Gaunt says. The risk is likely to be low. Still, the more cattle that contract bird flu, the higher the chances of co-infection, so it is a risk that should be taken seriously, she says. “When we're talking about a pandemic emergency,” Gaunt adds, “then it is generally an incredibly unlikely set of circumstances that bring it about, regardless of what virus we're talking about.”

Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of nanoscopic defects or microstructures in ice crystallized from liquid water has never been obtained. This is mainly due to the difficulties in preparing and preserving crystalline ice samples that can survive under high-resolution imaging conditions. Here, we report the stabilization and Å-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water by developing cryogenic liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (CRYOLIC-TEM). We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work improves our understanding of water crystallization behaviors at a molecular spatial resolution.

Ice crystallization is one of the most important processes in the ecosphere and is central to atmospheric processes1,2,3, transportation safety4,5,6,7, biomedical cryopreservation8,9, and the food industry10,11. Among all ice species, hexagonal ice (type Ih) crystallized from liquid water is most prevalent in the ambient. Due to the weak hydrogen bonds between water molecules, these structures can easily deform on the molecular scale during crystallization12,13. The precipitation of dissolved gas in water can further generate cavities in ice crystals; their formation and migration are exclusive to liquid-crystallized ice14,15 with profound implications in glaciology and paleoclimatology16,17. Elucidating defects and microstructures of ice, particularly their molecular origins, is critical to understanding the thermodynamics, phase transformation, and mechanical properties of ice18 and many other hydrogen-bonded crystals19,20,21.

Despite substantial interest in ice on the molecular scale, most studies rely on in-silico simulations22,23,24,25 and ensemble-scale spectroscopy and diffraction26,27,28. Meanwhile, real-space imaging in ice at this scale remains incredibly challenging due to the conflict between the low stability of ice and the harsh and invasive conditions often required by high-resolution imaging techniques. Recent breakthroughs in low-dose cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)29,30,31,32 and ultra-high vacuum scanning probe microscopy33,34 have enabled atomic-resolution imaging of ice condensed from the gas phase or converted from vitrified films. However, these experiments have typically been limited to crystals with random shapes and far-from-equilibrium structures because they rely on phase transformation and deposition at ultra-low temperatures in a high vacuum. Although cryo-TEM has recently been used to observe crystalline ice films prepared by liquid nitrogen, the structures that have been observed are limited to single crystals and low-energy stacking faults35. Molecular-resolution imaging of the microstructures and defects formed by the crystallization of liquid water remains elusive to date.

Herein, we report an approach to freeze liquid water into high-quality ice Ih samples, termed cryogenic liquid-cell TEM (CRYOLIC-TEM), which allows for high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging. Inspired by advances in liquid-phase electron microscopy36, this method freezes liquid water between amorphous carbon (a-C) membranes into large-area (up to microns in size) single-crystalline ice Ih films stable under the electron beam. Aberration-corrected HRTEM imaging at a line resolution better than 2 Å is routinely achieved with a record of 1.3 Å in continuous single-crystalline regions. This new capability enables us to directly correlate lattice mapping with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on machine-learned models to elucidate defect nanostructures formed by liquid water crystallization. The formation, migration, coalescence, and dissolution trajectories of nanobubbles in single-crystalline ice are further observed in situ under the electron beam. This work provides a versatile way for accessing close-to-equilibrium ice Ih in TEM and unlocks previously inaccessible avenues to probe the nano- and molecular-scale interfacial configurations of ice and their structural dynamics.

To freeze liquid water into ice Ih membranes suitable for TEM imaging, we first encapsulated deionized water between two TEM grids coated with a-C membranes and then loaded the sample onto a cryo-TEM sample holder (Fig. 1a). The sample was subsequently cooled by liquid nitrogen along with the holder. This process is substantially slower than vitrification in standard cryo-TEM, allowing for the crystallization of water. Flat, robust, and smooth a-C membranes are necessary for obtaining large-area, high-quality ice single crystals (Supplementary Fig. 1). The surface properties of the a-C membrane are similar to that of graphite (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Exposing the cold sample to the atmosphere may result in the condensation of ice spherulites on the a-C film. This low-temperature (typically < −180 °C) gas-phase ice deposition results in far-from-equilibrium mixtures of ice Ih and Ic (Supplementary Fig. 4), consistent with literature reports26,30,31,37. In contrast, ice formed by water crystallization between the a-C membranes often shows a flat morphology (Fig. 1b) and can be easily distinguished from condensed ice. In these crystals, single-crystalline regions aligned (or close) to the [0001] zone axis can often be found with areas up to several microns (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The thickness of encapsulated ice can vary from ~10 nm to micron-scale, depending on the geometry of the pocket (see Supplementary Fig. 9). Still, high-quality HRTEM images can be acquired from relatively thin regions, achieving a record line resolution of 1.3 Å (Fig. 1d). Preparing samples on a double-tilt cryo holder further facilitates diffraction and HRTEM imaging of single crystals along other zone axes (Fig. 1e, f, and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Importantly, these single-crystalline areas can withstand HRTEM imaging for at least minutes (electron flux up to ~100 e Å−2 s−1) without developing discernable nanoscale defects (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).

The low-loss profiles were deconvolved using the Fourier-log algorithm to remove the zero-loss peak and plural scattering. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Cryogenic electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) was performed to evaluate the high chemical purity of the encapsulated ice (Fig. 1g, h). After subtracting the inelastic scattering from the a-C membranes, the low-loss spectrum of encapsulated ice shows a relatively sharp peak centered at ≈8.5 eV and a broad peak at ≈15 eV (Fig. 1g). The former is characteristic of the excitonic 1b1 → 4a1 orbital transition of H2O in ice38,39 and can be unequivocally distinguished from the π → π* transition from graphitic carbon39 or aromatic organics38 at lower energy. Accordingly, this method results in highly pure ice samples by avoiding the organic contamination frequently encountered by other encapsulation techniques, such as frozen graphene liquid cells40, caused by the solute concentration effect41,42. The broad peak is located at a lower energy than the bulk plasmon typically reported in the literature29,38,39, possibly due to the ice-carbon interface. Core-loss EELS profiles for the oxygen K edge also confirmed the highly pure chemical environment of the encapsulated ice (Fig. 1h).

The strip-shaped crystal section in Fig. 1b appears to be a single crystal according to diffraction criteria (Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, lattice-resolved HRTEM images reveal highly defective textures near the edge areas despite a perfect hexagonal pattern in the Fourier transform (Fig. 2a, b). A relatively strong defocus was applied to obtain sufficient contrast. Indeed, these edge areas are substantially more volatile under beam irradiation (electron flux density < 20 e Å−2 s−1) compared to large single-crystalline sections. The surface of this edge area is near-atomically smooth along the\(\,\left\langle \bar{1}100\right\rangle\) direction, which suggests an exposed \(\{\bar{2}110\}\) surface assuming a vertical facet.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

To analyze the spatial distribution of the nanoscale defects, we developed a lattice amplitude mapping approach to evaluate the local crystal misorientation from the zone axis (see Methods). Colors in the map represent the relative strength of the lattice patterns in the three \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) directions. In this map (Fig. 2c), a white color suggests that the local area's zone axis [0001] is perfectly aligned with the incident electrons. A red color, for example, suggests that the local area is tilted by rotating around axis A in Fig. 2c. In this case, we only focus on the color balance rather than pixel intensities, as the varying thickness and the oscillatory contrast transfer function may complicate the latter. Nonetheless, nanostructures identified from lattice amplitude maps are generally insensitive to defocus, and only minor shifts in the overall color balance were observed at different defocus settings due to the slight imbalance of the beam deflectors (Supplementary Fig. 12). The lattice amplitude map at the defective edge reveals many subdomains on the 10- to 20-nm scale that are tilted away from each other despite the appearance of single-crystallinity according to the diffraction pattern (Fig. 1c) and the Fourier transform (Fig. 2b). This observation contrasts with that of the highly continuous lattice, indicative of high-quality single crystals with minimal nanoscale defects, away from the thin edges (Supplementary Fig. 12).

By converting the red-green-blue (RGB) model of the composite image into the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model, we can further evaluate the orientation and the relative degree of the tilt (Fig. 2e, f). In this model, the pixel saturation represents the color balance, therefore is directly correlated to the orientation which the local crystal domain tilts toward. Here, the subdomain orientation shows a significantly wider distribution compared to that in continuous lattices (Supplementary Fig. 13). The two dominant orientations are ≈9° and ≈127°, suggesting that the subdomain tilting towards the a axes (rotating around the normal vector of a primary prism plane) is slightly preferred. More importantly, the pixel saturation is associated with the relative tilt of the c axis from the imaging direction. This is a semi-quantitative evaluation because the absolute value depends on the crystal thickness. The saturation histogram reveals that the tilt angle is distributed over a wide range with multiple broad peaks, indicating the presence of shallow local energy minima.

The HRTEM image further reveals the interfacial structures (Fig. 2d). Here, neighboring subdomains connect through relatively sharp interfaces or show gradual distortion over a few nanometers (i.e., mild change in the anisotropy of the lattice patterns). The typical tilt angle of such structures is on the scale of 1° to allow for the visibility of the ice \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) patterns according to both lattice visibility criteria43,44 (Supplementary Fig. 17) and kinematical TEM simulations (Supplementary Figs. 18–29). Notably, a wide variety of interfaces exist with different tilt angles, orientations, and length scales.

MD simulations were employed to study the interfacial structure and energy landscape of these configurations. We used a coarse-grained machine-learned bond order potential (ML-BOP) model of water, which correctly captured the thermodynamic properties of water phases in good agreement with experiments23. A low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) between two single-crystalline domains was constructed by rotating one around the a2 axis, annealing at 260 K, and cooling to 93 K (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 2). We systematically varied the sample thickness and initial tilt angle to evaluate the post-annealing structures and energetics in a broad structural space (see Supplementary Data 1).

For very thin, freestanding ice structures consisting of a few molecular layers (thickness: ≈4.4 nm; h ≤ 2, where h is the number of supercells (3 unit cells in the c axis, ≈22 Å)), the post-annealing tilt angle significantly deviates from the initial setup (Fig. 3a, upper panel). A wide range of tilt angles are unstable as structures bounce back or forward during annealing. As ice thickness increases, the range of unstable configurations and the tilt angle deviation during annealing are reduced. The same trend is also reflected in the energy landscape of the annealed structures (Fig. 3a, lower panel). A substantial energy variance was observed for few-layer structures, indicating their instability. However, for thicker films of h = 6 and 12 (thickness: ≈13.2 and ≈26.3 nm), the energy profile converges and flattens out for tilt angles over ≈0.5° after an initial increase. This observation suggests that the energy penalties for varying the tilt angle of LAGBs in ice films may be minuscule.

To further understand the structural details of these boundaries, we examined the post-annealing MD trajectories (h = 6; Fig. 3b). With a low tilt angle (case 1, 0.34°), a defective region with disordered molecules and complex dislocations forms because the low tilt angle is insufficient to support a low-energy dislocation. This result corresponds to the initial energy rise as the tilt angle increases (Fig. 3a, lower panel). When the tilt angle is sufficiently large (case 3, 1.70°), a perfect edge dislocation (Burgers vector, b = \(\frac{1}{3}\left\langle 1\bar{2}10\right\rangle\)) forms to compensate for the lattice mismatch (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, a moderate tilt angle (case 2, 0.96°) leads to a mixed edge and screw dislocation, with the Burgers vector roughly pointing to the a3 axis. If we look along the a2 axis, i.e., roughly along the dislocation line (Fig. 3c), the crystal in case 2 only has a sufficient tilt angle to accommodate a visual half-plane mismatch, in contrast to the one-unit-cell mismatch in case 3. To avoid the unstable partial edge dislocation, a partial screw dislocation was also generated, leading to a perfect unit cell mismatch (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 34). This behavior is repeatedly seen in crystals with a larger thickness and when more than one dislocation line is present (Supplementary Fig. 35).

Based on the analyses above, we summarize how ice films develop LAGBs while minimizing the energy penalty (Fig. 3e). In conventional inorganic materials, such as bulk metals (upper schematic), the LAGB energy increases monotonously against the tilt angle with increasing dislocation density45. In comparison, ice crystals are mediated by the weak hydrogen bonds and organized by the flexible tetrahedral structural motifs of water molecules.46 This feature enables a high tolerance to local lattice distortions, including disordered structures and dislocations, along with interfacial configurations characteristic of clathrates (e.g., interfacial beads identified in Fig. 3). A large tilt angle gap exists in few-layer freestanding ice structures due to the unstable configuration (middle schematic). In ice films thicker than ≈10 nm relevant to our TEM experiments (lower schematic), the energy of the LAGB first increases due to elastic strain and the formation of disordered structures but then quickly flattens out over a wide range of tilt angles, owing to the formation of perfect dislocations regardless of the tilt angle. The presence of unstable configurations and shallow local energy minima could further explain the mild preference for certain tilt angles observed in the experiment (Fig. 2e, lower panel). As such, LAGBs with various tilt angles can co-exist in ice films with low energy penalties.

This conclusion is consistent with our TEM results. The annealed configuration from the MD (case 3) was used for multislice TEM simulation (Fig. 3f, g). The simulated TEM image correctly reproduced the isotropic hexagonal lattices on the right that are perfectly aligned with the [0001] zone axis. Meanwhile, the pattern on the left is elongated in the horizontal direction due to tilting, consistent with the lattice anisotropy observed from experimental images in tilted subdomains (Fig. 2d). The increase in anisotropy is also evidenced by the horizontal intensity profile for a row of lattice spots in Fig. 3g. Importantly, even though a single dislocation line is present in the middle, the pattern anisotropy exhibits a gradual transition across 1 to 2 nm, consistent with the interfacial transition observed in the experiments.

Away from the defective edges described above, we investigated the interior regions of single-crystalline ice. Continuous hexagonal lattices were observed over large areas (Fig. 4a–c), and the lattice amplitude map reveals an absence of subdomains (Fig. 4d).

In this region, we discovered many trapped gas bubbles in the form of nanoscale cavities in the crystal (Fig. 4a, circular and elliptical features labeled by arrows). Thickness gradients due to bubble curvature are evidenced by the significant contrast variations near the bubble surfaces. The formation of nanosized trapped bubbles is attributed to the relatively fast cooling rate of the thin sample compared to bulk freezing47. Note that these bubbles exist prior to imaging and remain unchanged throughout the imaging process. Therefore, it is most likely that they are generated by gas precipitation instead of radiolysis.

By calculating the in-plane lattice distortion tensors using geometric phase analysis (GPA)48, we found that almost no additional strain field exists in the crystals surrounding the nanobubbles (Fig. 4e–g and Supplementary Fig. 16). The distribution of all in-plane lattice distortion indicators (strains, rotation, and dilation) is significantly narrower than that of the subdomain-containing defective edge (Fig. 4h).

Previous MD simulations for metals, such as Al, predicted strain fields surrounding a nanocavity (r = 10 nm) on the scale of 1–3%49. To understand the absence of such a strain field in ice, we first used continuum theories of elasticity to estimate the strain distribution around a spherical cavity50. The maximum elastic strains caused by the Laplace pressure of an ice nanobubble (r = 10 nm) is <0.4% (Supplementary Fig. 35). As such, nanobubbles in ice should be expected to cause negligible strain fields, which agrees with the HRTEM-derived strain maps.

Our MD simulations also confirm this conclusion. We modeled a spherical cavity (r = 6 nm) in an ice single crystal, melted the structures within 3 nm in the vicinity of the cavity surface, and recrystallized them in silico (see Methods and Supplementary Data 2). Volumetric strain analysis shows no discernable strain accumulation around the cavity, with a mean and standard deviation of only 0.30% and 1.00% (Fig. 4j).

To further investigate the inner surface structure of the bubbles on the molecular scale, we moved to single-crystalline ice regions with a much lower thickness, where bubbles became quasi-cylindrical through-holes (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Movie 3). The reduced thickness allowed direct imaging and recognition of the lattice structures near the bubble surface. Notably, despite the overall curved shape, most exposed surfaces on the molecular scale can be attributed either to the primary prism planes, \(\{\bar{1}100\}\), or secondary prism planes, \(\{\bar{2}110\}\), assuming vertical facets. These two surfaces are the lowest-energy facets in ice Ih perpendicular to [0001]51,52. The ratio between the projected length of the primary and secondary prism planes is circa 3.8:1 (Table 1).

The bubble model in MD simulations was also used to reveal the surface faceting at the molecular level (see Supplementary Note 2.2). A significant fraction of the surface molecules are exposed as basal, primary prism, or secondary prism planes (Fig. 4k and Table 1). The fractional ratio between the primary and secondary prism planes in the MD-simulated cross-section at the center (Supplementary Fig. 38) and HRTEM follow the same trend predicted by their surface energy (Table 1). This result indicates that the trapped gas bubbles in the experiments are very close to thermodynamic equilibrium, and the nanoscale configurations we observed could reflect those in sufficiently annealed bubbles. We note that a lower amount of basal planes were observed in MD than prism planes despite their lower surface energy because the former must fit into the top and bottom curvatures. As such, trapped bubbles in ice are defined both by the macroscopic rounded shape and molecular-scale facets to minimize the total surface energy. The presence of these nanofacets may be important in defining the stability and migration kinetics of trapped gas bubbles in glacial systems16,53.

When we elevated the stage temperature to −70 °C and reduced the electron flux density to 25 e Å−2 s−1, we observed nucleation and growth of new nanobubbles in single-crystalline ice sections under HRTEM conditions (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movie 4). The newly generated bubbles show similar shapes with trapped nanobubbles imaged at about −180 °C. Furthermore, these bubbles can migrate in the crystal and completely dissolve under the same conditions (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Movie 5) while the ice sample stays single-crystalline, suggesting that the system is near a steady state for bubble generation and ice recrystallization.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Bubbles can also dynamically coalesce and merge into larger ones (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Movie 6). In this observation, two bubbles approached each other, and their outlines initially showed different thickness contrasts. However, the contrast matched upon coalescence, which suggests that the two bubbles physically connected rather than passed by at different vertical positions. The ice surfaces in the bubbles are highly dynamic, as shown by the significant reshaping of the merging ones.

The persistent hexagonal patterns in the Fourier transform of the movies suggest that the ice sample stayed single-crystalline in these observations. GPA was performed on all frames to evaluate the mechanical consequences of the bubble trajectories. Here, the mean value of in-plane lattice dilation reflects the global distortion of the sample and only fluctuated within a range of ~1% throughout the experiments (Fig. 5d). The standard deviation of the lattice dilation was further calculated to evaluate local lattice distortion (Fig. 5e). Indeed, most data fall between the levels observed in the defective edges (Fig. 2) and the bubble-containing interior sections (Fig. 4) at about −180 °C. These observations further show that nanobubbles cause insignificant strain fields in ice crystals even during their dynamic evolution.

Bubble formation in ice under the electron beam can mainly be attributed to radiolysis54 and knock-on damage by the incident electrons55. To evaluate the radiolytic chemistry under the experimental conditions, we extended approaches developed for water radiolysis in liquid-phase electron microscopy56,57 to lower temperatures and numerically calculated the reaction kinetics at −70 °C and 25 e Å−2 s−1 (see Methods and Supplementary Data 3). Notably, the system reaches a steady state within seconds of gas generation (Fig. 5f), consistent with in-situ TEM results. It is crucial to recognize that radiolysis offers one credible explanation for the formation of new bubbles in these experiments, but detecting the content of the gas species is challenging in these experiments. Nonetheless, the formation of substantial H2 and O2 species is in agreement with cryogenic EELS analyses of amorphous ice58,59, highlighting the potential role of these gas molecules in constituting bubble volumes in our experiments.

We have presented the first molecular-resolution imaging of nanoscopic defects in ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. The presented sample preparation method, which crystallized liquid water into thin ice films between a-C membranes, was a critical factor that led to this imaging breakthrough. These samples contain large-area single-crystalline regions that are sufficiently stable under HRTEM conditions for extended imaging. This method could be extended to prepare samples of mixed aqueous systems, as well as organic solvents, and provide new insights into liquid-liquid phase separation, solute precipitation, and the freezing behavior of organic liquids. Despite the presence of a heterogeneous interface between ice/water and the encapsulating membrane, the ice sample thickness is typically well beyond the thickness of interfacial regions (on the order of 1 nm)60 such that there is no significant deviation from the physics of bulk phase transformation. However, the interfacial equilibrium and properties at this length scale are anticipated to differ from those of the bulk. Therefore, caution must be exercised when translating conclusions from HRTEM studies to bulk crystals. By maneuvering the sample temperature and electron flux density, a near-steady state of bubble generation and dissolution in crystalline ice was achieved. A finer control over the imaging conditions will likely pave the way to the direct imaging of ice-water interfacial structures and, moreover, crystallization and melting dynamics with molecular resolution, a holy grail in the ice research community61,62,63. Experimental images and movies can now be directly compared and correlated to computations on an previously unattainable molecular length scale to reveal the underlying structures, molecular interactions, and phase transformation pathways. The direct extraction of such Å-scale information provides a new research paradigm for theory, modeling, and forecasting of ice crystallization and melting in environmental, biological, and material systems.

Deionized (DI) water was generated by an ELGA PURELAB flex 2 system with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm. Carbon-coated Cu grids for TEM were purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. Ammonium persulfate (≥98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

In a typical experiment, 1–3 µL of DI water was dispensed on the carbon side of a TEM grid and loaded on a Gatan 626 single-tilt or a 915 double-tilt liquid nitrogen cryo-transfer holder, with the carbon/water side facing up. Another identical grid was put on top of the first one, with the carbon side facing down. The grid orientation was roughly aligned when placing the second grid, and the surface tension of water would then align and adhere the grids together. Depending on the models of the TEM and their column vacuum level, the sample can either be frozen inside or outside the column with liquid nitrogen. Freezing outside the TEM in the cryo transfer station is typically preferred for consistency. In either case, the copper shield remains closed during sample freezing.

TEM was performed on an FEI Titan Environmental TEM [extreme-brightness Schottky field-emission gun (X-FEG), 300 kV] equipped with a CEOS double-hexapole aberration corrector (CETCOR) for the image-forming lenses and a Gatan UltraScan 1000 charge-coupled device (CCD) scintillation camera. A Gatan Metro 300 direct electron detector was used for the sample stability studies. TEM along zone axes other than [0001] was performed on an FEI Themis TEM (X-FEG, 300 kV) equipped with a CEOS CETCOR for the image-forming lenses and an FEI Ceta 16 M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scintillation camera. Low-loss EELS was performed on a JEOL JEM-ARM300CF GRAND ARM (cold FEG, 300 kV) equipped with a JEOL dodecapole expanding trajectory aberration corrector for the probe-forming lenses and a Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF) Quantum system. Convergence angle: 41.2 mrad; EELS collection angle: 62.4 mrad. EELS thickness measurements were conducted on an FEI Themis equipped with a GIF Quantum system with a convergence angle of 17.9 mrad and a collection angle of 36.18 mrad. Energy-filtered TEM was done on the same system. During the experiments, the temperature readout from the cryo holder is typically between −180 and −178 °C.

For all Fourier transform images presented in this article, the modulus of the complex values are displayed and are scaled linearly. Average background subtraction (ABS) filtering64 of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images was performed using a script in Gatan DigitalMicrograph (http://www.dmscripting.com/hrtem_filter.html) with the following parameters: Delta = 5.0%, BW n = 4, BW Ro = 0.8, and low-frequency tapering = 1.0%. Low-loss EELS profiles were first processed by removing the plural scattering using the Fourier-log algorithm. All EELS profiles were smoothed by adjacent averaging with a 50-pixel moving window size.

The lattice amplitude maps were calculated with the following procedures: (1) obtain the Fourier transform image; (2) mask only the circular areas containing the desired pair of lattice reflections and assign zero to all other pixels (mask diameter = 0.2 nm−1); (3) perform inverse Fourier transformation; (4) obtain the absolute value of the image (i.e., flip the sign of negative intensity values); (5) perform Gaussian smoothing with σ = 5 pixels (this may vary depending on the pixel size); (6) repeat this process for the other two pair of reflections; (7) overlay the three resulting images as a red/green/blue (RGB) stack. The lattice distortion maps (strain, rotation, and dilation) were calculated using the Strain++ package (https://jjppeters.github.io/Strainpp/) based on the geometric phase analysis (GPA) algorithm48. Zero-distortion points in GPA were chosen at the maximum-modulus frequencies in the Fourier transform. The Gaussian mask size (3σ) is set to 1/8 of the \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) g vector length.

After obtaining an ice sample in TEM, the holder temperature was raised to −70 °C and stabilized. Movies were recorded by screen capturing at an electron flux density of 25 e Å−2 s−1 determined on the fluorescence screen through the integrated sensor. Frames were registered using the ImageJ StackReg module (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/).

The thickness and surface roughness of the carbon membranes from the TEM grids were measured based on method described in ref. 65. Briefly, the copper grid was etched by an ammonium persulfate aqueous solution (≈100 mg mL−1), leaving the carbon membrane floating on the solution surface. The carbon membrane was then transferred to a glass slide and then to DI water for cleaning, which was repeated two times. Finally, the membrane was transferred to a silicon wafer ready for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. AFM was performed on an Asylum Research Cypher ES with a Bruker RFESPA-75 probe (resonance frequency, 75 kHz; spring constant, 3 N m−1). The scan rate was 1.5 Hz, and the amplitude was between 300 and 350 mV. The thickness was determined at the edge of the membrane ruptures caused by drying. Image processing and quantification were performed with the Gwyddion package66 (http://gwyddion.net/).

The chemical characteristics of the carbon membrane surface were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Kratos Axis Ultra that uses a monochromatic focused Al Kα X-ray (1486.7 eV) source. The instrument was calibrated prior to the introduction of the sample and referenced to binding energies for Cu 2p3/2 at 932.67 ± 0.05 eV and Au 4 f at 84.0 ± 0.05 eV. The base pressure of the sample analysis chamber was maintained at 1.6 × 10−9 Torr. The sample was prepared by adhering the carbon-coated copper grid to a stainless-steel bar using copper tape. The tape was used only in the corners, while at least two data points were analyzed from the center of the grid. Since the carbon-coated copper grid was conductive, no neutralizer was applied, and the results were analyzed without any charge correction.

Furthermore, the water contact angle was measured by drop-casting ≈1-µL of DI water onto a TEM grid and immediately capturing a side-view image. The drop shape was fitted to calculate the contact angle67. Experiments were repeated on three separate TEM grids.

Kinematical HRTEM simulation from single crystals was performed using the ReciPro package68 (https://seto77.github.io/ReciPro/). The simulation assumes a parallel beam condition, a beam energy of 300 keV ± 0.8 eV, Cs = 4 μm, and Cc = 1.4 mm. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were simulated based on the dynamical theory using ReciPro, assuming a sample thickness of 30 nm. Polycrystal SAED radial profiles were simulated based on the kinematical theory using the CrystalDiffract package (CrystalMaker Software, https://crystalmaker.com/crystaldiffract/). These simulations used the experimentally derived ice Ih crystal structure in the space group P63/mmc69,70.

Multislice TEM simulation71 based on explicit models from coarse-grained MD was performed with the QSTEM package72 (https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/en/sem/software/software_qstem) using the same TEM parameters. An F atom was used in place of a water molecule in the coarse-grained MD model for image simulation.

The MD simulations were performed using a coarse-grained machine-learned bond order potential (ML-BOP) model of water23. For grain boundary simulations, minimal-energy configurations of bi-grain ice models with different thicknesses and tilt angles were first established and equilibrated with the conjugate gradient algorithm73. The models were subsequently annealed in silico using the LAMMPS package74 at 260 K and then gradually cooled to 93 K in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble. For nanobubble simulations, a cavity of a radius of 6 nm was created in a single-crystalline ice Ih model by removing the molecules within. The model was first equilibrated in LAMMPS at 260 K and 1 bar. The surface areas of the bubble (thickness: 3 nm) were subsequently heated to 270 K and then 370 K for melting, and finally cooled back to 260 K for recrystallization. For detailed procedures, see Supplementary Note 2.

The OVITO package75 (https://www.ovito.org/) was used to perform local symmetry identification using the CHILL+ algorithm76 and dislocation analysis using an extended dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA)77.

Radiation chemistry is modeled by considering the interplay of twelve reactants relevant for liquid-phase TEM (H2O, H2, O2, H2O2, H, OH, HO2, H+, HO2−, O2−, OH−, and the solvated electron eh−). An amorphous ice sample with no spatial anisotropy is considered. The reactions among these reactants span a kinetic model that is described by a set of coupled differential equations78:

Here, ci denotes the concentration of the reactant i, t the time, k the reaction-rate constant of the respective reaction, Gi the generation value (G-value) of i upon electron irradiation, and ρ the density of amorphous ice (0.92 g L−1)79. The dose rate ψ is calculated from Eq. (2)80:

In Eq. (2), ϕ is the electron flux density, and e is the elementary charge. As the inelastic scattering of 300 keV electrons in amorphous ice appears to be reasonably close to that in water81,82, a density-normalized stopping power S of 2.36 MeV cm−2 g−1 was approximated83. For an electron-flux density of 25 e Å−2 s−1, this yields a dose rate of 9.45 × 107 Gy s−1.

The harnessed kinetic model extrapolates Arrhenius-based rate constants84 to lower temperatures (Supplementary Table 8). As cryogenic G values are unavailable59, room temperature values are used (Supplementary Table 9)85. Modeling is performed using a temperature-dependent extension of AuRaCh57. The code is available at https://github.com/BirkFritsch/Radiolysis-simulations.

What causes us to sleep? The answer may lie not only in our brains, but in their complex interplay with the micro-organisms spawned in our intestines.

New research from Washington State University suggests a new paradigm in understanding sleep, demonstrating that a substance in the mesh-like walls of bacteria, known as peptidoglycan, is naturally present in the brains of mice and closely aligned with the sleep cycle.

Those findings serve to update a broader hypothesis that has been in development at WSU for years -- proposing that sleep arises from communication between the body's sleep regulatory systems and the multitude of microbes living inside us.

"This added a new dimension to what we already know," said Erika English, a PhD candidate at WSU and lead author on two recently published scientific papers introducing the findings.

This view of sleep as arising from that "holobiont condition" joins a growing body of evidence suggesting that our gut microbiomes play an important role in cognition, appetite, sex drive and other activity -- a view that turns traditional brain-centric models of cognition upside-down and has implications for our understanding of evolution and free will, as well as the development of future treatments for sleep disorders.

The recent findings regarding peptidoglycan, or PG, lend weight to that hypothesis and point to a possible regulatory role for bacterial cell wall products in sleep. PG is known to promote sleep when injected in animals, but until recently, the conventional view held that it did not naturally migrate to the brain.

English found that PG, along with its receptor molecules involved in PG signaling and communication, was present in different locations within the brain, at levels that changed with the time of day and sleep deprivation.

The findings were reported in July in Frontiers in Neuroscience; longtime WSU sleep researcher and Regents Professor James Krueger co-authored the paper. English is also lead author of a recent paper with Krueger in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews that proposes the "holobiont condition" hypothesis of sleep.

That paper combines two prevailing views. One posits that sleep is regulated by the brain and neurological systems. Another focuses on "local sleep," which frames slumber as the result of an accumulation of sleep-like states among small cellular networks throughout the body. Such sleep-like states have been observed among cells in vitro, known as the "sleep in a dish" model.

As these smaller pockets of sleep accumulate, like lights going off in a house, the body tips from wakefulness toward sleep.

The new hypothesis merges those theories, proposing that sleep results from the interplay between the body and its resident micro-organisms -- two autonomous systems that interact and overlap.

"It's not one or the other, it's both. They have to work together," English said. "Sleep really is a process. It happens at many different speeds for different levels of cellular and tissue organization and it comes about because of extensive coordination."

Links between the microbiome and behavior are emerging on several fronts, indicating that micro-organisms formed in the gut play an important role in cognition and fundamental human behaviors. This work upends the traditional view of human neurology, suggesting that it is not completely top-down -- i.e., the result of decision-making in the brain -- but bottom-up -- i.e., driven by the tiny organisms whose evolution shaped animals to serve as their hosts and whose needs influence the activities and cognition of their hosts.

"We have a whole community of microbes living within us. Those microbes have a much longer evolutionary history than any mammal, bird or insect - much longer, billions of years longer," said Krueger, who was named a "Living Legend in Sleep Research" by the Sleep Research Society in 2023. "We think sleep evolution began eons ago with the activity/inactivity cycle of bacteria, and the molecules that were driving that are related to the ones driving cognition today."

English's work expands upon known links between bacteria and sleep, including the fact that sleep patterns affect the function of the gut microbiome and that bacterial infections cause people to sleep more.

The new findings begin to delve into questions that English looks forward to exploring further.

"Now that the world has come to appreciate how important microbes are, not just for disease but also for health, it's a very exciting time to start to expand on our understanding of how we are communicating with our microbes and how our microbes are communicating with us," she said.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Siddhartha “Sidd” Srinivasa has spent his career at the intersection of robotics research and real-world deployment. He helped start Berkshire Grey, launched Amazon's Robotics AI group, helped re-architect Cruise's autonomy stack, and leads the Personal Robotics Lab at the University of Washington as a professor.

Now he's adding a new role: venture partner at Madrona Venture Group, where he'll help shape investment themes and evaluate startups in robotics and embodied AI at the Seattle-based firm.

GeekWire caught up with Srinivasa for a conversation about the state of robotics, opportunities for entrepreneurs, and why he believes Seattle can become a global leader in AI and robotics. The interview was edited for brevity and clarity. 

GeekWire: Why did you decide to join Madrona?

Sidd Srinivasa: “I want to give back to the Pacific Northwest and make the Pacific Northwest an even bigger superpower in AI and robotics. I've been incredibly fortunate to work with some really wonderful VCs during my time at Berkshire Grey, and it felt like time for me to both give back as well as learn what it takes to be a venture capitalist — to think about how to evaluate companies, to develop a sound thesis on where AI and robotics should go next.”

Where is robotics right now in terms of progress?

Srinivasa: “Hardware has become commoditized. A humanoid robot used to cost a couple of million dollars, only accessible to top labs. Now you can get one for $15,000 to $20,000. A large part of that is because electric motors have gotten better and cheaper, and our ability to produce them and to be able to scale them has gotten much better.

It's also the compute. I have more compute on my phone now than I did on the biggest computer I could find during my Ph.D. That's pretty significant.

Building large foundation models is also commoditized. And what these foundation models help us do is deal with all the common sense stuff that goes into getting any task done.”

What about the current challenges?

Srinivasa: “The place where we have a huge problem with robotics right now is that though we are able to address a lot of the common sense tasks like folding your laundry or clearing your table — those are not the important tasks people would pay money for. This is a fundamental issue that a lot of robotics companies are facing right now. Yes, we have pretty amazing demos, we have cool videos of humanoids picking up an apple and putting it down. But who wants to pay for that? Not me. 

Robotics has a last-mile problem. We can go from zero to one, one to 10, 10 to 50 — but very few times have we actually been able to go the last mile. We certainly did that at Berkshire Grey. We certainly did that at Amazon and with fulfillment. But beyond fulfillment, I haven't seen any great success in robotics.”

What's missing technologically?

Srinivasa: “We need breakthroughs in generalization. The other day, when I was staining my fence, by the time I got 20% done, I was an expert stainer of fences. That adaptiveness is what we need robots to do efficiently.  Reinforcement learning is a way to do that but it is very data inefficient. So being able to truly generalize novel scenarios and being able to learn on the fly while being efficient and safe — safety is really important. 

I thought we would solve self-driving before we solve general purpose robotics. And we haven't solved self-driving yet. We're close, but not there yet. And I would say general purpose robotics is certainly five years behind self-driving in terms of capability and technology.”

What about humanoids?

Srinivasa: “I am not sure whether the humanoid form factor is the right form factor to align around. Humans have two arms and two legs just 'cause — there's nothing theoretically optimal about us. Maybe what you need is a robot with three arms, or a robot with seven fingers. I do believe that one day we will have capable robots performing useful tasks in our home. Whether that'll be a humanoid or a quadruped or a three-hand, three-arm robot — I don't know.”

Which sectors look closest to achieving viable unit economics?

Srinivasa: “There's still a lot of juice left to squeeze in fulfillment. There's over 50-to-60% of fulfillment that is yet to be automated — things like packing an Amazon box full of items. We need to be able to deal with that kind of high density. And I think last mile fulfillment is a space that is really ready to be disrupted. 

I've been really interested in computational agriculture from an observability point of view — knowing what's going on in a greenhouse without having to walk the line. And commissary kitchens that make lunches that are delivered or airline meals. If we are able to build robots that can be very easily repurposed and retrained to perform multiple tasks and have a small form factor, then I think that's a space that can be really disrupted.”

What advice do you have for robotics founders?

Srinivasa: “There has to be a pull for robotics, not a push. If you're pedaling robotics to people who reluctantly accept it, it's never going to work. The pull has to come from a real customer need.

The second thing I would say is that there is this tendency to believe that robots can follow the software model. Maintaining, servicing and taking care of software is really easy. But that's not the case with real, physical robots. I would think very carefully about not just the actual application, but also the modality by which you are putting your robots out there.”

How do you think about robotics and job displacement?

Srinivasa: “Ever since I started working on robots, I've been very rightfully asked: will robots take our jobs? The lazy argument is to say the Industrial Revolution created more jobs than it took away, so robotics will, too. But it's not the people who lost their jobs who got the new jobs. Pittsburgh is a great example — steel workers didn't become tech workers. So we have an entire generation of people who lost their jobs, who we did not re-skill to be able to take on the new roles that were coming up. We need to be committed to workforce re-skilling such that we can enable and empower the workforce to be able to work with and around new technology that comes about. It's not just a nice thing to do. It's a societal imperative.”

Any thoughts on Seattle as a robotics hub?

Srinivasa: “I think one of the things that's incredibly appealing about Seattle, and particularly about the University of Washington, which I think has been a pioneer in this, is just how closely faculty are able to work with industry while still maintaining and honoring their faculty position. 

I love Seattle. I think it's also incredibly valuable for dual careers. And I think it's a great place to start a company, not just because of Madrona, but also because of so many other VCs, as well as the huge amount of talent that's out here. So I think it's time to make Seattle the best in the world in AI and robotics.”

Microsoft has blocked an Israeli military unit from using some of its technology services after the company found evidence supporting a report that the tech was being used for surveillance of  Palestinian civilians.

The move by the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant is in response to an Aug. 6 report by The Guardian, which revealed how Microsoft Azure was being used to store and process millions of Palestinian civilian phone calls made each day in Gaza and the West Bank.

Microsoft President Brad Smith announced in a note to employees on Thursday the decision to cease and disable services being used by Unit 8200, an Israeli military spy agency. He said an ongoing review by Microsoft had found “evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting.”

“We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,” Smith wrote. “We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.”

He also noted that Microsoft's respect for the privacy rights of its customers — in this case, the Israeli military — meant that among other things, it could not access customer content. The company previously acknowledged limits as to what it could verify, citing a lack of visibility into use of its technology on private servers outside its cloud.

The Guardian report and Microsoft's dealings with Israel during the ongoing war in Gaza have been the basis for repeated protests against the company on its headquarters campus and elsewhere in recent months.

Members of the group No Azure for Apartheid have been calling on Microsoft to cut all ties to the Israeli military and government. Demonstrations in Redmond in August grew increasingly confrontational. Twenty people, including some current and former employees, were arrested during a protest on campus on Aug. 20. A week later, several protesters made their way into and occupied Smith's office in Building 34.

At the time, Smith said Microsoft was committed to upholding its human rights principles and was actively investigating The Guardian report.

The Guardian reported that the massive repository of intercepted Palestinian calls — which amounted to as much as 8,000 terabytes of data — was held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands. The newspaper said that within days of publishing its investigation, “Unit 8200 appears to have swiftly moved the surveillance data out of the country.”

On Thursday, The Guardian cited sources familiar with the data transfer, which occurred in early August, and said Unit 8200 “planned to transfer the data to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform.” Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor Amazon responded to The Guardian's request for comment, and GeekWire has reached out to Amazon as well.

In his memo to employees, Smith said that the company will continue providing cybersecurity services to Israel and other countries in the Middle East.

Read Brad Smith's full letter to employees:

I want to let you know that Microsoft has ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD). I know many of you care about this topic, and I share more about this decision below.

Let me first provide some context. As I've said to you in recent weeks, Microsoft is not a government or a country. We are a company. Like every company, we decide what products and services to offer to our customers.

As we publicly announced on August 15, we decided to undertake a review of allegations that appeared in an article published on August 6 by The Guardian about a unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). As we explained at that time, The Guardian article reported that “multiple individuals have asserted that the IDF is using Azure for the storage of data files of phone calls obtained through broad or mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank.”

We have reviewed The Guardian's allegations based on two principles, both grounded in Microsoft's longstanding protection of privacy as a fundamental right. As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust.

First, we do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft's standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians.

Second, we respect and protect the privacy rights of our customers. This means, among other things, that we do not access our customers' content in this type of investigation.

Since August 15, we have pursued this review by respecting both these principles, as well as the company's policies, contracts, and customer commitments. At no point has Microsoft accessed IMOD's customer content. Rather, the review has focused on Microsoft's own business records, including financial statements, internal documents, and email and messaging communications, among other records.

While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services.

We therefore have informed IMOD of Microsoft's decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies. We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians.

As I said at our recent employee townhall, this does not impact the important work that Microsoft continues to do to protect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East, including under the Abraham Accords.

I want to note our appreciation for the reporting of The Guardian. Its reports were based in part on sources outside Microsoft that had information we could not access in light of our customer privacy commitments. This helped inform our review.

I appreciate that many of you will have additional questions. Our review is ongoing. I'll share more information in the coming days and weeks, when it's appropriate to do so, including lessons learned from this review and how we will apply those lessons as we go forward.

Microsoft will continue to be a company guided by principles and ethics. We will hold every decision, statement, and action to this standard. This is non-negotiable.

Brad

OpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep. Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning — much like they would check social media or a news app.

Pulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI's consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. Features like ChatGPT Agent or Codex aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.

“We're building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,” said OpenAI's new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. “And ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction — starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this week that some of ChatGPT's new “compute-intensive” products would be limited to the company's most expensive subscription plan — which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it's severely limited in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it's rapidly building out AI data centers with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.

Starting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.

Pulse's reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic — like updates on a specific sports team — as well as more personalized briefs based on a user's context.

In a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family's upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.

Each report is displayed as a “card” featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.

A core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: “Great, that's it for today.” According to Fry, that's an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps. 

Pulse is compatible with ChatGPT's Connectors, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that's set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.

If users have ChatGPT's memory features turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI's personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.

Wadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a “net-new functionality” for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.

But it's hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn't expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.

It remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can “vary tremendously” in how much computing power it spends on a given task — for some projects, it's fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.

Eventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user's behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI's agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.

For years, recruiters used machine learning to find potential hires by searching for keywords in résumés and LinkedIn profiles. Although this method helps to narrow the candidate pool, recruiters still have to manually review each profile to determine the best fit for the job.

David Paffenholz (pictured left) and Ishan Gupta, then just 22 and 19, respectively, realized that LLMs could find talent faster and more efficiently. They built Juicebox, an AI-powered search engine that uses natural language to analyze professional profiles, personal websites, and other publicly available information to identify the most qualified candidates.

After attending startup accelerator Y Combinator in the summer of 2022, Paffenholz and Gupta spent a couple more years refining their product. When their AI search engine, PeopleGPT, was ready in late 2023, it was quickly adopted by a wide range of customers, from small startups to large companies like Cognition, Ramp, and Perplexity.

In a short period of time, it was serving over 2,500 customers and achieving more than $10 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).

On Thursday, Juicebox announced that it had raised $36 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series A round led by Sequoia.

Sequoia partner David Cahn learned about the company while catching up with an early-stage startup founder who said that he is using Juicebox for all of his recruiting efforts. Cahn told TechCrunch that the founder has hired over a dozen people without using a professional recruiter, something that was previously very difficult to do.

Such a rave review of Juicebox piqued Cahn's interest. Shortly after, Cahn learned that Sequoia's internal recruiter was also trying Juicebox to help the firm with its own hiring efforts, which made him even more excited about the startup's growth potential.  

When Cahn eventually met with Paffenholz and Gupta, he was even more impressed.

“I'm not sure I've ever in my career seen a company with four people that got to 2,000 customers with that small of a team,” Cahn told TechCrunch.

Although Juicebox has since hired eight additional employees, the company continues to attract customers without a sales team.

Customers are flocking to Juicebox in part because hiring speed is extremely important for companies racing to build AI functionalities.

What sets Juicebox's search engine apart is its ability to infer information about candidates much like a human would.

“We help find net new candidates that wouldn't be found elsewhere, because the profiles might not have the keywords or the types of things that we'd expect them to have in the regular searches,” Paffenholz told TechCrunch.

The startup's product is popular not only with small companies that lack a dedicated recruiter, but also with talent teams at large corporations. By automating the candidate search, the tool frees up internal recruiters to focus more on building relationships with potential hires.

Once Juicebox identifies candidates, its agent can automatically email them and schedule initial calls.

While Juicebox is growing quickly, older talent acquisition startups like Eightfold are also adding AI-powered search functionality to their offerings.

Still, Cahn is convinced that Paffenholz and Gupta can transform Juicebox into an essential product for every startup's technology stack.

“We've invested in a number of businesses that become defaults for startups, like Stripe,” he said. “I think Juicebox has a chance to be a default where, every single startup, [it's] the first thing they use to hire their first employees.”

The Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday a landmark settlement with Amazon over allegations that the company enrolled millions of consumers into Prime memberships without clear consent and intentionally made the cancellation process difficult. 

The deal includes a $1 billion civil penalty — the largest ever in an FTC case involving a rule violation — and $1.5 billion in refunds for consumers who the agency says were harmed by deceptive Prime enrollment and cancellation practices. Amazon will also be required to overhaul its Prime sign-up and cancellation processes and submit to independent compliance monitoring.

“The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. “Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans' pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again.”

The case stems from a 2023 FTC complaint against Amazon. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Seattle ruled that Amazon violated online shopper protection law by collecting payment information before disclosing full Prime terms, a setback that loomed over the company as the trial began this week.

“Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers,” Amazon said as part of a statement. “We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world.”

The Seattle-based tech giant did not admit wrongdoing under the settlement. It previously argued Prime's terms were clear and cancellations were accessible.

According to the FTC, Amazon employed confusing checkout flows and deceptive user interfaces — commonly described as “dark patterns” — to nudge shoppers into Prime sign-ups they didn't expect. In parallel, the FTC alleged that Amazon created a complex cancellation process.

The settlement forces Amazon to redesign Prime's enrollment interface — requiring clearer disclosures and a “clear and conspicuous button” to decline Prime. Amazon cannot have a button that says, “No, I don't want Free Shipping.”

The FTC estimates 35 million consumers will be eligible for refunds.

Amazon Prime memberships cost $139/year or $15/month. Subscribers get discounts on shipping, video and music streaming, and other benefits.

Amazon doesn't disclose specific Prime membership data. There were an estimated 197 million Amazon customers who had a Prime membership as of March 2025, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners — up about 7% from the June 2024 quarter.

Subscription services revenue, which includes Prime memberships, came in at $12.2 billion in the company's most recent quarter, up 12% year-over-year. That accounted for about 7% of Amazon's overall revenue in the quarter.

Amazon shares were down slightly on Thursday. The company has a market capitalization of nearly $2.4 trillion.

Starbucks closed its flagship Reserve Roastery in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, nearly 11 years after the location opened as an especially technical and geeky ode to the coffee-making process.

Windows at the large facility at 1124 Pike St. were already boarded up on Thursday morning, following news of the Seattle-based coffee giant's major restructuring, announced by CEO Brian Niccol in a blog post. The company plans to lay off approximately 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada.

Starbucks is also closing the Reserve store at the base of its corporate headquarters building south of downtown Seattle.

The $20 million Roastery, housed in a 1920s-era building which was once home to an auto showroom, opened in December 2014, just minutes from Starbucks HQ. Then-CEO Howard Schultz referred to it at the time as the “Willy Wonka of coffee.”

GeekWire toured the facility just before it opened to see how Starbucks planned to give customers a better understanding of the roasting process. For a city and a company steeped in coffee tradition and appreciation, the Reserve was a chance to experiment. Drinks at the mixology bar were created via processes such as Clover, pour-over, coffee press, Chemex, siphon or cold brew.

Technology was packed into the space, from sensors that prevented cross contamination of coffee beans to a 4K projector that showed footage of Starbucks' coffee farms on a smart glass window display. The two roasters were programmed to heat different types of beans at optimal amounts of time and temperature to ensure peak aroma, acidity, body, and flavor.

A company sign posted at the location on Thursday, captured by KIRO7, was addressed to “Cap Hill neighbors and friends” and called the Reserve a “destination of coffee lovers from down the block and around the world.”

Workers at the Roastery voted to unionize in April 2022.

Niccol, who joined Starbucks after six years in the top job at Chipotle, has been charged with turning around the struggling company, which is dealing with slumping sales and criticism over everything from its complicated menu to wait times, prices, and more.

In his post Thursday, Niccol said Starbucks will end fiscal year 2025 with nearly 18,300 total Starbucks locations – company operated and licensed. He said non-retail employees whose roles are being eliminated will be notified on Friday morning.

Starbucks has previously leaned heavily into its technology as a competitive advantage. It was early to mobile ordering, but this summer announced it was sunsetting smaller-format tech-driven pickup only stores. Niccol called them “overly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.”

Starbucks cut 1,100 corporate workers in February in one of the largest layoffs ever at the company.

Starbucks closed its flagship Reserve Roastery in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, nearly 11 years after the location opened as an especially technical and geeky ode to the coffee-making process.

Windows at the large facility at 1124 Pike St. were already boarded up on Thursday morning, following news of the Seattle-based coffee giant's major restructuring, announced by CEO Brian Niccol in a blog post. The company plans to lay off approximately 900 non-retail employees and close underperforming stores in the U.S. and Canada.

The $20 million Roastery, housed in a 1920s-era building which was once home to an auto showroom, opened in December 2014, just minutes from Starbucks' corporate headquarters south of downtown Seattle. Then-CEO Howard Schultz referred to it at the time as the “Willy Wonka of coffee.”

GeekWire toured the facility just before it opened to see how Starbucks planned to give customers a better understanding of the roasting process. For a city and a company steeped in coffee tradition and appreciation, the Reserve was a chance to experiment. Drinks at the mixology bar were created via processes such as Clover, pour-over, coffee press, Chemex, siphon or cold brew.

Technology was packed into the space, from sensors that prevented cross contamination of coffee beans to a 4K projector that showed footage of Starbucks' coffee farms on a smart glass window display. The two roasters were programmed to heat different types of beans at optimal amounts of time and temperature to ensure peak aroma, acidity, body, and flavor.

A company sign posted at the location on Thursday, captured by KIRO7, was addressed to “Cap Hill neighbors and friends” and called the Reserve a “destination of coffee lovers from down the block and around the world.”

Workers at the Roastery voted to unionize in April 2022.

Niccol, who joined Starbucks after six years in the top job at Chipotle, has been charged with turning around the struggling company, which is dealing with slumping sales and criticism over everything from its complicated menu to wait times, prices, and more.

In his post Thursday, Niccol said Starbucks will end fiscal year 2025 with nearly 18,300 total Starbucks locations – company operated and licensed. He said non-retail employees whose roles are being eliminated will be notified on Friday morning.

Starbucks has previously leaned heavily into its technology as a competitive advantage. It was early to mobile ordering, but this summer announced it was shuttering smaller-format tech-driven pickup only stores. Niccol called them “overly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection that defines our brand.”

Starbucks cut 1,100 corporate workers in February in one of the largest layoffs ever at the company.

Noah Hawley is “pretty confident” Alien: Earth will return for a second season. Yet another mid-budget Stephen King project marches forward. Plus, what's coming on The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Spoilers, assemble!



Deadline reports a film adaptation of Stephen King's “novella,” Rat, is now in development with Isaac Ezban attached to direct. The story concerns Drew Larson, a writer “cursed by his own ambition.” Each attempt at a novel has ended in disaster—illness, misfortune, or worse. Determined to break the cycle, he retreats to a desolate cabin in the Maine woods, convinced this time will be different. But as a violent storm traps him in isolation, Drew's body falters and his mind begins to unravel. In the grip of fever and madness, a stranger appears—an uncanny visitor who promises salvation and success…for a price Drew can barely comprehend.”

Deadline also reports the next Spider-Verse movie is now scheduled for a June 18, 2027, theatrical release date, a week earlier than its previous release date

Bloody-Disgusting has our first look at Sam Rockwell as “a man claiming to be from the future who takes the patrons of an iconic Los Angeles diner hostage in search of unlikely recruits in a quest to save the world” in Gore Verbinski's Good Like, Have Fun, Don't Die. 

 

During a recent interview with Polygon, Noah Hawley stated he's “pretty confident” there will be more Alien: Earth following its cliffhanger finale.

I'm pretty confident, given the show's success, that we'll get to make more. The risk is the reward.

Deadline reports Jimmi Simpson has joined the cast of The Walking Dead: Dead City as an incoming “series regular” named Dillard. No further details on his character are available at this time.

Deadline also reports Meredith Averill has replaced Moira Walley-Beckett as showrunner on Fourth Wing, a TV series at Amazon based on Rebecca Yarros' fantasy novels. The series concerns twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail as she “leaves the life of a scribe behind at her mother's demand that she become a dragon rider. At the order of her mother, who is a general in the military of Navarre, Violet enters the brutal ranks of Basgiath War College, which trains up-and-coming riders through the Graduate or Die method.”

Two years ago, when the alien invasion began, Verna and Joel sparked the rise of Infinitas.

Spoiler TV also has images from “La Justicia Fronteriza,” this week's episode of Daryl Dixon. Click through to see the rest.

Daryl and Carol disagree on how to move forward; a surprise attack changes everything.

Finally, 9-1-1 sends Supernova and Critters 4 star Angela Bassett to outer space, “where no first responders have gone before,” in a teaser for the long-running series' genre-bending ninth season.

On Thursday, the AI platform Clarifai announced a new reasoning engine that it claims will make running AI models twice as fast and 40% less expensive. Designed to be adaptable to a variety of models and cloud hosts, the system employs a range of optimizations to get more inference power out of the same hardware.

“It's a variety of different types of optimizations, all the way down to CUDA kernels to advanced speculative decoding techniques,” said CEO Matthew Zeiler. “You can get more out of the same cards, basically.”

The results were verified by a string of benchmark tests by the third-party firm Artificial Analysis, which recorded industry-best records for both throughput and latency.

The process focuses specifically on inference, the computing demands of operating an AI model that has already been trained. That computing load has grown particularly intense with the rise of agentic and reasoning models, which require multiple steps in response to a single command.

First launched as a computer vision service, Clarifai has grown increasingly focused on compute orchestration as the AI boom has drastically increased demand for both GPUs and the data centers that house them. The company first announced its compute platform at AWS re:Invent in December, but the new reasoning engine is the first product specifically tailored for multi-step agentic models.

The product comes amid intense pressure on AI infrastructure, which has spurred a string of billion-dollar deals. OpenAI has laid out plans for as much as $1 trillion in new data center spending, projecting nearly limitless future demand for compute. But while the hardware buildout has been intense, Clarifai's CEO believes there is more to be done in optimizing the infrastructure we already have.

“There's software tricks that take a good model like this further, like the Clarifai reasoning engine,” Zeiler says, “but there's also algorithm improvements that can help combat the need for gigawatt data centers. And I don't think we're at the end of the algorithm innovations.”

Australian shark experts have revealed that some special wetsuit materials aiming to keep sharks from ripping your arm off or gouging out your guts might actually be helpful.

As detailed in a study published today in the journal Wildlife Research, the team investigated the extent to which four bite-resistant wetsuit materials—Aqua Armour, Shark Stop, ActionTX-S, and Brewster—could lessen injuries and blood loss from great white and tiger shark bites.

“Our study showed that bite-resistant materials incorporated into wetsuits can reduce damage from large white and tiger sharks (up to 3 metres) compared to standard neoprene wetsuit, even from moderate and severe bites,” Tom Clarke, a researcher from Flinders University's College of Science and Engineering, said in a university statement. Three meters is around 9 feet. (Who's going to break it to them that some great white sharks can grow up to 20 feet (6 meters) long?)

The team tested each material with real sharks and classified the bite damage in one of four categories of severity, from superficial to critical. They compared the damage to that allowed by standard neoprene material. This approach revealed that “while there were small differences between the four tested materials, they all reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe haemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,” Clarke continued.

While sharks rarely bite humans (you're more likely to die from constipation, champagne corks, and lawn mowers) our interactions with them are increasing around the world as coastal communities expand and marine activities become more sought-after. The most unprovoked shark bites come from great whites and tiger sharks, which are also among the top three species that deliver the highest rate of deadly bites.

(As another side note, it would be interesting to know how researchers track provoked shark bites. Do they ask shark attack survivors, “How much, on a scale of one to ten, were you asking for it?”)

“While these suits don't eliminate all the risk (e.g. internal injuries may still occur), our results indicate that they can reduce blood loss and trauma from major lacerations and punctures, potentially saving lives,” said Charlie Huveneers, leader of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders University. Crushing injuries could also take place. “Our findings will allow for informed decisions to be made about the use of bite-resistant wetsuit materials for occupational activities, as well as enabling the public to make appropriate decisions about the suitability of using these products.”

So if a shark chomps down on your shin, it sounds like you could still break a leg—but maybe the beast won't rip away your entire calf. As such, the researchers argue that bite-resistant wetsuits are a viable approach to lessen the severity of shark bite injuries.

Conventional chainmail suits work well, but they are too heavy and stiff for people to use while surfing or diving. On the other hand, new wetsuits made from strong and light fiber (frequently seen in sailing rope) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (a tough polymer) are flexible as well as effective, according to the statement.

I assume there's little chance of putting the materials through human trials. I certainly don't volunteer as tribute.

The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged this week that Retail Ecommerce Ventures, the company that bought RadioShack out of bankruptcy in 2020, ran a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of $112 million.

REV was founded by Taino Lopez and Alexander Mehr and spent recent years buying up distressed retail ventures including Dress Barn, Franklin Mint, Linens ‘N Things, Modell's Sporting Goods, Pier 1 Imports, RadioShack, and Stein Mart.

Lopez and Mehr allegedly promised investors in their company annualized returns of 25%, along with equity and a monthly preferential dividend as high as 2.083%. They are also accused of assuring investors that funds raised would be for one specific portfolio company, and REV had never failed to pay a single investor. But that wasn't true, according to the SEC.

According to the court filing on Monday:

Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits. Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations. At least $5.9 million of the returns distributed to investors were, in reality, Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors.

The SEC alleges that about $16.1 million in investor funds were diverted for personal use by Lopez and Mehr. The 49-year-old Lopez and 46-year-old Mehr both lived in Puerto Rico, according to the court filing, though their company was registered in Delaware and their primary place of business was Miami, Florida.

The filing includes dollar amounts raised by REV in the name of each company:

Lopez appeared on CNBC in Aug. 2020 to talk about the acquisition of Modell's Sporting Goods. The focus was on the uncertainty of the pandemic, which had started earlier that year, and what that meant for brick-and-mortar stores. REV was focused on going online-only, but Lopez mentioned that there would be possibilities to open up physical stores in the future.

The SEC says REV raised more than $230 million from at least 660 investors nationwide. The federal agency alleges $112 million was acquired through fraudulent securities offerings in the eight REV retail brands. Most of the money raised was collected online through the company's website, as well as on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, according to the SEC.

The agency also outlines instances where it claims Lopez and Mehr made false statements to investors about the company's health. In one example from 2021 provided by the SEC, the company founders allegedly misrepresented how well everything was going.

Following the Zoom calls, Defendant Lopez and Mehr sent email updates to all existing investors recapping the calls. In one email recap Defendant Lopez sent to investors on February 18, 2021, he claimed that Dress Barn and Stein Mart were “on fire” and “cash flow is strong,” that “there are plenty of public companies operating at heavy losses” but that's “not us,” and that REV had “brands with a positive EBITDA.”

In reality, Dress Barn was not going strong, and the retailer experienced losses of nearly $13.7 million in 2020 and $10.7 million in 2021, according to the court filing.

Aside from Lopez and Mehr, REV's chief operating officer, Maya Rose Burkenroad, is also named as a defendant in the court filing on fraud charges for soliciting investment in the company.

Lopez, Mehr, and Burkenroad didn't respond to emailed questions on Wednesday. Lopez, who has quite a presence on YouTube as an influencer and gives advice on everything from investing to dating, posted a new video on Wednesday but didn't seem to address the SEC charges. Instead, the video just talks about the importance of self-education. It's possible the video was filmed before the allegations became public.

Gizmodo will update this article when we hear back.

Databricks said on Thursday that it is incorporating OpenAI's models, including GPT-5, into its data platform as well as its AI product, Agent Bricks, as part of a $100 million multi-year deal that bets on the AI company's ability to bring in enterprise customers.

The deal highlights the accelerating race to bring generative AI into the enterprise stack, as companies foresee demand for AI tools that can tap into corporate data securely.

Agent Bricks lets organizations build AI apps and agents on top of their enterprise data using a range of AI models. OpenAI's latest models are now part of that menu — accessible in SQL or via API — and GPT-5 is being offered as a flagship model for Databricks customers.  

The news comes nearly two months after Databricks added OpenAI's open-weight models, gpt-oss 20B and gpt-oss 120B, to the platform. Agent Bricks can now measure how accurately the different models perform on specific tasks and fine-tunes accordingly to produce more tailored results.

“Our partnership with Databricks brings our most advanced models to where secure enterprise data already lives, making it easier for businesses to experiment, deploy, and scale AI agents with real impact,” Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer of OpenAI, said in a statement.  

With this deal, Databricks is betting that enterprise customers will flock to OpenAI's models. Under the terms, the company is on the hook to pay a minimum of $100 million to OpenAI whether or not the AI firm's models generate that much in revenue over the life of the deal. 

Neither company disclosed how long the agreement will run. If revenue ends up exceeding $100 million, OpenAI will earn more, but if it falls short, Databricks will have to pay the full amount anyway. For Databricks, it means potential downside risk; for OpenAI, it means predictable income at a time when the company is trying to rapidly build out more data centers.  

The deal is similar to the one Databricks reached with Anthropic earlier this year, setting a revenue target of $100 million over five years.

A Databricks spokesperson told TechCrunch that the firm has already seen overwhelming demand from customers, including Mastercard, for native access to OpenAI's models on the platform.

Spotify on Thursday announced a series of updates to its AI policy, designed to better indicate when AI is being used to make music, to cut down on spam, and to make it clearer that unauthorized voice clones are not permitted on its service.

The company says it will adopt an upcoming industry standard for identifying and labeling AI music in credits, known as DDEX, and will soon roll out a new music spam filter to catch more bad actors.

Under the DDEX system, labels, distributors, and music partners submit standardized AI disclosures in music credits. This solution offers detailed information about the use of AI — like whether it was used for AI-generated vocals, instrumentation, or post-production, for example.

“We know the use of AI is going to be a spectrum, with artists and producers incorporating AI in various parts of their creative workflow,” said Sam Duboff, Spotify's Global Head of Marketing and Policy, in a press briefing on Wednesday. “This industry standard will allow for more accurate, nuanced disclosures. It won't force tracks into a false binary where a song either has to be categorically AI or not AI at all,” he noted. 

As part of the same announcement, Spotify clarified its polices around AI-enabled personalization, stating directly thatunauthorized AI voice clones, deepfakes, and any other form of vocal replicas or impersonation are not allowed and will be removed from the platform.

While the DDEX standard is developing, Spotify says it's received commitments from 15 labels and distributors who plan to adopt the technology, and sees its move as one that could signal to others it's time to adopt the technology.

Because AI tools make it easier for anyone to release music, Spotify also has a new plan to cut down on the potential spam that results. This fall, the company will roll out a new music spam filter that will attempt to address spam tactics, tag them, and then stop recommending those tracks to users.

“We know AI has made it easier than ever for bad actors to mass upload content, create duplicates, use SEO tricks to manipulate search or recommendation systems…we've been fighting these kinds of tactics for years,” Duboff said. “But AI is accelerating these issues with more sophistication, and we know that requires new types of mitigations.”

The company said it would roll out the filter gradually to make sure it's targeting the right signals, then add more signals over time as the market evolves. 

Related to this, Spotify will also work with distributors to address something called “profile mismatches,” a scheme where someone fraudulently uploads music to another artist's profile across streaming services. The company said it hopes to prevent more of these before the music ever goes live. 

Despite the changes, Spotify executives emphasized that they still support use of AI provided it's used in a non-fraudulent way. “We're not here to punish artists for using AI authentically and responsibly. We hope that artists' use of AI production tools will enable them to be more creative than ever,” noted Spotify VP and Global Head of Music, Charlie Hellman. “But we are here to stop the bad actors who are gaming the system, and we can only benefit from all that good side of AI if we aggressively protect against the downside,” he said.

Spotify's updates follow a rapid increase in AI-generated music across the industry. This summer, an AI-generated band called Velvet Sundown went viral on its service, leading users to complain that the company isn't transparent about labeling its AI tracks. Meanwhile, streaming rival Deezer recently shared that about 18% of the music uploaded each day to its service — or more than 20,000 tracks — is now fully AI-generated. 

Spotify wouldn't share its own metrics on the matter directly — but Duboff told reporters that “the reality is, all streaming services have almost exactly the same catalog.”

“People tend to deliver the music to all services,” he explained, adding that uploading tracks doesn't mean anyone's listening or that the AI music makes money. “We know AI usage is increasingly not a binary, but kind of a spectrum of how artists and producers are using it.”

Money seems to endlessly flow in the AI space, whether it's Nvidia announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI or OpenAI planning to build more massive data centers before the first $500 billion project is even completed. Eventually, some of the folks who have poured money into these ventures are going to expect to see some return on investment. According to a research note from Deutsche Bank, it's getting harder and harder to see how that is going to happen.

Fortune reports that a note written by George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank warned that spending in the AI sector is “parabolic.” In fact, it is so vast, the researcher said, that it might single-handedly be propping up the American economy. “AI machines—in quite a literal sense—appear to be saving the U.S. economy right now,” he wrote. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the U.S. would be close to, or in, recession this year.” That checks out: earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported capital expenditure spending for AI contributed more to growth in the US economy than all consumer spending combined has so far this year.

If you want to narrow it down even further, you can. Saravelos pointed to chipmaker Nvidia specifically and says the company is “currently carrying the weight of U.S. economic growth.” All that has to happen for the company to continue shouldering the entirety of the economy on its back is for its growth to be endlessly exponential. No problem, right? “The bad news is that in order for the tech cycle to continue contributing to GDP growth, capital investment needs to remain parabolic. This is highly unlikely,” Saravelos warned.

Shoot.

Now, you don't really have to be an economist to know that it's usually a bad idea to have all your eggs in one basket. But just in case, here is one to tell us: Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at asset management firm Apollo, wrote last week that “The bottom line is once again that there is an extreme degree of concentration in the S&P 500, and equity investors are dramatically overexposed to AI.”

To put some numbers to it, here's some math from a recent report published by consulting company Bain & Company. The firm says that “AI's compute demand grows at more than twice the rate of Moore's Law,” and by 2030, the computing power needed to satisfy AI demand would come at a cost of two trillion dollars per year. “The world is still $800 billion short to keep pace with demand,” Bain & Co writes. 

Pair that with the report that came out of MIT earlier this year, which found that just 5% of businesses that have adopted generative AI tools have managed to achieve “rapid revenue acceleration,” while the rest have largely fallen flat, and it becomes a little hard to see the case for profitability being just around the corner. But hey, who knows, maybe we're just another small $500 billion investment away from making it all click. Any takers?

Sony took the wraps off its Pulse Elevate wireless speakers during its State of Play event a few hours ago. With this 2.0 speaker system, the firm says it will be introducing its “first wireless speakers for desktop gaming.” Obviously, Sony has a long legacy of wired speakers for PCs, dating back to its VAIO multimedia PC days.

The new PC, Mac, and PS5-compatible Sony Pulse Elevate speakers use PlayStation Link wireless connectivity, which promises lossless audio with ultra-low latency. Other key features are the inclusion of a microphone with AI noise cancellation, an easy-access volume knob, and battery power for portability.

This launch will expand the Pulse audio family, which Sony already established with the Pulse Elite wireless headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds.

In terms of audio performance, a technology highlight of the Pulse Elevate speakers is the use of Planar magnetic speaker drivers. In each speaker, these are situated above woofers, which extend the bass response so you can “feel every impact” when gaming.

 




Tempest 3D AudioTech is supported on the PS5 platform, in compatible titles, for positioning audio. Both PS5 and PC have software controls that allow for adjustments of the speaker EQ, sidetone volume, and mic mute settings. It seems like Mac users will miss out on this extra configurability.

The speakers are easy to position and detach from their charging docks, upon which they sit on your desk. The PlayStation Link USB-C wireless dongle and associated software are also said to make it easy to switch input sources. That may be welcome if you have multiple systems sharing a desk space, for example.

We also note that the Pulse Elevate works with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player, if you are one of the ~2 million people who own one of these handhelds. The design offers “simultaneous Bluetooth and PlayStation Link connectivity.” And thanks to Bluetooth, you will also be able to pair them with your smartphone.

Sony says the speakers “will launch in 2026” and be available in black or white colors. The moderately distant launch date seems to have made it too early for a pricing reveal – a very important factor in whether these will be popular. The PC market is particularly price sensitive, as we are spoiled for choice with many great audio products to choose from.

A new report claims that Intel is set to increase the price of its older Raptor Lake chips by as much as 10% in the face of the continued popularity of the lineup and customers shunning AI-equipped Lunar Lake models, according to Digitimes. While the report doesn't specify which models are set for an increase, it specifically highlights that chips launched in October 2022 (13th-gen chips), noting that prices will increase from $150-160 to $170-$180. This could encompass some popular i3 or i5 models, depending on the region and availability.

This increase will occur despite the company announcing that the integrated GPU drivers for these processors will be placed on legacy software support, effectively putting them on the back burner, despite some having launched as recently as 2023. Digitimes cites industry insiders who say "lukewarm" consumer response to AI PCs as a factor.

Intel's current crop of processors hasn't performed well in the market, with CEO Lip-Bu Tan commenting frankly that the chips aren't competitive in the market. That, coupled with customers seeking value options, has led many to opt for lower-cost previous-generation models instead.

The Raptor-Lake price jump aligns with the soaring costs of DDR4 memory chips, meaning PC makers will be hard-pressed to keep their prices low by opting to use the older memory in lieu of newer, faster DDR5, thereby squeezing the budget end of the PC building market. According to the report, some brands are even experiencing supply shortages, especially as the volatility of chip pricing is making them reluctant to place long-term orders. Due to this, PC and component prices may increase slightly as we approach the end of 2025.

Windows 10's end-of-life this coming October might result in some corporate sales, especially for companies unwilling to pay for extended support. However, this is less of a concern for consumers, meaning it's unlikely that retail sales will increase as a result. The upcoming holiday season may drive some sales figures, especially if companies release great deals.

We've pinged Intel for comment and will update as neccesary.

The industry is getting billions, but it's way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand.

This week, Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced it has another customer for its first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. Eni, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, signed a billion-dollar deal to buy electricity from the facility.

The power purchase agreement makes Eni the second major customer for Commonwealth's first commercial fusion power plant.

One small detail? That reactor doesn't exist yet. Neither does the smaller reactor Commonwealth is building first to demonstrate that its tokamak design will work as intended.

This is a weird moment in fusion. Investors are pouring billions into the field to build power plants, and some companies are even signing huge agreements to purchase power from those still-nonexistent plants. All this comes before companies have actually completed a working reactor that can produce electricity. It takes money to develop a new technology, but all this funding could lead to some twisted expectations. 

Nearly three years ago, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hit a major milestone for fusion power. With the help of the world's most powerful lasers, scientists heated a pellet of fuel to 100 million °C. Hydrogen atoms in that fuel fused together, releasing more energy than the lasers put in.

It was a game changer for the vibes in fusion. The NIF experiment finally showed that a fusion reactor could yield net energy. Plasma physicists' models had certainly suggested that it should be true, but it was another thing to see it demonstrated in real life.

But in some ways, the NIF results didn't really change much for commercial fusion. That site's lasers used a bonkers amount of energy, the setup was wildly complicated, and the whole thing lasted a fraction of a second. To operate a fusion power plant, not only do you have to achieve net energy, but you also need to do that on a somewhat constant basis and—crucially—do it economically.

So in the wake of the NIF news, all eyes went to companies like Commonwealth, Helion, and Zap Energy. Who would be the first to demonstrate this milestone in a more commercially feasible reactor? Or better yet, who would be the first to get a power plant up and running?

So far, the answer is none of them.

The lack of essential supply chains and process technologies necessary to commercialize fusion energy could doom the US and European countries in capturing the critical geopolitical prize.

To be fair, many fusion companies have made technical progress. Commonwealth has built and tested its high-temperature superconducting magnets and published research about that work. Zap Energy demonstrated three hours of continuous operation in its test system, a milestone validated by the US Department of Energy. Helion started construction of its power plant in Washington in July. (And that's not to mention a thriving, publicly funded fusion industry in China.)  

These are all important milestones, and these and other companies have seen many more. But as Ed Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at Berkeley, summed it up to me: “They don't have a reactor.” (He was speaking specifically about Commonwealth, but really, the same goes for the others.)

And yet, the money pours in. Commonwealth raised over $800 million in funding earlier this year. And now it's got two big customers signed on to buy electricity from this future power plant.

Why buy electricity from a reactor that's currently little more than ideas on paper? From the perspective of these particular potential buyers, such agreements can be something of a win-win, says Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute.

By putting a vote of confidence behind Commonwealth, Eni could help the fusion startup get the capital it needs to actually build its plant. The company also directly invests in Commonwealth, so it stands to benefit from success. Getting a good rate on the capital needed to build the plant could also mean the electricity is ultimately cheaper for Eni, Stein says. 

Ultimately, fusion needs a lot of money. If fossil-fuel companies and tech giants want to provide it, all the better. One concern I have, though, is how outside observers are interpreting these big commitments. 

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been loud about his support for fusion and his expectations of the technology. Earlier this month, he told the BBC that it will soon power the world.

He's certainly not the first to have big dreams for fusion, and it is an exciting technology. But despite the jaw-dropping financial milestones, this industry is still very much in development. 

And while Wright praises fusion, the Trump administration is slashing support for other energy technologies, including wind and solar power, and spreading disinformation about their safety, cost, and effectiveness. 

To meet the growing electricity demand and cut emissions from the power sector, we'll need a whole range of technologies. It's a risk and a distraction to put all our hopes on an unproven energy tech when there are plenty of options that actually exist.

In a world where hallowed news organizations transform into conservative mouthpieces and ​milquetoast late-night jokes are grounds for suspension, satirical headlines from the Onion can feel closer to real life than parody.

Now the site is taking on one of the most taboo subjects of all—disgraced sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein—in mockumentary form.

Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile is a 20-minute satire that's half biopic, half true crime, and 100 percent dumb (complimentary). It launches in theaters in New York City, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and San Francisco for one day only on October 2; after that it will be available online. You can watch the trailer right here.

Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile is a 20-minute mockumentary that launches in select theaters on October 2.

Onion CEO Ben Collins says his writers decided to go big on Epstein once Donald Trump started acting “dodgy” when fielding questions about Epstein this summer. They pulled it together in six weeks.

“There's this big gap where information should be,” Collins says. They thought “it would be very funny to fill it with complete fucking nonsense.”

The mockumentary fills much of that gap with Trump himself. It opens with a fake voicemail from Epstein to Trump that heavily implies the president arranged his death. (Epstein died in prison in 2019; it was officially ruled a suicide.) “I just wanted to remind you that we're best friends, and tomorrow I'm going to tell the whole world that you're a pedophile, just like me,” the voice actor says over drone shots of the Manhattan skyline, Washington, DC, and the island where Epstein allegedly sex-trafficked minors. “Unless, of course, something bad happens to me tonight. But I'll probably be fine.”

From there, Bad Pedophile skewers all the standard true-crime tropes. Talking heads ask hard-hitting questions like, “Was he ever even alive to begin with?” and “Was Jeffrey his first name, or was Epstein his last name?” In addition to the portrayals of journalists, lawyers, and former associates, they throw in a priest whose title is “pedophile expert.” To give you a hint of what satirical tack the Onion is taking, this is a world in which Epstein is described as an “all-American molester” whose accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell first met him through a classified ad seeking a “gross pervert assistant.”

About a third of the way in, we hear another fake audioclip, this time portraying a Department of Justice official telling Maxwell in a 2025 interview, “We need you to help us cover up some of Donald Trump's crimes.” (The Justice Department released redacted transcripts of the actual Maxwell interview last month.) This is when Bad Pedophile takes a sharp turn to chronicle the relationship between Trump and Epstein. It would be a shame to spoil a sequence this ridiculous and sublime, so I'll leave it at that.

Like any good satire, the mockumentary's sharpest moments are flecked with bits of truth. While it has Epstein working at a fictional Deep State, it also calls out his allegedly real relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world, including Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton—throwing in a few extra “allegedlies” in the process. And of course it claims that Epstein, “a pedophile in the prime of his life, with decades of molesting still in front of him,” didn't end his own life but was killed in a “botched government-sanctioned assassination,” complete with “over 34,689,652 minutes” of missing surveillance footage from his jail cell. The latter is a nod to the footage that was cut from the “full raw” surveillance video from the only working camera near Epstein's Manhattan jail cell on the night before he was found dead in August 2019.

The release of Bad Pedophile will be more limited than was originally planned. Collins says a movie theater company was set to launch the mockumentary nationally but pulled out in the wake of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's death. The publication had to scramble to find an alternative.

“It does show you, this moment, if you are trying to get a merger through or something, or some sort of business from the government, or if you're just afraid of the ire of the president, the only real way to get stuff out there is independently,” says Collins. “If you see Jeffrey Epstein's name and your immediate thought process is, ‘Oh, this might offend the president,' that's not the problem of people making a joke. It's the problem of a broken and insanely failing society.”

Despite promising to be more transparent about releasing the so-called “Epstein files” during the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has since done an about-face. According to The Wall Street Journal, he was told he was named in the files, although it's unknown in what context. In a Truth Social post in September he described the case as the “Democrat Epstein Hoax.”

As the Epstein saga continues to unfold, there's no telling when the public will have access to all of the pertinent information. In the meantime, at least there's the Onion.

“In the last year, we've been able to say a lot of stuff that other places are afraid to say,” says Collins. “We're going to keep doing it.”

Half a decade after the end of the Intel Mac...

Intel is in preliminary discussions with Apple regarding a potential investment, according to Bloomberg, which cites sources familiar with the matter. The two companies are also reportedly exploring ways to work more closely together, although it remains to be seen whether any potential deals can be reached, as negotiations are in the early stages and may not come to fruition.

The reported talks with Apple follow a string of recent deals, including major funding from Nvidia and SoftBank, and conversion of CHIPS Act funding from the U.S. government to equity. These moves are believed to be a part of the company's revival strategy that not only includes securing money, but also securing commitments to use the company's products and services going forward to justify developing Intel's next-generation 14A process technology and building production capacities that will support the node.

Apple used Intel's CPUs inside its PCs from 2005 to 2020, but it never used the company's low-power processors for its iPhones or iPads. Instead, it switched its Macs to Arm-based SoCs in 2020. Apple's current computers do not use any hardware from Intel, even though these systems use technologies originally developed by Intel or co-developed with Intel, including DisplayPort, NVMe, PCIe, Thunderbolt, and USB. Even Thunderbolt 5 controllers/retimers found in the latest MacBook Pro come from Apple, yet are certified by Intel. It is unknown how Apple and Intel could collaborate going forward, though the high-tech world is very convoluted.

Intel's timing to enter negotiations with Apple seems favourable as the high-tech giant has just received investments from Nvidia, SoftBank, and the U.S. government. Such high-profile backers reflect a growing belief in Intel's comeback, so it should be easier for the company to persuade Apple and other potential investors to buy Intel stock. Also, Apple has prioritized expanding its investments within the U.S., even though much of its supply chain remains abroad. In August, it pledged $600 billion toward domestic initiatives, an increase from a previous $500 billion commitment.

Obviously, a deal with Apple would further underscore confidence in Intel's direction, which would carry symbolic weight and bolster Intel's public image. However, if the rumored deal does not yield any agreement, this might harm Intel's position.

From its inception, Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) operated as a rogue entity within the US government, slashing staff and funding, gaining access to government systems, and overriding agency decisionmaking—all without oversight from officials who have little understanding of its reach and methods.

A report issued by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) on Thursday adds new insight on how this incursion happened, while raising grave concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic data breach that would affect all Americans and serious questions about who DOGE operatives answer to.

Oversight staff detail how DOGE gained control over federal agencies, focusing their probe on three of DOGE's primary targets: the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Social Security Administration (SSA).

“A clear pattern emerged across agencies—officials who questioned DOGE were pushed out, and DOGE-affiliated personnel were installed in key positions such as Chief Information Officer,” the report finds. “The DOGE associates were then able to grant approval to other DOGE employees to work with sensitive data without restrictions.”

Throughout the report, committee investigators describe DOGE representatives as working clandestinely within the agencies they were sent to serve and in spaces kept under armed guard, seemingly not beholden to government officials.

“At one point, GSA officials said they did not have the key to open a locked room that had windows covered with black paper, trash bags, and tape,” the report says, describing HSGAC staffers' attempts to inspect the agency's offices. “When staff asked why the most senior officials in offices charged with building management and security could not open an office door, GSA could not provide an answer.”

According to the report, investigators were forbidden from taking photos of where DOGE worked at GSA, which they noted appeared to be the group's “primary technical hub.” It was also clearly a living space: GSA officials told Senate staffers they'd purchased furniture to outfit seven bedrooms for “intermittent sleeping;” there was even a “makeshift bedroom” next to the administrator's suite, which one official was surprised to find. The GSA administrator's dining room had unmade beds and a hot plate, while an office labeled “chief of staff” had a Ping Pong table and a nearby kitchen had “a dedicated fridge stocked with Celsius energy drinks and Muscle Milk.”

The administrator's office was filled with 10 work stations, stacks of laptops (8 to 10 per person), and "multiple cellphones.” The GSA officials could not confirm that the devices were provided by GSA or who the DOGE reps working there reported to, simply calling them “GSA employees.” DOGE associates at the SSA were also allowed to telework, even as all other staffers were called back to the office. Many DOGE members were detailed to several agencies simultaneously, in a move that several experts have noted is unprecedented.

“Senior officials at SSA, GSA, and OPM all failed to provide information about who was in charge; what conduct DOGE teams were engaged in; and what data those teams had been given access to, including the authorities and restrictions guiding their access,” the report says. “None of the agencies could answer simple questions about organizational charts and employee roles.”

In response to a request for comment, an OPM spokesperson who did not give their name denied that OPM had any “‘DOGE' employees” and said, “This is absurd. OPM was clear the acting director, chosen by President Trump, oversaw OPM's activities. There were no DOGE teams.”

Who was—and is—in charge of all this is unclear to the investigators. Under the terms of the executive order establishing DOGE, that should be Amy Gleason, the administrator of the US DOGE Service. “However,” the report says, “whistleblowers told staff that Ms. Gleason is just a figurehead with no real power over DOGE staff at agencies and that most DOGE staff actually function outside of the US DOGE Service.” (Gleason did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

DOGE affiliates in the SSA had access to personal data belonging to all Americans, the report claims, citing interviews with whistleblowers from the agency—including Social Security numbers, birthplace, date of birth, and work permit status, and placed the information in an unsecured cloud environment established by DOGE. Earlier this year, SSA chief data officer Chuck Borges filed a whistleblower complaint accusing the agency of mishandling data and creating an unsecure server to hold it. DOGE operatives could edit and delete data in this system and potentially share it with private entities or foreign actors, the report finds. It's unclear if data was manipulated or shared outside of government.

The committee notes that it's “very likely” that US adversarial nations, including Russia, China, and Iran are aware of the cloud system DOGE set up at SSA.

One whistleblower who spoke to committee investigators alleged that data from SSA's NUMIDENT database showed up in Department of Homeland Security “in an unusual format, suggesting that the data was not shared via a normal interagency data sharing agreement.” In April, WIRED reported that DOGE had uploaded SSA data to a DHS data lake that could be used to track and surveil migrants.

Prior to establishing the cloud environment, SSA conducted a risk assessment that found the possibility of a data breach with “catastrophic adverse effect” was between 35 and 65 percent, the committee's report says.

“In a worst-case scenario, one whistleblower noted the possibility that the agency may need to re-issue SSNs to all who possess one,” the report says.

“It is unclear why such a high-risk project is needed, or why DOGE personnel require the use of live data free from the supervision of agency officials,” the report says. “One whistleblower told staff that the purpose of the database might be to provide free SSN verification for other federal agencies, but circumventing basic safeguards suggests that project may have other purposes.”

In response to questions, an unnamed SSA spokesperson referred WIRED to a September 16 letter from Commissioner Frank Bisignano to Senator Michael Crapo, and says, “based on the agency's thorough review, the Numident data and database–stored in a longstanding secure environment used by SSA–have not been accessed, leaked, hacked, or shared in any unauthorized fashion.” The spokesperson also asserted that “there are no DOGE employees at SSA, only SSA employees.”

“DOGE isn't making government more efficient—it's putting Americans' sensitive information in the hands of completely unqualified and untrustworthy individuals,” said Gary Peters, a Democratic US senator from Michigan and ranking member of HSGAC, in a statement on Thursday. “They are bypassing cybersecurity protections, evading oversight, and putting Americans' personal data at risk. We cannot allow this shadow operation to continue operating unchecked while millions of people face the threat of identity theft, economic disruption, and permanent harm. The Trump Administration and agency leadership must immediately put a stop to these reckless actions that risk causing unprecedented chaos in Americans' daily lives.”

When visiting the GSA offices, committee investigators saw “cloud infrastructure and enterprise network infrastructure diagrams” drawn on a whiteboard, but GSA officials blocked their view “with their bodies,” the report says.

The report also claims that GSA officials “refused to show staff Starlink infrastructure,” telling them to schedule a follow-up visit and then denying the request to do so. The GSA installed terminals from Starlink, the satellite company Musk owns, about a month after inauguration. At the time, GSA staff warned that this posed a significant security risk and voiced concern that the terminals could allow DOGE to siphon data out of the agency. According to the report, GSA officials “could not even confirm that the Starlink terminal was configured with basic security settings recommended by Starlink itself,” making staffers “concerned that any data sent or received over the Starlink device at GSA and other locations could be an easy target for foreign adversaries."

Starlink terminals have also been installed at the White House.

This was not the only apparent effort to circumvent government policies and protections around data. One former OPM employee alleged in an interview with investigators that “even before the inauguration, the incoming administration expressed a ‘strong interest' in government-wide email servers and centralizing communications.” According to the employee, Greg Hogan, the incoming CIO, “had asked OPM staff whether they could deploy an AI system in an off-cloud environment, an environment that would allow for less agency oversight and fewer safeguards.” (The anonymous OPM spokesperson declined to comment on anything that happened before the inauguration. “The CIO asked many technical questions as part of his role,” they said in response to a question about Hogan. “All his work at OPM complied with the agency's security and regulatory requirements.”)

At the SSA, investigators found that access to the areas DOGE worked out of were controlled by armed guards. It was a measure taken, according to Dan Callahan, assistant commissioner for building and facilities management, because the DOGE members were “concerned for their safety.” Upon further inquiry, investigators found that this concern stemmed from “communication with an SSA employee that ‘included cursing.'”

At the GSA, “armed guards controlled access to work and living spaces [and] rooms were locked,” the report says, while the investigators' visit to OPM was carried out under armed guard. (“The ‘armed guards' were the normal security teams that provide security for the OPM office,” said the anonymous OPM spokesperson, citing purported “misbehavior” by the investigators as they visited other agencies. “They accompanied the visit when entering secure areas with sensitive information.”)

As a result of the investigation, the report calls on the Trump administration to end all DOGE activities, revoke all access its representatives maintain over personally identifiable information, and require agencies to provide evidence that the access is compliant with existing privacy regulations. The investigators also demand that SSA shut down the cloud environment to which DOGE uploaded NUMIDENT data.

The White House and GSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

When Kenneth Wehr started managing the Greenlandic-language version of Wikipedia four years ago, his first act was to delete almost everything. It had to go, he thought, if it had any chance of surviving.

Wehr, who's 26, isn't from Greenland—he grew up in Germany—but he had become obsessed with the island, an autonomous Danish territory, after visiting as a teenager. He'd spent years writing obscure Wikipedia articles in his native tongue on virtually everything to do with it. He even ended up moving to Copenhagen to study Greenlandic, a language spoken by some 57,000 mostly Indigenous Inuit people scattered across dozens of far-flung Arctic villages. 

The Greenlandic-language edition was added to Wikipedia around 2003, just a few years after the site launched in English. By the time Wehr took its helm nearly 20 years later, hundreds of Wikipedians had contributed to it and had collectively written some 1,500 articles totaling over tens of thousands of words. It seemed to be an impressive vindication of the crowdsourcing approach that has made Wikipedia the go-to source for information online, demonstrating that it could work even in the unlikeliest places. 

There was only one problem: The Greenlandic Wikipedia was a mirage. 

Machine learning is bringing us closer to a Babel-fish-style universal translation device.

Virtually every single article had been published by people who did not actually speak the language. Wehr, who now teaches Greenlandic in Denmark, speculates that perhaps only one or two Greenlanders had ever contributed. But what worried him most was something else: Over time, he had noticed that a growing number of articles appeared to be copy-pasted into Wikipedia by people using machine translators. They were riddled with elementary mistakes—from grammatical blunders to meaningless words to more significant inaccuracies, like an entry that claimed Canada had only 41 inhabitants. Other pages sometimes contained random strings of letters spat out by machines that were unable to find suitable Greenlandic words to express themselves. 

“It might have looked Greenlandic to [the authors], but they had no way of knowing,” complains Wehr. 

“Sentences wouldn't make sense at all, or they would have obvious errors,” he adds. “AI translators are really bad at Greenlandic.”  

What Wehr describes is not unique to the Greenlandic edition. 

Wikipedia is the most ambitious multilingual project after the Bible: There are editions in over 340 languages, and a further 400 even more obscure ones are being developed and tested. Many of these smaller editions have been swamped with automatically translated content as AI has become increasingly accessible. Volunteers working on four African languages, for instance, estimated to MIT Technology Review that between 40% and 60% of articles in their Wikipedia editions were uncorrected machine translations. And after auditing the Wikipedia edition in Inuktitut, an Indigenous language close to Greenlandic that's spoken in Canada, MIT Technology Review estimates that more than two-thirds of pages containing more than several sentences feature portions created this way. 

This is beginning to cause a wicked problem. AI systems, from Google Translate to ChatGPT, learn to “speak” new languages by scraping huge quantities of text from the internet. Wikipedia is sometimes the largest source of online linguistic data for languages with few speakers—so any errors on those pages, grammatical or otherwise, can poison the wells that AI is expected to draw from. That can make the models' translation of these languages particularly error-prone, which creates a sort of linguistic doom loop as people continue to add more and more poorly translated Wikipedia pages using those tools, and AI models continue to train from poorly translated pages. It's a complicated problem, but it boils down to a simple concept: Garbage in, garbage out. 

“These models are built on raw data,” says Kevin Scannell, a former professor of computer science at Saint Louis University who now builds computer software tailored for endangered languages. “They will try and learn everything about a language from scratch. There is no other input. There are no grammar books. There are no dictionaries. There is nothing other than the text that is inputted.”

There isn't perfect data on the scale of this problem, particularly because a lot of AI training data is kept confidential and the field continues to evolve rapidly. But back in 2020, Wikipedia was estimated to make up more than half the training data that was fed into AI models translating some languages spoken by millions across Africa, including Malagasy, Yoruba, and Shona. In 2022, a research team from Germany that looked into what data could be obtained by online scraping even found that Wikipedia was the sole easily accessible source of online linguistic data for 27 under-resourced languages. 

This could have significant repercussions in cases where Wikipedia is poorly written—potentially pushing the most vulnerable languages on Earth toward the precipice as future generations begin to turn away from them. 

“Wikipedia will be reflected in the AI models for these languages,” says Trond Trosterud, a computational linguist at the University of Tromsø in Norway, who has been raising the alarm about the potentially harmful outcomes of badly run Wikipedia editions for years. “I find it hard to imagine it will not have consequences. And, of course, the more dominant position that Wikipedia has, the worse it will be.” 

Automation has been built into Wikipedia since the very earliest days. Bots keep the platform operational: They repair broken links, fix bad formatting, and even correct spelling mistakes. These repetitive and mundane tasks can be automated away with little problem. There is even an army of bots that scurry around generating short articles about rivers, cities, or animals by slotting their names into formulaic phrases. They have generally made the platform better. 

But AI is different. Anybody can use it to cause massive damage with a few clicks. 

Wikipedia has managed the onset of the AI era better than many other websites. It has not been flooded with AI bots or disinformation, as social media has been. It largely retains the innocence that characterized the earlier internet age. Wikipedia is open and free for anyone to use, edit, and pull from, and it's run by the very same community it serves. It is transparent and easy to use. But community-run platforms live and die on the size of their communities. English has triumphed, while Greenlandic has sunk. 

“We need good Wikipedians. This is something that people take for granted. It is not magic,” says Amir Aharoni, a member of the volunteer Language Committee, which oversees requests to open or close Wikipedia editions. “If you use machine translation responsibly, it can be efficient and useful. Unfortunately, you cannot trust all people to use it responsibly.” 

Trosterud has studied the behavior of users on small Wikipedia editions and says AI has empowered a subset that he terms “Wikipedia hijackers.” These users can range widely—from naive teenagers creating pages about their hometowns or their favorite YouTubers to well-meaning Wikipedians who think that by creating articles in minority languages they are in some way “helping” those communities. 

“The problem with them nowadays is that they are armed with Google Translate,” Trosterud says, adding that this is allowing them to produce much longer and more plausible-looking content than they ever could before: “Earlier they were armed only with dictionaries.” 

This has effectively industrialized the acts of destruction—which affect vulnerable languages most, since AI translations are typically far less reliable for them. There can be lots of different reasons for this, but a meaningful part of the issue is the relatively small amount of source text that is available online. And sometimes models struggle to identify a language because it is similar to others, or because some, including Greenlandic and most Native American languages, have structures that make them badly suited to the way most machine translation systems work. (Wehr notes that in Greenlandic most words are agglutinative, meaning they are built by attaching prefixes and suffixes to stems. As a result, many words are extremely context specific and can express ideas that in other languages would take a full sentence.) 

Research produced by Google before a major expansion of Google Translate rolled out three years ago found that translation systems for lower-resourced languages were generally of a lower quality than those for better-resourced ones. Researchers found, for example, that their model would often mistranslate basic nouns across languages, including the names of animals and colors. (In a statement to MIT Technology Review, Google wrote that it is “committed to meeting a high standard of quality for all 249 languages” it supports “by rigorously testing and improving [its] systems, particularly for languages that may have limited public text resources on the web.”) 

Wikipedia itself offers a built-in editing tool called Content Translate, which allows users to automatically translate articles from one language to another—the idea being that this will save time by preserving the references and fiddly formatting of the originals. But it piggybacks on external machine translation systems, so it's largely plagued by the same weaknesses as other machine translators—a problem that the Wikimedia Foundation says is hard to solve. It's up to each edition's community to decide whether this tool is allowed, and some have decided against it. (Notably, English-language Wikipedia has largely banned its use, claiming that some 95% of articles created using Content Translate failed to meet an acceptable standard without significant additional work.) But it's at least easy to tell when the program has been used; Content Translate adds a tag on the Wikipedia back end. 

Other AI programs can be harder to monitor. Still, many Wikipedia editors I spoke with said that once their languages were added to major online translation tools, they noticed a corresponding spike in the frequency with which poor, likely machine-translated pages were created. 

Some Wikipedians using AI to translate content do occasionally admit that they do not speak the target languages. They may see themselves as providing smaller communities with rough-cut articles that speakers can then fix—essentially following the same model that has worked well for more active Wikipedia editions.  

But once error-filled pages are produced in small languages, there is usually not an army of knowledgeable people who speak those languages standing ready to improve them. There are few readers of these editions, and sometimes not a single regular editor. 

Yuet Man Lee, a Canadian teacher in his 20s, says that he used a mix of Google Translate and ChatGPT to translate a handful of articles that he had written for the English Wikipedia into Inuktitut, thinking it'd be nice to pitch in and help a smaller Wikipedia community. He says he added a note to one saying that it was only a rough translation. “I did not think that anybody would notice [the article],” he explains. “If you put something out there on the smaller Wikipedias—most of the time nobody does.” 

But at the same time, he says, he still thought “someone might see it and fix it up”—adding that he had wondered whether the Inuktitut translation that the AI systems generated was grammatically correct. Nobody has touched the article since he created it.

Lee, who teaches social sciences in Vancouver and first started editing entries in the English Wikipedia a decade ago, says that users familiar with more active Wikipedias can fall victim to this mindset, which he terms a “bigger-Wikipedia arrogance”: When they try to contribute to smaller Wikipedia editions, they assume that others will come along to fix their mistakes. It can sometimes work. Lee says he had previously contributed several articles to Wikipedia in Tatar, a language spoken by several million people mainly in Russia, and at least one of those was eventually corrected. But the Inuktitut Wikipedia is, by comparison, a “barren wasteland.” 

He emphasizes that his intentions had been good: He wanted to add more articles to an Indigenous Canadian Wikipedia. “I am now thinking that it may have been a bad idea. I did not consider that I could be contributing to a recursive loop,” he says. “It was about trying to get content out there, out of curiosity and for fun, without properly thinking about the consequences.” 

Wikipedia is a project that is driven by wide-eyed optimism. Editing can be a thankless task, involving weeks spent bickering with faceless, pseudonymous people, but devotees put in hours of unpaid labor because of a commitment to a higher cause. It is this commitment that drives many of the regular small-language editors I spoke with. They all feared what would happen if garbage continued to appear on their pages.

Abdulkadir Abdulkadir, a 26-year-old agricultural planner who spoke with me over a crackling phone call from a busy roadside in northern Nigeria, said that he spends three hours every day fiddling with entries in his native Fulfulde, a language used mainly by pastoralists and farmers across the Sahel. “But the work is too much,” he said. 

Abdulkadir sees an urgent need for the Fulfulde Wikipedia to work properly. He has been suggesting it as one of the few online resources for farmers in remote villages, potentially offering information on which seeds or crops might work best for their fields in a language they can understand. If you give them a machine-translated article, Abdulkadir told me, then it could “easily harm them,” as the information will probably not be translated correctly into Fulfulde. 

Google Translate, for instance, says the Fulfulde word for January means June, while ChatGPT says it's August or September. The programs also suggest the Fulfulde word for “harvest” means “fever” or “well-being,” among other possibilities.  

Abdulkadir said he had recently been forced to correct an article about cowpeas, a foundational cash crop across much of Africa, after discovering that it was largely illegible. 

If someone wants to create pages on the Fulfulde Wikipedia, Abdulkadir said, they should be translated manually. Otherwise, “whoever will read your articles will [not] be able to get even basic knowledge,” he tells these Wikipedians. Nevertheless, he estimates that some 60% of articles are still uncorrected machine translations. Abdulkadir told me that unless something important changes with how AI systems learn and are deployed, then the outlook for Fulfulde looks bleak. “It is going to be terrible, honestly,” he said. “Totally, completely no future.” 

Across the country from Abdulkadir, Lucy Iwuala contributes to Wikipedia in Igbo, a language spoken by several million people in southeastern Nigeria. “The harm has already been done,” she told me, opening the two most recently created articles. Both had been automatically translated via Wikipedia's Content Translate and contained so many mistakes that she said it would have given her a headache to continue reading them. “There are some terms that have not even been translated. They are still in English,” she pointed out. She recognized the username that had created the pages as a serial offender. “This one even includes letters that are not used in the Igbo language,” she said. 

Iwuala began regularly contributing to Wikipedia three years ago out of concern that Igbo was being displaced by English. It is a worry that is common to many who are active on smaller Wikipedia editions. “This is my culture. This is who I am,” she told me. “That is the essence of it all: to ensure that you are not erased.” 

Iwuala, who now works as a professional translator between English and Igbo, said the users doing the most damage are inexperienced and see AI translations as a way to quickly increase the profile of the Igbo Wikipedia. She often finds herself having to explain at online edit-a-thons she organizes, or over email to various error-prone editors, that the results can be the exact opposite, pushing users away: “You will be discouraged and you will no longer want to visit this place. You will just abandon it and go back to the English Wikipedia.”  

These fears are echoed by Noah Ha‘alilio Solomon, an assistant professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawai‘i. He reports that some 35% of words on some pages in the Hawaiian Wikipedia are incomprehensible. “If this is the Hawaiian that is going to exist online, then it will do more harm than anything else,” he says. 

Hawaiian, which was teetering on the verge of extinction several decades ago, has been undergoing a recovery effort led by Indigenous activists and academics. Seeing such poor Hawaiian on such a widely used platform as Wikipedia is upsetting to Ha‘alilio Solomon. 

“It is painful, because it reminds us of all the times that our culture and language has been appropriated,” he says. “We have been fighting tooth and nail in an uphill climb for language revitalization. There is nothing easy about that, and this can add extra impediments. People are going to think that this is an accurate representation of the Hawaiian language.” 

The consequences of all these Wikipedia errors can quickly become clear. AI translators that have undoubtedly ingested these pages in their training data are now assisting in the production, for instance, of error-strewn AI-generated books aimed at learners of languages as diverse as Inuktitut and Cree, Indigenous languages spoken in Canada, and Manx, a small Celtic language spoken on the Isle of Man. Many of these have been popping up for sale on Amazon. “It was just complete nonsense,” says Richard Compton, a linguist at the University of Quebec in Montreal, of a volume he reviewed that had purported to be an introductory phrasebook for Inuktitut. 

Rather than making minority languages more accessible, AI is now creating an ever expanding minefield for students and speakers of those languages to navigate. “It is a slap in the face,” Compton says. He worries that younger generations in Canada, hoping to learn languages in communities that have fought uphill battles against discrimination to pass on their heritage, might turn to online tools such as ChatGPT or phrasebooks on Amazon and simply make matters worse. “It is fraud,” he says.

According to UNESCO, a language is declared extinct every two weeks. But whether the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, has an obligation to the languages used on its platform is an open question. When I spoke to Runa Bhattacharjee, a senior director at the foundation, she said that it was up to the individual communities to make decisions about what content they wanted to exist on their Wikipedia. “Ultimately, the responsibility really lies with the community to see that there is no vandalism or unwanted activity, whether through machine translation or other means,” she said. Usually, Bhattacharjee added, editions were considered for closure only if a specific complaint was raised about them. 

But if there is no active community, how can an edition be fixed or even have a complaint raised? 

Bhattacharjee explained that the Wikimedia Foundation sees its role in such cases as about maintaining the Wikipedia platform in case someone comes along to revive it: “It is the space that we provide for them to grow and develop. That is where we are at.”   

Inari Saami, spoken in a single remote community in northern Finland, is a poster child for how people can take good advantage of Wikipedia. The language was headed toward extinction four decades ago; there were only four children who spoke it. Their parents created the Inari Saami Language Association in a last-ditch bid to keep it going. The efforts worked. There are now several hundred speakers, schools that use Inari Saami as a medium of instruction, and 6,400 Wikipedia articles in the language, each one copy-edited by a fluent speaker. 

This success highlights how Wikipedia can indeed provide small and determined communities with a unique vehicle to promote their languages' preservation. “We don't care about quantity. We care about quality,” says Fabrizio Brecciaroli, a member of the Inari Saami Language Association. “We are planning to use Wikipedia as a repository for the written language. We need to provide tools that can be used by the younger generations. It is important for them to be able to use Inari Saami digitally.” 

Spatial Speech Translation addresses one of automatic translation's biggest challenges: lots of people speaking at the same time.

This has been such a success that Wikipedia has been integrated into the curriculum at the Inari Saami–speaking schools, Brecciaroli adds. He fields phone calls from teachers asking him to write up simple pages on topics from tornadoes to Saami folklore. Wikipedia has even offered a way to introduce words into Inari Saami. “We have to make up new words all the time,” Brecciaroli says. “Young people need them to speak about sports, politics, and video games. If they are unsure how to say something, they now check Wikipedia.”

Wikipedia is a monumental intellectual experiment. What's happening with Inari Saami suggests that with maximum care, it can work in smaller languages. “The ultimate goal is to make sure that Inari Saami survives,” Brecciaroli says. “It might be a good thing that there isn't a Google Translate in Inari Saami.” 

That may be true—though large language models like ChatGPT can be made to translate phrases into languages that more traditional machine translation tools do not offer. Brecciaroli told me that ChatGPT isn't great in Inari Saami but that the quality varies significantly depending on what you ask it to do; if you ask it a question in the language, then the answer will be filled with words from Finnish and even words it invents. But if you ask it something in English, Finnish, or Italian and then ask it to reply in Inari Saami, it will perform better. 

In light of all this, creating as much high-quality content online as can possibly be written becomes a race against time. “ChatGPT only needs a lot of words,” Brecciaroli says. “If we keep putting good material in, then sooner or later, we will get something out. That is the hope.” This is an idea supported by multiple linguists I spoke with—that it may be possible to end the “garbage in, garbage out” cycle. (OpenAI, which operates ChatGPT, did not respond to a request for comment.)

Still, the overall problem is likely to grow and grow, since many languages are not as lucky as Inari Saami—and their AI translators will most likely be trained on more and more AI slop. Wehr, unfortunately, seems far less optimistic about the future of his beloved Greenlandic. 

Since deleting much of the Greenlandic-language Wikipedia, he has spent years trying to recruit speakers to help him revive it. He has appeared in Greenlandic media and made social media appeals. But he hasn't gotten much of a response; he says it has been demoralizing. 

“There is nobody in Greenland who is interested in this, or who wants to contribute,” he says. “There is completely no point in it, and that is why it should be closed.” 

Late last year, he began a process requesting that the Wikipedia Language Committee shut down the Greenlandic-language edition. Months of bitter debate followed between dozens of Wikipedia bureaucrats; some seemed to be surprised that a superficially healthy-seeming edition could be gripped by so many problems. 

Then, earlier this month, Wehr's proposal was accepted: Greenlandic Wikipedia is set to be shuttered, and any articles that remain will be moved into the Wikipedia Incubator, where new language editions are tested and built. Among the reasons cited by the Language Committee is the use of AI tools, which have “frequently produced nonsense that could misrepresent the language.”   

Nevertheless, it may be too late—mistakes in Greenlandic already seem to have become embedded in machine translators. If you prompt either Google Translate or ChatGPT to do something as simple as count to 10 in proper Greenlandic, neither program can deliver.

Raspberry Pi has been a bit quiet after a packed 2024, which saw multiple products and SKUs released on a weekly basis. The Raspberry Pi 500 was one of those products, and it received an Editor's Choice award despite the omission of a PCIe-based storage. Yes, there was space, and yes, the silkscreen had the layout for it, but it was never added to the 500. This led to other Pi community members and me theorizing that a future model would feature PCIe-based storage. It turns out that we were correct, and here we have the Raspberry Pi 500+.

Straight off the mark, the price is $200 (approximately £180). The price of a low-spec laptop, essentially. For the price, we get the same System on Chip (SoC) as the Raspberry Pi 500 and Pi 5, but we also get 16GB of RAM and a 256GB NVMe SSD, not to mention a mechanical keyboard. If you want the Raspberry Pi 500+ as part of a getting started kit, then for $220 (£200) you can pick up the Raspberry Pi 500+ Desktop Kit which comes with a branded mouse, USB-C power supply, official HDMI cable and the Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide. For the review, I have just the Raspberry Pi 500+.

Is the Raspberry Pi 500+ worth $200, and does it warrant an upgrade over the original Pi 500? Let's find out!

The dominant aesthetic of the Raspberry Pi 500+ is the keyboard. It looks stunning, and the layout is similar to my daily driver, a Keychron K2. Under the keycaps, we have Gateron Blue KS-33 low-profile switches, and as a lover of clicky keys, they please me greatly. This is a keyboard that I could use as a daily driver. Perhaps Raspberry Pi will release the keyboard as a replacement for the official keyboard? Aside from the keyboard, the ports on the rear of the 500+ are identical to those on the 500.

The Pi 500+ and the 500 before it sport the same all-white color scheme, which is boring, but functional. It looks great on your desk, but I loved the Raspberry Pi 400's "raspberry and white" aesthetic.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ is larger than the Pi 500, both in length and height. The bottom part of the chassis is deeper, and the keyboard is longer. The height is most likely to accommodate space for the NVMe SSD, as the key switches are all located in the top section of the chassis. The length difference will be for the standard keycaps used. Yes, you can replace the keycaps if you wish. Using the included key puller, I pulled a few keys off to take a look underneath, then I threw some spare keys from my Keychron spares box on there to prove that they fit.

My pre-release unit has a quirk with the ENTER key, and Raspberry Pi assures me that this issue is not present in mass-produced units. Did I mention that the keys are RGB? Oh yes, a rainbow at your fingertips. Just press the FN and the light key to change the sequence. There are static colors (white and red), animated rainbow effects, reactive keys that shine blue or red, and an off option. The power button, a dedicated soft key introduced on the Raspberry Pi 5 and Pi 500 (the secondary function of F10 for the Pi 400), shines green when the Pi is on and red when in standby. To control the RGB LEDs, Raspberry Pi has released a config tool in the form of a Debian package, which handles all installation tasks for demos and the all-important udev rules.

The package is both a command-line tool and a Python module, which means that we can write our own code to control the LEDs. So I did, and made my usual “Disco” demo.

After a few bouts of trial and error, I managed my goal and I had something like a 1970s disco on my keyboard.

 




The keen-eyed amongst you will note that, because the Pi 500+ uses the same keyboard wedge design as its predecessors, there is no access to the CSI (Camera) / DSI (Display) connector. Looking at the PCB, there are no connections on the board. If you really need a camera, grab a USB webcam. For displays, there are two micro HDMI ports that support 4K60, so you are well catered to.

All of the previous Raspberry Pi 00 series machines have been easy to tear down, and the Pi 500+ is no exception. It has to be because we need access to the NVMe SSD. You may never upgrade the drive, but the 500+ introduces Phillips screws that secure the bottom chassis to the keyboard. The final retail kit that I received came with a spudger to leverage the plastic chassis apart. Starting at the opening just below the space bar, I slid the spudger around the seam and the clips popped open.

Initially, I could see two sections of the chassis. The bottom part contained the mainboard, which is covered by a large aluminum heatsink, with only a cutout for the NVMe SSD (note that my pre-release model has a smaller 2230 SSD than what will be included in the retail units). The other part is the custom keyboard plate, which is powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico's RP2 (RP2040) and not the newer RP2350. There is no need for the newer board, after all, the RP2040 is merely acting as a USB interface.

Also present on the mainboard is a battery connector for a real-time clock, which can be purchased separately.

 




On the left side of the mainboard is a large unpopulated area, the same as on the Pi 500. This would've been for a PoE circuit to power the Pi 500+ over an Ethernet connection, but, just like the Pi 500, it was likely cut as a trade off for cost/capability.

At a glance, the Raspberry Pi 500+ and 500 look identical; in fact, the silkscreen version numbers are the same. The only key differences on the Pi 500+ are the NVMe and moving the keyboard connector from a larger flat flex cable (FFC) to a smaller one. The RP2 is not next to the keyboard connector; instead, it is located on the keyboard PCB, which leads me to believe that RP2 performs keyboard and RGB light control.

The change from a larger to smaller FFC between these versions means that while the mainboard has the same cut-outs and screw holes, you couldn't transplant the Pi 500+ into a 500 chassis (and vice versa) without some FFC connector and RP2040 desoldering. Of course, the Internet will prove me wrong, and some enterprising maker will do this just for the heck of it. If so, hit me up!

 




Like its predecessors, the Pi 500+ has a huge aluminum heatsink to passively cool the ARM-powered SoC. This means we are almost guaranteed that the unit will run much cooler than the original Raspberry Pi 5. But we must still check. So I ran my usual test script, which records the resting temperature for one minute, then runs a stress test across all cores for five minutes before recording the resting temperature as the system calms down.

 




The Pi 500+ runs a little warmer than the Pi 500, especially at idle, where it is almost 4C warmer. Under stress, the 500+ is only 1.7C warmer than the 500. The temperature difference can be attributed to the NVMe SSD, which will generate a little more heat inside the case.

The Raspberry Pi 500+ uses a fraction less power than the Pi 500, which is interesting considering that it has an NVMe SSD inside. The reason for the lower power consumption is that the chip uses the D0 stepping, which removes “all the non-Raspberry Pi specific logic from the chip,” according to Raspberry Pi co-founder Eben Upton, while leaving it functionally identical to the previous chip.

 




The removal of non-Pi logic sees a 33% reduction in die space and was achieved by removing Ethernet and USB logic; instead, these functions are handled by the RP1 “Southbridge” instead. This is identical to the Raspberry Pi 5 2GB and 16GB models.

 




Yes, but I could only manage 2.95GHz. I say “only” because for the Pi 500, I managed 3GHz! This time, the overclock took a little more work, requiring me to tweak the voltage delta to give the CPU a little more juice. But I got there.

The overclock saw the Raspberry Pi 500+ idle at 38.9C, and then under stress, this went up to 67C. This was still way under the thermal throttle trigger point of 82C. Power consumption at idle was still 2.64 Watts, and under stress, this jumped to 9.65W.

In fact, my log showed 0x50000, which refers to under-voltage, and this was using the official Raspberry Pi 27W power supply. If you plan to overclock, grab the official 45W power supply or source a compatible GaN charger.

I tested using the included 256GB NVMe SSD, which, according to lshw, is a Samsung PM991a PCIe Gen 3 NVMe SSD. Performance was to be expected; we get extra performance when compared to the official Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT on a Raspberry Pi 5.

An additional 56MB/s when reading the contents of the SSD to /dev/null means that, in general use, we should see a slight performance improvement, but don't expect high-performance NVMe. The same is true for write speeds. We get an extra 54.95 MB/s of throughput when writing data to the drive, as per the Raspberry Pi diagnostics tool. Again, not super speedy, but for an SBC (Single Board Computer), we will take every extra we can get.

For all of you eager to know how fast the Raspberry Pi 500+ boots, well, the results are a little disappointing because booting from NVMe took 22.62 seconds, but a Raspberry Pi 500, booting from an A2/SDR104 compatible micro SD card, took just 16.36 seconds. Both Pis are running the latest firmware and bootloader. I also set the Pi 500+ to boot from NVMe first. But the Pi 500's micro SD card boot won this race!

The Pi 500+ also has a micro SD card slot, compatible with SDR104 and all previous classes of micro SD cards. In fact, it is the same unit as on the Raspberry Pi 500, but the key selling point of the Pi 500+ is NVMe storage. You could feasibly remove the NVMe SSD and replace it with an AI processing unit, booting the OS from micro SD instead. Obviously, without a dedicated camera interface, you will need to get creative and use a USB camera or video source, but it can be done.

So, how well does the micro SD card perform on the Raspberry Pi 500+? Well, it came last in my tests at 26.55 seconds, and the culprit is the new bootloader splash screen, which, despite being set to boot from micro SD, hung around far too long. In the grand scheme of things, 26 seconds is no time at all, but we have to test!

I also tested micro SD read and write using my usual tests. Reading the contents of the micro SD card to /dev/null using dd, and using the built-in Raspberry Pi diagnostics test for sequential write speeds. The results are close enough to call it even. So the earlier boot speed difference is clearly down to the bootloader screen.

 




The Pi 500+ has the same GPIO as has been standard on all models of Raspberry Pi since the B+ back in 2014. But for the 00 series units, the GPIO is horizontal, and that means to use a HAT, or for a clearer view of the GPIO, you will need a right-angled breakout board. There are boards such as Pimoroni's Flat HAT Hacker, which are cheap and easy to use. If you want to use the GPIO in a project, you will need a breakout. However, in truth, the 00 series of Raspberry Pi is not really for hardware hackers. If you want to build a project around a Pi, go for the “typical” Raspberry Pi form factor found in the Pi 4 / 5.

I did a test with my own Flat HAT Hacker board, and I can confirm that you can use the GPIO quite easily for basic electronics. If you want to use a HAT, then it may or may not work, as with the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 5, there were changes to how the GPIO is accessed. Now it is accessed via the RP1 “Southbridge” chip instead of the older means of directly accessing it via the CPU and some hacky (but ultimately working) code modules.

I then broke out a Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro, the same board that I used to teach robotics with at Picademy. This still doesn't work with the Raspberry Pi 5 series of boards, well, unless you go through multiple hoops and spend an afternoon trying to install it. This aspect of the Raspberry Pi experience still makes me sad, and I long for the days when I could just buy a HAT, drop it on my Pi, and start hacking.

 




The Raspberry Pi 500+ is basically the same as the Pi 500 but with more RAM and NVMe storage, which is great, but it comes at a cost. Who would use the Pi 500+? I can see it being a viable home PC for those that don't need an ultra-powerful PC, or as a child's first PC. In business, it could be a viable thin client. For educational purposes, it would make a suitable classroom PC.

I was eager to compare the price of a similar Raspberry Pi 5 16GB, the new M.2 compact HAT and the same 256GB NVMe SSD, so I went over to Adafruit and priced it all up.

Before shipping and taxes, the cost came to $229, and we still have a keyboard to purchase. Interestingly, a 256GB NVMe SSD is $20 more expensive than the 512GB version, so save $20, get double the storage and use that $20 to buy a keyboard!So what does this prove? Well, it shows that in both cases, going the official Raspberry Pi route will cost largely the same, but with the Pi 500+ we have it all contained in a gorgeous looking keyboard. What we lose in function (camera and display access, awkward GPIO) we gain in the form of a singular unit with a great keyboard. But, the Raspberry Pi 500+, like the 500 and 400 before it, is not a platform for electronics / robotics tinkerers. For those enthusiasts, you will need the original form factor Raspberry Pi.

For those of us that grew up during the home computer boom of the 1970s and 1980s, of which I am one, the form factor is nostalgic, and I can see some enthusiasts building their own home computer emulation systems using the Pi 500+, but, they could also do that with the $90 Raspberry Pi 500, or even the older Raspberry Pi 400. A few years ago, I managed to build a competent Commodore Amiga 1200 using my Raspberry Pi 400.

 




At $200, the Raspberry Pi 500+ is a considered purchase, which may lead some to consider buying a cheap laptop instead. You could argue that you get a computer and an electronics education platform in one package, but a cheap laptop or an Intel N100 / N150 mini PC and a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W will offer the same experience for a very similar price.

I really like the Pi 500+, the keyboard is great and it is the pinnacle of the Raspberry Pi 5 series, but the price is hard to swallow as the Raspberry Pi moves from being a cheap single board computer, into an Arm-based desktop computer.

People who suspect that their sense of smell has been dulled after a bout of COVID-19 are likely correct, a new study using an objective, 40-odor test shows. Even those who do not notice any olfactory issues may be impaired.

Led by the National Institutes of Health's RECOVER initiative and supported by its Clinical Science Core at NYU Langone Health, a team of researchers from across the country explored a link between the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and hyposmia - the reduced ability to smell.

The results revealed that 80% of participants who reported a change in their smelling ability after having COVID-19 earned low scores on a clinical scent-detection test taken about two years later. Of this group, 23% were severely impaired or had entirely lost their sense of smell.

Notably, 66% of infected participants who did not notice any smelling issues scored abnormally low on the evaluation as well, the authors say.

Our findings confirm that those with a history of COVID-19 may be especially at risk for a weakened sense of smell, an issue that is already underrecognized among the general population."

Leora Horwitz, MD, study co-lead author 

Horwitz, a professor in the Departments of Population Health and Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, adds that 60% of uninfected participants who did not report olfactory problems also tested poorly during the clinical evaluation.

Hyposmia has long been connected to weight loss, reduced quality of life, and depression, among other concerns. Those with a diminished sense of smell may also struggle to detect dangers such as spoiled food, gas leaks, and smoke, experts say. In addition, scientists have flagged smelling dysfunction as an early sign of certain neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, which can affect the brain's scent-processing region.

While past research has identified hyposmia as a symptom of coronavirus infection, most of these studies have relied on patients' own assessments of their smelling ability. Such subjective measures are not always reliable and cannot effectively track the problem's severity and persistence, notes Horwitz.

The new study in 3,535 men and women, publishing online Sept. 25 in the journal JAMA Network Open, is the largest to date to examine loss of smell after COVID-19 by using a formal test, the authors say.

Along with Horwitz, Jacqueline Becker, PhD at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York is co-lead author. Hassan Ashktorab, PhD, at Howard University in Washington, D.C.; Andrea Foulkes, ScD, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston; and Joyce Lee-Iannotti, MD, at the University of Arizona in Phoenix, are study co-senior authors.

For the investigation, the research team assessed thousands of Americans who had participated in the RECOVER adult study, a multicenter analysis designed to shed light on the long-term health effects of the coronavirus. Throughout the study, those with and without a history of COVID-19 completed surveys about their symptoms every 90 days from October 2021 through June 2025.

To measure olfactory function, the team used a clinical tool: the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). In this scratch-and-sniff evaluation, which is considered the gold standard of its kind, participants were asked to identify 40 scents by selecting the right multiple-choice option for each odor. A correct answer earned one point, and the total UPSIT score was compared with a database of thousands of healthy volunteers of the same sex and as. Based on the results, smelling ability was characterized as normal, mildly impaired, moderately impaired, severely impaired, or lost altogether.

"These results suggest that health care providers should consider testing for loss of smell as a routine part of post-COVID care," said Horwitz. "While patients may not notice right away, a dulled nose can have a profound impact on their mental and physical well-being."

Experts are now exploring ways to restore smelling ability after having COVID-19, such as vitamin A supplementation and olfactory training to "rewire" the brain's response to odors. Having a deeper understanding of how the coronavirus affects the brain's sensory and cognitive systems may help refine these therapies, notes Horwitz.

Horwitz cautions that the study team did not directly assess loss of taste, which often accompanies problems with smell. In addition, it is possible that some uninfected participants were misclassified due to the lack of universal testing for the virus. This may help explain the surprisingly high rate of hyposmia identified in those without a supposed history of COVID-19, she says.

Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants R01HL162373, U01DC019579, OT2HL161847, OT2HL161841, and OT2HL156812.

Every new life begins after a genetic shuffle. When organisms make eggs or sperm, maternal and paternal chromosomes pair up and swap pieces of DNA in a process called crossing over. This exchange is essential: without at least one swap per chromosome pair, fertility and healthy chromosome numbers are at risk. At the same time, too many swaps—or too many DNA breaks that initiate them—can harm the genome. How do cells make sure the balance is just right? A team of researchers around Joao Matos of the Max Perutz Labs publishes the answers in Nature.

The team discovered that tiny DNA structures called Holliday junctions are not just stepping-stones on the way to crossovers, as scientists long believed. Instead, they also help stabilize a zipper-like structure known as the synaptonemal complex, which holds paired chromosomes together. This stability, in turn, tells the cell to stop making further DNA breaks, protecting the genome from damage.

Our hypothesis was that Holliday junctions are more than passive DNA links. They are essential for building and maintaining the synaptonemal complex, ensuring that chromosomes stay paired until crossovers are ready to form."

Joao Matos, group leader

To test this idea, first author Adrian Henggeler turned to baker's yeast, a simple organism that scientists often use as a stand-in for human cells because it goes through meiosis in a similar way. He was able to "freeze" millions of yeast cells at the exact moment when the DNA junctions and the chromosome zipper were present, but before the swaps had taken place. By then cutting the DNA junctions using a unique molecular tool developed in the lab, he could see right away what happened next.

"One of our eureka moments was seeing the synaptonemal complex collapse in real time the instant the junctions were removed," says Adrian. "It was exactly what we had hypothesized, suddenly unfolding in front of our eyes." Without Holliday junctions, the chromosome zipper fell apart, new DNA breaks re-started forming, and meiosis could no longer proceed correctly.

"This study uncovers a simple but elegant feedback loop," says Joao. "Once crossovers and the chromosome zipper are stabilized, the cell 'knows' it can stop making breaks and move forward safely with meiosis."

The next challenge is to find out whether the same principle holds true in mammals. If it does, it could shed light on fundamental mechanisms that safeguard fertility and maintain genome stability across species.

Taking a page from the private insurance industry's playbook, the Trump administration will launch a program next year to find out how much money an artificial intelligence algorithm could save the federal government by denying care to Medicare patients.

The pilot program, designed to weed out wasteful, "low-value" services, amounts to a federal expansion of an unpopular process called prior authorization, which requires patients or someone on their medical team to seek insurance approval before proceeding with certain procedures, tests, and prescriptions. It will affect Medicare patients, and the doctors and hospitals who care for them, in Arizona, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington, starting Jan. 1 and running through 2031.

The move has raised eyebrows among politicians and policy experts. The traditional version of Medicare, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities, has mostly eschewed prior authorization. Still, it is widely used by private insurers, especially in the Medicare Advantage market.

And the timing was surprising: The pilot was announced in late June, just days after the Trump administration unveiled a voluntary effort by private health insurers to revamp and reduce their own use of prior authorization, which causes care to be "significantly delayed," said Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

"It erodes public trust in the health care system," Oz told the media. "It's something that we can't tolerate in this administration."

But some critics, like Vinay Rathi, an Ohio State University doctor and policy researcher, have accused the Trump administration of sending mixed messages.

On one hand, the federal government wants to borrow cost-cutting measures used by private insurance, he said. "On the other, it slaps them on the wrist."

Administration officials are "talking out of both sides of their mouth," said Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat. "It's hugely concerning."

Patients, doctors, and other lawmakers have also been critical of what they see as delay-or-deny tactics, which can slow down or block access to care, causing irreparable harm and even death.

“Insurance companies have put it in their mantra that they will take patients' money and then do their damnedest to deny giving it to the people who deliver care," said Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and a urologist. "That goes on in every insurance company boardroom."

Insurers have long argued that prior authorization reduces fraud and wasteful spending, as well as prevents potential harm. Public displeasure with insurance denials dominated the news in December, when the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare's CEO led many to anoint his alleged killer as a folk hero.

And the public broadly dislikes the practice: Nearly three-quarters of respondents thought prior authorization was a "major" problem in a July poll published by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Indeed, Oz said during his June press conference that "violence in the streets" prompted the Trump administration to take on the issue of prior authorization reform in the private insurance industry.

Still, the administration is expanding the use of prior authorization in Medicare. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said both initiatives "serve the same goal of protecting patients and Medicare dollars."

The pilot program, WISeR — short for “Wasteful and Inappropriate Service Reduction” — will test the use of an AI algorithm in making prior authorization decisions for some Medicare services, including skin and tissue substitutes, electrical nerve stimulator implants, and knee arthroscopy.

The federal government says such procedures are particularly vulnerable to "fraud, waste, and abuse" and could be held in check by prior authorization.

Other procedures may be added to the list. But services that are inpatient-only, emergency, or "would pose a substantial risk to patients if significantly delayed" would not be subject to the AI model's assessment, according to the federal announcement.

While the use of AI in health insurance isn't new, Medicare has been slow to adopt the private-sector tools. Medicare has historically used prior authorization in a limited way, with contractors who aren't incentivized to deny services. But experts who have studied the plan believe the federal pilot could change that.

Pons told KFF Health News that no Medicare request will be denied before being reviewed by a "qualified human clinician," and that vendors "are prohibited from compensation arrangements tied to denial rates." While the government says vendors will be rewarded for savings, Pons said multiple safeguards will “remove any incentive to deny medically appropriate care.”

"Shared savings arrangements mean that vendors financially benefit when less care is delivered," a structure that can create a powerful incentive for companies to deny medically necessary care, said Jennifer Brackeen, senior director of government affairs for the Washington State Hospital Association.

And doctors and policy experts say that's only one concern.

Rathi said the plan “is not fully fleshed out” and relies on “messy and subjective” measures. The model, he said, ultimately depends on contractors to assess their own results, a choice that makes the results potentially suspect.

"I'm not sure they know, even, how they're going to figure out whether this is helping or hurting patients,” he said.

Pons said the use of AI in the Medicare pilot will be "subject to strict oversight to ensure transparency, accountability, and alignment with Medicare rules and patient protection."

"CMS remains committed to ensuring that automated tools support, not replace, clinically sound decision-making," he said.

Experts agree that AI is theoretically capable of expediting what has been a cumbersome process marked by delays and denials that can harm patients' health. Health insurers have argued that AI eliminates human error and bias and will save the health care system money. These companies have also insisted that humans, not computers, are ultimately reviewing coverage decisions.

But some scholars are doubtful that's routinely happening.

"I think that there's also probably a little bit of ambiguity over what constitutes 'meaningful human review,'” said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

A 2023 report published by ProPublica found that, over a two-month period, doctors at Cigna who reviewed requests for payment spent an average of only 1.2 seconds on each case.

Cigna spokesperson Justine Sessions told KFF Health News that the company does not use AI to deny care or claims. The ProPublica investigation referenced a "simple software-driven process that helped accelerate payments to clinicians for common, relatively low-cost tests and treatments, and it is not powered by AI," Sessions said. "It was not used for prior authorizations."

And yet class-action lawsuits filed against major health insurers have alleged that flawed AI models undermine doctor recommendations and fail to take patients' unique needs into account, forcing some people to shoulder the financial burden of their care.

Meanwhile, a survey of physicians published by the American Medical Association in February found that 61% think AI is "increasing prior authorization denials, exacerbating avoidable patient harms and escalating unnecessary waste now and into the future."

Chris Bond, a spokesperson for the insurers' trade group AHIP, told KFF Health News that the organization is "zeroed in" on implementing the commitments made to the government. Those include reducing the scope of prior authorization and making sure that communications with patients about denials and appeals are easy to understand.

The Medicare pilot program underscores ongoing concerns about prior authorization and raises new ones.

While private health insurers have been opaque about how they use AI and the extent to which they use prior authorization, policy researchers believe these algorithms are often programmed to automatically deny high-cost care.

“The more expensive it is, the more likely it is to be denied," said Jennifer Oliva, a professor at the Maurer School of Law at Indiana University-Bloomington, whose work focuses on AI regulation and health coverage.

Oliva explained in a recent paper for the Indiana Law Journal that when a patient is expected to die within a few years, health insurers are "motivated to rely on the algorithm." As time passes and the patient or their provider is forced to appeal a denial, the chance of the patient dying during that process increases. The longer an appeal, the less likely the health insurer is to pay the claim, Oliva said.

"The No. 1 thing to do is make it very, very difficult for people to get high-cost services," she said.

As the use of AI by health insurers is poised to grow, insurance company algorithms amount to a "regulatory blind spot" and demand more scrutiny, said Carmel Shachar, a faculty director at Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation.

The WISeR pilot is "an interesting step" toward using AI to ensure that Medicare dollars are purchasing high-quality health care, she said. But the lack of details makes it difficult to determine whether it will work.

Politicians are grappling with some of the same questions.

"How is this being tested in the first place? How are you going to make sure that it is working and not denying care or producing higher rates of care denial?" asked DelBene, who signed an August letter to Oz with other Democrats demanding answers about the AI program. But Democrats aren't the only ones worried.

Murphy, who co-chairs the House GOP Doctors Caucus, acknowledged that many physicians are concerned the WISeR pilot could overreach into their practice of medicine if the AI algorithm denies doctor-recommended care.

Meanwhile, House members of both parties recently supported a measure proposed by Rep. Lois Frankel, a Florida Democrat, to block funding for the pilot in the fiscal 2026 budget of the Department of Health and Human Services.

AI in health care is here to stay, Murphy said, but it remains to be seen whether the WISeR pilot will save Medicare money or contribute to the problems already posed by prior authorization.

"This is a pilot, and I'm open to see what's going to happen with this," Murphy said, "but I will always, always err on the side that doctors know what's best for their patients."

Scientists reveal that shifting mealtimes, without any workouts, can help reshape the body as early eaters lost more weight, but late eaters boost their anerobic power.

Study: Time-Restricted Eating Without Exercise Enhances Anaerobic Power and Reduces Body Weight: A Randomized Crossover Trial in Untrained Adults. Image credit: DenisProduction.com/Shutterstock.com

Time-restricted eating (TRE) and physical exercise could enhance physical performance. A recent study in Nutrients examined the impact of TRE on endurance parameters and body weight in healthy adults without any specific exercise intervention. This is the first time a human study has directly compared delayed and early TRE in an untrained healthy group without formal exercise interventions.

TRE refers to a pattern of eating in which the day's food is consumed within a specific window. TRE, by itself, often reduces caloric intake by around 20%. Animal experiments suggest that TRE improves certain aspects of physical performance even without exercise, but human evidence remains limited and mixed.

Physical performance and metabolic fitness are typically assessed using aerobic endurance and anerobic power. These predict the general health status and the future risk of cardiometabolic disease. Anerobic power is also linked to higher odds of physical function and independence with aging.

Besides exercise strategies like aerobic or resistance exercise, or high-intensity interval training, dietary approaches like TRE also play a key role in building physical capacity. Research from both preclinical and clinical studies points to three main underlying mechanisms.

First, TRE induces regular, prolonged fasting periods, causing a metabolic shift. This forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to fatty acids and ketones, promoting metabolic flexibility. In addition, TRE has been associated with increased mitochondrial production in animal studies. Mitochondria supply more energy by breaking down fats into fatty acids and ketones. The aim is to optimize energy efficiency.

Secondly, TRE favors a synchronized biological rhythm across the body systems, since food intake is now confined to the same period across the 24-hour day. This leads to a faster response to insulin secreted after food intake. Insulin stimulates glucose removal from the blood, mainly into muscle and liver cells. Better circadian synchronization also reduces inflammation, improves skeletal muscle efficiency, and promotes cardiometabolic health, especially by avoiding late-night eating. 

Autophagy is the third pathway activated by TRE. Cell repair is prioritized instead of cell growth. This leads to removing damaged organelles, including mitochondria, and replacing them with new ones. Animal studies show this occurring in skeletal muscle (which has a high metabolic rate) in response to fasting. The outcome is improved mitochondrial quality and greater antioxidant capacity. However, the authors caution that much of this mechanistic evidence comes from animal studies, with only indirect support in humans.

TRE in overweight or obese people results in decreased body weight, improved blood cholesterol levels, and higher insulin sensitivity. However, the benefits of TRE in highly trained individuals could be modest, as they already have high metabolic fitness. It might be more helpful for untrained individuals without added exercise because they have low fitness levels. The current study used two TRE timings to understand how this affects metabolic outcomes.

The study included 28 healthy university students, on average, aged 23.4 years. Just over half were women. The participants were randomized to early vs. delayed TRE (eTRE and dTRE, respectively) for four weeks, after which there was a two-week interval. The groups were then switched for another four weeks.

The eTRE timing was between 08:00–09:00 for the first meal and 14:00–15:00 for the last meal, vs 12:00–13:00 to 18:00–19:00 for dTRE. No formal exercise routine was allowed during the study period. After each TRE phase, the body weight, aerobic endurance, and anerobic power were assessed.

Aerobic endurance refers to how long the body can sustain oxygen-fueled physical activity, typically tested by a constant-load cycling test. Anerobic peak power is the maximum force produced without oxygen in a burst of high-intensity effort, sustained for only a few seconds. It is typically tested by sprint cycling, which also allows peak power output to be measured.

The mean body weight decreased by approximately 1.6 kg after the eTRE, vs 0.61 kg in the dTRE group. Body weight decreased after both TRE phases, but by 0.95 kg more with eTRE than dTRE.

This corroborates prior research showing that early eating windows are more effective than later ones. This may be due to TRE-associated decreased calorie intake due to an absence of dinner, typically a more calorie-packed meal than breakfast. Additionally, an earlier eating window is better synchronized with the circadian rhythms of digestion and insulin sensitivity. This could reduce fat mass and lower glucose levels. However, the current study did not directly measure changes in body composition, so whether fat or lean mass contributed to the weight loss is unknown.

Aerobic endurance remained unchanged with either form of TRE, despite decreased calorie intake, and without the benefit of prior exercise training. This may reflect a more efficient utilization of energy substrates under restricted eating conditions, but with constant physical demands. This metabolic flexibility favors aerobic fitness, irrespective of the eating window.

Anerobic power increased by 21.25 W vs 35.4 W with eTRE and dTRE, respectively. Power output also increased more after dTRE than eTRE. This may be because the dTRE window correlates better with the body's neuromuscular performance rhythm, where high-intensity muscular work is best done in the afternoon or early evening.

Such gains were not previously visible in trained athletes, perhaps because they are already at the top of their form physiologically. Conversely, other research demonstrates TRE-associated metabolic adaptations that help the body regain energy after short bursts of explosive activity by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency.

The study findings demonstrate that eTRE and dTRE are associated with weight loss and increased anerobic power, while aerobic endurance was preserved rather than improved. Weight loss was greater with eTRE vs dTRE, but the opposite was true of anerobic performance gains.

Future studies should examine whether these translate into clinical gains that are sustained over the long term and are suitable for all kinds of groups.

A new study involving the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) provides strong evidence that sugary drinks affect not only metabolic but also mental health – especially in women. This effect is probably mediated by the sensitive microbiome of the intestine.

As is well known, people who regularly consume sugary drinks not only have an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. There is an increasing number of studies that are now showing that soft drinks can also affect mental health. So far, however, it was unclear whether there is a direct relation to major depressive disorder (MDD) and which biological processes might be involved. 

To answer these questions, researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort (MACS). The study examined adults between the ages of 18 and 65 who were recruited from the general population and primary care between 2014 and 2018. The researchers included a total of 932 people, 405 of whom were patients with major depression disorder and 527 were healthy controls. 

The analyses showed a correlation between soft drink consumption and both the diagnosis of depression and the severity of the symptoms. This correlation was particularly pronounced in women: Among them, high consumption was associated with a 17% higher probability of depression (odds ratio 1.167) and more severe symptoms. 

But how could the effect be conveyed? Here, too, the study provides a possible explanation: In women who regularly drank sugary soft drinks, the researchers found a significantly increased number of bacteria of the Eggerthella genus in the intestine. Earlier studies had shown that Eggerthella is more common in people with depression. The current study now provides the first convincing evidence that this bacterium possibly plays a mediating role – as a biological link between the consumption of soft drinks and the development of depressive symptoms. 

"Our data suggests that the relation between soft drinks and depressive symptoms arises via the influence of the microbiome," says study leader Dr. Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah from the University Hospital Frankfurt and the MPI for Metabolism Research Cologne, an associated partner of the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD).

Sugary drinks such as cola or lemonade not only contain glucose and fructose, but also numerous additives – including preservatives and artificial sweeteners. This combination can disturb the delicate balance in the intestinal microbiome. Inflammation-promoting bacteria are favored, while the production of protective short-chain fatty acids decreases. Animal studies show that such changes can trigger inflammatory processes in the nervous system and thus increase depressive behavior. 

It is striking that this correlation appears to be sex-related. In men who regularly consumed soft drinks, the researchers found neither an increase in Eggerthella nor a correlation with depressive symptoms. It is still unclear why this effect only occurs in women. Hormonal differences or sex-related reactions of the immune system possibly play a role. 

"The study results open up new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders," comments DZD researcher Rachel Lippert from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke (DIfE). "Microbiome-based approaches – such as targeted nutritional therapies or probiotic strategies – might help to effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in the future." 

The researchers therefore argue that the influence of nutrition on mental health should be more strongly integrated into educational campaigns, care concepts and prevention programs. 

Changes in the microbiome can be influenced by diet – and are therefore a potential therapeutic target." 

Dr. Sharmili Edwin Thanarajah, University Hospital Frankfurt 

"Even small adjustments in consumer behavior might have a big impact – especially when considering the widespread consumption of soft drinks."

A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on September 15, 2025, titled "When strokes reveal a hidden malignancy: An atypical case of metastatic colorectal cancer with extensive thromboembolism."

In this case report, Md Tanzim Ahsan from Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh (WWL) Teaching Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust and Sultana Azreen from Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, describe how a series of unexplained strokes led to the diagnosis of advanced colorectal cancer. The report shows that hidden cancers can sometimes first present through blood clots and strokes, well before any typical cancer symptoms appear. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating cancer as a possible cause of unexplained embolic events, particularly in the absence of traditional stroke risk factors. 

"Although symptoms raised initial suspicion for vasculitis or autoimmune etiologies due to limb swelling and headache, he did not report associated visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, or neurological deficits."

The patient, a 71-year-old man, was admitted to the hospital with swelling in his left arm, headache, and non-specific neurological symptoms. Over the following weeks, he suffered multiple strokes affecting different areas of the brain, as well as blood clots in his veins, lungs, kidneys, and spleen. Clinicians initially suspected autoimmune conditions or infection. However, imaging and blood exams revealed signs of cancer. A biopsy of an enlarged lymph node confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer that had silently spread throughout the body.

The patient had no typical symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as weight loss, digestive issues, or changes in appetite. Because of this, the cancer remained undetected until widespread blood clot complications appeared. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, the care team transitioned the patient to palliative care, as the disease was too advanced for curative treatment.

This case illustrates a serious but often underrecognized condition known as Trousseau's syndrome, or cancer-associated stroke. It occurs when cancer causes abnormal blood clotting, leading to clots throughout the body. Unlike strokes caused by heart conditions, cancer-related strokes often involve multiple brain regions and lack clear cardiac causes. Elevated blood clotting markers, such as D-dimer, can serve as potential indicators of hidden malignancy in such patients.

The findings underscore the growing awareness that cancer may present in subtle, non-specific ways, sometimes through neurological or vascular symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to maintain a high level of suspicion when evaluating patients with unexplained strokes, especially when imaging reveals multiple infarcts or embolic patterns without an identifiable source.

The authors call for the development of clearer clinical guidelines to help healthcare providers recognize and screen for underlying cancers in stroke patients without obvious risk factors. As cancer rates continue to rise worldwide, early recognition of indirect warning signs, such as abnormal clotting, may allow earlier detection and improve patient outcomes.

A recent study links exposure to radiation from medical imaging to a small-but-significant risk of blood cancers among children and adolescents. 

But do not panic. The study concludes the benefits of medical imaging outweigh the minimal risks. 

Funded by the National Cancer Institute, the study will help medical personnel make informed decisions about using imaging on children. The study concluded that while ionizing radiation is a carcinogen, the benefit-to-risk ratio favors CT imaging of children when imaging is justified and the technique minimizes adverse effects. 

The paper, "Medical Imaging and Pediatric and Adolescent Hematologic Cancer Risk," was published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. For his part of the study, Bolch used virtual patient anatomic models to reconstruct bone marrow doses in more than 3.7 million children who underwent CT imaging between 1996 to 2016. 

"We used a library of 3D anatomic whole-body computerized patient models developed in the early 2010s under a contract with the National Cancer Institute," said Wesley Bolch, Ph.D., a distinguished professor in biomedical and radiological engineering with the University of Florida's J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering. 

In Bolch's Advanced Laboratory for Radiation Dosimetry Studies, researchers developed hundreds of models representative of U.S. adults and children across all combinations of ages, heights and weights. 

"We call this an organ dose reconstruction," said Bolch, who is also a member of the UF Health Cancer Center. 

The study is unique because it directly measures leukemia risks in these pediatric patients. Previously, researchers used established cancer-risk models, many of which were based on data from the atomic bomb survivors in 1945 Japan. Needless to say, Bolch noted, diagnostic X-ray exposures are vastly different from atomic weapon radiation fields. 

This is the very first study of its kind in the U.S. and Canada, and the very first study of cancer risks in children undergoing medical imaging where each patient was considered in a unique manner regarding their sex, body size and medical imaging exposure technique factors."

Wesley Bolch, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor, Biomedical and Radiological Engineering, University of Florida 

While CT imaging contributes a greater fraction of total radiation, doses from nuclear medicine, radiography and fluoroscopy were also included for bone marrow-dose calculations. 

"Dr. Bolch's role in this landmark study highlights UF BME's leadership in making medical imaging safer for children. It demonstrates UF's dedication to research that safeguards patients and informs global healthcare practices," said BME chair Cherie Stabler, Ph.D. 

In the study, the highest CT doses to bone marrow were seen in head-and-neck imaging, where the average dose was 30.8 milligray (a unit measuring ionizing radiation deposited in tissue). CT imaging of the head – one of the more common pediatric CT scans – showed an average dose of 13.7 milligray. 

The incidence of hematologic cancers by age 21 years was 0.3% among those children exposed to bone marrow doses more than 30 milligray. However, fewer than 1% of the 3.7 million children in this study had cumulative doses exceeding 30 milligray. 

Plus, CT imaging doses today are much lower, and imaging systems are much faster than in the late-1990s and early-2000s. 

This research comes 25 years after a Columbia University research paper made the link between leukemia and some radiology scans, thus scaring "every mother in this country," Bolch said. 

The key issue in that study showed imaging technologists and radiologists were not making adjustments to X-ray techniques that explicitly considered the size of the patient. 

"Consider that you've just imaged an obese a male with a high-intensity and high energy X-ray beam, and now a petite 7-year-old girl becomes the next patient to be imaged. In the late 1990s, very few clinics would adjust the X-ray energies and intensities from the previous adult patient. In this case, the girl received a much larger amount of imaging than was really needed to form a diagnostic-quality image," Bolch said. "This paper scared a lot of people, but it really was a great service because it says, 'Oh, we're doing this wrong.'" 

Starting in the early 2000s, physicians adjusted the energy and intensities of the X-ray beam based on the size of the patient. CT system manufacturers, Bolch said, also made technological improvements to lower patient CT doses. 

The paper's lead authors are radiologist and epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman, M.D., from the University of California, San Francisco, and biostatistician Diana Miglioretti, Ph.D., from UC, Davis. 

"Their work involved collecting and organizing the medical records that showed what imaging exams were performed on the children, when they occurred, how they were acquired and what modality was used – CT, radiography, nuclear medicine or fluoroscopy," Bolch said. 

They also led the team that linked these patients to cancer registries that indicated which patients later developed bone marrow cancers. 

"This is where my laboratory came in," Bolch said. "We ran computer simulations of these imaging procedures to provide estimates of bone marrow radiation doses for each child, for each form of medical imaging and for each imaging examination. 

"Everybody went into action to figure out what is the appropriate lowest dose of radiation that would give us a good image. These risks are low, and when justified by the imaging physician, patient benefits, such as disease detection, will greatly outweigh these very small risks."

A population-based study in Northern Sweden challenges assumptions about pollution and cellular aging, uncovering an unexpected signal of longer telomeres in patients with dementia that warrants further research.

Associations between air pollution and subsequent risk of dementia are growing clinical concerns, but remain understudied. The biological underpinnings of these associations are especially unclear. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers explored one hypothesized pathway involving telomeres (that shorten with age) by analyzing data from 473 older adults from Northern Sweden who had complete information on air pollution exposure, telomere length, and covariates.

Study findings did not reveal an overall association between exposure to air pollution and telomere length. However, study analyses highlight a slight, statistically nonsignificant trend suggesting that individuals who later developed dementia had longer telomeres, despite higher exposure to pollution, a counterintuitive finding that warrants further investigation.

Telomeres are segments of DNA at the ends of our chromosomes that protect the underlying genetic material from degradation, external damage, and fusion. With each cell division, these telomeres naturally shorten, making telomeres a well-established hallmark of biological aging.

Recent research suggests that environmental factors (particularly pollutants) can accelerate this shortening process. Air pollution, a well-studied driver of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, is hypothesized as a prime suspect. Evidence is mixed on whether long-term air-pollution exposure shortens telomeres, with some studies reporting no association or even longer telomeres.

Simultaneously, decades of research have now conclusively linked telomere length (shorter is worse) to a variety of age-related chronic diseases, including dementia. Dementia is an umbrella term for several neurological conditions characterized by significant cognitive decline and memory loss, substantially hampering patients' daily lives.

In today's rapidly aging society, identifying the mechanistic underpinnings of risk factors (such as air pollution) linked to age-associated chronic disease (like dementia) prevalence and risk could help delay symptom progression in the more than 57 million patients living with the condition, and the millions more likely to develop dementia in the near future. Unfortunately, mechanistic evidence for the association between air pollution and dementia remains limited, as previous studies have failed to explicitly test the relationship between these variables.

The present study leveraged data from the Betula project, a long-running, population-based cohort focused on aging and dementia in Northern Sweden. Researchers collated two different time waves (T1 and T2 out of the seven total waves of the Betula study) collected in five-year intervals between 1988 and 1995.

Data collections at each wave comprised health-related questionnaires, cognitive evaluations, and medical examinations (including blood collections). Notably, air-quality data for the locations of study participants were also available.

Blood samples were used for relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL) measurements via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Air pollution exposure was assessed using a high-resolution dispersion model to estimate the annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) and black carbon (BC) at each participant's home address in 1990, including source-specific estimates for vehicle exhaust and residential wood burning.

Analysis further included linear regression models to investigate the association between these pollution levels and telomere length, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, lymphocyte proportion, and education. Subgroup analysis tested whether the relationship differed in the 74 participants who were later diagnosed with dementia.

Linear regression analyses failed to demonstrate any significant associations between air pollution exposure (either PM₂.₅ or BC) and shorter telomeres. For total PM₂.₅ exposure, the beta coefficient (β, measure of relative leukocyte telomere length) was recorded at 0.01 (95% CI: -0.011, 0.024), indicating a negligible effect. Total BC was similarly negligible at 0.03 (95% CI: −0.046, 0.114).

However, subgroup analyses revealed a more complex, unexpected, and currently unexplained trend: a slight positive association between pollution exposure and telomere length.

While not statistically significant, these findings mean that among future dementia patients, those exposed to higher levels of air pollution tended to have longer, not shorter, telomeres. For example, this subgroup's beta coefficient for total PM₂.₅ exposure was 0.03 (p-value = 0.12), and for total BC, it was 0.11 (p-value = 0.17). Effect-modification interaction terms were not significant.

This study, conducted in a low-pollution region of Northern Sweden, failed to validate the prevailing hypothesis that links air pollution to shorter telomere length (accelerated cellular aging) and, in turn, higher dementia risk. Instead, an unexpected and counterintuitive trend was observed in the dementia subgroup: higher air pollution exposure was linked to longer telomeres in participants who later developed dementia. These exploratory signals were imprecise and not statistically significant, necessitating further research to explain this observation.

A study from the Medical University of South Carolina, published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, reveals that shorter storage durations of donor human milk are linked to reduced gastrointestinal complicatoins in premature infants, including necrotizing enterocolitis. These findings suggestt that minimizing milk storage time may help to preserve protective properties crucial for preterm gut health, offering new insights into neonatal nutrition practices and improving outcomes for vulnerable newborns.

Odds are that when you go to the supermarket, you check each product you pick up for its "best by" date, ensuring that you have the freshest, healthiest food to bring home for you and your family. An MUSC study published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition has found that those little best by dates for a particularly precious resource – donor human milk – have huge implications for the gastrointestinal health of very premature infants.

"Our results showed that babies weren't as protected with the use of donor milk that was stored for a longer time as with donor milk that was stored for shorter periods of time," said physician-scientist Katherine E. Chetta, M.D., who led the study. Chetta's research program is focused on the science of breast milk, nutrition and intestinal rehabilitation.

Donor human milk is a vital substance, given to almost all preterm babies, especially if their own mother's milk is unavailable, in short supply or otherwise unsafe. It can also reduce complications associated with formula, while supporting immune function, digestion and infants with specific medical conditions, such as low blood sugar, congenital heart disease and immunologic deficiencies.

Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of using donor milk is to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, as it's often referred to in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), where most pre-term babies are cared for. NEC is a very serious inflammatory disease that affects mostly preemies and can lead to bowel tissue dying. It requires medication and often surgery and can lead to lifelong complications.

Although doctors and scientists have not yet identified the sole cause of NEC, they do have some ideas about several factors that, together, can cause injury to the premature gut, allowing bacteria in and creating inflammation.

As a neonatologist at the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital, Chetta has long dealt with the devastating effects of NEC in her patients. "It's one of those key benchmark diseases that all NICUs are constantly trying to decrease," she said.

As a physician-scientist, Chetta collaborates closely with the nutrition management center or "milk room," where the donor milk is stored. Based on previous studies and detailed analysis of the milk, Chetta and her team knew that longer storage times mean a breakdown in the action and efficacy of specific milk components. Chetta wondered whether aging milk is less protective against the development of NEC than fresher milk.

To determine the answer, she reviewed the medical records of 262 very-low-birth-weight, less than 3.3 pounds, infants who were provided donor milk in the NICU at the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital between February 2022 and January 2024. Of those premature babies, 226 remained free of disease while 36 developed NEC or another gut disease called spontaneous perforation, which also causes tremendous damage to intestinal tissue. The South Carolina Clinical & Translational Research Institute, a Clinical and Translational Science Awards hub with an academic home at MUSC, provided statistical support for the .

Chetta's findings revealed that every additional day of storage increased the risk of NEC in very-low-birth-weight preemies by 3.7%. The sweet spot for frozen milk storage was approximately 240 days for the tiniest infants. Laboratory results showed that, over time, certain milk components degrade even while in frozen storage.

When preemies are on the edge of viability, and extremely low birth weight, that's when they seem to be the most susceptible to the effects of storage and can be most protected by having fresher milk. In short, for preemies: "Fresh milk is the best."

Katherine E. Chetta, M.D., physician-scientist 

Currently, the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both advise that frozen milk can be stored safely for up to a year for all babies. Based on this study, Chetta and her team believe that these guidelines need to be reevaluated, especially regarding critically ill babies. Still, this laboratory finding has already influenced clinical practice in Chetta's NICU.

"We're so convinced that we need a little bit fresher that we're already doing it just to be on the safer side," said Chetta, of feeding high-risk, premature infants the freshest milk possible based on the study results. "That's how much we believe in it."

The practical application of this finding doesn't mean discarding or wasting milk that is considered not quite as fresh but, rather, using fresh milk more quickly and optimizing freezing and storage procedures so that the sickest and youngest babies can have the freshest milk. To achieve these goals, Chetta worked closely with the Mother's Milk Bank of South Carolina and others involved in the handling of human milk.

Based on her experience, she can offer some simple, easy-to-follow advice: "Other NICUs could talk to their own milk banks about bringing this milk in a little bit quicker from donor depot sites, as we did." Chetta said it really is as simple as that. "We didn't have to change much. We were just refocused on trying to get it under that threshold of 240 days."

While this is still very new information, Chetta and her team have high hopes for its impact in the not-so-distant future. "I think improving outcomes can be expanded very rapidly once people start verifying some of the findings we have," she said. "From a policy standpoint, it could be a quick change. I hope the use of fresher milk will make a difference in the lives of the youngest babies. I think it will."

National team and club sides may face suspension

Next Uefa international break begins on 6 October

Uefa could decide as early as next week whether to suspend Israel from its competitions, with the governing body facing growing pressure from inside and outside the game.

Reports on Thursday, initially in the Times, suggested a vote that would determine Israel's ­participation in World Cup qualifying and that of ­Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League could be held by Uefa's ­executive committee before the ­international break begins on 6 October.

Uefa said no meetings were ­scheduled for next week, with the next exco gathering due on 3 ­December. But sources inside national ­federations said events appeared to be coming to a head and that Uefa and its ­president, A­leksander Ceferin, were ­increasingly expected to take action.

There have been an ­increasing number of interventions away from the game. On Tuesday, a group of ­senior diplomats called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the ­publication of a report by the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry that found Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Last week, the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York's Times Square to call for federations to boycott any matches with the country.

It is understood that voices within the game have also been speaking up in private, including those from the club world.

Italy is one of the countries under pressure to act. The Azzurri, along with Norway, are due to face Israel in the next round of ­qualifiers, with their match scheduled for 14 ­October in Udine. Italy is fresh from a 24-hour general strike in protest against ­Israel's behaviour in Gaza.

Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said this week that any boycott “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. He also said he “denounced” the suffering in Gaza and that “there is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain”.

Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote by the 19 members of Uefa's exco. Insiders suggest if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of ­passing with as few as three or four abstentions or votes against. It could, however, have considerable political consequences.

The United States government, for example, has warned it would stand against any such decision, with the country co-hosting the World Cup next summer. “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup,” a spokesperson for the US Department of State told Sky News.

Any suspension would mean Uefa removing a participant from a Fifa-organised competition. Fifa, under its president, Gianni Infantino, has developed a strong relationship with the Trump ­administration.

The global governing body is ­investigating ­allegations of teams staging matches in illegal ­settlements in the West Bank, a review that ­follows a request by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) in 2024.

On Thursday, Jibril Rajoub, the PFA president, said he will meet Ceferin and Kirsty Coventry, the president of the International Olympic Committee, to discuss the issue next week. “I believe that Israelis should not be allowed to participate in any matches, whether they are Uefa- or Fifa-regulated,” he told TV2 in Norway. “Israel has violated principles, values and Fifa's statutes. Therefore, I believe that Israel should be sanctioned. I hope Uefa will follow the spirit of the statutes.”

In cycling, the Canadian sponsor of the Israel-Premier Tech team has called a name change. Its riders were targeted by protesters at the recent Vuelta a España, causing ­disruption to the Grand Tour event. It was estimated more than 100,000 people were on the streets in Madrid during the final stage, with protesters criticising the presence of the Israel Premier Tech team. In a statement reported by Radio ­Canada, Premier Tech said: “The current situation regarding the team name is no longer sustainable to achieve our goal.”

Liverpool have confirmed that rising star Rio Ngumoha has signed his first professional contract with the club. The forward swapped Chelsea for the Reds a year ago and has enjoyed a rapid rise at the Premier League champions. The 17-year-old grabbed the headlines with his 100th-minute winner against Newcastle United earlier this season and now he has put pen to paper on a new deal.

The United States government says it will fight international calls for Israel to be banned from the 2026 World Cup, while Europe's governing soccer body is moving toward a vote to suspend Israel, the Associated Press reports.

Israel's men's national team currently sits third in its UEFA World Cup qualifying table with the group winner securing a spot in next summer's World Cup and the runner-up advancing to qualification playoffs. The next round of qualifiers is coming up in October, with Israel slated to face group-leader Norway and second-place Italy on the road.

Calls have intensified to ban Israeli teams banned from international competitions – the same way Russia was following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – in the weeks since a United Nations inquiry concluded that Israel has committed genocide in its war on Gaza since being attacked on Oct. 7, 2023.

Spain's prime minister Pedro Sánchez expliticly expressed support for such a suspension, stating that "Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image."

The majority of the 20-member UEFA executive committee is "expected to support any vote in favor of suspending Israeli teams from international play," according to the Associated Press report. A ban could end the country's hopes of qualifying for its first World Cup since 1970, the only time Israel has reached the tournament.

Pressure is also being exerted on FIFA, world soccer's governing body, to institute a ban of its own on Israel – but the U.S. State Department told multiple outlets that "we will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup."

FIFA president Gianni Infantino has formed a close relationship with American President Donald Trump as the U.S. gets set to co-host the 2026 World Cup with Canada and Mexico. Trump and the State Department hold significant leverage over FIFA as the host nation with the power to process visas for hundreds of thousands of fans, players and officials coming from all over the world.

“Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual,” the UN experts said in a statement. “Sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.”

Neatly two years into the war, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel is currently ramping up its assault on Gaza City.

Israel has rejected all claims that it is committing genocide in Gaza. The Israeli football association told Reuters earlier in September that calls for the country to face consequences from soccer's governing bodies "feel like sickening anti-Semitism."

World Cup

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it will work to keep Israel from being banned from the 2026 men's World Cup.

Israel's participation in global soccer has been questioned in the past week, with the United Nations calling on FIFA and UEFA, the respective governing bodies of world and European soccer, to suspend the nation from their competitions.

A State Department spokesperson told The Athletic: “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup.”

Israel's national and club teams have continued to participate in FIFA and UEFA competitions throughout the conflict in Gaza, which began with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. Israel is in the middle of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign and is third in its group of five as it bids to reach next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The draw for the World Cup will be made in Washington D.C. on Dec. 5.

It is unclear if U.S. officials have already pressured UEFA or FIFA to not ban Israel. When asked by The Athletic to clarify, the State Department spokesperson declined to comment further.

The UN's statement on Tuesday called for the suspension of Israel from international competition due to what it described as an “unfolding genocide” in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.

UEFA competition matches have not taken place in Israel since the 2023 attacks, in which 1,100 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.

More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza following Israel's ground invasion, according to local health officials.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed on Sunday that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood — a move with which President Trump said he disagreed. France announced its recognition of the state of Palestine on Monday.

On Tuesday, four members of the United Nations human rights council — independent human rights experts who are not employed by the UN or any government  — called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer in response to the conflict in Gaza.

The human rights experts released their statement following an investigation into alleged violations of humanitarian and human rights law during the Israel-Gaza war. The UN's commission of inquiry concluded that “the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip” — crimes under international law.

Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC earlier this month that it rejected the report and described it as “distorted and false.”

The report was published on Sept. 16 and the human rights experts released a statement on Tuesday, arguing that “sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.”

“We are clear that the boycott must be addressed to the State of Israel and not to individual players,” they said. “We have always maintained that individuals cannot bear the consequences of the decisions their government makes, so there should be no discrimination or sanctions against individual players because of their origin or nationality.

“National teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can and should be suspended, as has happened in the past (Russia is currently banned from global soccer due to the ongoing war in Ukraine).

“We urge FIFA to stop legitimising the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. There is a legal and moral imperative to take every measure possible to end the genocide in Gaza now.”

When approached by The Athletic regarding the UN's statement on Wednesday, FIFA and UEFA declined to comment.

In April 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) asked FIFA to suspend Israel from competition in a submission made before FIFA's 74th annual congress.

PFA president Jibril Rajoub spoke at the congress, calling on FIFA “to stand on the right side of history” and asking whether FIFA considers “some wars to be more important than others and some victims to be more significant.” An Israel Football Association (IFA) spokesperson had described the attempt to suspend the country as “nothing but a cynical and shameless move.”

FIFA did not suspend Israel but opened two investigations into alleged breaches of its statutes by Israeli football teams and authorities. The first was into whether teams from Israeli settlements in the West Bank competing in national Israeli competitions represent a breach of the FIFA statutes, and the second investigated allegations of discrimination by the IFA. The PFA has accused FIFA of failing to provide “clarity or due process” with as yet no conclusion to the investigations.

The PFA again called for Israel's suspension at the 75th FIFA Congress in May. “Our issue, sadly again, is stuck in a highly politicized bureaucratic holding pattern,” said Susan Shalabi, vice president of the PFA.

In September, an IFA spokesperson said he was surprised Israel had yet to be suspended from international football.

“I'm surprised we're still part of international tournaments. In many aspects, this is a miracle,” Shlomi Barzel, head of the IFA's public relations department, told Israeli newspaper The Globes. “The miracle can be explained by action on our part and a lot of tolerance on the part of FIFA and UEFA, but historically countries have been suspended for much less than that.”

Israel has been a member of the European confederation UEFA since 1994.

Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and won the 1964 Asian Cup. They were later excluded from AFC competitions in 1974 following a vote after a number of teams refused to play against them.

Israel now participates in the European section for qualification to the World Cup. While it has never qualified for the European Championship — the continental competition UEFA runs every four years — it reached the play-offs for Euro 2020 and Euro 2024.

Domestic Israeli teams also participate in UEFA club competitions, with Maccabi Tel Aviv competing in the league phase of this season's Europa League.

UEFA confirmed in October 2024 that no matches would take place in Israel “until further notice” in response to the Israel-Gaza war. The national team and club sides have played “home” UEFA competition fixtures elsewhere, including in Hungary, Cyprus and Poland.

UEFA's 55 member associations are meeting today (Thursday) at a regular gathering, although the issue of Israel's participation is not on the agenda. UEFA's next meeting of its 20-strong executive committee, the organisation's main decision-making body, is scheduled for Dec. 3, but president Aleksander Ceferin could call one sooner than that. Slovenia, where Ceferin is from, issued sanctions against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.

Israel is due to play Norway and Italy away in World Cup qualifiers next month. Norway has already said it will donate the proceeds from the game to the Doctors Without Borders charity working in Gaza.

Comparisons have been made between the situations of Russia and Israel, with former Manchester United player and France international Eric Cantona calling it “a double standard” for Israel to remain a part of international soccer, via The Telegraph.

After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, FIFA suspended it from competing in international matches on Feb. 28.

Russia's men's team had been due to play Poland in a World Cup play-off in March 2022, with the winner scheduled to face either Sweden or Czech Republic. All three teams had said they would refuse to play against a Russian side. It was later confirmed that Russia would not participate in the women's European Championship in 2022.

Russian clubs were also suspended from European competition by UEFA.

UEFA and FIFA had announced plans in September 2023 to allow Russia's under-17 teams to participate in their competitions. However, UEFA backtracked in October.

Should Israel be banned by FIFA and UEFA, this would prevent the national team from competing in competitions organised by the two governing bodies.

At international level, this would cover the World Cup, with the 2026 men's iteration taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Israel is in a qualification group alongside Norway, Italy, Estonia and Moldova, and has played five of eight qualifying matches. Israel sits third, level on points with Italy. The top team from each UEFA group qualifies automatically for the World Cup, while the second-place team advances to a playoff round.

The ban would also include the women's World Cup — a competition Israel has never qualified for. The European qualifying draw for the 2027 World Cup takes place in November.

A ban would also include UEFA international competitions: the men's and women's European Championships and Nations Leagues.

At club level, this would cover the men's and women's Champions League, the Europa League and Conference League. Maccabi Tel Aviv is the only Israeli team competing across the three competitions this season. Maccabi Tel Aviv is in the Europa League and is scheduled to play GNK Dinamo, Midtjylland, Aston Villa, Lyon, Stuttgart, Freiburg and Bologna during the league phase.

            The mascots for the 2026 World Cup have been unveiled with Clutch the Bald Eagle, Maple the Moose and Zayu the Jaguar representing the three host nations at next year's tournament.
    


            “Maple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement released Thursday.
    


            FIFA says the three mascots all represent part of their respective country's culture.
    


            “Maple the Moose was born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture,” Thursday's release said.
    


            Zayu hails from southern Mexico's jungles and represents the nation's rich heritage.
    


            “Zayu embraces Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. More than an athlete, Zayu is a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride.”
    


            Flying over the United States, Clutch embraces “every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism.”
    


            The three mascots are also footballers in their own right.
    


            Maple is the goalkeeper of the trio, Zayu is a striker known for their “exceptional ingenuity and agility”, with Clutch knitting it all together in midfield.
    


            According to FIFA, the mascots are “coming together to symbolize unity, diversity and the shared passion for the beautiful game.”
    


            The opening match of the 2026 World Cup is set to kick off in Mexico City at the Estadio Azteca on June 11, 2026. The final is scheduled to be played a little over a month later, near New York City, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.
    


            The final will include a halftime show for the very first time.
    


            The schedule will consist of 104 matches, as the tournament has been expanded to include 48 national teams, up from 32.

We break down the USMNT's record by confederation to see which region gives them the most success…and trouble.

The United States Men's National Team has had a complicated history at the World Cup. From appearing in the very first World Cup in 1930 to their 40 year drought to the modern era, they have had some ups and downs when playing in the world's biggest tournament.

A lot of a team's success at a World Cup can hinge on how they fare against the teams in their group. Whether you're in a so-called Group of Death or you're placed in a group that an opponent's fans consider to be “EASY,” the USMNT has had to claw and scrap in just about every World Cup they've been in. And, against the best teams in the world, their record hasn't been great.

But, when you break down the USMNT's World Cup record by confederation, we get a further glimpse at which teams they may hit a bit above their batting average and where they fall flat. We take a look at the USMNT's record by confederation at the World Cup compared to how they've done all-time against teams from that region.

UEFA - 3W-14L-7D, 16 group stage points (27% win rate)

Starting with UEFA makes sense because at a World Cup, it's normally guaranteed that you have at least 1 team from Europe in your group. With 16 teams at the 2026 World Cup, UEFA will have 8 groups with 1 team and 4 groups with 2 teams. For the USMNT, it feels almost certain that they will be in a group that contains 2 teams from UEFA. The only times the USMNT were in a group that did not have 2 UEFA teams at a World Cup were 1930 - only Belgium was in their group - and 1934, which did not have a group stage and only had a bracket. The USMNT lost to Italy in the first round of that tournament. In 1950, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2022, the United States was placed with 2 other UEFA teams. In 1990, the USMNT - returning to the World Cup for the first time in 40 years, was placed in a group with 3 UEFA teams.

It's no wonder that they have played 24 of their 37 World Cup matches against European teams, and their record against Europe explains why there hasn't been a ton of World Cup success for the United States. Their 27% win rate far underperforms their all-time record against Europe (58W-100L-44D - 39.6% win rate) and that is what needs to improve quickly for the team to become a major force down the line.

Oceania - 0W-0L-0D (—)

The USMNT doesn't play Oceania often. They're 2W-0L-2D (75% win rate) against New Zealand, the only current Oceania member that they've played in soccer. Of course, Australia was a part of Oceania until 2006, and they were 0W-1L-1D against them before they joined the Asian Football Confederation. The United States has never played an Oceania team at a World Cup.

Concacaf - 1W-0L-0D (100% win percentage)

Of course, Concacaf is the home confederation for the USMNT where all-time they hold a 231W-97L-83D record (66.3% win rate). However, they've only faced a Concacaf opponent once in their World Cup history, and we all know which match that was: Dos A Cero in Jeonju. The USMNT's 2-0 win over Mexico in the 2002 World Cup Round of 16 remains to date the lone time they have faced a Concacaf opponent, and it's easily the biggest win in the history of one of the fiercest rivalries in the world.

AFC - 1W-1L-1D, 4 group stage points (50%)

The USMNT hasn't faced that many Asian teams at the World Cup. The United States have only faced two Asian teams in the World Cup, all in the group stage: Iran (1998, 2022) and South Korea (2002). The USMNT lost against Iran in 1998 and exacted revenge in 2022, while they drew South Korea in 2002. Their 50% win rate in the World Cup against Asian teams is just slightly off their all-time 57.9% win rate (21W-14L-9D). With the AFC getting 8 direct spots in the World Cup, plus a potential 9th through the inter-confederation playoff, the USMNT should prepare to see one at some point during the World Cup.

CAF - 2W-2L-0D, 6 group stage points (50%)

Like Asia, the United States have only seen 2 African teams in a World Cup: Ghana (2006 group stage, 2010 Round of 16, 2014 group stage) and Algeria (2010 group stage). Between 2006 and 2022, the USMNT only faced African or European teams at the World Cup in 13 straight matches, including 3 straight against African teams. Their 50% win rate and 6 group stage points earned against Ghana and Algeria is slightly off their 65% all-time win rate against African teams (12W-6L-2D). The CAF will have 9 teams directly slotted into the World Cup, with a possible 10th team entering via the inter-confederation playoff.

CONMEBOL - 2W-3L-0D, 6 group stage points (40%)

The USMNT have had their issues all-time against South American teams, with a 30W-59L-30D record (37.8% win rate) in their matches against CONMEBOL. However, this is the confederation that the USMNT has performed slightly better than their batting average when it's in the World Cup. The United States have a 40% win rate against South American teams in just 5 matches, beating Paraguay at the 1930 World Cup and famously beating Colombia at the 1994 World Cup. The United States will want to improve their record against South American teams, especially the traditional powers like Brazil and Argentina, but their win rate shows that they might have a decent shot when lining up against a team from South America in the World Cup.

Overall, the United States Men's National Team will have to improve their World Cup record: 9W-20L-8D (35.1% win rate) with 40 goals scored and 66 conceded. To do that, they have to play better when the bright lights of the world stage shine upon them. As the co-hosts next summer, that spotlight will shine even brighter. It's upon the team to perform when the stakes are the greatest.

Is it even a World Cup without a mascot?Well, how about three?

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup being the biggest edition (48 teams) of the marquee soccer extravaganza, we'll also have a plethora of mascots for next summer's edition. 

[WORLD CUP 2026: WHICH TEAMS HAVE QUALIFIED?]

Three co-hosts. Three distinct mascots. Each of these cuddly creatures represent the co-hosts of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and have their own special attributes on the pitch.

A moose from our neighbors up north, Maple wears the No. 1 and is in charge of anchoring the net. From the name to his uniform color, Maple embodies some of the country's most recognizable emblems and is "born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture."

And although Les Rouges are better known for playmakers such as Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, it won't hurt to have Maple's antlers covering as much of the goal as possible.

A jaguar who plays forward, donning the No. 9 in Mexico's iconic green kit. An elusive creature found in southern parts of the country, jaguars are a symbol to many of Mexico's ancient civilizations. Zayu is said to "embrace Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. … a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride."

And there's also no shortage of quality forwards for El Tri at the World Cup, including Javier "Chicharito" Hernández, Cuauhtémoc Blanco, and current striker Raúl Jiménez. 

You need a maestro in the midfield, and Clutch should be up to the task. You need a keen eye and some sharp instincts when wearing the No. 10 shirt, so it's no surprise to have a bald eagle representing the United States.  Clutch is said to have "an unquenchable thirst for adventure, soaring across the United States and embracing every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism."

Christian Pulisic usually wears that number for the U.S. men's national team as a winger, so USMNT fans will hope he soars to new heights in 2026.

Christian Pulisic usually wears that number for the U.S. men's national team as a winger, so USMNT fans will hope he soars to new heights in 2026.

FIFA pulled back the curtain on its three official mascots for the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

The Athletic's Adam Crafton shared the details on Clutch, Zayu, and Maple, which are intended to represent each host county. Clutch, a bald eagle, represents the U.S. Mexico has Zayu the jaguar. And Canada is symbolized through Maple the moose.

The bald eagle is the United States' national bird and the animal most synonymous with the U.S., while the moose occupies a similar standing in Canada. The jaguar's connection to Mexico goes back centuries.

"Ancient civilizations of Mexico, such as the Maya, bestowed huge significance upon the jaguar, linking it to the underworld and symbolizing strength and bravery," Crafton wrote.

FIFA went even further by assigning positions to the three mascots. Maple is a goalkeeper, Clutch is a midfielder, and Zayu is a striker.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the mascots will add to the overall World Cup experience.

"Maple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself," he said, per Crafton. "I can already picture them on children's shirts, high-fiving football legends and — in another first for this tournament — starring in video games played by millions worldwide."

The 2026 tournament is the first since FIFA increased the number of teams from 32 to 48. As the hosts, Canada, Mexico and the United States have already qualified.

The World Cup is scheduled to kick off on June 11, 2026, and culminate in the final on July 19 at MetLife Stadium.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it will work to keep Israel from being banned from the 2026 men's World Cup.

Israel's participation in global soccer has been questioned in the past week, with the United Nations calling on FIFA and UEFA, the respective governing bodies of world and European soccer, to suspend the nation from their competitions.

A State Department spokesperson told The Athletic: “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup.”

Israel's national and club teams have continued to participate in FIFA and UEFA competitions throughout the conflict in Gaza, which began with the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. Israel is in the middle of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign and is third in its group of five as it bids to reach next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The draw for the World Cup will be made in Washington D.C. on Dec. 5.

It is unclear if U.S. officials have already pressured UEFA or FIFA to not ban Israel. When asked by The Athletic to clarify, the State Department spokesperson declined to comment further.

The UN's statement on Tuesday called for the suspension of Israel from international competition due to what it described as an “unfolding genocide” in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.

UEFA competition matches have not taken place in Israel since the 2023 attacks, in which 1,100 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.

More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza following Israel's ground invasion, according to local health officials.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed on Sunday that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood — a move with which President Trump said he disagreed. France announced its recognition of the state of Palestine on Monday.

On Tuesday, four members of the United Nations human rights council — independent human rights experts who are not employed by the UN or any government  — called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer in response to the conflict in Gaza.

The human rights experts released their statement following an investigation into alleged violations of humanitarian and human rights law during the Israel-Gaza war. The UN's commission of inquiry concluded that “the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip” — crimes under international law.

Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC earlier this month that it rejected the report and described it as “distorted and false.”

The report was published on Sept. 16 and the human rights experts released a statement on Tuesday, arguing that “sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.”

“We are clear that the boycott must be addressed to the State of Israel and not to individual players,” they said. “We have always maintained that individuals cannot bear the consequences of the decisions their government makes, so there should be no discrimination or sanctions against individual players because of their origin or nationality.

“National teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can and should be suspended, as has happened in the past (Russia is currently banned from global soccer due to the ongoing war in Ukraine).

“We urge FIFA to stop legitimising the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. There is a legal and moral imperative to take every measure possible to end the genocide in Gaza now.”

When approached by The Athletic regarding the UN's statement on Wednesday, FIFA and UEFA declined to comment.

In April 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) asked FIFA to suspend Israel from competition in a submission made before FIFA's 74th annual congress.

PFA president Jibril Rajoub spoke at the congress, calling on FIFA “to stand on the right side of history” and asking whether FIFA considers “some wars to be more important than others and some victims to be more significant.” An Israel Football Association (IFA) spokesperson had described the attempt to suspend the country as “nothing but a cynical and shameless move.”

FIFA did not suspend Israel but opened two investigations into alleged breaches of its statutes by Israeli football teams and authorities. The first was into whether teams from Israeli settlements in the West Bank competing in national Israeli competitions represent a breach of the FIFA statutes, and the second investigated allegations of discrimination by the IFA. The PFA has accused FIFA of failing to provide “clarity or due process” with as yet no conclusion to the investigations.

The PFA again called for Israel's suspension at the 75th FIFA Congress in May. “Our issue, sadly again, is stuck in a highly politicized bureaucratic holding pattern,” said Susan Shalabi, vice president of the PFA.

In September, an IFA spokesperson said he was surprised Israel had yet to be suspended from international football.

“I'm surprised we're still part of international tournaments. In many aspects, this is a miracle,” Shlomi Barzel, head of the IFA's public relations department, told Israeli newspaper The Globes. “The miracle can be explained by action on our part and a lot of tolerance on the part of FIFA and UEFA, but historically countries have been suspended for much less than that.”

Israel has been a member of the European confederation UEFA since 1994.

Israel was a founding member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and won the 1964 Asian Cup. They were later excluded from AFC competitions in 1974 following a vote after a number of teams refused to play against them.

Israel now participates in the European section for qualification to the World Cup. While it has never qualified for the European Championship — the continental competition UEFA runs every four years — it reached the play-offs for Euro 2020 and Euro 2024.

Domestic Israeli teams also participate in UEFA club competitions, with Maccabi Tel Aviv competing in the league phase of this season's Europa League.

UEFA confirmed in October 2024 that no matches would take place in Israel “until further notice” in response to the Israel-Gaza war. The national team and club sides have played “home” UEFA competition fixtures elsewhere, including in Hungary, Cyprus and Poland.

UEFA's 55 member associations are meeting today (Thursday) at a regular gathering, although the issue of Israel's participation is not on the agenda. UEFA's next meeting of its 20-strong executive committee, the organisation's main decision-making body, is scheduled for Dec. 3, but president Aleksander Ceferin could call one sooner than that. Slovenia, where Ceferin is from, issued sanctions against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.

Israel is due to play Norway and Italy away in World Cup qualifiers next month. Norway has already said it will donate the proceeds from the game to the Doctors Without Borders charity working in Gaza.

Comparisons have been made between the situations of Russia and Israel, with former Manchester United player and France international Eric Cantona calling it “a double standard” for Israel to remain a part of international soccer, via The Telegraph.

After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, FIFA suspended it from competing in international matches on Feb. 28.

Russia's men's team had been due to play Poland in a World Cup play-off in March 2022, with the winner scheduled to face either Sweden or Czech Republic. All three teams had said they would refuse to play against a Russian side. It was later confirmed that Russia would not participate in the women's European Championship in 2022.

Russian clubs were also suspended from European competition by UEFA.

UEFA and FIFA had announced plans in September 2023 to allow Russia's under-17 teams to participate in their competitions. However, UEFA backtracked in October.

Should Israel be banned by FIFA and UEFA, this would prevent the national team from competing in competitions organised by the two governing bodies.

At international level, this would cover the World Cup, with the 2026 men's iteration taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Israel is in a qualification group alongside Norway, Italy, Estonia and Moldova, and has played five of eight qualifying matches. Israel sits third, level on points with Italy. The top team from each UEFA group qualifies automatically for the World Cup, while the second-place team advances to a playoff round.

The ban would also include the women's World Cup — a competition Israel has never qualified for. The European qualifying draw for the 2027 World Cup takes place in November.

A ban would also include UEFA international competitions: the men's and women's European Championships and Nations Leagues.

At club level, this would cover the men's and women's Champions League, the Europa League and Conference League. Maccabi Tel Aviv is the only Israeli team competing across the three competitions this season. Maccabi Tel Aviv is in the Europa League and is scheduled to play GNK Dinamo, Midtjylland, Aston Villa, Lyon, Stuttgart, Freiburg and Bologna during the league phase.

In a high-energy Q&A with GOAL, the former England skipper was asked to play “winner stays on” with some of the league's biggest centre-back names.

Shaka Hislop and Steve Nicol praise Christian Pulisic after he became the top USMNT scorer in Europe's top five leagues. (2:47)

The European club season has been in full swing for over a month now, giving those U.S. men's national team players plying their trade overseas the chance to establish themselves. Some have gotten off to uneven starts, with the opening round of UEFA Champions League fixtures proving to be especially difficult. Others have hit the ground running. Those in MLS have been in rhythm for a while now.

Then there's Christian Pulisic, who has been leading the U.S. charge in Europe for nine years now and already has five goals in all competitions this season. Fortunately for the USMNT, Pulisic is one of several players who have been hitting their stride in recent weeks.

Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. We call it the USMNT's countdown to the World Cup.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

Only 260 days to go.

Tessmann had already enjoyed a solid start to the season, but last weekend he kicked his campaign into overdrive, scoring the lone goal in Lyon's 1-0 victory over Angers, a result that put the club in a tie atop the Ligue 1 table, behind AS Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain on goal differential. Not bad for a team that was threatened with relegation due to financial irregularities before the start of the season.

As for Tessmann, the question remains: Will these performances be enough to get him back in the U.S. squad? He hasn't been called up since the Concacaf Nations League in March. To be clear, they should be, but the mind of U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino works in mysterious ways. At minimum, Tessmann should be in contention to provide cover for Tyler Adams, or even crack the starting lineup.

Credit Tillman for showing a strong mentality, bouncing back from a dreadful match in midweek against F.C. København in the Champions League to deliver a man of the match performance against Borussia Mönchengladbach in which he scored his second league goal of the season. A tactical tweak from manager Kasper Hjulmand might have helped.

Against Copenhagen, Tillman was operating as one of the dual No. 10s and struggled mightily to get on the ball. Against Gladbach, he was deployed deeper in midfield and had a much stronger impact on the game, even beyond his 70th-minute goal. Hjulmand afterward continued to preach patience, as Tillman is one of many new arrivals to the squad, but the player's ability to shake off a poor performance will serve him well for both club and country.

2025-26 minutes: 286
2025-26 FotMob rating: 7.9

This was an impressive week for Pulisic, even by his lofty standards. After scoring two goals and helping set the table for a third in last weekend's 3-0 win over Udinese, Pulisic maintained his fine form by scoring the final goal -- on the half-volley, no less -- in a 3-0 Coppa Italia win over Lecce.

There's not much more to be said about Pulisic that hasn't been already. He remains the USMNT's most important attacking player, and he now holds the mark for most goals by an American in Europe's top five leagues with 59. As long as he can stay healthy, he's a lock to be in the U.S. lineup.

He'll try to keep the momentum going in this weekend's momentous clash with top-of-the table Napoli.

When Pochettino switched to a three-man back line during the September international window, it was a move that didn't appear to benefit Gladbach's Joe Scally. The wing back position favors the mobility and attacking instincts demonstrated by the likes of Sergiño Dest and Alex Freeman over the defending of Scally, but then Gladbach interim manager Eugen Polanski trotted out a 3-4-3 with Scally as the right wing back, and the American delivered an impressive performance.

Scally showed an ability to get forward that was unexpected given that he recorded no goals and no assists this past season -- his xG of 0.26 is already on its way to eclipsing last year's 0.38. Granted, who knows what formation the permanent Gladbach coach will prefer once he's hired, but the performance should help keep Scally in the lineup.

Given his performance last weekend, why isn't he in this week's in-form XI? It's a fair question, especially when you consider Dest conceded a penalty that was converted in PSV Eindhoven's 2-2 draw with Ajax. Combined with some defensively shaky moments during the September international window, it's worth weighing whether Dest is enough of a defensive liability that he loses his spot in the starting lineup. That said, Dest's value in attack is still high enough given his ability to deliver the unexpected, though Scally has given Pochettino something to think about in terms of who his starting wing backs should be.

Meanwhile, the relative stock of the U.S. corps of forwards continues to go through some wild swings in form. Folarin Balogun looked to have gained some separation from the chasing pack after a great performance against Japan, but that was before his tepid effort in a 4-1 Champions League defeat to Club Brugge landed him on the bench for last week's league encounter against Metz. Even worse for Balogun, his replacement, Mika Biereth, scored the opener in a 5-2 win, while Ansu Fati scored two off the bench and George Ilenikhena also got on the score sheet.

The silver lining for Balogun is that no other U.S. center forwards scored last weekend, although Ricardo Pepi's selfless run to the near post allowed Ismael Saibari to score PSV's first, so he'll remain the starter in this week's lineup. Also, Balogun's skill set is unique within the USMNT player pool, given his ability to make runs in behind the opposition defense, and this should mean his spot in the U.S. squad is still secure. He'll need to work his way back into the Monaco lineup, though, and this week's match at Lorient will reveal the extent to which his spot in the club hierarchy has fallen.

Manchester City are reportedly considering a second raid on Paris Saint-Germain for another Champions League winner. The Premier League giants took advantage of a surprising situation in the French capital to lure Italy international goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to the Etihad Stadium during the summer of 2025. It is now being claimed that Warren Zaire-Emery is a “dream target” for Pep Guardiola.

World Cup

FIFA has confirmed Clutch, Zayu, and Maple as the mascots for the 2026 men's World Cup, with a bald eagle, a jaguar, and a moose representing the three co-hosting nations: The United States, Canada, and Mexico.

FIFA teased the three mascots in a video posted to social media on Wednesday but The Athletic has obtained an exclusive first image of the mascots. FIFA, after being approached by The Athletic with the leaked image, subsequently provided a narrative story behind each character.

Clutch, is dressed in the U.S men's national team's blue away kit. The bald eagle is recognizable for its place at the center of the Great Seal since 1782. An act of Congress, signed by President Joe Biden in 2024, made the bald eagle the official national bird. 

Maple the Moose represents Canada and is dressed in the country's red home kit. The mascot also draws inspiration from Canada's maple leaf, which is the country's national symbol.

Zayu the jaguar represents Mexico and is dressed in the nation's green home strip. Ancient civilizations of Mexico, such as the Maya, bestowed huge significance upon the jaguar, linking it to the underworld and symbolizing strength and bravery.

— FIFA World Cup (@FIFAWorldCup) September 24, 2025



Each mascot also has its own narrative designed by FIFA and is given both a playing position on the soccer field and a backstory.

The U.S. mascot Clutch is a midfielder with “an unquenchable thirst for adventure, soaring across the United States and embracing every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism.

“Fearless on the pitch and uplifting off it, Clutch leads by action — rallying teammates, lifting spirits and turning every challenge into an opportunity to rise higher. A social spark and sports fanatic, Clutch, like all great midfielders, unites people wherever they go, proving that true flight is about purpose, passion and play.”

Canadian mascot Maple the Moose is a goalkeeper who FIFA says was “born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture.”

FIFA's description continues: “A street style-loving artist, music enthusiast and dedicated goalkeeper, Maple found purpose through creativity, resilience and unapologetic individuality. With a knack for making legendary saves and a heart full of strength and leadership, Maple combines endless stories and unstoppable flair.”

Zayu the Jaguar is a striker from the jungles of southern Mexico. FIFA says his name is inspired by “unity, strength and joy … and demonstrates exceptional ingenuity and agility that intimidates defenders.

“Off the pitch, Zayu embraces Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. More than an athlete, Zayu is a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride.”

The FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: “Maple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself. I can already picture them on children's shirts, high-fiving football legends and — in another first for this tournament — starring in video games played by millions worldwide.”

The mascots will not only provide a feel-good factor to the tournament but also form part of FIFA's commercial offering. Mascot shirts will go on sale via FIFA platforms and they will also be playable characters in a new FIFA-licensed game, FIFA Heroes, which will launch next year. FIFA describes the game as an “arcade-style, fast-paced five-a-side football title”, which will feature “World Cup mascots past and present, football's biggest icons and favourite fictional characters from popular TV shows and films.” The game will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, Android, iOS and Nintendo Switch, while the mascots will also feature in FIFA Super League Soccer on Roblox.

The 2026 World Cup draw will take place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. on December 5, with the tournament starting on June 11 and finishing on July 19.

PAOK fans displayed a banner reading 'Stop genocide' during their match against Maccabi Tel Aviv

The United States government will try to prevent any attempt to ban Israel from competing at the 2026 World Cup.

A United Nations commission of inquiry said earlier this month that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

That has led a panel of UN experts and the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to call for sporting sanctions against the country.

Next year's World Cup is being co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada.

A US State Department spokesperson told BBC Sport: "We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup."

Meanwhile, there have been reports that European football's governing body Uefa - which organises World Cup qualifying matches - could meet to decide whether to suspend Israel as early as next week.

One senior source at a European member association told BBC Sport: "Our understanding is that Uefa leadership wants to see some action on this.

"Nothing is confirmed or scheduled. But there is a new, high-level pressure from many nations compared to just a month ago."

Israel are set to play Norway in a World Cup qualifier in Oslo on 11 October.

Earlier this month Norwegian football federation president Lise Klaveness said her organisation "has to deal with Israel participating in their competitions, but cannot and will not be indifferent to the humanitarian suffering that is taking place in the region, especially the disproportionate attacks against civilians in Gaza".

The Italian FA has also spoken about the challenges of playing Israel, who Italy host on 14 October in Udine.

The UN report said there were reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law had been carried out since the start of the war in 2023.

A panel of human rights experts at the UN subsequently called on world football governing body Fifa and its European body Uefa to suspend Israel's national team from international football,, external saying: "Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual."

Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence. Its foreign ministry called the UN report "distorted and false".

The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 65,419 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The ministry's figures are quoted by the UN and others as the most reliable source of statistics available on casualties.

There has been an increase in calls to ban Israel from sporting competition since the UN's report.

And it comes amid reports that Uefa could vote on whether to suspend Israel next week. Uefa has said that no meeting is currently planned.

Israel are third in their World Cup qualifying group - organised by Uefa - on nine points, six behind leaders Norway.

The top team from each group qualifies automatically for the World Cup, with the runners-up going into the play-offs.

Spanish PM Sanchez said Israel should be treated in the same fashion as Russia by being banned from international sports competitions.

"Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image," Sanchez said.

The Russia national team have been banned from competing in international football tournaments since the country's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The Israeli FA declined to comment when contacted by BBC Sport, and Fifa has been approached for comment.

Sanchez's comments came as the final stage of the Vuelta a Espana was abandoned earlier this month after pro-Palestinian protesters entered part of the course in the centre of Madrid.

Protesters knocked down barriers and occupied the road at several points on the course including Gran Via, where cyclists were due to pass multiple times.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing under their national flags at the 2024 Olympics.

Earlier this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry sidestepped a question about sanctioning Israeli athletes, saying: "The sports movement has to showcase the good that is in humanity."

Meanwhile, supporters of Greek side PAOK displayed Palestinian flags and banners during their side's Europa League match against Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday.

Fans held signs in English reading "Stop the genocide" and "Show Israel the red card".

Chants of "Free Palestine" were also heard after Maccabi supporters unfurled an Israeli flag.

The displays came after protests earlier in the day in Thessaloniki, where fans and activist groups rallied against Israel's participation in European football.

Demonstrators submitted more than 1,900 signatures to Uefa in support of a petition launched this week, which said there could be "no fair play with representatives of genocide".

The match had been designated high risk due to the ongoing situation involving Israel and Gaza, with PAOK warning supporters before the match: "The display of banners, messages or flags with political content could result in heavy sanctions for our club."

Maccabi face Aston Villa at Villa Park in the Europa League on 6 November.

The vast scale and complexity of the recent Club World Cup stood out for Senior Pitch Management Manager, Alan Ferguson. He explains how that will shape preparations for 2026.

With less than a year to go until the FIFA World Cup 2026, the curtain fell on football's newest showpiece event, the expanded Club World Cup. The new 32-team tournament was also a chance for a dress rehearsal for football's governing body before next year's main event.

For Senior Pitch Management Manager, Alan Ferguson, this was an opportunity to test the newly developed shallow pitch profile system, which was deployed in varying levels in five stadiums for the Club World Cup, including MetLife Stadium, where Chelsea FC became the first winners of the new format.

Testing new technology

As a learning opportunity, the FIFA Pitch Team has taken a great deal away from the experience.

““The first thing that hit home for me was the sheer scale of the tournament,” Alan explained. “The Club World Cup was hosted in twelve stadiums across America, with 63 matches, and each host city had its own challenges. However, in ten months' time, we'll be at sixteen stadiums in three countries, each with its own climatic challenges.”

“Everything from stadiums to weather really got us thinking, and we have certainly plenty to think about in the coming weeks, and if I'm honest, it's pretty much where I thought we would be.”

“It's one thing to research in the universities, but the real challenges come once you do it for real. From what I've seen across this tournament, I am confident we will fully align for the World Cup in ten months' time.”

While these were substantial challenges, the experience gained from the Club World Cup is critical to achieving FIFA's ambitious goals for the 2026 World Cup. A significant amount of time, effort and money was invested in the research programme run by Tennessee and Michigan State Universities, which developed the shallow pitch profile system, and this was their first real-world tournament test.

“The Club World Cup has given us invaluable insight into what we need to be ready for next year,” says Alan. “And with the systems we've developed, I'm confident that we'll exceed expectations in 2026.”

“Without the research that's gone into the new system, I've got no doubt the five pitches that used it at this tournament wouldn't have been a success.”

“As the Club World Cup approached, the team installed nine pitches in nine cities in 10 days, which was no mean feat. Everyone, from the Sod farmers to the hauliers, stadium teams and FIFA pitch Managers did a fantastic job pulling it off.”

“The whole operation went as smoothly as I could have hoped for, with the highlight coming in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium, where we had four days to install ahead of kick-off. Not only did we pull this off, but we also shallow stitched the pitch in situ using five machines in two days, which is another first. There were three concerts in the stadium ahead of the tournament, which only left a four-day window for installation, so we had to work with the time we had.”

“With the tournament over now, I think we still have a way to go so we can reach the uniform standards I want to achieve, but the important thing for me is we saw what we have developed so far, and it worked well.”

“There were some challenges that were unique to this tournament due to turnaround times and the needs of stadium owners that we won't face at the World Cup, but even those are valuable experiences that we can anticipate now. There were also issues with the weather that prompted us to think, but we can now try to prepare better for that.”

“Most importantly, we've changed perceptions of overlay pitches in the US, showing our system can host several games across a tournament. This gives me confidence for the World Cup.”

Up to 75 different floors were tested, with a short list of only seven able to be considered. One product which shone in testing was Permavoid. This modular system proved to be a success, generating ideal surface hardness and traction.

Another key finding from the research was the ability to achieve shallow stitching. Standard stitching in a restricted profile was not an option. FIFA has already implemented this finding in its other tournaments, with two pitches in Chile for the Men's U20 World Cup, scheduled for September 2025, benefiting from the new technology.

Training Pitch Challenges

Away from the public-facing stadium pitches comes the more significant challenge of the approximately 34 training pitches. Anyone who works in delivering international football tournaments will know this tends to be the most difficult area.

“Tournament training sites usually comprise a diverse range of venues,” Alan begins.

“We had everything from professional MLS training grounds to state-run high school and university pitches.”

“My preference is to pick up as many professional facilities as possible, because by working with the professional venues, we have a much higher starting point, often being able to save significant sums of money along the way.”  

“I have no issue transforming a local training pitch into an international training pitch and leaving a strong legacy for football after the tournament. But such exercises are often underestimated by local organisers. Not only does the uplift in a local pitch require quite a bit of work, but it also requires the staff to upscale training.”

“Again, that's not a big issue for us, but once the venue realise the time involved and downtime for the venue pitch during the work, it usually creates more issues for venue management. By embracing more professional venues, it offers FIFA the chance to fund legacy programmes across several venues.”

“Ultimately, for us, it comes down to quality. During the Club World Cup, we didn't always achieve the standards we wanted, but by working with the Local Organising Committee, we can address those issues in time for the World Cup.”

As we count down to the 2026 World Cup, Alan Ferguson remains confident that the lessons learned from the Club World Cup will directly influence the tournament's success. With new technologies, a better understanding of venue challenges, and a clear focus on legacy, the FIFA Pitch Team is more than ready for the world's biggest football event.”

The organizing committee for the 2026 World Cup Wednesday named Los Angeles native and former LA Galaxy member Cobi Jones as the official community ambassador for the mega event.

On Wednesday, the L.A. World Cup 2026 Host Committee, led by the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission, announced Jones will help them deliver a tournament experience that "leaves a lasting and meaningful legacy" for the region.

Eight World Cup matches will be played at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team opening game scheduled on June 12, 2026.

As part of the tournament, the organization is expected to deliver 39 days of fan engagement activities and entertainment. Jones will join recently announced Community Chairman Snoop Dogg in welcoming visitors to the tournament.



"L.A. is home and it is with excitement and pride that I will serve as an official Los Angeles World Cup 2026 community ambassador,'' Jones said in a statement. "I've spent my life here -- growing up in the Conejo Valley playing AYSO and club soccer, to bringing home a NCAA championship with UCLA. Then helping create a MLS dynasty with the LA Galaxy hoisting trophies and winning titles," his statement continued. "Yet, most important of all raising my family here."

Jones played in three World Cups for the U.S. Men's National Team -- in 1994, 1998 and 2002. He spent 12 seasons with the LA Galaxy, spanning his entire Major League Soccer career.

In the last three decades, he has helped elevate the sport's profile in the United States through his work as a broadcaster, coach and co-founder of Angel City Football Club of the National Women's Soccer League.

"As we prepare to welcome the world in 2026, Cobi Jones is the ideal representative for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 with his deep ties to the game as a player, lifelong connection to LA, and unwavering commitment to growing the games of soccer,'' said Kathryn Scholessman, president and CEO of the LA Sports & Entertainment Commission, and head of the host committee. "We're honored to have him represent our region and help ensure the tournament leaves a meaningful and lasting legacy for Angelenos and visitors alike," she added.

TOKYO (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz injured his ankle and recovered to beat Sebastian Baez 6-4, 6-2 in the Japan Open second round on Thursday.The world No. 1 said he was "scared" when he fell in the first set. Alcaraz rubbed his eyes and held his left ankle in visible discomfort."When I planted the ankle, I was worried, because it didn't feel good at the beginning," Alcaraz said. "I'm just happy that I was able to play good tennis after that and finish the match quite good."I will try to recover to do whatever it takes to be ready for the next round."

Alcaraz required strapping before continuing the match and securing a place in the third round."I was worried that I wouldn't have the confidence to finish the match, but the physio came and did some tests," he said. "It was good I could walk to the bench and that gave me confidence. I'm trying to have a warrior mentality in every match, in every aspect of everything."

Carlos Alcaraz overcame both an injury scare and a rain delay on a dramatic debut at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo, where he defeated Sebastian Baez 6-4, 6-2 on Thursday evening.

Midway through the opener, the World No. 1 collapsed to the floor holding his left ankle and heel, which required strapping, only to later be interrupted by a 30-minute rain delay prior to serving for the first set. Despite the setbacks, Alcaraz steadied himself to win in straight sets and move safely into the second round at the ATP 500 event.

“I was scared too, I'm not gonna lie,” Alcaraz said. “When I planted the ankle, I was worried, because it didn't feel good at the beginning. I'm just happy that I was able to play good tennis after that and finish the match quite good. I will try to recover to do whatever it takes to be ready for the next round.”

After dropping serve for 2-2 in the first set, Alcaraz stretched for a forehand and stumbled backward in clear discomfort before collapsing to the court, clutching his left leg and glancing anxiously to his team. While lying there, the World No. 1 received on-court attention from the physio before moving to his chair, where his left ankle and heel were taped during a medical timeout.

Alcaraz tentatively returned, but eventually retrieved some of his first-class shotmaking to seal the first set, which was halted for 30 minutes at 5-4. The 22-year-old Spaniard then had the strapping reinforced, and with his movement more secure, he powered through the remainder of the match.

“I couldn't do anything at all during the first five minutes [after] I did it,” said Alcaraz, who improved to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Baez. “I was worried that I wouldn't have the confidence to finish the match, but the physio came and did some tests. It was good I could walk to the bench and that gave me confidence [to continue]. I'm trying to have a warrior mentality in every match, in every aspect of everything.”

Next in his campaign is Zizou Bergs, who ousted in-form Chengdu champion Alejandro Tabilo 1-6, 7-6(2), 7-6(4). The top-seeded Alcaraz is this week aiming to join 12 fellow ATP No. 1 Club members who have triumphed in Tokyo. He owns a Tour-leading 63 wins and seven titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.



Alcaraz's seeded semi-final opponent Casper Ruud shook off a sluggish in his opener to overcome Japanese wild card Shintaro Mochizuki 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and keep pace in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The former Nitto ATP Finals runner-up is currently 13th, but he insists that qualification for the season finale is yet to cross his mind.

“Not yet. Typically when we come back to Europe, there's only three or four more tournaments, so that's when you think about it,” said Ruud, who next plays Matteo Berrettini. “My goal is to have a good end of the season, and I haven't really had that in the past except for Turin, [where] I've had some good results. Indoors is not my forte.

“Let's see… It was a little tough to play today, coming a long way from San Francisco, but I'm very happy I was able to overcome it.”

Learner Tien, Dino Prizmic and Shang Juncheng all earned victories on the ATP Tour last week in Hangzhou and Chengdu, respectively, increasing their chances of playing at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, held from 17-21 December in Jeddah.

Tien cemented his third-placed position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah with a quarter-final run at the ATP 250 hard-court event in Hangzhou. The 19-year-old American defeated Mariano Navone and Giulio Zeppieri before he lost to eventual finalist Valentin Royer. Tien is hoping to make his second appearance at the 20-and-under event after reaching the title match last year.

Fourth-placed Prizmic captured his third ATP Tour match win of the season at the event in Chengdu. The Croatian, who has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2025, defeated Cincinnati semi-finalist Terence Atmane and then pushed Top 10 star Lorenzo Musetti to three sets in the second round. Prizmic is aiming to make his debut in Jeddah.

China's Shang continued his comeback from injury with a first-round win against Zizou Bergs in Chengdu. The 20-year-old lefty returned to Tour at the end of July in Toronto after missing the first six months of the season due to a foot injury.

Shang is 18th in the Live Race To Jeddah and will need a couple of deep runs in the next eight weeks to move into qualification contention. This week, he is playing at the ATP 500 event in Beijing and opens against Arthur Cazaux.

Fifth-placed Alexander Blockx, sixth-placed Nicolai Budkov Kjaer and eighth-placed Martin Landaluce are in Challenger Tour action this week in Orleans, while seventh-placed Nishesh Basavareddy lost in the opening round of qualifying in Beijing.

Fritz had won both of his previous career meetings against Diallo, at Wimbledon and Canada earlier this year, and he made it 3-0 in Tokyo—though things could easily have gone the other way this time.Not only did Fritz have to battle back from a set down, but after evening things up at a set apiece, he had to serve to stay in the match twice in the third set, at 4-5 and 5-6—he was actually just a few points away from losing the match serving at 4-5, 40-30 in the decider.But the American held both times and once he got it to a tie-break he soared, opening up an early 3-0 lead, then holding all of his service points from there until grabbing one last mini-break to close the match out after just over two hours on court. At the end of the day, only three points separated the two players—Fritz finished with 95, Diallo with 92."It's definitely a tough turnaround," Fritz said. "I think the biggest thing for me today was the energy. It's really tough to match the energy that you have last week, with Andre [Agassi] on the bench, the team on the bench, everyone going crazy. I'm obviously a little jet lagged as well, so that comes into it. I really just had to find it and get it going."It was a really, really tough match to play today."

Abbi Pulling reviews the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on The Cooldown Room

Race Recap: Azerbaijan

Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman give their verdicts on how the Azerbaijan Grand Prix went for Haas.

Haas did not manage to score any points in Azerbaijan, with Ollie Bearman the higher placed of their two drivers in 12th. Esteban Ocon followed him home in 14th after an eventful race that saw the Frenchman suffer contact off the line.

Ocon's weekend had already been compromised by a disqualification in Qualifying for a technical infringement, meaning he started from last. A good getaway saw him fighting with Nico Hulkenberg, but unfortunately the duo collided.

That led to an immediate pit stop due to a puncture, and with the Safety Car out after Oscar Piastri's crash, Haas saw an opportunity to try something different. Having started on the hard tyre, Ocon was fitted with some mediums before coming back in the next lap for more hards.

That gave him 49 laps to try and survive – and thrive – on the C4 compound. He was asked afterwards whether the early collision hampered his race.

“Luckily it didn't – I think for both our races. At least I didn't have heavy damage,” he explained. “It was just a small touch, and it touched the wheels mainly, which was a good thing.

“It was a good start; we tried a really aggressive strategy, which at the end made me lose out quite a lot. So, a bit of a shame on that part. We will review – it has been a difficult weekend for us.

“I think there are a lot of things we can improve for next weekend and this is what we will look out for in Singapore.”

Haas had looked fast at points in practice, with both drivers flirting with the top 10. As such, hopes had been high going into Qualifying, only for Ocon to exit in Q1 before Bearman crashed out in Q2. Those were just the latest in a series of issues for Haas, which Ocon wants to see rectified moving forwards.

“Yesterday [we had] a brake problem, in Monza we had an issue with the front end of the car really that was quite big. So, we just need to enter weekends and have a clean sweep and no issues, and a healthy weekend really. This is what we are all asking for.”

As for Bearman, he knew that Q2 crash was costly as it meant a P15 starting slot on a day where there was only one race retiree, and limited options to move forward.

“Qualifying was tough this weekend; I did a mistake in Q2 that meant I didn't put a lap on the board. Of course, it was very tricky conditions but that is no excuse. So yeah, just need some improvements [needed] for Singapore,” was his take.

“It was a good race overall, we made a good comeback, had really good pace. But starting 15th, lost a few places on the early laps with the Safety Car restart and after that I was really stuck.

“In the first stint, I lost a lot of time stuck behind [Franco] Colapinto and [Lance] Stroll, and after that it was really damage limitation. The car was quick but I couldn't do much with it.”

Haas head to Singapore sitting ninth in the standings, 11 points behind Kick Sauber.

With Together Again, Jesse Hassenger looks at actors and directors who have worked together on at least three films, analyzing the nature of their collaborations.

It wouldn't be right to call Philip Seymour Hoffman a chameleon. Even before he became an Oscar winner and frequent player of first and second leads, Hoffman was a “that guy” character actor too distinctive to fully disappear into his roles. You don't hire “that guy” for his mastery of disguise. Often, quite the opposite. Character actors take advantage of an unconscious sense of continuity: the idea that, say, the officious yet duplicitous prep-school prick from Scent Of A Woman could make sense as the humorless cop from Nobody's Fool and the toady from The Big Lebowski. That the lovelorn porn-movie boom operator from Boogie Nights could also be the lonely obscene phone-caller in Happiness, or a wild tornado chaser from Twister might branch into a gregarious Lester Bangs in Almost Famous or an imitation Jack Black in Along Came Polly.

Those are three major modes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, and far from the only ones. It's a tribute to his range and magnetism that they all seem like a natural fit without much superficial shapeshifting. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't completely avoid casting Hoffman in his various types across their five movies together. But he often seemed to stay a step or two ahead of the conventional wisdom around how to use one of his favorite actors—skipping, for example, over the early supercilious-prep phase entirely. This vein ran through some of Hoffman's supporting work for years, well after he was done playing actual prep-schoolers, eventually turning into a kind of malicious inquisitiveness. His characters in Red Dragon (a journalist) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (mostly just nosy) aren't the real bad guys, not compared to the murderers he side-eyes. But by virtue of identification with morally dubious characters, they're naturally antagonistic.

Anderson cast Hoffman in antagonistic parts, too, but never especially witty ones. His characters are guys who don't have the patience or the countenance to bother with insinuating. In Hard Eight, Anderson's first feature, Hoffman is on screen for less than three minutes, playing an obnoxious gambler at the craps table with the older, quieter, more experienced Sydney (Philip Baker Hall). A mulleted Hoffman intones his repetitive taunts—he keeps calling Sydney “old-timer”—like a junior-level Nicolas Cage drawling through the kind of then-trendy Tarantino imitations that probably helped get Hard Eight a green light in the first place. He's a walking, braying counterpoint to Hall's stillness, as well as a calling card for a more expansive prickishness than Hoffman had shown in his Hollywood roles thus far.

Hoffman provides similar punctuation to Punch-Drunk Love—right down to sounding like Tarantino himself. (His orders repeatedly end with “All right? Okay?”) He isn't on screen much more than he is during Hard Eight—maybe five minutes as opposed to three—but he looms more heavily over the proceedings as the would-be tormenter of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), via a phone-sex-line scam. Barry lacks Sydney's even keel, but his explosive bursts of rage are balanced by soft-spoken sweetness. Hoffman's Dean Trumbell, better known as the Mattress Man, defaults to rage and disgust in seemingly any interaction, paradoxically opening his side of several conversations with “Shut up.”

Hoffman's most famous moment in the movie is a variation on this: When Barry confronts him about his extortion on the phone, he unleashes a barrage of “Shut! Shut! Shut shut! Shut up!” When Barry confronts him in person and Dean backs down, he still can't resist getting the last word in, screaming insults at Barry as he leaves, then immediately invoking Barry's proposed “That's that” like a kid on a playground frantically touching base during a game of tag. Anderson leaves the Mattress Man's ultimate motivations—whatever feelings he has beneath his contemptuous impatience—unspoken and offscreen, which makes him a sleaze-world version of the villain Hoffman would play in Mission: Impossible III a few years later.

“Shut the fuck up” is also how Boogie Nights introduces Hoffman's Scotty, though he's on the receiving end of the admonishment as he awkwardly makes his side-door entrance at a debauched afternoon pool party. A porn-film crew worker wearing a series of snug tank tops, Scotty is a more sensitive character that anticipates the sexual awkwardness he'd be asked to maximize in Happiness a year later. One of the sweetest, if also most limiting, aspects of Boogie Nights is how Anderson draws so many of its characters as essentially childlike; earlier in the party sequence introducing Scotty, Dirk (Mark Wahlberg) and Reed (John C. Reilly) are comparing gym bona fides and swimming-pool pointers like a couple of 14-year-olds.

Hoffman's Scotty fits perfectly into this schema, which is to say he doesn't especially fit at all; he's the kid at the class party, lingering on the sidelines, genially tolerated but unloved on a deeper level. In a movie that sometimes feels as if Anderson is doing the tracking-shot-introducing-all-the-characters bit on a loop, Scotty keeps unceremoniously appearing in the frame and popping up in the background; every time you wonder if Hoffman has quietly exited the picture during the characters' '80s-era downward slope, he pops up once more, sometimes with no more than a line or barely acknowledged reaction. Scotty's story as it relates to the bigger picture—he's in love with an oblivious Dirk, he acts on it, and gets rebuffed—is pretty much over with an hour of the movie to go. But he sticks around, and doesn't meet the kind of end you might expect from the quiet tragedy of his unrequited love.

For an arrogant and reportedly drug-addled late-'90s enfant terrible, Anderson spared many of his early characters from the worst possible suffering. Like the Boogie Nights folks, the ensemble of Magnolia goes through a wringer, and one not so easily chalked up to the foolishness of youth or the allure of getting paid to have sex on camera. Yet only the absolute worst misdeeds seem likely to face great cosmic punishment. (Even then, an abuser's attempted suicide is thwarted by the same strange falling-frogs fate that throws the rest of the cast off.) Amid this assembly of Anderson's favorite actors, the filmmaker again zig-zags with Hoffman; having previously helped establish him as a jackass and then reshaped him as a socially awkward and emotionally needy type, he casts him here as Phil Parma, the home nurse caring for the dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). There's a feint early on, when Phil orders a few groceries for delivery, then casually tacks on copies of Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler; audiences could be forgiven for making an unconscious connection and wondering if Phil is meant to be some kind of creep. Yet, he turns out to be perhaps the most purely good person in Magnolia short of actual children. It may not be a coincidence that the character shares Hoffman's first name.

Though unalike in presentation and temperament, Phil Parma isn't so different from Scotty in function: He stays on the sidelines. That position gives him more to do this time, just as most of the characters in Magnolia are more multifaceted than their Boogie Nights counterparts. As Earl's nurse, witness to his decline, Phil has greater empathy for the man than someone who's spent decades with him (or estranged from him), though he seems more than faintly aware of how difficult the old bastard can be. When Earl feebly asks to get in touch with his son Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), Phil reaches out on his behalf and makes it happen. He's the one major character in the movie whose personal problems don't really enter the narrative, serving as the audience for Earl's big, rambling monologue about regret as well as Frank's bedside breakdown over his absentee father. 

In a monologue-heavy movie, Anderson trusts Hoffman with a mini-monologue that lampshades Magnolia‘s go-for-broke melodrama, pleading with a sales rep on the phone to connect him with someone who can get in touch with Mackey. Phone to his ear, touching his hand to his face in that now-familiar Hoffman way, he says:

“I know this sounds silly. And I know that I might sound ridiculous, like this is the scene in the movie where the guy's trying to get ahold of the long-lost son, you know, but this is that scene. This is that scene. And I think they have those scenes in movies because they're true. You know, because they really happen. And you gotta believe me, this is really happening. I mean, I can give you my number, and you can go check with whoever you gotta check with, and call me back. But do not leave me hanging on this. All right, please. See…see, this is the scene of the movie where you help me out.”

In one of the most impressive casts of its era, it's difficult to picture anyone else in the ensemble making that dialogue work. Maybe that emotional rawness helps explain why Hoffman only has a small part in Punch-Drunk Love, and nothing in There Will Be Blood; Anderson's work was becoming a bit more obtuse during a period where Hoffman (thanks in part to Anderson) was more frequently and traditionally ingratiating. Magnolia, State And Main, and Almost Famous came out in a row, forming a versatile trilogy of disarmingly lovable Hoffman.

Then, after a decade apart, during which Hoffman won an Oscar for his standard biopic transformation in Capote and Anderson directed Daniel Day-Lewis to another Oscar for There Will Be Blood, Anderson and Hoffman came full circle with The Master—sort of. As in Hard Eight, Hoffman antagonizes the lead character, this time as the older man of greater (if self-styled) authority set against a younger, wilder man. (The actual age difference between the lead actors is only seven years; it's made to feel like more.) But Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) isn't exactly the villain of The Master, any more than Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) registers as a hero. The movie's point of view sticks mostly with Quell—including several scenes that seem like hallucinations or dreams, most notably when he sees Dodd singing to a room full of women who are suddenly all unclothed. This is not happening in the objective reality of this scene; it's all bundled up with Quell's neuroses, as he returns home from World War II, adrift and alcoholic and almost ruinously horny.

Quell happens upon Dodd by chance, as the latter begins to build up The Cause, a Scientology-like religion full of pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy. Dodd rankles at challenges to his credentials, or his authority in general; at one Cause meeting, he haughtily dismisses one questioner with well-coiffed confidence until the man's persistence finally causes Dodd to rip the lid off of his rage and call out “Pigfuck!” in a way that suggests he had been suppressing the epithet for the entire interaction. Yet Quell's far more insinuating way of challenging him—by quite evidently not being a true believer, by attaching his lostness to this temporary solution that probably can't last—elicits Dodd's admiration alongside his frustration. Quell's id-like, tortured soul reflects Dodd's own divided psyche, the raging, redfaced side of himself he attempts to hide behind a quasi-academic composure. 

Hoffman conveys all of this while saying almost none of it. His occasional outbursts recall Punch-Drunk Love, and his queasy fascination with Quell plays like a more refined version of Scotty's transparent longings; mostly, though, past Hoffman performances are only faint, ghostly echoes, with that character-actor ethos emerging again. Dodd puts that sensibility into lofty, borderline ridiculous words: “If we meet again in the next life,” he tells Quell before he leaves The Cause for good, “you will be my sworn enemy, and I will show you no mercy.”

If Anderson was ahead of the curve in his casting of Hoffman, how Lancaster Dodd might be reflected in his future roles remains a mystery. The Master proved an unexpected culmination of Anderson and Hoffman's working relationship when Hoffman died in 2014. He was 46. He made a couple of small non-Hunger Games pictures in between The Master and his death, but The Master feels like his last big one—and his first really big one for Anderson, despite the pair serving as each other's most frequent major collaborator. Hoffman often lurks around the edges of Anderson's movies; that's true even for his co-starring role in The Master. Lancaster Dodd strives to be the focus of a mass movement, but the film's fixation is Freddie Quell's inability to fit in rather than Dodd's attempts to dictate the fitting.

So there's something both familiar and completely new about having Hoffman's son Cooper star outright in Licorice Pizza, a coming-of-age comedy released almost eight years after the older Hoffman's death. Cooper Hoffman is his own person, giving a lovely performance in Licorice Pizza that falls far afield from how his dad might have played it, had he somehow been given the chance as a teenager. The elder Hoffman brought spiritual weight to many of his performances; he's hilarious in Punch-Drunk Love, but the Mattress Man also appears profoundly unhappy. As teenage actor, entrepreneur, and all-around bullshitter Gary Valentine, Cooper Hoffman has a buoyancy that lifts him up even as he capably conveys jealousy, disappointment, pettiness, and anger as needed. Cast in the shadow of his father's death, subtly underlined by Gary's father never appearing in the film, that lightness never feels lightweight.

But that sadness isn't remotely part of the movie's text; Licorice Pizza is the highest-spirited of Anderson's career. Yet for those who love Hoffman's work, a melancholy awareness creeps in; in a barely perceptible way, Philip Seymour Hoffman lingers around the edge of this movie, too. The older Hoffman flashed an ingratiating star quality in certain parts; so far, the younger Hoffman leads with that quality, with flashes of something weightier. Towards the end of Licorice Pizza, when Gary is stalking around his latest business, throwing kids out of his Pinball Palace seemingly out of frustration that he's not enjoying himself more, Hoffman's brusqueness uncannily mimics his dad—in one mode, anyway. This was the scene of the movie where Philip Seymour Hoffman helps you out.

	Before the start of Mötley Crüe's Las Vegas residency earlier this month, Vince Neil revealed that the band was forced to push the beginning of the run because he had a stroke in December. Well, now, the Mötley frontman has shared that he actually suffered at least four strokes “throughout the years” — and this last one may just have been the worst.


	“Two of 'em I didn't even know I had. One of 'em was a mini stroke that happened, and I just lost feeling in my hand. And that was it,” he told Eddie Trunk on SiriusXM's Trunk Nation. “And I got over that pretty quickly. But then this last one, it was a big one.”


	Neil said doctors were able to discover that he had suffered the other strokes because they had “scarred right around the same spot” and that there were four scars in his brain due to strokes. The last of the health scares really affected Neil's mobility, and he was forced to learn to walk again.

A post shared by Trunk Nation on SXM Faction Talk Channel 103 (@trunknationsxm)


	“My left leg wouldn't work, and my left arm wouldn't work. So I had to get help out of bed. I couldn't push myself up to get myself comfortable in bed. And I had to have help,” he said. “And slowly but surely, the sensation came back in my legs. And I had to learn to walk again. I went from a wheelchair to a walker to a cane to — I can walk now, but for five months it was just off and on, not knowing what's gonna happen.”

	











	He continued: “And the doctor said that I probably wouldn't be onstage again. And I was, like, ‘No, man. I can't do that.' And so I just tried. I worked my butt off to get back in shape to go onstage. And I was really sad to have to cancel those shows, but I just wasn't ready yet.”

	











	Back in March, Neil had shared that the band — which he comprises with Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx, and new guitarist John 5 — would push back the residency from March to September over a vocal procedure. “My health is my top priority so I can bring you the awesome shows you deserve, and I can't wait to return to the stage,” Neil said in a statement at the time. However, the health issue was much more serious.


	To the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Neil explained that he did physical therapy for months in Nashville before being able to rehearse. While his voice wasn't affected, “it takes a while to get your brain to start moving your legs, for them to do what your brain wants to do. You try to walk, but it doesn't come out right,” he explained, adding that he's around 95 percent back to “where I was before.”


Mötley Crüe: The Las Vegas Residency kicked off at Dolby Live at Park MGM in Las Vegas earlier this month. The Crüe have shows scheduled on Sept. 26 and 27, and on Oct. 1 and 3.

YouTube is taking flight with Delta Air Lines.


	The airline, which is celebrating its centenary, has inked a wide-ranging, multiyear partnership with the video platform, a deal that will bring YouTube content to the airline's seat-back in-flight video displays, free trials of YouTube Premium for Delta Skymiles members and a custom YouTube Music playlist (curated by flight attendants!) when passengers are boarding.




	“Think about what Delta is all about, which is providing an amazing experience as they take travelers around the world. And from a YouTube perspective, we're really focused on bringing the best of the world to our users, through quality content,” says Miguel Quiroga, YouTube's vp product partnerships, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “So at the end of the day, like that intersection felt really compelling.”

	“This was a no-brainer, really. What we knew was that when we looked at what customers enjoyed doing while on board via the Internet, the number one platform they were streaming was YouTube, and so we knew our customers love YouTube, and we knew we wanted to continue to elevate the experience for our customers,” adds Julieta McCurry, Delta's vp inflight entertainment and connectivity strategy. “So this partnership made a lot of sense — two leaders in each other's industries, really coming together to be able to create a really awesome experience for customers.”

	Passengers will be able to use Delta's inflight Wifi to access YouTube on their personal devices, of course, but a curated selection of YouTube content will also be added to Delta's inflight entertainment system, accessible via seatback screens, beginning Sept. 25.


	“The opportunity that we had is to be able to allow our customers to discover creators or talent or content that maybe they haven't yet been able to discover on their own. It is such a vast library, it's really hard sometimes to understand what's out there and what might I enjoy,” McCurry says. “We'll continue to understand and learn from this partnership and optimize right based on on where customers are leaning in and telling us that what they're enjoying.”


	“I think about it as featured content, and we do this, obviously, in partnership with Delta, and we'll periodically update it,” Quiroga says. “It's designed for premium and longform content in nature that's generally widely popular and suited for in-flight viewing. And of course, because of the nature of the WiFi experience on the planes, on your actual device, you're able to stream all YouTube as well, so it gives you the mix of both.”


	In-flight entertainment has emerged as a surprisingly prime piece of real estate for media companies, but while some, like Peacock, may cut deals for exposure to their programming, YouTube isn't in need of such brand positioning.


	“Our point of view is, consumers want to have us wherever they need to be, and being in the air or being a part of this type of relationship, we just think makes a ton of sense for us — there's always something new to surprise and delight in the YouTube experience as well,” Quiroga says.

	











	Part of that surprise and delight will come in October, when eligible passengers will be able to try out YouTube Premium, an ad-free subscription service, in a two-week free trial. And a custom YouTube Music playlist will welcome passengers on board (there will also be playlists available via the entertainment systems).


	McCurry says that the playlist actually came about from an impromptu conversation between a YouTube Music executive and one of Delta's flight attendants. The YouTube exec mentioned the partnership to the flight attendant on a recent trip, “and the flight attendant used this as an opportunity to connect with her entire crew, and wrote down a whole list of recommendations in terms of what the whole crew believed would be really great music for for our customers to play on board,” she said. “So it also provided really great feedback.”

To know Eleanor Morgenstein is to love her—apparently. As played by June Squibb, the title character of Scarlett Johansson's feature directorial debut is a bitingly sarcastic, tell-it-like-it-is nonagenarian who, in the midst of profound grief, makes an unconscionable decision. Much of Eleanor The Great chronicles the aftermath of that decision, watching as a lie she tells snowballs out of control. This tonally tricky comedy-drama tackles aging, loss, the Holocaust, Jewishness, and the difficulty of determining the truth in a fake-news world. But Johansson's well-meaning film couldn't be more aggravating, and its biggest problem is its insistence that we find Eleanor so damn endearing, no matter what.

Eleanor lives in Los Angeles with her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar), whom she's known for 70 years. They've been roommates since their husbands died more than a decade ago, constantly trading quips and telling off whippersnapper grocery store employees. But, occasionally, Bessie has trouble sleeping, waking up from nightmares that take her back to her childhood in Poland, where she barely survived the concentration camps. At their kitchen table before the sun comes up, Bessie relates her horror stories to Eleanor, who tries to make her friend feel better. But those emotional scars are permanent, and Bessie knows she'll wear them to the grave.

When Bessie does die, the terribly alone Eleanor flies to New York to move in with one of her adult daughters, divorced mom Lisa (Jessica Hecht), with whom she's never been close. The tension between them is apparent instantly, the 94-year-old criticizing Lisa's apartment and life choices. She's especially unhappy once Lisa gently suggests checking out assisted-living facilities—and signs her up for Jewish Community Center events to keep her busy. Reluctantly attending one such event, Eleanor gets distracted by a separate meeting being held down the hall, only belatedly realizing she's accidentally joined a support group for Holocaust survivors. Rather than admit her mistake, though, Eleanor feels so welcomed by the group that she starts sharing her memories of the camps—except they're not her memories, they're Bessie's. She hasn't felt so included, so valued, since Bessie's passing, so she keeps up the charade. Who could it possibly hurt?

Tory Kamen's screenplay quickly provides the answer: A sweet NYU journalism student, Nina (Erin Kellyman), attends the meeting for an article she's writing, moved by Eleanor's harrowing tale. With her daughter and grandson (Will Price) wrapped up in their own lives, Eleanor doesn't have much human contact, so she lets Nina interview her, befriending this college student in the process. Turns out, Nina is going through her own grief: Her artist mother died only a few months ago. Unfortunately, the longer Nina spends with Eleanor, the more Eleanor draws on Bessie's stories, essentially creating an alternate identity based on her late friend. (Nina knows Eleanor's friend died, but not that Bessie lived the life Eleanor is pretending is her own.) Adding more complications, Nina's father Roger (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the charming host of a local TV news segment focusing on unique New Yorkers, becomes interested in doing a broadcast on Eleanor's remarkable (and wholly fabricated) past.

Squibb, who turns 96 in November, has enjoyed a prolific career later in life, receiving an Oscar nomination for 2013's Nebraska and landing her first starring role in last year's action-comedy Thelma. Her characters are surly, mischievous wiseasses, and Eleanor The Great capitalizes on that onscreen persona, giving us a woman who, early in the film, doesn't mind telling the occasional white lie to ensure that Bessie gets special treatment in the hospital. But once Eleanor starts stealing from Bessie's experiences, the deceit becomes troubling. Lying about being a Holocaust survivor is a serious ethical lapse, and one that will surely bring consequences. But for the most part, Eleanor doesn't display any sense of guilt or concern—she's just so grateful to have a new friend. Is Eleanor The Great the melancholy story of a grief-stricken woman? Or is there something more devious (or demented) in Eleanor's flouting of the truth?

A sharper movie would have explored those intriguing questions. But Johansson is after something far tidier and syrupy. Her manipulative film introduces an inherently nervy premise but then quickly and unconvincingly pivots away from its more serious implications. Squibb plays Eleanor with blandly crotchety adorableness, her incurious movie ignoring any potentially compelling inner conflict. Eleanor The Great‘s moral complications are insultingly sanded off in the name of treacly messages about forgiveness and grief. 

At a moment when many Jews have anguished feelings about both Israel's ongoing pummeling of Gaza and the Trump administration's exploiting of antisemitism to target universities, Eleanor The Great means to illustrate the struggles and the beauty of modern Judaism and the Holocaust's ugly lingering shadow. (Belatedly, Eleanor wants to finally have her bat mitzvah, inspiring an on-the-nose scene in which a rabbi discusses the Torah's teachings about lying.) But like another falsely feel-good film about bigotry—Jojo Rabbit, which earned Johansson an Oscar nomination—Eleanor The Great seeks uplift not insight. It wants to put a happy, tearjerking face on the trauma it's intending to memorialize. We're expected to sympathize with Eleanor because she's a lovable, lonely stinker who made an innocent mistake that got out of hand. But it's hard to forgive her when Eleanor never wants us to doubt how great she really is. Grief can make people do unimaginable things—too bad Johansson's debut lacks the imagination or courage to delve into the darkness in order to bring her audience (and Eleanor) back into the light.

	Attorneys representing two groups of Disney shareholders are demanding records related to the company's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel under pressure from the Trump administration. 


	As Variety notes, the letters were sent to Disney CEO Bob Iger on behalf of the American Federation of Teachers (which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO) and the nonprofit Reporters Without Borders. It says the records request is “to investigate potential wrongdoing, mismanagement, and breaches of fiduciary duty” by the Disney board, executives, or others connected with the decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live!.


	“There is a credible basis to suspect that the Board and executives may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty, care, and good faith by placing improper political or affiliate considerations above the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,” the letter reads. 


	While the AFT's and RWB's attorneys did write that the groups were “pleased” that ABC “did the right thing and put Jimmy Kimmel back on the air,” they noted that Disney's “stock suffered significant declines” following the original decision. The letter also expressed concern over Trump's continued attacks on free speech, including his threat to sue ABC following Kimmel's return.

	“The fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech, triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney's stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship,” the letter read. “And the negative repercussions on Disney and its stockholders remain, given that, following the announcement that the show would be returning to the air, Donald Trump issued a new threat on his social media platform, Truth Social, stating on September 23, 2025, that ‘I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do.'”

	











	The AFT and RWB are demanding the records be sent to them within five days of the letter (which is dated Sept. 24). Pending review of the documents, the two groups could file a derivative lawsuit, which allows shareholders to act on behalf of a company and sue the corporation's own directors and officers, as well as other third parties who may have harmed the company.

The Los Angeles Festival of Movies (LAFM), heading into its third year April 9 – 12 in 2026, has parted ways with MUBI as a presenting sponsor, as LAFM shared on Instagram Thursday.

The festival launched in 2024 with MUBI as a sponsor to bring the best of independent film to Los Angeles over one weekend. MUBI has been subjected to internal and external strife since receiving a $100 million investment from the venture capital company Sequoia, which has also supported companies tied to Israeli military technology amid the war on Gaza. 

 










MUBI CEO Efe Cakarel said in August that the distributor and streamer's profits have no relationship to other companies in Sequoia's portfolio. MUBI secured the investment at the end of May 2025, around the time it acquired the Jennifer Lawrence-starring film “Die My Love” out of Cannes for a reported $24 million. MUBI declined to comment on the LAFM news, and referred back to Cakarel's statement from August.

Filmmakers and MUBI staff have since implored the company to drop its relationship with Sequoia, with a request to remove Sequoia partner Andrew Reed from MUBI's board. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






MUBI's fall slate includes, along with “Die My Love,” Kelly Reichardt's “The Mastermind” and Jim Jarmusch's Venice Golden Lion winner “Father Mother Sister Brother.” At the Venice Film Festival this year, Jarmusch expressed discontent over MUBI's relationship with Sequoia and said he'd had conversations with its leaders about next steps.

Back in August, IndieWire obtained a letter signed by roughly half of MUBI's staff sharing frustrations over the investment. Cakarel said that Sequoia is a minor investor in the company with no oversight on programming or distribution. Expected on October 15 is an internal policy at MUBI, to be shared publicly, on guidelines to ethical investments.

Micah Gottlieb and Sarah Winshall co-founded the L.A. Festival of Movies as a response to the 2018 discontinuation of the L.A. Film Festival. Gottlieb's film non-profit Mezzanine also serves as a sponsor.

Here's the festival's full statement, as shared on Instagram, below.

In the spirit of continuing to build trust and transparency with our community, we want to share that LAFM has parted ways with our presenting sponsor MUBI, on account of its financial ties to Sequoia Capital, a company invested in Israeli military technology and the ongoing campaign of genocide in Gaza.

This was not a decision taken lightly. LAFM is still a brand-new festival run by a fledgling nonprofit organization, and we are still largely dependent on corporate sponsorships and donations. This decision definitively puts us behind on our fundraising goals for next year.
 










With MUBI, we were able to work with a marketing team that understood our mission of bold curation, and supported us in cultivating dynamic spaces for cutting-edge arthouse and independent cinema. We are now actively seeking sponsors and donors who share those values.

When we began in 2024, we arrived in an incredibly precarious environment for independent cinema. We planted a seed in a city dominated by the commercial film industry, in order to build a foundation for the kind of film culture we want to perpetuate.

Like many, we have been witnessing the genocide in real time on our social media feeds. And like many, we question our material ability to move the needle as a cultural arts organization. But we do not want to remain indifferent.

We are so lucky to proceed with intention, curiosity and warmth. It is these values that we want to imbue to our partners and to our audience.

The support that we get from you goes a long way. 

Please consider supporting us, and help us make it to 2026.

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: Top reality TV executive Corie Henson is taking on a beast of a new role.


	Deadline understands that Henson, who was most recently unscripted chief at NBC, is joining Beast Industries, the company founded by MrBeast, the world's top YouTuber.


	Henson has been named Head of Beast Industry Studios, which oversees MrBeast's YouTube channels as well as its moves into longform streaming series such as Beast Games, the Amazon competition series that has been renewed for two further seasons.


	It comes as MrBeast, otherwise known as Jimmy Donaldson, is expanding more into traditional television alongside his growing YouTube empire, where he has over 440 million subscribers.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“MrBeast rewired how millions of people consume entertainment. I'm beyond thrilled to join Jimmy and Jeff to help build what comes next,” Henson said. “We're not just creating franchises, we're building worlds that actually matter to fans — and doing it across every screen.”


	Henson will report to Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries. Tech entrepreneur Housenbold joined the company last year.


	Housenbold told Deadline that he wants to turn Beast Industries into the next Disney. “Just like Disney has Mickey [Mouse], it also has Lucasfilm, Pixar, Marvel, Searchlight, ABC, ESPN, and so on — we have Jimmy. We know how to build virality into everything we do, and we're looking to continue building large-scale viewership, whether it's short-form or long-form content, and Corie is going to be integral to getting us there quickly,” he said.


	“Corie brings world-class experience and a proven ability to scale iconic franchises. We're excited for her to lead Beast Industries Studio as we continue to blend the best of traditional entertainment with creator-driven innovation and expand our global impact,” he added.


	In addition to his YouTube projects and Beast Games, Donaldson is also writing a book with James Patterson, launching an animation studio and a video game platform, and is releasing a theatrical feature. The company is also developing more unscripted and scripted series, which will be overseen by Henson.

	











	Earlier this year, Donaldson explained the rationale behind Beast Games, which saw 1,000 contestants compete in a series of physical, mental and social challenges to win a grand prize.


	“I've just always been really excited about taking the big spectacles we do on YouTube but being able to do it over an episodic series where we could actually get to know the contestants and have more depth and story and get more invested into the challenges and games. The idea was to take what we do on YouTube, but make it 10 times bigger and 20 times better,” he told Deadline.


Beast Games, which premiered on Amazon's streaming service in December and ran through February, saw Donaldson give away $25 million in prize money including a $10M prize to the winner.


	The show was renewed for two more seasons in May.


	Henson has a storied unscripted background. She joined NBCUniversal in 2022, where she became EVP, Unscripted Content, Competition and Game Shows, where she oversaw NBC staples such as America's Got Talent and The Voice as well as Peacock hits The Traitors and Love Island. She left earlier this year as a result of a restructure implemented by Donna Langley.


	Henson's big win at NBC was Deal or No Deal Island, a new spin on the classic game show that returned for a second season after strong ratings for its first season. She also greenlit Destination X, a major new adventure format that is expected to launch later this year and will likely be the first of a number of interesting international co-productions and deals.


	Before NBCU, Henson worked at Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox. She was previously EVP, Head of Unscripted for TBS, TNT and truTV before she decided to leave following Warner Bros.' merger with Discovery. There, she oversaw series such as the reboot of Wipeout, The Go-Big Show and The Cube as well as Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses, the Warner Bros-produced, Helen Mirren-fronted competition series that performed well for TBS and Cartoon Network.


	Before Turner, Henson was EVP, Alternative Entertainment at Fox and before that was EVP, Unscripted Television at Electus and VP, Alternative Series at ABC Entertainment.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar nominee Josh Brolin, who is coming off box office smash Weapons, has come on board to headline the action-comedy Mister from Bright White Light and John Wick outfit Thunder Road.


	As we told you during Cannes, the film will mark the directorial debut of well known second unit and action director Wade Eastwood, whose credits include Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Jumanji: The Next Level. 


Mister follows a man (Brolin) who wakes up in a strange house covered in blood and comes to realize his true identity while fighting off contract killers from his past — including everyone from his exes to his best friend. To get out, he teams up with his estranged daughter who also has ended up in the family business, but they will need to repair their relationship in order to survive.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Principal photography is set to begin in early 2026 in Spain, with additional casting underway.


	Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee will produce for Thunder Road alongside Brolin for Brolin Productions. Nicki Cortese, who also penned the script with Nick Inglis, will produce with Wayne Marc Godfrey for Bright White Light (Runner), which also is financing the film.


	Executive producers include Chase Vergari, Ibrahim Mohammed, Eric Handler and Will Flynn. Black Bear represents international rights on the film, with CAA Media Finance handling domestic. Sophie Meyer and Alex Bigman will oversee for Bright White Light.


	Following his acclaimed performance in the breakout hit Weapons, Brolin next will be seen in Edgar Wright's The Running Man and Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. Next year he stars in Ridley Scott's The Dog Stars and 20th Century's Whalefall.












	“Having the opportunity to collaborate with Josh is everything I could have hoped for,” said director Eastwood. “His presence and gravitas define Mister and bring the film to life in every way. What excites me most about this project is the depth of the characters and complexity of their relationships, which allows me to build action around story, without ever losing the intensity the genre demands.”


	Brolin is represented by CAA and Eastwood by UTA.

“Star Trek” actor William Shatner, who played the role of Captain Kirk, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 24, TMZ reports. He is 94 years old.

The outlet adds that he “experienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon,” with the actor having “called emergency medical service workers for help as a precaution and paramedics showed up in an LAFD ambulance.”

Shatner was taken to a local hospital, with TMZ reporting that he's doing “good” and “resting comfortably.”

TMZ posted on social media, sharing the news, and many fans left comments, showing support for Shatner. 

“🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,” one fan commented.  

“Oh no.. I hope he's not beamed up just yet.. Stay strong @WilliamShatner.. Engines need more Warp Speed,” someone wrote. 

“Wishing Captain Kirk well,” a fan said.

In June 2025, Shatner opened up about a medical condition he has been dealing with for years called tinnitus.

According to the Mayo Clinic, tinnitus is “when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears,” however, it isn't “caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.” The condition began when he was filming “Star Trek” due to the special effects explosion.

In the video released by the nonprofit organization Tinnitus Quest, Shatner aimed to spread awareness.

“Over the years, I've had many ups and downs with my tinnitus,” he said. “I know from firsthand experience just how difficult it can get.”

“It”s a diverse condition that comes in different degrees of severity. About 1–2% of the population suffer from a chronic, debilitating form of tinnitus. There are no effective treatments—and that's why we need more research,” he added. 

A post shared by William Shatner (@williamshatner)

On Aug. 7, William Shatner took to Instagram, revealing to fans that, at the age of 94, he has decided to release a book. 

“My dear followers, I wanted to drop a bit of a teaser: I'm writing a new book. Even Better: the book's all about YOU, the fans, and you can be a part of it, maybe even be in it!,” he captioned the post. “Go to WilliamShatnerAndYou.com to find out more!”

Shatner has played many iconic roles, including Captain Kirk, Denny Crane, T.J. Hooker. So with that, he is asking fans to “submit your own tale of how my characters: be it Kirk, T.J. Hooker, or even Denny Crane—have touched your life.” And a lucky few will get the opportunity to be interviewed by Shatner about their stories, while will be featured in the book.

Stop us if you've heard this one before: a restrictive and repressive foreign country edited and censored an LGBTQ scene from a movie and now the American distributor is upset. We can think of a dozen movies that come to mind. 

In this case, a Chinese distributor caved to the government's pressure and edited a scene in the recent indie body horror movie “Together,” changing a gay wedding to a straight one. Neon isn't pleased, and it demanded that Hishow, the Chinese distributor to whom it sold the foreign rights, stop showing “this altered version,” the company told IndieWire in a statement.

 










What's weird, however, is that Hishow didn't just cut the scene in question or edit it in such a way to make it look like it was a heterosexual couple getting married. Per some glaring social media posts that went viral last week, the distributor seemingly used AI to face swap a male character with the face of a woman.

Firstly, the Chinese distributor simply isn't allowed to edit the film in any way, which is normally the case in sales agreements. In the case of a major studio film where the studio is handling global distribution, it needs to go through government approval to get released in China or other countries prone to censoring LGBTQ+ content, and the studio itself would need to make that decision on an edited version.

 










But for an indie like “Together,” which Neon bought the worldwide rights to (for $15 million out of Sundance this year), it handles North American distribution itself, and then it sells the movie to other territories for the rest of the world. 

But under the terms of any deal they make with another international distributor, Neon is selling “Together” under the legal pretense that the distributor release Neon's IP as intended. Hishow has halted the release since. “Together” officially opened on September 19.

It's also unclear if this is really “AI” or just some other slapdash edit that swapped a man's face with a female one. It's hard to tell when you have nothing to go on but a screenshot smuggled from Chinese social media. 

But people in China certainly seem to think this is an example of AI. China Digital Times reports that it wasn't just the same-sex image that was altered, but the distributor did also cut out some straight sex scenes from the film, just like they could've done with the scene that was digitally altered. China Digital Times also compiled a collection of commenters from film forum websites like Douban, Zhihu, and Xiaohongshu. As one user implies, the AI is a more sophisticated and “terrifying” form of censorship because smart viewers have figured out ways to get around obvious censorship or can tell the difference, but that's much harder with AI. Here's a smattering of some of the comments, sarcasm implied on the last one:

 










“If they just deleted scenes, we could work it out by watching BluRay or streaming versions, and even scene alterations like cropping, dimming, or photoshopping in skirts could be fairly readily identified. But the evolution of alteration methods like this AI face-swapping is terrifying … in the future, we won't even be able to tell if we're watching the original film or not.“

“We've reached the point where it's not a matter of cuts, but of falsification and misrepresentation.

“This is nauseating because it not only interferes with the integrity of the plot, it disrespects the sexual orientation of the actors. Congrats to those Chinese with thin skins for pioneering this new mode of film import. Next time, they might as well straight-swap “Call Me by Your Name” for hetero screenings.

“Awesome! Next, let's use one-click AI to re-release “Brokeback Mountain,” “God's Own Country,” “Lan Yu,” and “Happy Together” as “restored” hetero romances — a faster and more effective conversion than drinking Chinese herbal medicine! What a beautiful country! There's hope for us yet!

The one commenter is especially right about the edit interfering with the integrity of the plot. Some SPOILERS! for “Together” follow. The scene that was edited isn't just any old wedding. When stars Alison Brie and Dave Franco discover a video tape of the wedding, we learn the two men in the wedding eventually went through the same fusion process that is about to take place for them, and the two men ultimately formed into one single man, as played by Damon Herriman. When Brie and Franco eventually fuse at the end of the film, they become a single, androgynous, non-binary person. Erasing the same-sex marriage and making it a straight couple suddenly makes the Damon Herriman character make no sense.

 










That's the really terrifying part of this particular edit — AI alterations that exist to serve censorship and degrade creators' original storytelling.

	As if Jimmy Kimmel's return to late-night wasn't enough, South Park put FCC chair Brendan Carr through a grueling gauntlet of slapstick pain in its latest episode, Wednesday, Sept. 24. 


	The episode isn't a direct commentary on how the Trump administration pressured ABC and affiliate owners to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live!, though Trey Parker and Matt Stone made their views on the matter evident enough. Carr is part of an episode subplot involving Donald Trump's efforts to get rid of his unborn butt baby with Satan, but all the zany schemes the president concocts keep befalling the hapless FCC chair instead.


	These include: Slipping down a greased flight of stairs, eating a stew laced with Plan B, and finally, getting covered in dirty cat litter and infected with toxoplasmosis. The last trap puts Carr in the hospital, where a doctor quips about his condition: “His bones are healing, so he may regain full range of motion. But if the toxoplasmosis parasite gets to his brain, I'm afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a more direct nod to the Kimmel controversy, J.D. Vance shows up at the hospital, delighted that Carr is in critical condition and thus unable to challenge the VP for the presidency. Vance even threatens Carr with the same words the FCC chair used on a podcast when revealing his desire to get Kimmel booted over a joke he made about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”

	Last night's South Park aired a week later than expected, after Parker and Stone admitted they were unable to get the episode “done in time.” The show's blockbuster 27th season has been airing every other week, as opposed to weekly, to ostensibly give the pair and their staff more time to craft episodes in response to current events. (Case in point: The Carr plot was almost certainly added after last week's episode was delayed, as Stone and Parker announced the postponement the same day, Sept. 17, ABC suspended Kimmel.)


South Park will air five more episodes this year, with the tentative schedule set as: Oct. 15, Oct. 29, Nov. 12, Nov. 26, and Dec. 10.

Vance even threatens Carr with the same words the FCC chair used on a podcast when revealing his desire to get Kimmel booted over a joke he made about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”

	Last night's South Park aired a week later than expected, after Parker and Stone admitted they were unable to get the episode “done in time.” The show's blockbuster 27th season has been airing every other week, as opposed to weekly, to ostensibly give the pair and their staff more time to craft episodes in response to current events. (Case in point: The Carr plot was almost certainly added after last week's episode was delayed, as Stone and Parker announced the postponement the same day, Sept. 17, ABC suspended Kimmel.)


South Park will air five more episodes this year, with the tentative schedule set as: Oct. 15, Oct. 29, Nov. 12, Nov. 26, and Dec. 10.

	Lienne Sawatsky, Dan Williams, and John Hazlett, the trio behind animated children's series' The Guava Juice Show, are writing the adaptation, and will serve as showrunners.

	The original Surf's Up starred the likes of Shia LeBeouf, Jeff Bridges, Zooey Deschanel, Jon Heder and and James Woods, and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature 18 years ago. It parodied surf documentaries such as Riding Giants, following a teenage northern rockhopper penguin, Cody Maverick, who dreams of becoming a professional surfer by competing in the Big Z Memorial competition on Pen Gu Island.

	The series will follow an over-confident teen penguin named Flip, who teams a zany bunch of young surfers in his attempt to become a surf legend. Things go spectacularly wrong and the wipeouts are spectacular, so they instead they build their own surf community on Pen Gu Island. Characters from the movie such as Cody, Big Z and Chicken Joe will return.


	“Our team at Atomic is thrilled to be working on Surf's Up: The Series and for the opportunity to introduce these adored characters to the small screen, reaching new and existing fans of the iconic animated film,” said Twiner McCarron, who is also the CEO of Atomic in addition to Thunderbird.


	“Lienne, Dan and John are passionate about only two things in life – penguins and surfing,” added Behl. “It was undeniable that they were the write team – pun intended – to adapt Surf's Up as a hilarious animated series.”

	











	Atomic has bases in Vancouver, Ottawa and L.A., and is known for the likes of The Last Kids on Earth, Rocket Saves the Day and Mermicorno: Starfall, which is currently in production. It has also worked on brands such as LEGO, My Little Pony and CoComelon. Atomic's parent, Thunderbird, is behind the likes of Super Team Canada, Molly of Denali, Highway Thru Hell, Kim's Convenience, Boot Camp and Sidelined: The QB and Me, and operates TV sales division Thunderbird Distribution and Thunderbird Brands, which manages consumer products rights.


	The plan is to market Surf's Up: The Series internationally to land TV partners and consumer products lines.


	“We're excited to be partnering with Atomic and their long history of bringing great intellectual property to series animation,” said Sony's Mischel. “Surf's Up is iconic and we look forward to a whole new audience getting to know these characters.”

Wade Robson and James Safechuck have been suing the estate for years - and new court filings claim they're seeking a monumental sum.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



	Two men who have long accused Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children are seeking a whopping $400 million in their court cases, his estate revealed in recent court filings.


Wade Robson and James Safechuck have spent more than a decade litigating over their allegations of sexual abuse – and in a motion filed last week in Los Angeles court, Jackson estate executors John Branca and John McClain say they're seeking a monumental sum.


	“It would be disastrous for the Estate to default in this case,” Branca and McClain wrote in the court filings, which were obtained by Billboard.


	The revelation came amid an intra-estate dispute with Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson, who claims Branca and McClain have paid too much in legal bills to certain law firms. In the new filing, the executors argue that not paying those fees would have “profoundly destabilizing consequences,” including a costly judgment for Robson and Safechuck.


	“The Estate would likely have to default in the Robson/Safechuck litigation, where numerous depositions, discovery matters, and other matters are scheduled to take place over the next several months, and where the plaintiffs are seeking $400 million.”


	In a statement to Billboard, the Jackson estate said: “The lawsuit has no merit and Michael is innocent.” An attorney for Robson and Safechuck did not immediately return a request for comment on the estate's claims about the damages demand.


	Though Robson and Safechuck have being suing for years, it had never been reported that they were seeking such a massive award. The revelation was first reported by Us Weekly.


	Jackson, who died suddenly in 2009, was never convicted or held legally liable on any accusation of child molestation, but is still dogged by such allegations. Last year, the estate took legal action against a man named Frank Cascio, claiming he fabricated such claims as part of an alleged $213 million extortion attempt.


	Robson and Safechuck have spent years suing, and their allegations were amplified in 2019 by HBO docuseries Leaving Neverland, which laid out their claims in disturbing detail. In 2023, an appeals court revived their abuse lawsuits against Jackson's companies, and the cases remain pending with a trial currently scheduled for next year.


	Paris Jackson filed her petition in June, challenging how the estate had paid its lawyers. She claimed the executors had failed to “provide adequate responses” over how it spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to three firms. The executors later denied any wrongdoing, saying its conduct was “not unusual and in fact is quite common” in the music industry.


	In last week's new filing, they used the threat of a potential loss in the Robson and Safechuck cases to hammer that point home: “Petitioner's requested relief, if granted, could devastate the Estate. The Estate's attorneys — and those of its constituent businesses — are not going to work for free.”

Kathryn Bigelow is back with her first movie in eight years, the nuclear missile thriller “A House of Dynamite,” which premiered to raves at Venice, having already been acquired by Netflix in advance. The trailer for “A House of Dynamite” is here, and it is gripping. Watch it below.

Senior situation room duty officer Rebecca Ferguson (here doing such a great American accent you'll forget about Ilsa Faust immediately) receives shocking news: An intercontinental ballistic missile has appeared over Asia with a trajectory that appears to take it to a Midwest city in the U.S. And, given how fast ICBMs travel, reaching suborbital altitudes, it'll reach that target in 18 minutes. The entire film that follows plays out by toggling back and forth among myriad different perspectives, including Idris Elba as POTUS, in an ever-growing ensemble during those 18 minutes.

The cast also includes Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, and Jonah Hauer-King, with Greta Lee and Jason Clarke. It comes from a script by Noah Oppenheim, the former president of NBC News who also wrote Pablo Larrain's “Jackie” as well as co-created the Robert De Niro-led Netflix series “Zero Day,” about a devastating cyberattack on the U.S.

IndieWire Executive Editor Ryan Lattanzio wrote in his review that the “horrifically gripping and hopeless” film “will ruin your day.” In the best possible way, as he also gave it an A- score and a Critic's Pick, when reviewing it out of the 2025 Venice Film Festival earlier this month.

“‘A House of Dynamite' moves at a whirring gradient with an ever-widening ensemble — which includes Greta Lee, Jason Clarke, and Moses Ingram as various cogs — that can be challenging to keep track of,” Lattanzio continued. “The film essentially takes place entirely within an under-20-minute timeline, showing the same events from a shuffling deck of points of view. Bigelow's grindingly focused direction is peerless here, with her already established as a frank and fearless chronicler of American political ambiguity in films like ‘The Hurt Locker' and ‘Zero Dark Thirty,' and with ‘A House of Dynamite' seemingly completing a trilogy about the collapse of the American dream in war times.”

“Hardly mere agitprop due to the stylistic intensity of its filmmaking, this gun-to-your-head engrossing movie — with its eardrum-piercing and death-rattling sound design and a score by Volker Bertelmann so oppressive it could swallow you whole — also wants to shake you out of your slumber.”

 










“A House of Dynamite” opens in select U.S. theaters on Friday, October 10 and will stream on Netflix starting on Friday, October 24. Watch the trailer below.

On Billboard's music business podcast On the Record, senior editor Griselda Flores talks concert cancellations and the lack of Latin artists at Coachella.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	When Donald Trump was elected to his second term as President of the United States last November, Billboard‘s senior Latin editor, Griselda Flores, began watching to see if his forthcoming immigration policy changes would impact the Latin music business.


	There was already a historical pattern to support this thinking: Back in the 2000s, when George W. Bush strengthened immigration enforcement and tightened visa restrictions, Billboard found that it hurt the business of Latin music concert promoters, who depend on immigrants to fill seats. Abel DeLuna, a California-based member of the veteran Mexican music association Promotores Unidos, told Billboard in 2007 that the policies alone accounted for 20% to 25% of the drop in his concert promotion business, for example.


	Through Flores's extensive reporting, she found that Trump's policies did, in fact, have some economic and cultural impact on this sector of the music industry. The Michelada Festival in Chicago was cancelled last minute this summer, citing a “rapidly changing political climate” and “uncertainty” around artist visas. Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny announced he would not be coming to the U.S. on his next tour, citing a fear of potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the crowd. Mexican-born Narcocorridos artists and Cuban acts found it hard to get visas, and stadium-level acts like “Box Office King” Julión Álvarez had visas canceled at the last minute before shows.


	To explain what she's been seeing over her last nine months of reporting on the issue, Flores went on Billboard's new music business podcast, On the Record With Kristin Robinson. 


	The interview can be watched in full below or listened to at this link.

	Originally released by MGM in 1987 — a decade after George Lucas' sci-fi classic Star Wars debuted to become a culture-defining smash — Spaceballs starred Bill Pullman, Moranis, Zuniga, Wyner and John Candy, as well as a voice role for Joan Rivers as a C-3P0 parody. The film earned $38.1 million ($108 million today) at the box office before becoming a cult favorite.


	During summer of 2024, Gad teased the sequel in an Instagram post. “Just handed in a film script that I think may be the funniest and best thing I've ever worked on and I am so freaking excited,” Gad captioned the post at the time. He added that working with Samit and Hernandez “has been heaven on Earth and many other planets as well. Love you boys!”

	











	Moranis is represented by Troy Bailey of Bailey Brand Management and Marc Von Arx. Gad is repped by CAA, Range and Johnson Shapiro. Palmer is repped by 3 Arts and Hertz Lichtenstein. Lewis Pullman is repped by CAA and Anonymous Content. Carrigan is repped by United Artists in the U.K., Goodman Genow and Schlegel Entertainment. Wyner is repped by The House of Representatives. Zuniga is repped by Untitled Entertainment, CESD and Jackoway. Bill Pullman is repped by CAA.

	Angie Martoccio




O
n April 26, 1973, a young writer got his first article published in Rolling Stone. “It's been four years since Poco played their first gig at the Troubadour and everybody made a point of saying the band would be The Next Big Thing,” he wrote. “Five albums and many tours later, Poco is still on the verge.” 


	Despite a few hits in the late Seventies, Poco did not become The Next Big Thing. But the article launched the career of Cameron Crowe, who was just 15 years old at the time. Before long, he was writing cover stories for the magazine, hanging with David Bowie on the Sunset Strip, flying cross-country with Led Zeppelin, and going fishing with Lynyrd Skynyrd. 


	A fictionalized account of his years as a rock journalist resulted in the beloved 2000 film Almost Famous, but more than 50 years after his debut as a professional writer, Crowe is finally ready to tell the real story. The writer-director's memoir, The Uncool, arrives on Oct. 28. The book is not a salacious celebrity memoir, but a tender chronicling of his Rolling Stone years, where he earned the trust of musicians and witnessed now-iconic concert moments. He also goes deep on his upbringing and family life, and the time he may or may not have prank-called Lucille Ball.

	











	Ahead of the release, Crowe, 68, opened up on all this and more for Rolling Stone's Last Word feature.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







Have you always wanted to write a memoir?No. This is really just pivoting back to a kind of writing that I loved. Sometimes you just feel like there's a sweet spot, and you love living there. Around the time of the [Almost Famous] musical, I felt like I had a lot that needed to get out — that I just wanted to write for me. It was such a joyful experience, and it became 800 pages. It was that kind of writing. 

	











How did it come about?Ultimately, it also came time to do a collection book of all the journalism that I'd done for Rolling Stone and other places in the day, because I'd gone back and re-interviewed a lot of those people again. And that was my little long-term project. But it turned out that this [memoir] was a good kind of first chapter to all of that. It's about finding your voice. One person that you meet, interviewing them for the magazine introduces you to another person, and that chain link fence becomes your life and your dream. The book is really about that.

Is that other book still coming out?Yeah, that's the next stage. It comes out next year. You saved everything from your past, from backstage passes to a doodle David Bowie drew you. It must have made writing easier. I kept everything, because why not? They're souvenirs from a front row seat. My dream was always, if I get a front row seat, I want to put you in the seat next to me. It's like, “Here's what it is to really be in the middle of all of it, and to do diary pieces from within that hurricane.”


	The idea, Angie, is to just write a letter to a friend. Don't write for the world, don't write to be a writer with a capital W. It's kind of like when people write about Bob Dylan, they feel the need to swing in the arena with Bob Dylan. It's like, “No, don't do that. Get out of the way.” [I wanted to] write this in a way so that it feels like somebody is talking to just one person. It's you and them late at night and you're just saying, “Here's what it was like, can you believe it?” That's the tone that I love the most.


How long did it take to complete? When we spoke in 2020, you were already working on it.I kept adding and adding and adding to it, realizing, “You know what? Jerry Garcia was really an amazing interview.” I was a little guy living in San Francisco, and I'm back here now. I'm going to go back into the book and add the stuff about Jerry Garcia, because that was really pivotal for me in a certain way. It was fun to keep introducing people to what's behind the Wikipedia page on some of your favorite artists. Because over time, you get reduced to whatever that Wikipedia page is.I just kept thinking, it isn't a celebrity memoir: “Here are all of the secrets I've had in my back pocket to finally tell!” It was a little bit like, “You should meet the David Bowie that I got to meet. You should meet the guy that was giving me a ride home at 6:30 in the morning from the Station to Station sessions, going, [British accent] ‘Do I turn left or right here at this street to drop you off, you who has no driver's license?'” That guy was a really generous human being that wanted to help my writing voice, by just throwing stuff at me from his life. That was a growth step that you could never have imagined, and resonates constantly with me. So that was an important part of the book to write about.

The memoir ends in the early Eighties, right when your film career is starting. Why did you decide to cap it there?That was when a new door opened — the door to making movies and taking a step into this really unknown world. That, to me, feels like a whole other life happened. But everything I've done has a very obvious road to music.Tom Petty was responsible for that door opening, while you were conducting interviews for the 1983 doc Heartbreakers Beach Party.He says, “Pick up the camera and film this.” I'm like, “There's no director around.” [He said] “Pick up the camera!” And he does this song, ‘I'm Stupid,' right into the camera. I'm like, “This is amazing. This feeling doesn't happen when you're transcribing 12 hours of interviews in the middle of the night. This is going right to the center of the creative process.” Cut. He goes, “Congratulations, you're a director.”Each chapter here is like a snapshot of profile subjects.Yeah. It's kind of like, let them be singles that amount to an album. I've always loved the books that you could carry with you in a backpack and just pull out at any given point when you have 20 minutes, and flip through it and get a feeling. You just want to keep them close. They're not huge coffee table books or anything. They're always kind of like Patti Smith's book [2010's Just Kids]. It travels well. You really feel like you got a friend in that book. That's what I was going for.You also tell your family history here. I imagine that was therapeutic in a way, since most people only know the fictionalized version of your family in Almost Famous.Yeah. There was a happy/sad quality about growing up in the desert in Palm Springs, and later in San Diego, where music really suited that. I hadn't written about Southern California at that time ever before. It's such a vivid memory, and that's a part of what I love about music. It's one of those places that you go to in your heart and your mind. It's like Joni's song, “My Secret Place.” To write about that world was really satisfying.


We all know about your mom, Alice, and your sister, Cindy, who were portrayed in the film. Did you ever think to include your father, or your late sister, Cathy, in the movie?No. My oldest sister has always been there on my shoulder. She's been such a huge presence, and she's been gone for a long time. Obviously when you're 10 years old and you lose a sibling who's 19, it's like, “Well, they were an adult.” So I always thought of her as an adult. And then you get older and you realize she was a teenager. She never got out of her teens. She was living in that world and she loved Brian Wilson. Brian Wilson was that nearest faraway place and she gave that to me. Over time, I realized how much I owe her, and my sister Cindy. The book's a lot for them.

	











Cathy was a huge Beach Boys fan. Knowing that now, I view that “Feel Flows” scene in Almost Famous differently.I had heard a story from someone who had gone to see Almost Famous in the theater, and when the movie was over and the lights came up, there was somebody crying behind him. And my friend turned around and it was Brian Wilson. He said, “Hey Brian, why are you crying?” He goes, “Because that's my brother. That was my brother singing that song.” And that to me was like, “Walk away.” If this film burns in a lightning blast five minutes from now, I'm good. Those are the little victories along the way, where the music person inside of you was like, “Yes.” 


The book begins in 2019, when you're at rehearsals for the Almost Famous musical. You're on the phone with your mom, and you scream, “I want my old life back!” What did you mean by that?When I was directing and doing everything myself, and looking forward rather than potentially looking backward. And the richness that could be mined from looking backwards in a format that I didn't know, which was musical theater. So it was kind of that cry for help that was supposed to happen unheard by anyone else, but one of the crew was just a few feet away smoking a cigarette and heard everything. So I wanted to write about that in the book, too. The act of looking back is very dangerous.


You write that you didn't see a lot of rock & roll excess at first. At what point did you witness it?Being backstage interviewing Steve Marriott from Humble Pie. I come from a school teacher mother. Drugs are the enemy. He has a green Heineken in his hand and he's in the locker room of the San Diego Sports Arena, and the conversation's going really well. And then from his other hand comes the biggest hash joint I could have ever imagined. It was out of a Robert Crumb cartoon. It was so huge, and I was like, “What do I do if he offers it to me?” And he did, and I was like, “No thanks. Not today.” He's like, “Smart, more for me.” And I heard that forever, since that day.


	If you don't do the drugs that you see, you're not there to party with them, and you send that message, which is cool. The huge excess was kept from me a lot, though I saw the hint of some of it around the edges. Sometimes, you can say a lot in between the lines. Grover Lewis did that big profile of the Allman Brothers Band [in 1971] before I did mine, and he just went right into a kind of procedural explanation of the drugs everybody was doing. I didn't want to do that, because that felt like a police report. 


	It's a case-by-case basis. Some [musicians] are like, “Yeah, write about anything!” or you sense that about them, and you do. Other people you feel like, “I just want to write about the creative process, and I'm not interested in partying with you until two a.m., so I'll leave at midnight.” 

	











You did indulge sometimes, though. You write that you had a Pimm's cup with Ron Wood, and planted some seeds from Bob Marley's weed in your backyard. [Laughs.] Thanks. There was a siesta hour from time to time, but mostly, you're never going to get the story done or delivered in time if you're that guy who is there for a dual purpose. And I think there's a kind of journalist that gets filtered out of the process pretty quickly if you realize that they're there to make friends more than write something from the heart.


This is a good time to talk about your baby face. You write that you were kicked out of clubs for being underage, but it also made musicians trust you. I see it as a blessing and a curse.I grew some facial hair in the early Nineties when I was living in Seattle, and that was really a mistake. People that saw that were like, “No, no, no, no, that look is not you. Just stop that, here's this razor, go get rid of that.”In 1975, you got a Rolling Stone assignment that was a bit different from your usual beat. It was an essay titled “How I Learned About Sex.”I ended up putting this in the book at the last minute, too. Tim Cahill was an editor that worked with me a little bit on the Allman Brothers story. He called me up and said, “I want you to do something that's not about music.” I'm like, “Sounds great!” And he said, “It's the men's issue.” And I'm like, “Fantastic!” And he goes, “The subject is how you learned about sex.” And I'm like, “Gr—great!” And then proceeded to die on the vine trying to write this story. At the last minute, I just spewed out a lot of the embarrassing stuff that I never wanted to tell anybody, and sent it in.The call was instantaneous. He was like, “This is what you should be doing. This is real writing. I laughed my ass off. Wow, this is embarrassing.” The embarrassing stuff is what people always love. Be personal, but don't overtake the story, was the lesson I took from that at.You wrote cover stories on Led Zeppelin and Joni Mitchell — musicians who weren't exactly fans of Rolling Stone. The former is particularly impressive: you convinced Jimmy Page to do the cover while he was eating a bowl of cereal.I'm telling you, I'm still shocked it happened. That was a line that was never supposed to be crossed, Led Zeppelin appearing in Rolling Stone. But it was the music fan in him that really helped that happen, because I had a bootleg tape of a Joni Mitchell interview from Canada, and he's a fan, and he wanted to hear it.And you never got it back.I never got it back. I finally got another copy of that interview a couple of weeks ago, so it came home to roost in some way or another.


You got to witness now-legendary songs in concert when they were brand new. Material from Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti, the Who's Quadrophenia, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's “Simple Man.” Did you have a feeling at the time they'd become classics? That's a really good question. It felt classic in the moment. [Photographer] Neal Preston and I would go back to the hotel room and recap at the end of these wonderful nights. You just wanted to take those little moments and treasure them. How much better can it get than Lynyrd Skynyrd at Winterland with Ronnie Van Zandt barefoot? We had that feeling a lot: “If it's this good now, how good is it going to be? This is one of the best rock shows ever.” And it was. That thing — that white-hot moment for rock — was never the same in that way again.


You went fishing with Van Zandt in Hawaii. Was he any good?None of us caught anything, but he was a really good fisherman. He reminded me of Duane Allman on the cover of one of those archives albums, where you've never seen a guy more comfortable holding a fishing rod. This is what this guy is meant to hold in life. And most importantly, he knew how to have fun catching not one bite. It was just a wonderful afternoon.Mistakenly, I'd recorded a little bit of that, and heard it back in the context of a mixtape that I didn't even realize had them recorded on it. This was some time ago, but I was in the kitchen listening to this mixtape. It was like, Paul McCartney and Wings' “Beware My Love.” And there was Ronnie and the guys from Lynyrd Skynyrd from years earlier fishing, laughing, talking about music, and it all came back. And then with a click, it went back into “Beware My Love.” And I was just like, “Fuck, man.” And I've not let it in because I have been so sad since Ronnie died, but I started listening to Skynyrd again after that.You also interviewed Gram Parsons and Jim Croce, who both died a day apart, in Sept. 1973.You tend to really be imprinted by the first people that you knew who died in your life. They took the time to really bond. Jim Croce even more than Gram Parsons, but you have this indelible time where they reveal part of themselves to you and trust you. That was so vivid to be 15 and have Jim Croce say, “This guy is here to interview us!” And I was just sitting in the wrong dressing room. But the guy ended up just telling stories, and I ditched school the next day and there were more stories. I just felt like, “I'm meeting people that get me as opposed to some of the people at school.” And then he died, and Gram was gone in an odd, mystical way. So there was a feeling at the time of, “Grab this time around your heroes, because there's a danger and sometimes there's a body count in this business of people in their little planes.” I was always scared of little planes.What's the best piece of advice you've ever gotten?Act like you belong until you do belong. 

	











What about from the Eagles' Glenn Frey? I know he loved to pass down his wisdom to you.Oh, man. I put that into a scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It's spoken over a cardboard cutout of Debbie Harry, which is like, “If they can't smell your qualifications, move on.” I felt like Debbie Harry when Glenn was telling me this. He was such a student of how to slip into a room and make everybody part of your sport, which is, “Let's all do great stuff together.” That was the sport of Glenn Frey. And along the way, if somebody tries to hold you back, move on. Don't let it get you down. If they can't smell your qualifications, fuck them.


You once left your wallet in the bathroom at CBGB, and Dee Dee Ramone helped himself to $75. Did you ever tell him you knew he stole it?No, I did not. I don't think people would really imagine that I would've been around the Ramones when the Ramones were first starting. It's kind of like, “What happened? Why didn't he stick with the Ramones?” But I was moving back to California, and I think it was a little bit like I was leaving their wonderful land, their wonderful kingdom, never to return, when I was moving to California again. But being around them at that pivotal time was amazing. I felt sad that he had to steal some money from me, but I knew that if people were able to appreciate how unique the Ramones were, that things would be OK, at least for a while.


You also had an unpleasant encounter with Lou Reed while in New York.And apparently it continued throughout his entire life, because I spoke to somebody who was friends with him, and I was like, “Yeah, I always wondered what he thought of Almost Famous, when Philip Seymour Hoffman and Patrick Fugit debate the relevance of Lou Reed and his association with David Bowie.” And the person I was talking to said, “Oh, let me end the mystery. He didn't like it and he wasn't a fan of yours either.” I'm sorry to Lou Reed [Laughs.] It didn't go his way in that scene.


What advice do you wish you could give your younger self?Keep everything. Because one day you'll be able to look at this souvenir that means so much to you, whether it's a tape of somebody talking or something somebody gave you, and it will all come back and you will have this moment again. 


Do you ever regret jumping straight into adulthood as a teenager and missing out on that period of your life?I do. I miss some of those things. Some of the things I've been able to go back and check the box on. That's a thing that I'd always had as a conversation with my sister, Cindy, because she had a message for me, which is, “Take time to be an adolescent.” Take time to live the life of the people that are in those audiences while you're lucky enough to be in those crowds. Did you ever want to have fun like them as opposed to having to run home and transcribe and have a story done within days? Will you miss one day, the other life?So yes and no. When I really think about it, I wouldn't trade the life that I was able to have in those years, and I was very happy to write the book and share the highs and lows of that whole period. So I think some people think like, “You had a charmed life, you got to do all that, and you were doing stories when you were young.” It's like, “No, there were a lot of hills and valleys.” But it was worth it because you should do the thing that you can't say no to, and that was writing about music, particularly in that time.You were briefly in a high school band, the Masked Hamster. Do you ever think about what would have happened had you not gotten kicked out, or was it just a hobby?[Laughs] Do you know how amazing it is to be asked that question? The Masked Hamster is actually a band we can talk about. Maybe that was my dream. I don't know, man. If I had been able to play “I Can't Explain” properly with a band, I may have never written another word. I was so happy in that moment, but I guess I just summoned that pleasure in another way, because I was really not meant to be a musician.

	











What about if you'd stayed writing for Rolling Stone, and hadn't moved onto directing? Do you ever think about what would've happened?I do a lot, because [film] barely happened. Fast Times was definitely put on the most back of back burners by the studio, and it really was like a death march to the movie being released. So those dreams did not exist. When people started showing up in Spicoli Vans, it was like, “What? This is a miracle.” But I would've kept on writing. I think I would've written stories like Ray Bradbury, because he had wit and soul to him, which was the stuff that I always loved. When there was a little meat on the bone, but it was also fun. Ray Bradbury would've been my guiding light. 


The media landscape is drastically different now than it was in 1972.Journalists are being laid off hugely all the time, and it's tragic. So that's a reason to wave the flag for journalism. You are a journalistic hero. You're out there doing stuff at a time when it's hard to spend a couple thousand words writing about Judee Sill. So there is a nobility to that, but it's also just like being a journalist has been trivialized as a job. They've been the butt of jokes lately, and it's ridiculous. If this book does anything, I would really love for it to get across the joy of what it is to be a journalist when things are really cooking and you are there exploring something that's near and dear to your heart, and you can write about it, that is a hugely important thing.It's tougher now than it was, but it's more immediate, which is great. You can immediately find out about last night's show with Neil Young. You can immediately find out how the set lists are changing. So media is really wonderful that way. 


Do you think that social media has robbed rock stars of their mystique?Absolutely. There's so many outlets and a million podcasts. To find an artist who shrouds themselves in just a little bit of mystery is a beautiful thing, but it's so hard for them to drop an album. There has to be a campaign. And once you're campaigning, you've lost mystique. So the ball game is to keep people interested in that magic thing that happens when you capture a feeling, and not talk about it and dissect it and sell it so much that it loses its power. So this is the daily battle that we wage.


What's the best and worst part about success?The best part of success is that people can know that you have a voice and you can meet with an actor that you're interested in working with or call and ask for access to an artist that you know or appreciate or want to write about, and they might know your work. That's the best part.The hardest part about success is … I don't know, it all feels like a gift. When I was first starting to write, James L. Brooks told me, “Buddy, think of the privilege we have. We got the greatest job in the world. We get to tell stories.” And I still feel that every day. 


What did you learn from the Almost Famous musical?In San Diego, it was a smaller, heartfelt thing. It ended up being something that was completed by my mom dying, which I'd never thought would happen. The emotion of her dying just bled through the cast. They took the baton of everything that had happened, and did it for my mom. And then Covid happened, and it was rolling the boulder back up a very bigger hill. And I think we learned, once again, what we already knew, which is the most personal and passionate version of the show is the show to do. There's going to be a performance of it in Connecticut in October. So we did some more work on it, just to use what we learned from the Broadway experience. It's a living, growing thing, and I learned a lot.

	











I'm sure the negative reviews were hard to swallow.Yeah. I just will always remember Casey Likes the day after, when a lot of the reviews had hit. Here comes the kid who's playing you as a young guy, an optimistic young warrior. Here he is leaping down the street, literally jumping, saying, “This just makes me want to do better and better and better!” It was an amazing moment that I'll never forget. These things all take time. Scripts take time and plays take time, and bands take time and songs take time. It's the beautiful journey.


The memoir is a great way to introduce younger audiences to your writing, who are mostly familiar with you as a director.Yeah. Led by this thing that I did grow up with, which is, “Put on your magic shoes.” Everybody always says “you can do anything” to a young person growing up. I actually believed it. There was only one person in the whole time at Rolling Stone that ever said, “You're too young to be able to write about me.” Everybody else was like, “OK, sit down. What else you got?”Who was that?Steve Miller.

“Hell is waiting for you. I'll be your nightmare forever,” Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is told at gunpoint in one of the most thrilling sequences of Kiyoshi Kurosawa‘s career in “Cloud.”

It's a line, though, that could apply across the Japanese filmmaker's work, whether the specters in the machine stalking a post-Y2K digital realm in “Pulse” or the elusive serial killer who seems to operate by hypnosis in “Cure,” one of the very best horror movies ever made.

“Cloud” is Kurosawa's first movie to weld his techno anxieties to a Western framework, as his movie about a sociopath-adjacent internet reseller and hoarder culminates in the grandest action set piece yet from the filmmaker. And it turns out, Kurosawa intended “Cloud” as homage to American action thrillers like Sam Peckinpah's “Straw Dogs.”

IndieWire exclusively announces that “Cloud,” which played U.S. theaters over the summer and was Japan's submission for the 2025 Best International Feature Oscar, will begin streaming on the Criterion Channel on Tuesday, October 7. The film will premiere alongside a new interview with Kurosawa, part of Criterion's Meet the Filmmakers series, and IndieWire shares an exclusive clip from that interview in the video above.

 










That same day, “Cloud” will also become available for TVOD rentals on Apple TV, Prime Video, and Fandango at Home. A home-video release will follow next February.

“I had the desire to shoot the kind of action scenes often seen in American films. However, I knew that to do something like that for Japanese audiences, I would have to choose a completely different type of character to focus on. Like a yakuza, a police officer, or the Japan Self-Defense Force. I really didn't want to do that. That's why I wanted the protagonist to be an average guy who typically avoids heated confrontation but gets caught up in what could be called a shootout,” Kurosawa says in the clip. 

“A protagonist who has no connection to violence whatsoever, yet ultimately becomes a participant in a kind of carnage. When it comes to such a story, I immediately thought of ‘Straw Dogs.' It's a gruesome action film … with not a single positive thing about it. I don't reference Straw Dogs in every scene, but everyone who sees ‘Cloud' immediately notices the resemblance. Since this is a film where people who have never even held a handgun engage in what you would call action… and murder each other, I knew from the start it'd never be popcorn entertainment. What would happen if someone who had never considered or experienced such a thing suddenly held something that could kill another person?”

 










IndieWire's David Ehrlich also raved about “Cloud” circa Venice last year, writing, “‘Cloud' updates the filmmaker's signature focus for a modern world that's enmeshed in an infinite (but invisible) network of small cruelties and bitter grievances — a network so ubiquitous that even the better angels of our nature might drive us straight into hell. Almost too mundane to care about until it becomes impossible to stop watching for much the same reason, this riveting and highly unusual shoot-em-up finds Kurosawa returning to his roots, only to discover that psychological terror isn't quite as abstract as it used to be.”

I haven't run the exact numbers, but I'm pretty sure I must have watched, read, or played at least a hundred different stories about revenge over the course of my life—despite the actual opportunities for vengeance cropping up in that same period being, basically, nil. Am I living my life wrong, that the chance to dig two graves (one for my target, and one for the giant pile of clichés I'll have to cut my way through to get to them) just doesn't come up in my day-to-day? Am I not swearing enough oaths? The people in Ghost Of Yōtei can't seem to go five minutes without swearing a blood-soaked oath about something. It's one of about a dozen things that makes the samurai video game sequel one of the most aggressively dull games I've played in recent memory.

Like its predecessor, 2020's Ghost Of Tsushima, Yōtei puts its best foot immediately forward: Studio Sucker Punch Entertainment has made a very pretty video game here, depicting the wide, rolling plains and epic vistas of Northern Japan with meticulous and cinematic detail. From the mountain that lends the game its title—and dominates its skyline—to the vast fields of wildflowers you go racing through on horseback on your way to your next avengin', Yōtei is undeniably gorgeous, as good a technical pitch as anyone's ever crafted for the PlayStation 5 hardware. No game has ever been more readily and clearly made for the existence of its own Photo Mode—and if you sense some contempt in that sentence, well, yeah, absolutely.

I admittedly gushed about Tsushima's visuals back in my 2020 review, using the word “beautiful” fully six times in the body of my write-up. (To let my past self off the hook a bit, we were three months into the pandemic lockdowns, and anything that wasn't the walls of my living room or the inside of my own eyelids was feeling pretty goddamn lustrous by that point.) But the elegance of Tsushima's landscapes also felt genuinely novel at the time, an escalation in what a video game world could look like. Meanwhile, five years of new hardware (and other developers playing catch-up) have only revealed how quickly this kind of visual spectacle can start to feel rote. Yes, Yōtei is pretty—but it's pretty in a way where you can slurp up all of that beauty simply by watching its trailer a couple of times. You see it, register “Pretty!” in your head, and then feel nothing beyond it; none of the game's aesthetic flourishes feel like they're in service of anything meaningful, beyond filling out a roll of eye-catching PR screenshots, and the actual effect often comes off as busy, more than jaw-dropping.



All of that panoramic showing off feels decidedly disconnected, for instance, from the game's plot, which drops you into the boots of hardened vengeance seeker Atsu (Erika Ishii, at least in the game's English voice track). As quickly sketched in Yōtei's opening minutes—and then fleshed out with early flashbacks that mark one of the game's rare narrative high points—Atsu gets her motivations straight out of The Big Book Of Plots You've Seen A Million Times Already: Happy childhood, murdered family, list of mask-themed murder targets who've each conveniently migrated to one corner of the game's massive, icon-strewn map. When not distracted by the nine million chores waiting to intrude on her quest for solitary vengeance, Atsu masters new weapons, pursues her targets, and serves as the subject of god only knows how many lectures about the pointlessness of sanguine revenge.

I will note, for the sake of transparency, that I have not finished Ghost Of Yōtei, with this review representing 20 hours of dedicated play. It is certainly possible that the game's later sections contain at least one narrative moment that I had not already seen in any five other movies or games you might care to name on this topic; if so, I'd suggest Sucker Punch move that moment forward, so as to make their game's first-through-twentieth impressions a little less dire. As is, Ishii gives a low-key but winning performance as Atsu, but the dialogue is so flat, and the stories being told so rife with samurai film clichés, that I found myself actively heckling the writing as I made my way through beat after tired beat. Even when the game tries to make a plot moment zig or zag—would you believe, dear reader, that the bad guys have internal lives and motivations that lend shading to the cartoonish cruelty with which they orphaned our heroine?—the overall tone is so relentlessly dour that you can predict every single emotional pivot of every single character's arc with only the barest understanding of how these kinds of stories usually go.

This basic unwillingness to present players with anything they haven't seen before extends equally to the game's play. Combat is presented with exciting trappings, with enemies hitting hard enough (and in big enough groups) to frequently put Atsu on her back foot, forcing you to burn resources to heal. But after a few hours (and a few upgrades), the game's fights essentially solve themselves, as you learn to spam parry/block for everything except the handful of enemy moves immune to it, while switching between Atsu's growing arsenal of weapons in order to counter different foe loadouts. (Each new weapon involves studying under a different master, allowing Yōtei to add training tropes to its gigantic grabbag of clichés.) Big climactic fights can be exciting, as the game's intimidating boss enemies run Atsu through her paces. But by that 20th hour, I was starting to take hits in mook fights not due to difficulty, but because I was getting so bored of the fighting that my attention would flag—a death knell for a game where the thrills of combat are among its biggest ostensible selling points.

Yōtei is somehow even less innovative, meanwhile, in its exploration gameplay, as Atsu takes time out from her critical race towards vengeance to paint pictures, hunt bounties, climb mountains, cook food, pray at shrines, gobble up hundreds of pieces of crafting litter, and befriend the wildlife of Hokkaido. No one instance of this stuff is offensive, and a few of the mission types, like a series of map objectives that see you rescue hunted wolves to empower Atsu's occasional animal companion, can round out to being pretty exciting. 

But just as equally, no one instance of them is something you haven't done in a game of this type before, whether it's summoning your Magically Teleporting Horse to come running up from behind you, or climbing carefully color-coded rocks, or poking around at the Dual Shock 5's touch pad to do little extra bits of interactivity like lighting fires or cooking fish. And none of it will ever leave you alone. Repeating Tsushima's one truly great map game trick—the blowing wind that guides the player to their chosen objectives—to massively diminishing returns, Yōtei constantly reminds you that there's more crap to pick up just over that next beautifully realized hill. With collectibles glinting in the sunlight, navigation-aiding birds and foxes suddenly swooping into frame, and the air itself pushing you toward yet another completion point, the game sometimes feels like reality itself is screaming at you to do more, get more, play more. No individual reward (beyond the initial slate of skill points that gets Atsu's basic combat powers online) feels terribly meaningful, but the game's Skinner box side has been carefully calibrated to keep you moving toward the next thing on the horizon, basically forever.

Some of the gameplay elements that Ghost Of Yōtei so aggressively replicates are fun, pretty much by default. Sneaking around an enemy camp and slowly merking every single guy inside it, for instance, is always going to carry a thrill, even when developers choose not to do much new with the template. (With the exception of the ability to sometimes call in your wolf pal to help you, stealth combat is pretty much unchanged from Tsushima: Sneak, stab, get caught, giant fight, repeat.) Everything presented here, with the exception of the word-to-word writing, is baseline competent, and frequently fun in small doses. As a way to turn hours of human life into a vague sense of accomplishment, the game ticks all the necessary boxes.

But, god, there's something spiritually draining about seeing this much effort, and this many resources, thrown at a game that doesn't seem to have a single creative idea running through its pretty, massive head. It's not just that Ghost Of Yōtei has nothing new to say about revenge. (Like I said up top, pretty much no vengeance-minded story seems capable of cracking that one.) But it also has nothing new to say about sword combat in video games. Or open-world map design. Or crafting systems. Or sibling relationships. Or melancholy. Or how climbing should work in games that sure have a lot of it, while paradoxically not seeming to give two shits about how it feels. It feints at some of these things, some of the time. It throws dozens of upgrades, cosmetic changes, and other little customization elements at you, constantly, to create an illusion of choice. It pours enormous amounts of time and energy into creating the tone and texture of the samurai movies its creators are so clearly obsessed with.

But none of it arrives with any genuine impact, because genuine impact would get in the way of easing the player toward the next simple set of tasks, to keeping them hooked on the ride. The fact is, you've played this game before. You'll almost certainly wind up playing it again. It'll pass through you like water—or maybe a gorgeously decorated bowl of gruel—and that's both Ghost Of Yōtei's blessing, and its curse.

Apple TV+‘s French-language thriller series The Hunt has begun its march to launch.


	The series now has a pair of first-look images and a global release date on the streamer: December 3. On that date, two episodes will drop, one then following each week through December 31.


The Hunt, known in France as Traqués (fka A L'Ombre des Forêts) comes from César-nominated director Cédric Anger (Next Time I'll Aim for the Heart), who is creator and director, and stars Benoît Megimel (Pacifiction) and Mélanie Laurent (Inglorious Basterds). Lupin maker Gaumont is the producer, with Isabelle Degeorges, Clémentine Vaudaux, Alexis Barqueiro and Sidonie Dumas the exec producers.

	In the show, Franck (Magimel) and his longtime friends, who spend weekends hunting together, come across another group who begin targeting them for no apparent reason. Despite one of their group being shot, they strike back and manage to escape. However, as Franck goes back to his normal life with wife Krystel (Laurent), he senses he is being watched or tracked by hunters now hell-bent on revenge.

	Damien Bonnard, Manuel Guillot, Cédric Appietto, Angelyna Danabe-Mignot, Paul Beaurepaire, Yann Goven, Sarah Pachoud and Patrick De Vallette also star.


The Hunt will be Apple TV+'s fourth original French-language show after the International Emmy-winning fine wine thriller drama Drops of God, celebrity chef drama Carême and high-stakes thriller Liaison starring Vincent Cassel and Eva Green.

Liev Schreiber, Mayim Bialik, and Greg Berlanti are among 1,200 industry figures who have signed an open letter decrying an Israeli film boycott.


	Organized by non-profit Creative Community For Peace, the letter (read in full below) described the Film Workers for Palestine boycott, signed by the likes of Mark Ruffalo and Olivia Colman, as “discriminatory and antisemitic.”


	The Creative Community For Peace letter, signed by others including Debra Messing and Sharon Osbourne, referred to the rival pledge as an act of “censorship” and “erasure of art.”

	The letter said: “Israel's entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.”

	











	It continued: “We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponized and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.”


	The letter concluded: “We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.”


	The Film Workers for Palestine boycott was published earlier this month. It has gathered signatories including Emma Stone, Peter Sarsgaard, Lily Gladstone, Elliot Page, and Joaquin Phoenix.


	The pledge said: “We pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions—including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies—that are implicated* in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”


Full Creative Community For Peace letter (signatories here):


To our fellow artists and the global film community,












We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.


The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.


To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.


Israel's film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel's film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistently program dissent.


Israel's entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.


The pledge uses nebulous terms like ‘implicating' and ‘complicity.' Who will decide which Israeli filmmakers and film institutions are ‘complicit'? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is ‘complicity' just a pretext to boycott all Israelis and Zionists — 95% of the world's Jewish population — no matter what they create or believe?


History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence filmmakers before: Nazi Germany's propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood's own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.


We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponized and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimizes falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.


If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support filmmakers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.


Let art speak the whole truth.


We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.

As a Jew, it's incredibly insulting to have my fair criticisms of Israel for its egregious handling of Palestinian territory described as anti-semitic.

WELL DONE !!!!!!

I agree because that would be like other Countries boycotting our film industry because we have an evil orange monster for a President who constantly does horrific actions. They are blaming the wrong people. The film industry in Israel is not responsible for their evil leader just like we aren't responsible for the actions our evil leader is doing.

In general art and artists should not be boycotted. It won't end a war and may only incite more hatred toward Israel and possibly Jewish people. On the other hand if the Israeli film industry gets funding from the Israeli government then you can see why some might feel there is an issue. But I think there are better ways to oppose Israel's actions in Gaza than protesting their film industry.

Bravo that they are standing up and voicing the blatant antisemitism.

Rihanna is now a proud mother of three. The musician announced on social media that she gave birth to a baby girl named Rocki Irish Mayers on Saturday, September 13. She had revealed her pregnancy in May on the carpet for the 2025 Met Gala.

Rihanna and her partner, A$AP Rocky, welcomed their first child, RZA Athelston Mayers, in 2022, and the singer gave birth to her second son, Riot Rose Mayers, in 2023. Despite the couple's predilection for “R” names, A$AP Rocky (who was born Rakim Athelston Mayers) had recently joked to GQ that he might name his third child Denzel, in honor of his Highest 2 Lowest co-star Denzel Washington.

							By 

	Alyssa Mercante



	A woman stands in the doorway of a burning building, the large brim of a hat obscuring her face, her yellow hakamashita dappled red with blood. Fire dances off the hilt of the katana in her hand. Death lies in her wake. “Onryō!” the villagers hiss as she mounts a horse and disappears behind the veil of night, evoking the folk tales of vengeful ghosts who refuse to depart this mortal plane in search of revenge. 


	This Ghost of Yōtei haunts the red maple forests and stalks the snowy tundra in search of those whose names are written on the sash wrapped around her waist. She won't stop until each name is crossed out in blood, and her image is soon plastered on bounty posters across the land. Shrines crop up in her honor — both from those who wish to avoid her wrath and others who approve of her killings. 


	Who is this Ghost of Yōtei? Is she woman or yūrei?


Ghost of Yōtei (out Oct. 2), Sucker Punch's standalone sequel to 2020's action-adventure game, Ghost of Tsushima, centers around protagonist Atsu (Erika Ishii), who lost her family at the hands of a brutal lord and dedicates her life to avenging them. Like the 1973 film Lady Snowblood (and the movie it inspired, Kill Bill), Atsu tears across the beautiful but troubled lands resting in the shadow of Mount Yōtei in search of revenge, leaving behind a bloody trail as she learns much about herself in the process.

	











	Five years after the release of its predecessor, Yōtei expands upon Tsushima in every direction — its characters are more complex, its story more gripping, and its visuals more stunning. In Yōtei, the series' beautiful music is tied even closer to its narrative, as is the franchise's impressive flora and fauna. 

	











Yōtei's world is larger, and you explore it differently — willing settlers and unwilling rōnin with a katana at their gullet will offer hints about hot springs, wolf dens, shrines, and altars, all of which will help progress your build. You can use those hints to help pinpoint their location, an oral cartography that fills in the map bit by bit.

	Atsu is a mercenary, not a samurai, so she doesn't need to fight in accordance with their rigid values. Because of this, Yōtei's combat is much more varied and fun than Tsushima's. Rather than swapping katana stances to fight different enemies, Yōtei gives players several different weapons (though you'll need to complete missions to get them). 


	You can beat baddies into a bloody pulp with dual katanas, a spear, a kusarigama, or an ōdachi, and swap between them on the fly (a lid for every pot, yada yada). A kusarigama's iron weight can be swung to bash through enemy shields, a dual katana better deflects incoming spears, and a single katana always stands strongest against its mirror.


	Swapping between weapons when facing a barrage of enemies can be a bit of a struggle, especially when they're wielding a variety of weapons, but thankfully, Atsu's dodging and parrying skills should make up for panicked swaps. As she progresses through her skill tree, Atsu can deflect away incoming arrows, unleash a flurry of dual-katana strikes, and temporarily sheath her katana just to pull it out and gut an enemy in one swift motion. 


	Couple that with the throwables in her arsenal (kunai that you can upgrade to light enemies ablaze, metsubushi powder to blind them, shinobi bombs that sheathe you in smoke), and Atsu is a much more formidable fighter than Tsushima's Jin Sakai. I dreaded large battles in Tsushima, even avoided them, but welcome them in Yōtei. There are few things more satisfying than embedding a kusarigama in a man's skull right after he hurls insults at you, then turning on a dime to throw fiery kunai at the chest of a big brute, his screams echoing through the forest.

	If you prefer to be a bit more demure in doling out death, Yōtei improves upon Tsushima's stealth gameplay. Atsu has an entire skill tree dedicated to sneaking, and you can still take out enemies silently from afar with the thrum of a bowstring or disappear amidst the fog of a smoke bomb. It may not satisfy players who prefer stealth, but it's more than enough for me.

	











	If Ghost of Tsushima was a feast for the senses, Ghost of Yōtei is a buffet (and I'm about to get kicked out after going for my fourth plate of lobster claws). There are many lovely details that Sucker Punch was clearly given the time, space, and budget to labor over. 


Tsushima made use of the DualSense controller's haptic feedback in a few, simple ways: the tension of a pulled bow string, the vibration of a cat's purrs, the clinging of katana blades. Yōtei takes the controller and makes it feel like a real-world multi-tool.


	In the opening moments, your fingers act as Atsu's brushstrokes as she writes the names of her enemies on her sash, swiping up, down, and across the DualSense pad like you're painting the characters. Lifting the controller and swinging it swiftly down hammers steel at Atsu's family forge, gently pulling the trigger urges a campfire's tendrils higher, while tilting it this way and that lowers mushrooms further into that fire for cooking.


Yōtei organically melds the DualSense's capabilities with diegetic gameplay, all of which urge you to explore more of this world and whisper in your ear, “What's another hour or two more?”


	It's obvious from the opening moments that Ghost of Yōtei was built from the ground up for PS5 (Tsushima originally launched for PS4 in July 2020). Atsu jumps on horseback, and the screen narrows and stretches like you're sitting in a movie theater, the grassland of Ezo sprawling in every direction, Mount Yōtei's snowcapped peak resting in the distance. At one point, Atsu climbs its range and skirts along the mouth of the dormant volcano, which spreads like an impossibly massive maw in every direction (Yōtei is pushing the limits of draw-distance tech). 


	There are visuals seared into my brain: Atsu and her horse galloping across a frozen lake that looks like blue lace agate; Atsu making camp under the green streaks of the aurora borealis; red maple leaves careening and pinwheeling in the wind in Atsu's wake. It may be the most beautiful game I've ever played.


	But Yōtei's beauty isn't superficial, nor is it an attempt to distract from its gameplay or its story. Players will want to explore Ezo to see more splendor, sure, but will also want to kill that rōnin they can barely make out that's camping in an open field, and will definitely want to know why that one samurai at the checkpoint looks so familiar. Every element is enveloping, pulling you in until it's time to awaken from the fugue state at 2 a.m., bleary-eyed, the screen blinking a warning about the DualSense's battery life. 

	











	Whereas Tsushima slowly peels back the layers of protagonist Jin like a stubborn taro root, Yōtei tells us exactly who Atsu is from the outset: an angry young woman, doggedly chasing vengeance across an island picked apart by selfish lords and the samurai who serve them. She is single-minded and short-tempered, preferring the company of foxes, wolves, and her horse (whom I named Shimaki in my play-through) to people. 


	Atsu is no onryō, but she has a supernatural air about her — wolves suddenly appear to help turn the tide in a battle, launching at her enemies' throats or latching onto their outstretched arms. If she kills enough foes without taking damage, she can invoke the Onryō Shout, which shakes the ground upon which she treads and sends her foes stumbling backward in fear. 


	Yet she rebukes the onryō title, and wonders why they “have to die to get revenge.” Atsu “won't be someone's bedtime story,” and wants desperately to define herself, yet she is taciturn, hoping that her actions will tell her tale, and frustrated when she doesn't like how it's told. 


	The more time I spend with Atsu, the more it's clear she has the heart of a young, traumatized girl, encased in a woman's body. That young girl was stubborn and tomboyish and skilled with a katana, yes, but she was also soft and sweet. She wanted to raise horses when she grew up, but instead spent the last sixteen years as a mercenary in war-torn lands, only to return home and realize that the very people who ruined her life are destroying everyone else's.


	Despite Atsu's scary reputation and the horrors of its world, Yōtei is softer and more sensitive than Tsushima. There are dozens of little moments of quiet kindness and profound mourning, of gentle reflection and solemnity, of nature reaching out to Atsu, and by proxy, the player.


	Birds flit around Atsu's head and lead her to points of interest. Foxes tap their toes excitedly while she chops bamboo. When she rests at a hot spring, neck deep in cloud-blue water, a buck nestles in the grass just behind her. A wolf drops a salmon at her feet while she sleeps at her campfire.


	I make it a point to save every wolf in the game, despite the side quests sucking up precious time. I believe, doggedly, this is what Atsu would want. As I lead Atsu through her story, I worry about her. I question her decisions, yet continue onward in the hopes that I can help her find peace. It's that hope for Atsu, and for the people of Ezo, that propels me forward through a story that is so much more complicated than a typical revenge tale.

	











	Sadly, like so many games released in the last few years, Ghost of Yōtei will launch as an unwilling soldier in an ideological culture war. When Atsu was first revealed as the game's protagonist, reactionaries jumped to disavow the sequel, citing bad-faith reasoning that failed to hide their prejudices. Sucker Punch recently fired a developer who joked about right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination after the same people who vowed to never play Yotei launched a cancel campaign against the studio.


	It's unclear if this will change the minds of those who already planned on boycotting the game. But after many hours with it, what is clear is that Ghost of Yōtei is a work of art. It embodies the ideology that games can lead players through a beautiful, interactive world while still giving them the agency to materially affect it. Refusing to engage with it means robbing yourself of the experience, like walking into a museum eyes closed rather than appreciating any of the paintings. 


Ghost of Yōtei isn't perfect. During my playthrough, I encountered zero progression-blocking bugs but several visual glitches, the occasional hitching enemy, and the rare, weirdly rendered NPC, but nothing broke the immersion.


	Side quests are a bit same-y, which is a common problem in action games. Killing a crew of rōnin just to have one give in and hand over important information via cutscene gets tiring, yet there's solace in climbing a shit-covered rocky outcropping to bow at a heavens-touching altar over and over again. Its world, though bigger, isn't technically completely open, as there are barriers between regions (likely to allow for some load times, which are lightning-fast).

	Yet Ghost of Yōtei transports players to feudal Japan with such vivid effectiveness that it's hard to leave it and return to the reality of the modern age. It seamlessly blends diegetic gameplay with a compelling, moving narrative that's pushed forward by a complex cast of characters. It's absolutely a game of the year contender, and an improvement upon Tsushima's winning formula.


Ghost of Yōtei releases on Oct. 2 for PlayStation 5.

For his latest directorial outing, Ben Stiller has tackled the toughest of tough subjects: his own family. “Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” is, on its surface, a very intimate look at the life and work of Stiller's comedic genius parents Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, but even in the film‘s first trailer, it's clear that the doc goes beyond that (already quite intriguing!) promise.

In the film, “Stiller tells the story of his parents, comedy icons Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, exploring their impact both on popular culture and at home, where the lines between creativity, family, life and art often blurred. In the process, Stiller turns the camera on himself and his family to examine Jerry and Anne's enormous influence on their lives, and the generational lessons we all can learn from those we love.”

The AppleTV+ documentary will premiere at the New York Film Festival on October 5, with other screenings to follow throughout the festival's run.

The New York Film Festival's own synopsis provides deeper exploration of the film, noting that “after Anne and Jerry passed away in 2015 and 2020, respectively, Stiller dug into the vast treasure trove of recordings, footage, letters, and other ephemera with which they documented their personal and professional lives. These extraordinary archives are the foundation of this immensely moving — and, of course, very funny — documentary, beautifully directed by Stiller and edited by Adam Kurnitz, which charts, with love and candor, the challenges and insecurities that are part of any show-business family's essential makeup.”

 










Stiller himself stars in the film, along with his sister Amy Stiller, his wife Christine Taylor-Stiller, his children Ella and Quinlin Stiller, plus Christopher Walken and Stephen Colbert. The doc is produced by Red Hour Films' Stiller and John Lesher, as well as Geoffrey Richman and Lizz Morhaim, with XTR's Bryn Mooser, Justin Lacob and Kathryn Everett, as well as Tony Hsieh and Andy Hsieh serving as executive producers. 

“Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost” will be released in select theaters on Friday, October 17 and will start streaming globally on Apple TV+ on Friday, October 24. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Fresh off its IPO, the indie disruptor is betting big on global audiences. But its values-based playbook may not translate everywhere.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Barely a week since Angel Studios rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and the faith-friendly disruptor is still basking in the glow of its high-profile debut and feeling the heat that comes with it. The Utah-based studio behind Sound of Freedom has gone from a family-run outsider operation to a $1.6 billion public company in less than a decade. Its rise reflects not only the strength of a niche market hungry for values-driven storytelling but also the new pressures of proving that a homespun model can scale under Wall Street's unforgiving gaze. It comes as the studio has expanded internationally, striking distribution agreements across Europe, Latin America, and Asia in an effort to prove its grassroots, faith-friendly business model can resonate worldwide.

	Angel's secret weapon has been its 1.5 million-strong “Angel Guild,” paying members who double as financiers and gatekeepers, voting on which projects make it to screens, as well as providing Kickstarter-style capital investments and a “pay-it-forward” booking system that allows people to buy and then donate movie tickets to Angel Studios releases for others to use.

	“Rather than having a couple dozen people make all the decisions about every movie that goes out, I can't take a movie into the studio and stream it or take it to theaters unless the guild passes it,” chief content officer Jeffrey Harmon explained, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in June, ahead of its IPO.

	











	That grassroots democracy has delivered some startling wins, including the $250 million global success of Sound of Freedom and The King of Kings, a South Korean-produced animated hit about the life of Jesus, which has grossed more than $70 million worldwide. Media analyst Evan Shapiro estimates that from 2023 to 2025, Angel's releases averaged $34.7 million per title, outpacing indie rivals like A24.


	Angel's pitch to investors is that audiences in middle America, the same group that Taylor Sheridan tapped to create his Yellowstone television empire, will flock to faith-friendly movies that embrace a more conservative worldview.


	“Angel is a response to Hollywood gatekeepers being out of touch,” says Angel CEO and co-founder. “We have flipped the model, empowering our 1.5 million Angel Guild members to be virtual co-producers, deciding what values-driven film and television shows get made and distributed. While we are encouraged by the early response to the power of our new model, we are focused on building lasting value over the long term.”


	But the company's bold approach comes with obvious risks. Angel has yet to turn a profit. In the first half of 2025, it booked $135 million in revenue but still posted a $53.3 million loss. The company has attributed much of its spending to efforts to expand its Angel Guild membership base, though detailed breakdowns of marketing costs are not publicly available. Just ahead of its listing, Angel raised $55 million from more than 40,000 individual investors and secured a $100 million credit facility with Trinity Capital. According to summaries of its filings, Angel has also used high-interest debt and other financing arrangements tied to revenue streams such as Sound of Freedom. These moves provided the studio with growth capital, but also raised questions about potential dilution, leverage, and the durability of its financial runway.

	











	The international expansion adds another layer of uncertainty. Whether Angel's blend of evangelical-inspired hits and broader family fare can travel beyond its U.S. base remains an open question. “Europe is a more secular market generally,” Harmon admitted to THR, but noted he sees strong growth potential in territories like Brazil, which boasts a more faith-focused audience. “They embrace the faith films more so than even the U.S. does.”


	The company has already partnered with Brazil's largest faith-based distributors for theatrical rollouts, inked a slate deal with U.K.-based distributor Kova for a pipeline of titles, and secured streaming and theatrical partnerships across Latin America. Angel has also pursued selective distribution agreements in Asia, including South Korea — home to a large Christian community — where The King of Kings became a local hit before expanding globally. These deals show Angel adapting to territory-specific partners, but also highlight the challenge of tailoring its model to vastly different cultural markets.


	The studio has also run into friction with creatives. A bitter arbitration battle over The Chosen ended with Angel losing rights to its biggest series (Angel is appealing), and a lawsuit with Slingshot, producer of the animated feature David, is ongoing. Angel president Jordan Harmon has previously waved off the disputes, noting that lawsuits in the entertainment industry are “like pigeons in New York City. It's just the reality of this space.”

	











	Despite those bumps, Angel is charging ahead. The studio has teed up The Senior, a sports drama starring Michael Chiklis as a 59-year-old who returns to college to play football, and Zero A.D., a biblical thriller from Sound of Freedom director Alejandro Monteverde, starring Sam Worthington, Ben Mendelsohn, Gael García Bernal and Jim Caviezel. Its 2026 slate includes Young Washington, a George Washington origin story timed to hit theaters next summer during America's 250th anniversary celebrations.


	Angel Studios shares, trading under ticker symbol ANGX, have dropped from around $13 after going as high as $20.39 and as low as $4.52. On Tuesday, the stock had closed at $5. 


	Given the current cultural moment, Angel Studios' IPO looks particularly fortuitous. But Wall Street's memory is short, and overseas audiences, which have proven resistant to patriotic American fare — James Gunn's Superman being a case in point — may prove harder to proselytize. Barely a week into its life as a public company, Angel has shown it can light a spark. The question is whether that spark can sustain a flame big enough to keep both its faithful backers and its new investors believing.

The move marks the first time that the Jim Henson Company will be offering its treasures for a public auction, which will be held online and at company headquarters in Hollywood on La Brea Avenue. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	On what would've been its founder's 89th birthday, the Jim Henson Company has confirmed a partnership with Julien's Auctions to bring to auction more than 400 beloved archival puppets, props and pieces from shows like The Muppets, Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.


	The move marks the first time in history that the Jim Henson Company will be offering up its treasures for a public auction, which will be held online and at company headquarters in Hollywood on La Brea Avenue. The Jim Henson Company 70th Anniversary Auction is set to take place Nov. 25. Bids will open Oct. 22, and proceeds from the special event will benefit the work of the Jim Henson Company archives.

	“With tens of thousands of items catalogued in the Jim Henson Company's archive from our 70-year history, it has been an exciting project to select the pieces that will be a part of this auction,” explained archives director Karen Falk. “This landmark event is sure to include something for every fan and collector interested in the Henson legacy and our contributions to pop culture and entertainment.”

	Added Julien's Auctions managing director of entertainment Catherine Williamson: “Jim Henson's innovation and creativity revolutionized family entertainment, and his optimism and sincerity made him one of the most beloved artists of our time. From his brilliant and beloved Muppets characters to his technically radical creations in The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth, his puppets transcended the arts, becoming cultural forces that continue to touch millions of all ages and influence today's next generation of bold creators and artists.”

	











	Heading to the block will be the Naia Drenchen Gelfling full-body puppet used in The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance (estimate: $15,000-$25,000). The puppet, seen in the fourth episode of the Emmy-winning series, represents a lead character that was also featured in the Dark Crystal novels. Other items from the prequel series include sword props used by Rian (estimate: $3,000-$5,000) and Ordon (estimate: $1,000-$2,000); skekGra the Heretic Circle of the Suns' Skeksis chair (estimate: $4,000-$6,000), dagger and baton props (estimate: $2,000-$3,000), and Maudra Fara's axe prop (estimate: $1,000-$2,000).

Sure, being a massive conglomerate capable of buying and selling some of the biggest entertainment brands on the planet sounds fun. You can throw around billions of dollars, engage in all sorts of fun mergers and acquisitions, and only occasionally find yourself forced to kneel and shell out cash in the face of the government being kind of mean to you. But have you considered how many people also wind up yelling at you, even when you only fold in the face of censorship a little bit?

These questions brought to us by news that some of Disney's shareholder groups would like the corporation to answer their questions about its conduct over the last week, and specifically as applies to the nearly week-long suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the airwaves. Specifically, THR reports that Reporters Without Borders and the American Federation Of Teachers (both of whom own Disney stock, apparently) have issued a letter to the company's board, stating that they believe that there's a “credible basis to suspect” that the board broke its duty to investors by putting its focus on “improper political and affiliate considerations” in the Kimmel matter.

Basically, the letter asserts, by bowing to FCC pressure—indirectly applied to the House O' Mouse after FCC chair Brendan Carr told affiliates that there was “an easy way or a hard way” to deal with Kimmel's comments about right-wing conduct in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder—Disney cost its shareholders a bunch of money in the form of lost public reputation, streaming service cancellations, and drops in stock price. (It's worth noting, in the interest of accuracy, that while Disney's stock price did drop after the Kimmel suspension was announced, it didn't drop much, in the grand scheme of things; that being said, it's not clear yet how many people actually canceled their Disney+ subscriptions, or how much overall damage Disney has done to its rep over the last seven days.) The shareholders are demanding to be given access to board communications about the decision to suspend Kimmel, as well as any back-and-forth between Disney and Nexstar or Sinclair, the affiliate ownership groups that are continuing to keep the talk show off the air in the markets where they own ABC stations.

Reading between the lines, it's easy to see how the shareholder groups are trying to send a message, i.e., that capitulating to the Trump administration's demands could potentially be just as much a hassle for Bob Iger and his fellow members of Disney leadership as trying to fight them. “The fallout from suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! sparked criticism as an attack on free speech,” the letter states, “Triggered boycotts and union support for Mr. Kimmel, and caused Disney's stock to plummet amid fears of brand damage and concerns that Disney was complicit in succumbing to the government overreach and media censorship.”

The fact-based film centers on the U.S. women's gymnastics team's historic success at the 1996 Summer Games.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Millie Bobby Brown is close to landing a role as an American sports icon for Netflix. 


	The Stranger Things standout is in final negotiations to star as Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug in director Gia Coppola‘s feature Perfect. Brown would also join the film's producing team. 




	Coppola (The Last Showgirl) is helming the movie from a script by Ronnie Sandahl. The project is based on the real-life U.S. women's gymnastics team's historic success at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.

	Netflix is eyeing a 2026 shoot for Perfect. Producers include Nik Bower for Riverstone Pictures and Thomas Benski for Magna Studios. 30West is executive producing.

	Known as the Magnificent Seven, the American women's gymnastics team collected its first-ever team gold at the 1996 Olympics. Strug clinched the individual gold for the vault despite landing on an injured ankle, and the image of coach Béla Károlyi carrying the athlete to the podium became a signature moment for those Summer Games.


	The team also included Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, Dominique Dawes, Amy Chow, Jaycie Phelps and captain Amanda Borden.


Perfect continues Brown's longstanding relationship with the streaming service, which includes such films as the Enola Holmes franchise, Damsel and The Electric State. The actress originated her breakout role of Eleven on the smash Netflix series Stranger Things when the show debuted in 2016. Its fifth and final season is set to be released later this year in three parts.

	











	Coppola, the granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola and niece of Sofia Coppola, has previously directed the features Palo Alto (2013), Mainstream (2020) and the Pamela Anderson-led The Last Showgirl (2024).


Deadline was first to report on Perfect.

Also in the fifth episode of the show's scorching 27th season, Satan and President Trump's different attitudes toward becoming parents together become clear.


							By 

	Kevin Dolak



	Predictive betting comes to South Park in episode five of the show's sporadic yet highly rated 27th season, when the odds on whether Kyle's mom, who is a Jewish woman, will attack Gaza become a hot speculation at the elementary school.


	It all starts with the kids of South Park Elementary placing bets on whether one of their own — a Boy Scout who insists on repeatedly informing the class that she is one of the group's WeBelos — is a boy or a girl. Soon, Eric Cartman is going on about Kyle's mom, one of his least favorite people in town but one he enjoys talking (and on the big screen, singing) about.

					Charlie Kirk Would Not Want His 'South Park' Episode Pulled, 'Charlie Kirk Show' Producer Insists		
			









	Back at the White House, Satan and President Trump are awaiting the birth of their child, who is likely to bring about the apocalypse, and are preparing for the little one's arrival. A seemingly goober-like version of Vice President J.D. Vance is back, too, with bad news for Trump. 




			Related Video		







	“Everyone is so excited for the baby,” Vance says. “Boss, you must be so excited as well. Yeah, well, excited, it is going to completely change your life, though….”


	Naturally, this being South Park, Trump soon begins his efforts to kill his and Satan's unborn child. Hijinks ensue. Vance's motivations are also revealed later in the episode (but you all knew the Vice President of the United States was no goober, right?).Plots in Washington and our favorite small Colorado mountain town once again merge after a phone call is placed from South Park to end the sports betting craze, via government intervention. FCC chief Brendan Carr ends up on the other end of the line from a frustrated Kyle and within about 10 seconds of his appearance on the show, he's there with Trump and Satan, shitting so hard he flies around the room, and then in the hospital with a parasite called toxoplasmosis; it can be transferred from cats to humans and bring about some complications — in particular, for Carr, the loss of his freedom of speech.


	As the tension around what Kyle's mom Sheila will do about the Israel-Gaza atrocities reaches a fever pitch at South Park Elementary, she decides that it's time that she go to Gaza and does what she needs to do. However, this is not before explaining her perspective on the seemingly endless conflict that has now come for her personally.

	











	“You see, it's just pure anti-Semitism,” Sheila explains in one of the show's teachable moments. “I'm so sick of being grilled about my views on Palestine and my thoughts on Hamas, and being judged for things that are centuries old and that non-Jews know nothing about. 


	“Well, if they all think we should do something, then you better believe I'll do something,” she concludes.


	The episode ends with her in Israel — and she does attack. But it's only verbal violence, as Sheila launches into a nonstop tirade-as-homage to Curb Your Enthusiasm and its pseudo-villain, Susie Greene (Susie Essman). Cue the trademark tuba, mandolin, banjo and piano of “Frolic,” Curb theme song, as we reach what is said to be the halfway point of the 27th season of South Park.


	The episode arrived a week later than planned, after the show's creators admitted that they failed to complete it in time; Trey Parker and Matt Stone blamed their own procrastination habits for the delay. But some speculated the killing of Charlie Kirk, who was spoofed in episode two of season 27, at a speaking event in Utah that week, led to the new episode being yanked or possibly tweaked. The South Park team did manage to touch on the other major scandal of the moment with the Carr subplot, as it was his comments and veiled threats to ABC that are believed to have been the catalyst for Jimmy Kimmel's late night show going dark last week.

“Star Trek” actor William Shatner, who played the role of Captain Kirk, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 24, TMZ reports. He is 94 years old.

The outlet adds that he “experienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon,” with the actor having “called emergency medical service workers for help as a precaution and paramedics showed up in an LAFD ambulance.”

Shatner was taken to a local hospital, with TMZ reporting that he's doing “good” and “resting comfortably.”

TMZ posted on social media, sharing the news, and many fans left comments, showing support for Shatner. 

“🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,” one fan commented.  

“Oh no.. I hope he's not beamed up just yet.. Stay strong @WilliamShatner.. Engines need more Warp Speed,” someone wrote. 

“Wishing Captain Kirk well,” a fan said.

In June 2025, Shatner opened up about a medical condition he has been dealing with for years called tinnitus.

According to the Mayo Clinic, tinnitus is “when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears,” however, it isn't “caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.” The condition began when he was filming “Star Trek” due to the special effects explosion.

In the video released by the nonprofit organization Tinnitus Quest, Shatner aimed to spread awareness.

“Over the years, I've had many ups and downs with my tinnitus,” he said. “I know from firsthand experience just how difficult it can get.”

“It”s a diverse condition that comes in different degrees of severity. About 1–2% of the population suffer from a chronic, debilitating form of tinnitus. There are no effective treatments—and that's why we need more research,” he added. 

A post shared by William Shatner (@williamshatner)

On Aug. 7, William Shatner took to Instagram, revealing to fans that, at the age of 94, he has decided to release a book. 

“My dear followers, I wanted to drop a bit of a teaser: I'm writing a new book. Even Better: the book's all about YOU, the fans, and you can be a part of it, maybe even be in it!,” he captioned the post. “Go to WilliamShatnerAndYou.com to find out more!”

Shatner has played many iconic roles, including Captain Kirk, Denny Crane, T.J. Hooker. So with that, he is asking fans to “submit your own tale of how my characters: be it Kirk, T.J. Hooker, or even Denny Crane—have touched your life.” And a lucky few will get the opportunity to be interviewed by Shatner about their stories, while will be featured in the book.

This Friday marks the kick-off of the first Riyadh Comedy Festival, a pretty concerted effort by the government of Saudi Arabia to rebrand the capital city as an international comedy destination. To that end, organizers from the Saudi General Entertainment Authority have reportedly thrown around quite a bit of cash to bring in some of the biggest names in the comedy world to perform at the festival, including Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Aziz Ansari, Gabriel Iglesias, Louis CK, and several more. It has also, correspondingly, brought some critique: Most notably from comedian Marc Maron, who posted a stand-up clip to his social media this week blasting comics for signing on for a festival being put on by a government with a pretty lengthy list of human rights abuses detailed by Amnesty International.

In the clip (posted to the WTF comics' Facebook page), Maron opens by asking his audience “How do you even promote that?” Referencing both 9/11 and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Maron pulled no punches: “But don't let that stop the yuks, it's gonna be a good time.” (True to form, Maron also did a bit of self-deprecation, noting that he wasn't personally invited to the festival: “Easy to maintain your integrity when no one's offering to buy it out.”)

Maron isn't the only comic who's spoken out about the Riyadh Festival: Shane Gillis has made comments on various podcast appearances, stating that he turned down a reportedly large amount of money to perform at the fest due to his discomfort with Saudi politics. Comedian Tim Dillon was also reportedly fired from the festival this week, allegedly over jokes he made about his decision to sign on for it in the first place, claiming at the time “They're paying enough money to look the other way.” (He also joked, “Get over it, so what they have slaves,” referencing a long litany of allegations of forced labor imposed on migrant workers in the country.) Dillon said on a more recent episode of his show that his management told him “They heard what you said about them having slaves. They didn't like that.” Dillon said on the earlier podcast that he was being paid $375,000 for the single show, and that some comics were getting more than a million, it's worth noting that those numbers haven't been confirmed by any other sources.

Alexandra Grant set the record straight about her relationship with Keanu Reeves. The 52-year-old artist took to Instagram on September 24 to shut down wedding rumors, sharing a candid photo of herself kissing the 61-year-old actor at Roden Crater in Flagstaff, Arizona.

A post shared by Keanu Reeves (@keanureeves.media)

“This is a real photo. Not an engagement photo or an AI wedding announcement… simply a kiss!” she wrote in her caption. “We're at Roden Crater, and Keanu and Gard had just finished interviewing James Turrell for Visionaries.”

Grant called the headlines “fake news” and confirmed she and Reeves never tied the knot. “I'm sharing it here to say thank you to everyone for the congratulations on our wedding. Except we didn't get married,” she added. “Good news is much needed these days, but it's still fake news, so be careful out there! So, here's a bit of real happiness!” 

Read Alexandra's complete statement here.

A representative for Reeves also addressed the speculation on Sept. 23. “It is not true,” the rep told People. “They are not married.” The couple first went public in November 2019 when they walked the red carpet together at the LACMA Art + Film Gala in Los Angeles. 

Nearly a decade earlier, they had collaborated on the 2011 book “Ode to Happiness.” 

At the time of their debut, a source told People, “Keanu wants to openly share his life with her. He is extremely happy and grateful to have Alex in his life.”

The marriage rumors surfaced just as Reeves began his Broadway debut in “Waiting for Godot.” Grant celebrated the milestone with another heartfelt Instagram post, praising his portrayal of Estragon.

A post shared by Brian Skope (@skopephotography)

“To Keanu — who is not on social media, and with whom I'll share this later — your hard work and dedication to trying something new and brave is so inspiring, artist to artist,” she wrote. 

“Your Estragon is unlike any I've seen before … funny, lonely, pensive, philosophical.”

She also applauded director Jamie Lloyd and the cast, calling the production “exciting, wildly imaginative, surprising.”

A post shared by Keanu Reeves (@keanureeves.media)

Reeves and Grant first met in 2009 at a dinner party and went on to collaborate on the books “Ode to Happiness” and “Shadows.” In 2017, they co-founded X Artists' Books, with their friendship eventually blossoming into romance.

Though protective of their privacy, the pair have shared glimpses of their love over the years. At the 2023 MOCA Gala in Los Angeles, they kissed on the red carpet, and Reeves later told People that his happiest recent moment was with Grant: “A couple of days ago with my honey. We were in bed. We were connected. We were smiling and laughing and giggling. Feeling great. It was just really nice to be together.”

From blockbuster hits like “The Matrix,” “John Wick,” and “Speed” to his latest chapter on Broadway, Reeves continues to thrive as an actor. Yet some of his most meaningful moments are found offscreen, in the life and love he shares with Grant.

The Harry Potter cast battle lines got drawn pretty quickly once J.K. Rowling started getting seriously into transphobic rhetoric circa mid-2000, divided between those franchise actors, like Ralph Fiennes, who voiced support for the series creator as she got ever-more-vocal about attacking trans rights and identity, and those who dared dissent. Notably, the latter camp included the series' three stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who all expressed their vocal support for trans folk early and often.

Rowling did not take this well, to put it lightly, making public comments suggesting she would never forgive the young performers for their statements—pretty much all of which started and stopped with quotes like Watson's “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned”—and implying on social media that their presence in the Harry Potter film franchise “ruins” those movies for her.

Watson has now addressed the rift, with Variety reporting that the performer, who's been on hiatus from acting since appearing in Little Women back in 2019, popped up on a podcast this week in which Rowling's comments were addressed. Appearing on On Purpose With Jay Shetty, Watson expressed her sadness at the idea of Rowling—who she has, obviously, known since she was 11—completely shutting the door on any possible conversations:

I really don't believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, mean that I can't and don't treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with. I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don't get to keep and cherish. To come back to our earlier thing—I just don't think these things are either or. I think it's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with. I think the thing I'm most upset about is that a conversation was never made possible.”

Rowling has, of course, stayed very busy in the years since she and the Potter kids broke up: She's been very publicly funneling parts of her vast wealth into supporting legal challenges to trans rights in the U.K., while also lending her name and support to the new Harry Potter TV series in the works at HBO.

Space stories often dwell on the vast unknown of the cosmos, but sometimes the absolute terror comes when astronauts return home. The new trailer for Jess Varley's “The Astronaut” suggests that survival in orbit may have been easy, as isolation, paranoia, and something not of this world creep into the atmosphere.

The psychological sci-fi thriller stars Kate Mara as astronaut Sam Walker, discovered alive in a punctured capsule after crash-landing off the Atlantic coast. Confined to a strict NASA quarantine overseen by Laurence Fishburne's General William Harris, Sam begins rehabilitation and testing—only to sense that her troubles didn't stay in space. Disturbing phenomena escalate; she fears something extraterrestrial has followed her back to Earth.

The supporting cast includes Gabriel Luna, Ivana Milicevic, Macy Gray, and newcomer Scarlett Holmes. The film had its world premiere at the 2025 SXSW Film & TV Festival.

A former psychic medium who became a Christian told The Christian Post that reports of witches cursing Charlie Kirk before his assassination could spread unnecessary fear by distracting from God's sovereignty.

"Nothing happens without God's permission," said Jenn Nizza, a former psychic medium who is now an author and podcaster who runs the website Ex-PsychicSaved.com.

Two days before Kirk was fatally shot in Utah by a 22-year-old assassin with leftist political views, the feminist news website Jezebel published an article by an unnamed staffer who said she had hired witches on the online marketplace Etsy to invoke "multiple curses" on the 31-year-old Turning Point USA co-founder.

The article, titled "We Paid Some Etsy Witches to Curse Charlie Kirk," called Kirk a "far-right misogynist" and mentioned a spell to invoke hatred against him, with the author noting she was promised results within weeks and offered the choice of paying extra to "amplify the energetic support."

The article also noted that one of the witches confirmed to the author that requests for curses against political figures have risen in recent years. Formal occult activity against President Donald Trump repeatedly made headlines during his first term, with members of the "#MagicResistance" casting "binding spells" against him and his associates.

After Kirk was slain and their article faced backlash on social media, the outlet first appended an editor's note condemning political violence before deleting the article "on the recommendation of our lawyers," claiming it was intended to be satirical.

The article had left Kirk and his wife, Erika, "rattled," prompting them to ask a friend to pray over them the day before he was shot, according to conservative political commentator Megyn Kelly, who is friends with the Kirk family.

"Erika and Charlie Kirk heard about these curses, and that news genuinely rattled Erika, in particular," Kelly said on her Monday podcast. "She knew Christian teaching on the subject, she loved Charlie, absolutely, and she was scared when she heard of the curses Jezebel had called up."

"She eventually worked it through, and so did Charlie," said added. "As she later told me, 'Weapons will form, but not prosper; that Satan and those witches have no power.' Of course, God's will is the one that matters, and His blessing over Charlie was real and palpable."

Nizza told CP the idea that occult practitioners have ultimate power over life and death is a lie, and that anything their witchcraft happens to accomplish remains under the authority of God.

"Do I think that witches really were putting hexes and curses on Charlie? Probably. Do I think that they have any power to ultimately say who lives or dies? No, that's up to God," she said.

In a TikTok video posted last week, Nizza warned against focusing on the potential role that occultists and the demonic forces they invoke might have played in Kirk's murder. She admonished Christians to avoid descending into a spiral of fear and anger that distracts from God's sovereignty and faithfulness, a temptation she implied is part of the spiritual attack.

"They want to think that they have the power of God, and that's simply not true," Nizza said of occultists, whose activity she said ultimately leads to their own destruction. "Don't fall for that way of thinking. God is sovereign over all things. God allowed Charlie to come home. Demons are on a short leash. Please try to remember that."

Regarding whether she believes spiritual warfare is escalating in the wake of Kirk's assassination, Nizza told CP she remains optimistic that God will use any evil intentions to accomplish His will.

"I would say revival is upon us. Actually, I think that this is a classic but amplified case of 'what he meant for harm, God meant for good,'" she said, paraphrasing Joseph's words to his brothers in Genesis 50:20, after their plans to persecute him ultimately led to saving his own people from famine.

Nizza also referenced the story of Pharaoh's sorcerers in Exodus, who she said were at first "able to go tit-for-tat" with Moses until the power of God overwhelmed their occult abilities when the Nile River turned to blood.

"They can't undo that," she said of whatever dark forces the Egyptian sorcerers were invoking. "They can't make something clean. They can't purify something."

Nizza suggested the promotion of the Gospel in the wake of Kirk's murder might be leading to a spiritual purification.

"Satan always loses, he always loses," she said. "Charlie Kirk went home to Jesus Christ, so that's number one; number two, Charlie Kirk's voice got magnified."

She noted millions heard the Gospel during Kirk's memorial service in Glendale, Arizona. In what has been dubbed "the Charlie effect," reports have emerged of a surge in church attendance after his death.

"Here's God with this huge turn of events — what they thought was going to be for evil, God intended for good to save many lives," she said.

Professional ghost hunter and author Marie Mason of Ghosts Hunter Investigations will conduct paranormal tours at Porterville's Zalud House Museum ahead of Halloween, city officials announced.

The city of Porterville will offer these tours at 8 and 10 p.m. on Oct. 3 and 4. Mason said that her work begins with learning the history of a building, its area, and its residents. 

“The historical part is that as a paranormal investigator, we are investigating the people from the past,” she said. “The theory is maybe they want to tell their side of the story, so, therefore, we incorporate the history and say to them, ‘OK, we know that you shot William Brooks in the chair. Was he really having an affair with you?'"

The spirit boxes and the equipment Mason uses will validate answers in real time, she said.

“Maybe the voice box will say, ‘Yes, I shot him.' Then maybe one of the tools will blink over there in the corner," she said.

The theory with ghost hunting is that there's "residual energy or unfinished business,” Mason said. 

“What happened at the Zalud House is there was nothing but tragedy, one tragedy after another,” she said. “Not only did the whole family die individual weird deaths, but this particular house has all the original items. It's all their same stuff from 1891. That whole entire house is filled with the original people's energy everywhere.”

Mason was interviewed two weeks before investigating the Zalud House, but she had already done her homework.

John Zalud and his wife, Mary, built the house in 1891, she said.

“Mary and John had three kids, two daughters and one boy,” she said. “The son, Edward, died mysteriously in a freak accident. He fell off his horse. 

“Who the heck falls off a horse in 1890s?” Mason asked rhetorically. “Then, daughter Anna married a guy named William Brooks, and he was alleged to have had an affair.

“He was in the Pioneer Hotel, with his friends, laughing about it,” she continued. “She walked in, the lady that he alleged had an affair with, and they were laughing at her. She pulled out a pistol and shot him six times.”

The chair that he was sitting in still has a bullet hole, Mason said. The chair was donated by the Pioneer Hotel and it's in the bedroom of William Brooks in the Zalud House. 

“Sometimes when you sit on that chair that still has the bullet hole, people have reported to get pain in their back, exactly where the bullet hole is,” she said. “It was documented on the Ghost Adventures TV show.”

With most of its original items, the Zalud House offers Mason “residual energy” for her investigation.

“Just imagine all the fingerprints in that house,” she said. “It's residual energy. The residual energy is imperative because it's their items."

She compared residual energy to DNA technology.

“If you know that somebody in a murder case in 1970 can leave their fingerprint on something, and today they can pull that fingerprint and they can get the DNA of that person, just imagine it on a scale that we're not even familiar with of the spiritual world."

Zalud house is rare because it remained in the family until each owners' eventual death.

“All of them died by owning that house," Mason said. "Then there were a lot of other little outside tragedies that were bizarre."

“There's just death surrounding that place everywhere,” Mason said, before responding to the suggestion that the building may have been cursed. “I don't know about a curse, but what I do know is that when it comes to ghost hunting, you have to go deeper. You have to remember the surrounding area. 

“You had the Indian Wars, the Tule Treaty in 1851, the army was supposed to give them cattle,” she said. “They backstabbed the Indians.”

Mason noted that soon after, the Tule River tribe moved.

Mason said that visitors can expect a real paranormal investigation.

“The equipment that I use is an SLS camera, which is a Kinect,” she said. “I use a DNA box that will telekinetically use a ‘word bank.' The theory is the ghosts are telekinetically grabbing the words and saying the words out loud.

“The third thing is we use the SP7 Spirit Box, and you hear a lot of static,” she said. “It's a regular radio, and it goes from channel to channel to channel at like 100 milliseconds, and the spirits have the ability to grab words going at 100 milliseconds.” 

Even with the equipment, Mason said the most important equipment for a paranormal investigation is their body. 

“When you're in the room and you're investigating, you have to pay attention to your body,” she said. “Like, is your body shaking?

“The theory is it's energy,” she added. “The room will get cold. Why does it get cold? They're sucking the energy because they're using energy from, let's say, your camera or your batteries to use it to manifest or to move an object."

Museum curators have claimed to see shadow figures in the house.

“Then they can smell the medicine in Mary's room, the medicine she used to take (for tuberculosis). Sometimes you hear stories of perfume, or sometimes you can smell a cigar," Mason said. "I mean, it's bizarre how that can come through to this time frame. It's bizarre to think how is that possible."

There have also been reports of items being moved or misplaced, Mason said.

“Some say that the ghost doesn't like people sitting on their bed, and you'll see indentations in the bed," she added.

Tours are $50 per person, and limited to groups of seven adults. For more information visit the city of Porterville website.

	The deal was negotiated by Isra Al Kassi of TAPE Collective and Margot Hervée of Paris-based sales agent Totem Films. The Animalia release in cinemas is set for Dec. 12.




	The movie premiered at Sundance 2023, where it won a special jury prize for creative vision, before playing the film fest circuit.

Animalia follows Itto, played by Oumaima Barid in her debut role, “a young woman from a modest rural background who is slowly adapting to the privileged codes of her husband's Moroccan family,” according to a plot description. “But when supernatural events plunge the country into a state of emergency, Itto is separated from her husband and new family. Alone, pregnant, and searching for a way back, she discovers her own emancipation.”

	Said Al Kassi: “We have been inspired by the unique cinematic world Sofia has created in this bold sci-fi tale, which probes the consequences of humanity's relationship to the environment, with poignant references to class inequalities and the erasure of indigenous cultures. It's exciting to be part of this release as Sofia develops her next feature films, undoubtedly continuing her grand world-building and chilling storytelling.”

	











	The film was written, directed and produced by Alaoui. It also stars Mehdi Dehbi and Fouad Oughaou. The cinematography is courtesy of Noé Bach, with editing by Héloïse Pelloquet and an original score by Amine Bouhafa.

Produced by Margaux Lorier, Toufik Ayadi, Christophe Barral, Dounia Benjelloun Mezian and Alaoui, it was co-produced by Arte France Cinéma, with the support of Canal+, Ciné+, ARTE France, Centre Nationaldu Cinéma et de l'image animée, le Centre Cinématographique Marocain, le Fonds Image de laFrancophonie, Le Doha Film Institute, La Procirep et l'Angoa, Les Ateliers de l'Atlas, and CinéventureDéveloppement 7, and in association with Cinécap 5, SG Images 2020, Cinémage 16.
