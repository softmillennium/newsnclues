                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former psychic medium who became a Christian told The Christian Post that reports of witches cursing Charlie Kirk before his assassination could spread unnecessary fear by distracting from God's sovereignty. "Nothing happens without God's permission," said Jenn Nizza, a former psychic medium who is now an author and podcaster who runs the website Ex-PsychicSaved.com. Two days before Kirk was fatally shot in Utah by a 22-year-old assassin with leftist political views, the feminist news website Jezebel published an article by an unnamed staffer who said she had hired witches on the online marketplace Etsy to invoke "multiple curses" on the 31-year-old Turning Point USA co-founder. The article, titled "We Paid Some Etsy Witches to Curse Charlie Kirk," called Kirk a "far-right misogynist" and mentioned a spell to invoke hatred against him, with the author noting she was promised results within weeks and offered the choice of paying extra to "amplify the energetic support." Formal occult activity against President Donald Trump repeatedly made headlines during his first term, with members of the "#MagicResistance" casting "binding spells" against him and his associates. After Kirk was slain and their article faced backlash on social media, the outlet first appended an editor's note condemning political violence before deleting the article "on the recommendation of our lawyers," claiming it was intended to be satirical. Two days ago, this outlet promoted paying a witch to curse Charlie Kirk to make him be on the receiving end of hatred.Now they disavow themselves of the consequences of their rhetoric.The media has blood on its hands. The article had left Kirk and his wife, Erika, "rattled," prompting them to ask a friend to pray over them the day before he was shot, according to conservative political commentator Megyn Kelly, who is friends with the Kirk family. "Erika and Charlie Kirk heard about these curses, and that news genuinely rattled Erika, in particular," Kelly said on her Monday podcast. "She eventually worked it through, and so did Charlie," said added. "As she later told me, 'Weapons will form, but not prosper; that Satan and those witches have no power.' Nizza told CP the idea that occult practitioners have ultimate power over life and death is a lie, and that anything their witchcraft happens to accomplish remains under the authority of God. "Do I think that witches really were putting hexes and curses on Charlie? Do I think that they have any power to ultimately say who lives or dies? In a TikTok video posted last week, Nizza warned against focusing on the potential role that occultists and the demonic forces they invoke might have played in Kirk's murder. She admonished Christians to avoid descending into a spiral of fear and anger that distracts from God's sovereignty and faithfulness, a temptation she implied is part of the spiritual attack. "They want to think that they have the power of God, and that's simply not true," Nizza said of occultists, whose activity she said ultimately leads to their own destruction. Regarding whether she believes spiritual warfare is escalating in the wake of Kirk's assassination, Nizza told CP she remains optimistic that God will use any evil intentions to accomplish His will. Actually, I think that this is a classic but amplified case of 'what he meant for harm, God meant for good,'" she said, paraphrasing Joseph's words to his brothers in Genesis 50:20, after their plans to persecute him ultimately led to saving his own people from famine. Nizza also referenced the story of Pharaoh's sorcerers in Exodus, who she said were at first "able to go tit-for-tat" with Moses until the power of God overwhelmed their occult abilities when the Nile River turned to blood. "They can't undo that," she said of whatever dark forces the Egyptian sorcerers were invoking. She noted millions heard the Gospel during Kirk's memorial service in Glendale, Arizona. "Here's God with this huge turn of events — what they thought was going to be for evil, God intended for good to save many lives," she said. Jon Brown is a reporter for The Christian Post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Professional ghost hunter and author Marie Mason of Ghosts Hunter Investigations will conduct paranormal tours at Porterville's Zalud House Museum ahead of Halloween, city officials announced. Mason said that her work begins with learning the history of a building, its area, and its residents. Was he really having an affair with you?'" “Maybe the voice box will say, ‘Yes, I shot him.' The theory with ghost hunting is that there's "residual energy or unfinished business,” Mason said. “Not only did the whole family die individual weird deaths, but this particular house has all the original items. That whole entire house is filled with the original people's energy everywhere.” Mason was interviewed two weeks before investigating the Zalud House, but she had already done her homework. John Zalud and his wife, Mary, built the house in 1891, she said. “The son, Edward, died mysteriously in a freak accident. “Who the heck falls off a horse in 1890s?” Mason asked rhetorically. “Then, daughter Anna married a guy named William Brooks, and he was alleged to have had an affair. “He was in the Pioneer Hotel, with his friends, laughing about it,” she continued. “She walked in, the lady that he alleged had an affair with, and they were laughing at her. She pulled out a pistol and shot him six times.” The chair that he was sitting in still has a bullet hole, Mason said. “Sometimes when you sit on that chair that still has the bullet hole, people have reported to get pain in their back, exactly where the bullet hole is,” she said. “It was documented on the Ghost Adventures TV show.” With most of its original items, the Zalud House offers Mason “residual energy” for her investigation. “Just imagine all the fingerprints in that house,” she said. The residual energy is imperative because it's their items." “If you know that somebody in a murder case in 1970 can leave their fingerprint on something, and today they can pull that fingerprint and they can get the DNA of that person, just imagine it on a scale that we're not even familiar with of the spiritual world." Zalud house is rare because it remained in the family until each owners' eventual death. “All of them died by owning that house," Mason said. “There's just death surrounding that place everywhere,” Mason said, before responding to the suggestion that the building may have been cursed. “I don't know about a curse, but what I do know is that when it comes to ghost hunting, you have to go deeper. Mason noted that soon after, the Tule River tribe moved. Mason said that visitors can expect a real paranormal investigation. “It's a regular radio, and it goes from channel to channel to channel at like 100 milliseconds, and the spirits have the ability to grab words going at 100 milliseconds.” Museum curators have claimed to see shadow figures in the house. "I mean, it's bizarre how that can come through to this time frame. It's bizarre to think how is that possible." There have also been reports of items being moved or misplaced, Mason said. “Some say that the ghost doesn't like people sitting on their bed, and you'll see indentations in the bed," she added. Tours are $50 per person, and limited to groups of seven adults. For more information visit the city of Porterville website.</p>

Alone, pregnant, and searching for a way back, she discovers her own emancipation.” Mark Ruffalo, Javier Bardem Join Jordan Oscar Contender 'All That's Left of You' as Exec Producers It's exciting to be part of this release as Sofia develops her next feature films, undoubtedly continuing her grand world-building and chilling storytelling.” The film was written, directed and produced by Alaoui.
