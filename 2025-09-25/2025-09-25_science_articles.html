                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Studies indicate that a simple treatment could halt a leading cause of death for millions of people. And then there's dementia: You forget recent conversations; whole hours or afternoons become blank. The person who used to plan trips while cooking dinner with friends and being the DJ for the party now lies awake at night in fear and spends days staring, because they don't know where they are or what to do next. You can remember enough to know—this isn't your life. It is possible that microscopic structures in your nerve cells are unraveling—and with them, your sense of who you are. Evidence is building that exposing the brain to short bouts of an extremely low-frequency and low-intensity electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) signal can slow or reverse the impacts of Alzheimer's. Anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, has studied the minute structures of the brain for decades–especially those microscopic structures called microtubules that may contain our memories. He was an early voice among a growing body of scientists who think electromagnetism encourages microtubules to hold together. But they're also oscillators that generate, propagate, and amplify electrical signals; so they're effectively the nerve center of the cell. Hameroff has been studying microtubules for decades as the possible biological structure that enables consciousness. After all, neurons last our entire lives, unlike most of the rest of our cells, which are constantly replaced. The most prevalent protein in them is called tau, which serves key functions for the microtubule, including possibly stabilizing it. When scientists have examined the neuronal cells of people who have died from Alzheimer's, they discovered piles of tau that appear to have fallen off the microtubules and stuck together in clumps called Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), or tau tangles. These tangles show tau in a specific state that is an Alzheimer's marker. But there's a clear correlation between this breakup and Alzheimer's. “So imagine, God forbid, your bones started to dissolve,” Hameroff says. When it does so, synapses are pulled away from one another. As the system collapses, memories and cognition are lost. But many researchers say there's no convincing evidence that plaques cause Alzheimer's. People with the plaques don't always have symptoms; people with symptoms don't always have the plaques. And there is no drug to address what is causing the tau tangles, though the tangles themselves aren't toxic, he adds. Leqembi, another amyloid-destroying IV therapy for Alzheimer's, costs $26,500 a year. Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organization, 55 million people globally live with dementia, with another 10 million cases diagnosed annually. Most people think Alzheimer's Disease and dementia are a normal part of aging, but they're not. In 2019, dementia cost economies $1.3 trillion globally; approximately half of these costs are attributable to informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average five hours of care and supervision per day. That's where the inexpensive brain zapper comes in. Several studies have indicated that subjecting the brain to various ELF-EMF treatments can positively impact several systems in the microtubule. And that results in better brain function. Researchers published a study in February in the European Journal of Neuroscience where they tested the theory that a 40Hz signal would reverse microtubule-tau disintegration. Not only did cells that had microtubule-tau separation damage stay intact when treated with multiple bouts of ELF-EMF, but it also significantly reduced the cause of weakened bonds between tau and the microtubule. Researchers also found that other frequencies in neuron-like cultures could help with microtubule development and regeneration. Hameroff has been working with quantum mechanics expert Anirban Bandyopadhyay, PhD, who heads the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan. Bandyopadhyay previously discovered that numerous bands of electromagnetic energy exist within microtubules, at multiple frequencies and time signatures. Mid-range frequencies will open the blood-brain barrier which, as he says, is there for a reason. Higher frequencies are used to cause lesions, like zapping a tumor. Hameroff had made his own efforts to test these theories in 2011. “And they said, yeah, great idea, Hameroff. We'll watch.” At the end of a long day in the operating room, his colleagues wheeled in an ultrasound machine. But about a minute later, I got a buzz, and I started being buzzed for like two hours. During a double-blind study—in which doctors didn't know whether a patient received true treatment or a placebo—they asked people about changes in their mood, 10 minutes and 40 minutes after the treatment. “So it was not the best study in the world,” Hameroff says, “but it showed a positive effect in a double-blind study, and no side effects. We published it in the journal Brain Stimulation.” Over the last decade, more studies have found that electromagnetic brain stimulation can address myriad issues. An ultrasound machine at a hospital, he says, costs around $70,000. (Ironically he suspects that's one reason he's finding it difficult to get funding for medical trials: if it works, nobody will get rich. A friend of Hameroff's, Sterling Cooley, had basically been doing informal tests using the device—a process Hameroff kept his distance from, given that he has a medical license to protect. However, after Hameroff talked with people at The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)—an American non-profit parapsychological research institute—they offered to use their institutional review board to validate Cooley's results and make further research legal. IONS Institutional Review Board also insisted that if the patients wanted to enroll, they had to have their doctor's permission. He's hoping for more funding to advance this treatment effort. “But in the meantime, more and more papers are coming out showing improvement in Alzheimer's with ultrasound,” he says. One paper showed that cognition and memory improved significantly, and neural degeneration in the part of the brain responsible for  higher-order functions was reversed. “My dream, I guess, is to go to the memory care facility near my house, which has gone from one city block to five city blocks since I've lived there, and go room to room and give everybody, you know, five minutes.” Then he'd like to modify the machine to use all the microtubule resonant frequencies Bandyopadhyay has discovered. He wants to call it The Tubulator 5000. “Yeah,” he says, “maybe we'll do that.” Susan Lahey is a journalist and writer whose work has been published in numerous places in the U.S. and Europe.

Colossal Biosciences, in Dallas, Texas, describes itself as the world's first de-extinction company. It aims to revive lost species using CRISPR gene-editing technology, including the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.). Its co-founders are technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm, Colossal's chief executive, and George Church, the company's genetics adviser, who also holds academic research positions at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. In the third article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Lamm describes how the name ‘Colossal Biosciences' came about. Climate change, biodiversity, CRISPR and gene editing, artificial intelligence, computational analysis and advanced embryology can be difficult concepts for the public to fully grasp. Every week, we get little pictures of dodos and baby mammoths that kids draw, and their parents mail us physical letters, saying things such as: ‘Thank you so much for doing what you're doing. To come up with Colossal, I worked with Chris Klee, executive vice-president of design at the company, and Chris Stevens, co-founder of Maven Creative, our branding agency, in Orlando, Florida. We had a list of seven or eight potential names — including ‘Huge', ‘Macedon' (an ancient kingdom) and ‘Footprint' (because every species has a unique one). Everything was centred around the concept of ‘big and awesome'. Obviously, ‘Mammoth' was on the list because the world is facing a mammoth challenge, but we felt that calling it that would have pigeonholed us to one species. We also liked ‘Colossus', and the idea of using ‘us' to signify a team effort. But Colossus is a character in the Marvel Universe media franchise, and we didn't want to be too Hollywood. We also considered names linked to evolution, and thought ‘Darwin' could be a cool one. Alongside the name, there's the brand — so before we decided on Colossal, we underwent a process to come up with a brand that encapsulated ‘Harvard University meets 1980's MTV'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to experts, the building may have once been a royal “water palace.” A recent natural disaster may give researchers a rare look into remnants of the empire, or at least one remnant in particular. But the recent earthquake caused a fissure that revealed more parts of the structure that were previously hidden beneath layers of soil. Researchers say that additional ruins, including a handrail, brick platforms, and an 18-inch riser step, are now visible. According to the report, some of these features resemble sketches from ancient palm-leaf manuscripts called “Pura-pike.” Historically, water has been a religious symbol in Myanmar culture, so water palaces served as important places for rituals, the Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports. Though the prospect of finding a royal water palace is exciting, it's much more likely the structure is something simpler. Some commenters are critical of researchers not unearthing the structure when it was initially discovered in 2009.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That hasn't stopped scientists from chasing the incredible idea, using regeneration as a potential tool to treat human disease and injury. And this quest to hack biology is exactly the kind of breakthrough story Pop Mech readers can't get enough of, from reversing hair loss to restoring eyesight. The treatments may sound like sci-fi now, but with continued testing, they could soon move from the lab to your medicine cabinet. So, how did scientists “wake up” dormant stem cells? Since active hair follicle cells contain more lactate, which helps them create energy without oxygen, researchers determined they needed to increase cell lactate in these dormant cells. Enter PP405, which inhibits the protein that moves pyruvate into mitochondria, and therefore yields more lactate. When tested on mice, sure enough, they began regrowing hair. PP405 has undergone two safety clinical trials so far, and will go into testing for its effectiveness next year. A research team at The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology may have discovered a new way to regrow retinal cells, and it comes with incredible implications for treating blindness.

The ruling paves the way for a type of DNA analysis known as whole-genome sequencing — used to decipher ancient DNA in fossilized remains, for example — to be admitted as evidence in US criminal trials. “This is a big step forward for the use of DNA evidence, because it will allow comparisons and matches with evidence that was previously considered too minuscule, too old or too badly degraded to be considered useful,” says Nathan Lents, a biologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. “You can bet that cold-case units all over the country are going back through their evidence lockers to see if there are samples that can now be tested with a reasonable chance of success.” The Gilgo Beach killings were a series of murders that occurred in Suffolk County, New York, between 1993 and 2011. In 2010, investigators concluded that there wasn't enough genetic material in the hairs for conventional forensic technology to identify whose they were. But since then, genomic technology has matured at a fast pace. Forensic scientists still identify suspects from hair and other samples using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which can amplify snippets of DNA called short tandem repeats (STRs). Today, however, scientists can also sequence whole genomes and look at single-letter variations in the DNA to zero in on a person of interest. This technology has the added benefit of being able to analyse severely degraded samples — from Neanderthal remains to hairs in the Gilgo Beach case. But it has typically been used only during investigations, and the results have not been widely presented as evidence before juries. (Rootless hairs are mostly made of keratin and don't contain much genetic material, Lents says.) But Astrea was able to sequence the small amount of genetic material in the hairs and then use statistical-analysis software to scan the DNA for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) — single-letter differences in people's genetic codes. Even in a degraded sample, whole-genome sequencing followed by this statistical analysis can spot thousands of SNPs: enough to pinpoint an individual's unique pattern, Lents says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To study how dialects change over time, you need a single speaker who's lived in different regions and has been recorded a lot. In the winter of 2000, researchers from Macquarie University in New South Wales wondered exactly how regional dialect changes over time, and specifically, how younger speakers can impact a well-established dialect. To explore this idea, they needed a single person who'd given many public, recorded speeches over the span of decades. The study proved that attempts to preserve a specific pronunciation couldn't withstand social pressures over time. Fast-forward 25 years, and researchers at the University of Minnesota pondered a similar question: How exactly does dialect ebb and flow over the course of one's life? The scientists this time around also opted for royalty—pop royalty, that is. “Taylor Swift is perfect for this type of longitudinal analysis because she has been interviewed and recorded many times over the years and had motivations for changing her accent at specific times,” Matthew Winn, a researcher from the University of Minnesota and co-author of a new paper in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA)  said in a press statement. The team collected recordings and interviews of Swift from when she was living in Nashville, Tennessee, her home state of Pennsylvania, and New York City. From this audio, the team compiled 1,400 vowel sounds and used software to specifically measure vocal resonances. “We made ten measurements per vowel to show this movement, which was key to showing how her articulation changed in the different cities.” Social status, for instance, can impact how one person talks to another, and even the difference between talking to a stranger and talking to a friend or a lover can be perceptible in our speech. Additionally, dialects themselves are constantly changing, in part through a process known as “dialect leveling” where regional dialect differences are lost over time through social (or even economic) pressure to pronounce certain words a certain way. “Dialects are a key component of communities that can be defined by geographic region, social characteristics, and shared interests,” the authors wrote. “[Swift's] adaptive use of these dialect features builds on foundational work to demonstrate how the ways that talkers use their spoken language to convey identity and community belonging are malleable across the lifespan.” Experts Could Soon Heal Brain Damage from a Stroke</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Good Conversations Don't Require Everybody to Agree, Neuroscience Shows Brain imaging is illuminating the patterns linked to productive, positive dialogue, and those insights could help people connect with others With each turn of the news cycle, you may wonder how anyone in their right mind, seeing what they're seeing, could still hold differing political views from your own. Or I may stay close to issues where I know we agree so we can have a conversation that feels safe and easy. But there is a third option for navigating these conversations: curious exploration. My and my colleagues' research into the ways brain activity across people aligns or diverges as they converse suggests that seeking to persuade may not be the most fruitful way to approach a conversation. Instead an open attitude, allowing ourselves to traverse a range of ideas and to learn from other people's experiences, may be both more enjoyable and productive. When people's brain activity is in sync, it seems to indicate a common interpretation and understanding of what they are experiencing. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Strong political speeches can bring people's brains into sync with one another, for instance. But people get their news from politically polarized sources, which means that they encounter news coverage of different events and receive diverging analyses of the same events. This shapes their views of those issues and creates conflicting background assumptions when they encounter new political stories. In parallel, studies show divergence in brain responses when people with different political views engage with the news, as though they were making sense of different stories altogether. In research initiated by the late Emile Bruneau at the University of Pennsylvania, who died in 2020, and carried forward by Nir Jacoby, now at Dartmouth College, our team scanned the brains of participants who identified as Democrats or Republicans while they watched video clips of people talking about policies. We found that participants' brain activation in social and emotional processing systems was more aligned with people from their own party than it was with those from the opposing party. But evidence from a new technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hyperscanning, which can track brain activity during real conversations, complicates that idea. This method is exciting because it allows researchers to observe two brains in action at the same time. With hyperscanning, we can see how people's brains respond to one another during real-time conversation. My collaborators and I have been using it to understand the dynamics of good conversations—exchanges where people enjoy themselves, reach consensus on how to solve hard problems or help each other navigate emotional challenges. In a hyperscanning study, our team, including psychologists Lily Tsoi of Caldwell University, Shannon Burns of Pomona College, Sebastian Speer and Diana Tamir, both at Princeton University, gave friends and strangers instructionsto get to know each other better. Strangers, on average, gradually increased their neural synchony over the course of a conversation, whereas friends typically started out more in sync with one another early on. Then something interesting happened: after starting off more in sync, friends' patterns of brain activity in regions that process social interactions began to diverge. Strangers explored fewer topics and had less enjoyable conversations. But some pairs of strangers showed a pattern more like friends. These pairs seemed to use synchrony as a jumping-off point for exploring more ideas rather than an end. And in conversations where people needed to discuss their differences of opinion, we encountered a similarly intriguing finding. In still unpublished work, our team studied what happened as people discussed policy issues, such as the future of higher education and environmental concerns. When people came into the conversation looking to compromise, we found, this led to more expansive exploration (for example, covering more topics, mental states and brain patterns). Recently I tried to put these findings into practice while speaking with a colleague who held different views than I did and learned how events that had unfolded in his job and community had shaped his opinions and decisions. Although the conversation was tiring and did not end in complete agreement, it renewed our connection to each other and left me open to talking more. To be sure, individual conversations in isolation can't fix society's polarization. Our findings suggest one set of possibilities for people navigating conversations with those across divides. We can be more open, curious and exploratory when speaking with others rather than avoid controversies or start off pushing our viewpoint.

Nature Water (2025)Cite this article Widespread, persistent and toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a major threat to water systems and human health. Current detection methods are relatively expensive, slow and complex, underscoring the need for more accessible alternatives to meet increasingly stringent PFAS regulations. Here we present an ultrasensitive sensing platform for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid detection in tap water with a reporting limit ( ~ 250 parts per quadrillion) lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory standard (4 parts per trillion), using a remote gate field-effect transistor featuring β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-modified reduced graphene oxide as the sensing membrane. The sensor exhibits excellent selectivity against common inorganic ions, natural organic matter and select organic pollutants in tap water. The reversible and rapid response ( < 2 min) indicates the potential of remote gate field-effect transistor for continuous in-line monitoring. Mechanistic studies using quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulations reveal key roles of analyte adsorption and charge properties in sensing performance and offer insights for designing more selective PFAS capture probes.

New research shows that cow udder cells can be infected with human flu and bird flu viruses at the same time, which means the viruses could exchange genes and generate novel strains that would be better adapted to infecting people. In the U.S., a highly infectious form of the virus has also spread through dairy cattle herds, and 70 cases in people have been detected since February 2024. Virologists have been concerned about bird flu for decades because it has such a high mortality rate in humans. Globally, between 2003 and May 2025, there have been 976 reported cases in humans, almost half of which were fatal.

Through tests with cells in a lab, Gaunt and her colleagues have now shown that not only can cows' mammary glands can be infected with a human flu virus but also that many different types of influenza are able to replicate in the cow cells and that a single udder cell can be infected with human and avian flu viruses at the same time. The researchers have concluded that cow udders are a site where viruses could swap genetic material—a process known as reassortment—and generate new flu viruses that could potentially spread more easily or cause worse illness. Richard Webby, an expert in animal and human viruses at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who was not involved in the research, agrees the findings suggest that cow udders could be infected with both forms of virus. It is hard to predict the properties of any novel virus, Webby notes. If a new virus emerges that is like nothing humans have encountered before, people won't have immunity to it, Gaunt says. And infecting a living cow is harder, says Robert de Vries, a virologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who was also not involved in the study. But he says cow udders could be a potential viral mixing pot. Many researchers suspect human flu viruses may infect cows. “People haven't been testing for it because we considered this species as a nonhost,” he adds. Nevertheless, “if you set up surveillance for this, you will find it.” There is evidence that some cows have antibodies to human flu viruses, which suggests the animals have been infected by these pathogens even if the viruses themselves haven't been detected, Gaunt says. How U.S. cows initially caught bird flu isn't known. Scientists suspect contact with infected wild birds seeded the initial infections, but the virus seems to have spread among cows via contaminated milking equipment, Gaunt says. She suggests a cow could be infected with human flu if an ill farmworker wasn't wearing personal protective equipment (if they had access to any) and if the milking equipment wasn't disinfected between uses. Thoroughly cleaning milking equipment could help stop the spread, she says. Bird flu jumping into cattle in the first place is a relatively rare occurrence—as a human virus infecting the animals most likely would be, he says. “It would require a couple of rare events occurring at the same time,” he says.

Nature Communications volume 16, Article number: 8342 (2025) Cite this article Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of nanoscopic defects or microstructures in ice crystallized from liquid water has never been obtained. This is mainly due to the difficulties in preparing and preserving crystalline ice samples that can survive under high-resolution imaging conditions. Here, we report the stabilization and Å-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water by developing cryogenic liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (CRYOLIC-TEM). We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work improves our understanding of water crystallization behaviors at a molecular spatial resolution. Ice crystallization is one of the most important processes in the ecosphere and is central to atmospheric processes1,2,3, transportation safety4,5,6,7, biomedical cryopreservation8,9, and the food industry10,11. Among all ice species, hexagonal ice (type Ih) crystallized from liquid water is most prevalent in the ambient. Due to the weak hydrogen bonds between water molecules, these structures can easily deform on the molecular scale during crystallization12,13. The precipitation of dissolved gas in water can further generate cavities in ice crystals; their formation and migration are exclusive to liquid-crystallized ice14,15 with profound implications in glaciology and paleoclimatology16,17. Elucidating defects and microstructures of ice, particularly their molecular origins, is critical to understanding the thermodynamics, phase transformation, and mechanical properties of ice18 and many other hydrogen-bonded crystals19,20,21. Despite substantial interest in ice on the molecular scale, most studies rely on in-silico simulations22,23,24,25 and ensemble-scale spectroscopy and diffraction26,27,28. Meanwhile, real-space imaging in ice at this scale remains incredibly challenging due to the conflict between the low stability of ice and the harsh and invasive conditions often required by high-resolution imaging techniques. Recent breakthroughs in low-dose cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)29,30,31,32 and ultra-high vacuum scanning probe microscopy33,34 have enabled atomic-resolution imaging of ice condensed from the gas phase or converted from vitrified films. However, these experiments have typically been limited to crystals with random shapes and far-from-equilibrium structures because they rely on phase transformation and deposition at ultra-low temperatures in a high vacuum. Although cryo-TEM has recently been used to observe crystalline ice films prepared by liquid nitrogen, the structures that have been observed are limited to single crystals and low-energy stacking faults35. Molecular-resolution imaging of the microstructures and defects formed by the crystallization of liquid water remains elusive to date. Herein, we report an approach to freeze liquid water into high-quality ice Ih samples, termed cryogenic liquid-cell TEM (CRYOLIC-TEM), which allows for high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging. Inspired by advances in liquid-phase electron microscopy36, this method freezes liquid water between amorphous carbon (a-C) membranes into large-area (up to microns in size) single-crystalline ice Ih films stable under the electron beam. Aberration-corrected HRTEM imaging at a line resolution better than 2 Å is routinely achieved with a record of 1.3 Å in continuous single-crystalline regions. This new capability enables us to directly correlate lattice mapping with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on machine-learned models to elucidate defect nanostructures formed by liquid water crystallization. The formation, migration, coalescence, and dissolution trajectories of nanobubbles in single-crystalline ice are further observed in situ under the electron beam. This work provides a versatile way for accessing close-to-equilibrium ice Ih in TEM and unlocks previously inaccessible avenues to probe the nano- and molecular-scale interfacial configurations of ice and their structural dynamics. To freeze liquid water into ice Ih membranes suitable for TEM imaging, we first encapsulated deionized water between two TEM grids coated with a-C membranes and then loaded the sample onto a cryo-TEM sample holder (Fig. The sample was subsequently cooled by liquid nitrogen along with the holder. This process is substantially slower than vitrification in standard cryo-TEM, allowing for the crystallization of water. Flat, robust, and smooth a-C membranes are necessary for obtaining large-area, high-quality ice single crystals (Supplementary Fig. The surface properties of the a-C membrane are similar to that of graphite (Supplementary Figs. Exposing the cold sample to the atmosphere may result in the condensation of ice spherulites on the a-C film. This low-temperature (typically < −180 °C) gas-phase ice deposition results in far-from-equilibrium mixtures of ice Ih and Ic (Supplementary Fig. 4), consistent with literature reports26,30,31,37. In contrast, ice formed by water crystallization between the a-C membranes often shows a flat morphology (Fig. 1b) and can be easily distinguished from condensed ice. In these crystals, single-crystalline regions aligned (or close) to the [0001] zone axis can often be found with areas up to several microns (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. The thickness of encapsulated ice can vary from ~10 nm to micron-scale, depending on the geometry of the pocket (see Supplementary Fig. Still, high-quality HRTEM images can be acquired from relatively thin regions, achieving a record line resolution of 1.3 Å (Fig. Preparing samples on a double-tilt cryo holder further facilitates diffraction and HRTEM imaging of single crystals along other zone axes (Fig. 1e, f, and Supplementary Figs. Importantly, these single-crystalline areas can withstand HRTEM imaging for at least minutes (electron flux up to ~100 e Å−2 s−1) without developing discernable nanoscale defects (Supplementary Fig. a Schematic of encapsulating ice crystal sections from deionized (DI) water between amorphous carbon (a-C) films. b TEM image of a thin strip of ice crystal encapsulated between a-C films. c SAED pattern showing overall single crystallinity along the [0001] zone axis. d–f Schematic of the viewing direction (top row), average background subtraction (ABS)-filtered HRTEM (middle row), and Fourier transform (bottom row) of ice Ih along three zone axes. Both Miller-Bravais and Miller indices were given for convenience. EELS profiles in the low-loss (g) and oxygen K core-loss (h) regions. The low-loss profiles were deconvolved using the Fourier-log algorithm to remove the zero-loss peak and plural scattering. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Cryogenic electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) was performed to evaluate the high chemical purity of the encapsulated ice (Fig. After subtracting the inelastic scattering from the a-C membranes, the low-loss spectrum of encapsulated ice shows a relatively sharp peak centered at ≈8.5 eV and a broad peak at ≈15 eV (Fig. The former is characteristic of the excitonic 1b1 → 4a1 orbital transition of H2O in ice38,39 and can be unequivocally distinguished from the π → π* transition from graphitic carbon39 or aromatic organics38 at lower energy. Accordingly, this method results in highly pure ice samples by avoiding the organic contamination frequently encountered by other encapsulation techniques, such as frozen graphene liquid cells40, caused by the solute concentration effect41,42. The broad peak is located at a lower energy than the bulk plasmon typically reported in the literature29,38,39, possibly due to the ice-carbon interface. Core-loss EELS profiles for the oxygen K edge also confirmed the highly pure chemical environment of the encapsulated ice (Fig. The strip-shaped crystal section in Fig. 1b appears to be a single crystal according to diffraction criteria (Fig. Surprisingly, lattice-resolved HRTEM images reveal highly defective textures near the edge areas despite a perfect hexagonal pattern in the Fourier transform (Fig. A relatively strong defocus was applied to obtain sufficient contrast. Indeed, these edge areas are substantially more volatile under beam irradiation (electron flux density < 20 e Å−2 s−1) compared to large single-crystalline sections. The surface of this edge area is near-atomically smooth along the\(\,\left\langle \bar{1}100\right\rangle\) direction, which suggests an exposed \(\{\bar{2}110\}\) surface assuming a vertical facet. a HRTEM image of a defective ice section near the crystal edge (orange dashed line is a visual guideline). b Fourier transform of image a with three pairs of \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) reflections labeled as A, B, and C. c Intensity map of the three reflections in b indexed by red, green, and blue colors. d ABS-filtered HRTEM from the area highlighted by the dashed box in a colored by (c).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. To analyze the spatial distribution of the nanoscale defects, we developed a lattice amplitude mapping approach to evaluate the local crystal misorientation from the zone axis (see Methods). Colors in the map represent the relative strength of the lattice patterns in the three \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) directions. In this map (Fig. 2c), a white color suggests that the local area's zone axis [0001] is perfectly aligned with the incident electrons. A red color, for example, suggests that the local area is tilted by rotating around axis A in Fig. In this case, we only focus on the color balance rather than pixel intensities, as the varying thickness and the oscillatory contrast transfer function may complicate the latter. Nonetheless, nanostructures identified from lattice amplitude maps are generally insensitive to defocus, and only minor shifts in the overall color balance were observed at different defocus settings due to the slight imbalance of the beam deflectors (Supplementary Fig. The lattice amplitude map at the defective edge reveals many subdomains on the 10- to 20-nm scale that are tilted away from each other despite the appearance of single-crystallinity according to the diffraction pattern (Fig. 1c) and the Fourier transform (Fig. This observation contrasts with that of the highly continuous lattice, indicative of high-quality single crystals with minimal nanoscale defects, away from the thin edges (Supplementary Fig. By converting the red-green-blue (RGB) model of the composite image into the hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) model, we can further evaluate the orientation and the relative degree of the tilt (Fig. In this model, the pixel saturation represents the color balance, therefore is directly correlated to the orientation which the local crystal domain tilts toward. Here, the subdomain orientation shows a significantly wider distribution compared to that in continuous lattices (Supplementary Fig. The two dominant orientations are ≈9° and ≈127°, suggesting that the subdomain tilting towards the a axes (rotating around the normal vector of a primary prism plane) is slightly preferred. More importantly, the pixel saturation is associated with the relative tilt of the c axis from the imaging direction. This is a semi-quantitative evaluation because the absolute value depends on the crystal thickness. The saturation histogram reveals that the tilt angle is distributed over a wide range with multiple broad peaks, indicating the presence of shallow local energy minima. The HRTEM image further reveals the interfacial structures (Fig. Here, neighboring subdomains connect through relatively sharp interfaces or show gradual distortion over a few nanometers (i.e., mild change in the anisotropy of the lattice patterns). The typical tilt angle of such structures is on the scale of 1° to allow for the visibility of the ice \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) patterns according to both lattice visibility criteria43,44 (Supplementary Fig. 17) and kinematical TEM simulations (Supplementary Figs. Notably, a wide variety of interfaces exist with different tilt angles, orientations, and length scales. MD simulations were employed to study the interfacial structure and energy landscape of these configurations. We used a coarse-grained machine-learned bond order potential (ML-BOP) model of water, which correctly captured the thermodynamic properties of water phases in good agreement with experiments23. A low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) between two single-crystalline domains was constructed by rotating one around the a2 axis, annealing at 260 K, and cooling to 93 K (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 2). We systematically varied the sample thickness and initial tilt angle to evaluate the post-annealing structures and energetics in a broad structural space (see Supplementary Data 1). For very thin, freestanding ice structures consisting of a few molecular layers (thickness: ≈4.4 nm; h ≤ 2, where h is the number of supercells (3 unit cells in the c axis, ≈22 Å)), the post-annealing tilt angle significantly deviates from the initial setup (Fig. A wide range of tilt angles are unstable as structures bounce back or forward during annealing. As ice thickness increases, the range of unstable configurations and the tilt angle deviation during annealing are reduced. The same trend is also reflected in the energy landscape of the annealed structures (Fig. A substantial energy variance was observed for few-layer structures, indicating their instability. However, for thicker films of h = 6 and 12 (thickness: ≈13.2 and ≈26.3 nm), the energy profile converges and flattens out for tilt angles over ≈0.5° after an initial increase. This observation suggests that the energy penalties for varying the tilt angle of LAGBs in ice films may be minuscule. a The initial angle (upper panel) and the mean cohesive energy per molecule of annealed MD models at 93 K (\({\bar{E}}_{{{{\rm{c}}}}}\)) compared to that of an annealed perfect crystal (\({\bar{E}}_{{{{\rm{c}}}},{{{\rm{p}}}}}\); lower panel) as a function of the final tilt angle. Crystal thickness (h) is expressed in the number of supercells (3 unit cells in the c axis, ≈22 Å). b Cross-sectional models of the tilted ice (h = 6) with a final tilt angle of 0.34° (1), 0.96° (2), and 1.70° (3).

Beads: water molecules in ice, surface/amorphous (surf./am. ), or hydrate-like local configurations (other colors). Red curves represent dislocations of other types. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. To further understand the structural details of these boundaries, we examined the post-annealing MD trajectories (h = 6; Fig. With a low tilt angle (case 1, 0.34°), a defective region with disordered molecules and complex dislocations forms because the low tilt angle is insufficient to support a low-energy dislocation. This result corresponds to the initial energy rise as the tilt angle increases (Fig. When the tilt angle is sufficiently large (case 3, 1.70°), a perfect edge dislocation (Burgers vector, b = \(\frac{1}{3}\left\langle 1\bar{2}10\right\rangle\)) forms to compensate for the lattice mismatch (Fig. Interestingly, a moderate tilt angle (case 2, 0.96°) leads to a mixed edge and screw dislocation, with the Burgers vector roughly pointing to the a3 axis. If we look along the a2 axis, i.e., roughly along the dislocation line (Fig. 3c), the crystal in case 2 only has a sufficient tilt angle to accommodate a visual half-plane mismatch, in contrast to the one-unit-cell mismatch in case 3. To avoid the unstable partial edge dislocation, a partial screw dislocation was also generated, leading to a perfect unit cell mismatch (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. This behavior is repeatedly seen in crystals with a larger thickness and when more than one dislocation line is present (Supplementary Fig. Based on the analyses above, we summarize how ice films develop LAGBs while minimizing the energy penalty (Fig. In conventional inorganic materials, such as bulk metals (upper schematic), the LAGB energy increases monotonously against the tilt angle with increasing dislocation density45. In comparison, ice crystals are mediated by the weak hydrogen bonds and organized by the flexible tetrahedral structural motifs of water molecules.46 This feature enables a high tolerance to local lattice distortions, including disordered structures and dislocations, along with interfacial configurations characteristic of clathrates (e.g., interfacial beads identified in Fig. A large tilt angle gap exists in few-layer freestanding ice structures due to the unstable configuration (middle schematic). In ice films thicker than ≈10 nm relevant to our TEM experiments (lower schematic), the energy of the LAGB first increases due to elastic strain and the formation of disordered structures but then quickly flattens out over a wide range of tilt angles, owing to the formation of perfect dislocations regardless of the tilt angle. The presence of unstable configurations and shallow local energy minima could further explain the mild preference for certain tilt angles observed in the experiment (Fig. As such, LAGBs with various tilt angles can co-exist in ice films with low energy penalties. This conclusion is consistent with our TEM results. The annealed configuration from the MD (case 3) was used for multislice TEM simulation (Fig. The simulated TEM image correctly reproduced the isotropic hexagonal lattices on the right that are perfectly aligned with the [0001] zone axis. Meanwhile, the pattern on the left is elongated in the horizontal direction due to tilting, consistent with the lattice anisotropy observed from experimental images in tilted subdomains (Fig. The increase in anisotropy is also evidenced by the horizontal intensity profile for a row of lattice spots in Fig. Importantly, even though a single dislocation line is present in the middle, the pattern anisotropy exhibits a gradual transition across 1 to 2 nm, consistent with the interfacial transition observed in the experiments. Away from the defective edges described above, we investigated the interior regions of single-crystalline ice. Continuous hexagonal lattices were observed over large areas (Fig. 4a–c), and the lattice amplitude map reveals an absence of subdomains (Fig. a HRTEM image of an ice Ih crystal aligned to the [0001] zone axis from the interior area of a crystal section.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. In this region, we discovered many trapped gas bubbles in the form of nanoscale cavities in the crystal (Fig. 4a, circular and elliptical features labeled by arrows). Thickness gradients due to bubble curvature are evidenced by the significant contrast variations near the bubble surfaces. The formation of nanosized trapped bubbles is attributed to the relatively fast cooling rate of the thin sample compared to bulk freezing47. Note that these bubbles exist prior to imaging and remain unchanged throughout the imaging process. Therefore, it is most likely that they are generated by gas precipitation instead of radiolysis. By calculating the in-plane lattice distortion tensors using geometric phase analysis (GPA)48, we found that almost no additional strain field exists in the crystals surrounding the nanobubbles (Fig. 4e–g and Supplementary Fig. The distribution of all in-plane lattice distortion indicators (strains, rotation, and dilation) is significantly narrower than that of the subdomain-containing defective edge (Fig. Previous MD simulations for metals, such as Al, predicted strain fields surrounding a nanocavity (r = 10 nm) on the scale of 1–3%49. To understand the absence of such a strain field in ice, we first used continuum theories of elasticity to estimate the strain distribution around a spherical cavity50. The maximum elastic strains caused by the Laplace pressure of an ice nanobubble (r = 10 nm) is <0.4% (Supplementary Fig. As such, nanobubbles in ice should be expected to cause negligible strain fields, which agrees with the HRTEM-derived strain maps. Our MD simulations also confirm this conclusion. We modeled a spherical cavity (r = 6 nm) in an ice single crystal, melted the structures within 3 nm in the vicinity of the cavity surface, and recrystallized them in silico (see Methods and Supplementary Data 2). Volumetric strain analysis shows no discernable strain accumulation around the cavity, with a mean and standard deviation of only 0.30% and 1.00% (Fig. To further investigate the inner surface structure of the bubbles on the molecular scale, we moved to single-crystalline ice regions with a much lower thickness, where bubbles became quasi-cylindrical through-holes (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Movie 3). The reduced thickness allowed direct imaging and recognition of the lattice structures near the bubble surface. Notably, despite the overall curved shape, most exposed surfaces on the molecular scale can be attributed either to the primary prism planes, \(\{\bar{1}100\}\), or secondary prism planes, \(\{\bar{2}110\}\), assuming vertical facets. These two surfaces are the lowest-energy facets in ice Ih perpendicular to [0001]51,52. The ratio between the projected length of the primary and secondary prism planes is circa 3.8:1 (Table 1). The bubble model in MD simulations was also used to reveal the surface faceting at the molecular level (see Supplementary Note 2.2). A significant fraction of the surface molecules are exposed as basal, primary prism, or secondary prism planes (Fig. The fractional ratio between the primary and secondary prism planes in the MD-simulated cross-section at the center (Supplementary Fig. 38) and HRTEM follow the same trend predicted by their surface energy (Table 1). This result indicates that the trapped gas bubbles in the experiments are very close to thermodynamic equilibrium, and the nanoscale configurations we observed could reflect those in sufficiently annealed bubbles. We note that a lower amount of basal planes were observed in MD than prism planes despite their lower surface energy because the former must fit into the top and bottom curvatures. As such, trapped bubbles in ice are defined both by the macroscopic rounded shape and molecular-scale facets to minimize the total surface energy. The presence of these nanofacets may be important in defining the stability and migration kinetics of trapped gas bubbles in glacial systems16,53. When we elevated the stage temperature to −70 °C and reduced the electron flux density to 25 e Å−2 s−1, we observed nucleation and growth of new nanobubbles in single-crystalline ice sections under HRTEM conditions (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movie 4). The newly generated bubbles show similar shapes with trapped nanobubbles imaged at about −180 °C. Furthermore, these bubbles can migrate in the crystal and completely dissolve under the same conditions (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Movie 5) while the ice sample stays single-crystalline, suggesting that the system is near a steady state for bubble generation and ice recrystallization. Time-sequence drift-corrected HRTEM images at a stage temperature of −70 °C and an electron flux density of 25 e Å−2 s−1 showing three types of bubble dynamics: nucleation and growth (a), dissolution (b), and coalescence (c).

Curves are smoothing results (LOWESS, span = 0.15). f Calculated ice radiolysis kinetics at −70 °C and an electron flux density of 25 e Å−2 s−1. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Bubbles can also dynamically coalesce and merge into larger ones (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Movie 6). In this observation, two bubbles approached each other, and their outlines initially showed different thickness contrasts. However, the contrast matched upon coalescence, which suggests that the two bubbles physically connected rather than passed by at different vertical positions. The ice surfaces in the bubbles are highly dynamic, as shown by the significant reshaping of the merging ones. The persistent hexagonal patterns in the Fourier transform of the movies suggest that the ice sample stayed single-crystalline in these observations. GPA was performed on all frames to evaluate the mechanical consequences of the bubble trajectories. Here, the mean value of in-plane lattice dilation reflects the global distortion of the sample and only fluctuated within a range of ~1% throughout the experiments (Fig. The standard deviation of the lattice dilation was further calculated to evaluate local lattice distortion (Fig. Indeed, most data fall between the levels observed in the defective edges (Fig. 2) and the bubble-containing interior sections (Fig. These observations further show that nanobubbles cause insignificant strain fields in ice crystals even during their dynamic evolution. Bubble formation in ice under the electron beam can mainly be attributed to radiolysis54 and knock-on damage by the incident electrons55. To evaluate the radiolytic chemistry under the experimental conditions, we extended approaches developed for water radiolysis in liquid-phase electron microscopy56,57 to lower temperatures and numerically calculated the reaction kinetics at −70 °C and 25 e Å−2 s−1 (see Methods and Supplementary Data 3). Notably, the system reaches a steady state within seconds of gas generation (Fig. 5f), consistent with in-situ TEM results. It is crucial to recognize that radiolysis offers one credible explanation for the formation of new bubbles in these experiments, but detecting the content of the gas species is challenging in these experiments. Nonetheless, the formation of substantial H2 and O2 species is in agreement with cryogenic EELS analyses of amorphous ice58,59, highlighting the potential role of these gas molecules in constituting bubble volumes in our experiments. We have presented the first molecular-resolution imaging of nanoscopic defects in ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. The presented sample preparation method, which crystallized liquid water into thin ice films between a-C membranes, was a critical factor that led to this imaging breakthrough. These samples contain large-area single-crystalline regions that are sufficiently stable under HRTEM conditions for extended imaging. This method could be extended to prepare samples of mixed aqueous systems, as well as organic solvents, and provide new insights into liquid-liquid phase separation, solute precipitation, and the freezing behavior of organic liquids. Despite the presence of a heterogeneous interface between ice/water and the encapsulating membrane, the ice sample thickness is typically well beyond the thickness of interfacial regions (on the order of 1 nm)60 such that there is no significant deviation from the physics of bulk phase transformation. However, the interfacial equilibrium and properties at this length scale are anticipated to differ from those of the bulk. Therefore, caution must be exercised when translating conclusions from HRTEM studies to bulk crystals. By maneuvering the sample temperature and electron flux density, a near-steady state of bubble generation and dissolution in crystalline ice was achieved. A finer control over the imaging conditions will likely pave the way to the direct imaging of ice-water interfacial structures and, moreover, crystallization and melting dynamics with molecular resolution, a holy grail in the ice research community61,62,63. Experimental images and movies can now be directly compared and correlated to computations on an previously unattainable molecular length scale to reveal the underlying structures, molecular interactions, and phase transformation pathways. The direct extraction of such Å-scale information provides a new research paradigm for theory, modeling, and forecasting of ice crystallization and melting in environmental, biological, and material systems. Deionized (DI) water was generated by an ELGA PURELAB flex 2 system with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm. Carbon-coated Cu grids for TEM were purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. Ammonium persulfate (≥98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. In a typical experiment, 1–3 µL of DI water was dispensed on the carbon side of a TEM grid and loaded on a Gatan 626 single-tilt or a 915 double-tilt liquid nitrogen cryo-transfer holder, with the carbon/water side facing up. Another identical grid was put on top of the first one, with the carbon side facing down. The grid orientation was roughly aligned when placing the second grid, and the surface tension of water would then align and adhere the grids together. Depending on the models of the TEM and their column vacuum level, the sample can either be frozen inside or outside the column with liquid nitrogen. Freezing outside the TEM in the cryo transfer station is typically preferred for consistency. In either case, the copper shield remains closed during sample freezing. TEM was performed on an FEI Titan Environmental TEM [extreme-brightness Schottky field-emission gun (X-FEG), 300 kV] equipped with a CEOS double-hexapole aberration corrector (CETCOR) for the image-forming lenses and a Gatan UltraScan 1000 charge-coupled device (CCD) scintillation camera. A Gatan Metro 300 direct electron detector was used for the sample stability studies. TEM along zone axes other than [0001] was performed on an FEI Themis TEM (X-FEG, 300 kV) equipped with a CEOS CETCOR for the image-forming lenses and an FEI Ceta 16 M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scintillation camera. Low-loss EELS was performed on a JEOL JEM-ARM300CF GRAND ARM (cold FEG, 300 kV) equipped with a JEOL dodecapole expanding trajectory aberration corrector for the probe-forming lenses and a Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF) Quantum system. Convergence angle: 41.2 mrad; EELS collection angle: 62.4 mrad. EELS thickness measurements were conducted on an FEI Themis equipped with a GIF Quantum system with a convergence angle of 17.9 mrad and a collection angle of 36.18 mrad. Energy-filtered TEM was done on the same system. During the experiments, the temperature readout from the cryo holder is typically between −180 and −178 °C. For all Fourier transform images presented in this article, the modulus of the complex values are displayed and are scaled linearly. Average background subtraction (ABS) filtering64 of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images was performed using a script in Gatan DigitalMicrograph (http://www.dmscripting.com/hrtem_filter.html) with the following parameters: Delta = 5.0%, BW n = 4, BW Ro = 0.8, and low-frequency tapering = 1.0%. Low-loss EELS profiles were first processed by removing the plural scattering using the Fourier-log algorithm. All EELS profiles were smoothed by adjacent averaging with a 50-pixel moving window size. The lattice amplitude maps were calculated with the following procedures: (1) obtain the Fourier transform image; (2) mask only the circular areas containing the desired pair of lattice reflections and assign zero to all other pixels (mask diameter = 0.2 nm−1); (3) perform inverse Fourier transformation; (4) obtain the absolute value of the image (i.e., flip the sign of negative intensity values); (5) perform Gaussian smoothing with σ = 5 pixels (this may vary depending on the pixel size); (6) repeat this process for the other two pair of reflections; (7) overlay the three resulting images as a red/green/blue (RGB) stack. The lattice distortion maps (strain, rotation, and dilation) were calculated using the Strain++ package (https://jjppeters.github.io/Strainpp/) based on the geometric phase analysis (GPA) algorithm48. Zero-distortion points in GPA were chosen at the maximum-modulus frequencies in the Fourier transform. The Gaussian mask size (3σ) is set to 1/8 of the \(\{\bar{1}100\}\) g vector length. After obtaining an ice sample in TEM, the holder temperature was raised to −70 °C and stabilized. Movies were recorded by screen capturing at an electron flux density of 25 e Å−2 s−1 determined on the fluorescence screen through the integrated sensor. Frames were registered using the ImageJ StackReg module (http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/stackreg/). The thickness and surface roughness of the carbon membranes from the TEM grids were measured based on method described in ref. Briefly, the copper grid was etched by an ammonium persulfate aqueous solution (≈100 mg mL−1), leaving the carbon membrane floating on the solution surface. The carbon membrane was then transferred to a glass slide and then to DI water for cleaning, which was repeated two times. Finally, the membrane was transferred to a silicon wafer ready for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. AFM was performed on an Asylum Research Cypher ES with a Bruker RFESPA-75 probe (resonance frequency, 75 kHz; spring constant, 3 N m−1). The scan rate was 1.5 Hz, and the amplitude was between 300 and 350 mV. The thickness was determined at the edge of the membrane ruptures caused by drying. Image processing and quantification were performed with the Gwyddion package66 (http://gwyddion.net/). The chemical characteristics of the carbon membrane surface were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a Kratos Axis Ultra that uses a monochromatic focused Al Kα X-ray (1486.7 eV) source. The instrument was calibrated prior to the introduction of the sample and referenced to binding energies for Cu 2p3/2 at 932.67 ± 0.05 eV and Au 4 f at 84.0 ± 0.05 eV. The base pressure of the sample analysis chamber was maintained at 1.6 × 10−9 Torr. The sample was prepared by adhering the carbon-coated copper grid to a stainless-steel bar using copper tape. The tape was used only in the corners, while at least two data points were analyzed from the center of the grid. Since the carbon-coated copper grid was conductive, no neutralizer was applied, and the results were analyzed without any charge correction. Furthermore, the water contact angle was measured by drop-casting ≈1-µL of DI water onto a TEM grid and immediately capturing a side-view image. The drop shape was fitted to calculate the contact angle67. Experiments were repeated on three separate TEM grids. Kinematical HRTEM simulation from single crystals was performed using the ReciPro package68 (https://seto77.github.io/ReciPro/). The simulation assumes a parallel beam condition, a beam energy of 300 keV ± 0.8 eV, Cs = 4 μm, and Cc = 1.4 mm. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were simulated based on the dynamical theory using ReciPro, assuming a sample thickness of 30 nm. Polycrystal SAED radial profiles were simulated based on the kinematical theory using the CrystalDiffract package (CrystalMaker Software, https://crystalmaker.com/crystaldiffract/). These simulations used the experimentally derived ice Ih crystal structure in the space group P63/mmc69,70. Multislice TEM simulation71 based on explicit models from coarse-grained MD was performed with the QSTEM package72 (https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/en/sem/software/software_qstem) using the same TEM parameters. An F atom was used in place of a water molecule in the coarse-grained MD model for image simulation. The MD simulations were performed using a coarse-grained machine-learned bond order potential (ML-BOP) model of water23. For grain boundary simulations, minimal-energy configurations of bi-grain ice models with different thicknesses and tilt angles were first established and equilibrated with the conjugate gradient algorithm73. The models were subsequently annealed in silico using the LAMMPS package74 at 260 K and then gradually cooled to 93 K in the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble. For nanobubble simulations, a cavity of a radius of 6 nm was created in a single-crystalline ice Ih model by removing the molecules within. The model was first equilibrated in LAMMPS at 260 K and 1 bar. The surface areas of the bubble (thickness: 3 nm) were subsequently heated to 270 K and then 370 K for melting, and finally cooled back to 260 K for recrystallization. For detailed procedures, see Supplementary Note 2. The OVITO package75 (https://www.ovito.org/) was used to perform local symmetry identification using the CHILL+ algorithm76 and dislocation analysis using an extended dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA)77. Radiation chemistry is modeled by considering the interplay of twelve reactants relevant for liquid-phase TEM (H2O, H2, O2, H2O2, H, OH, HO2, H+, HO2−, O2−, OH−, and the solvated electron eh−). An amorphous ice sample with no spatial anisotropy is considered. The reactions among these reactants span a kinetic model that is described by a set of coupled differential equations78: Here, ci denotes the concentration of the reactant i, t the time, k the reaction-rate constant of the respective reaction, Gi the generation value (G-value) of i upon electron irradiation, and ρ the density of amorphous ice (0.92 g L−1)79. The dose rate ψ is calculated from Eq. (2), ϕ is the electron flux density, and e is the elementary charge. As the inelastic scattering of 300 keV electrons in amorphous ice appears to be reasonably close to that in water81,82, a density-normalized stopping power S of 2.36 MeV cm−2 g−1 was approximated83. For an electron-flux density of 25 e Å−2 s−1, this yields a dose rate of 9.45 × 107 Gy s−1. The harnessed kinetic model extrapolates Arrhenius-based rate constants84 to lower temperatures (Supplementary Table 8). As cryogenic G values are unavailable59, room temperature values are used (Supplementary Table 9)85. Modeling is performed using a temperature-dependent extension of AuRaCh57.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from Washington State University suggests a new paradigm in understanding sleep, demonstrating that a substance in the mesh-like walls of bacteria, known as peptidoglycan, is naturally present in the brains of mice and closely aligned with the sleep cycle. Those findings serve to update a broader hypothesis that has been in development at WSU for years -- proposing that sleep arises from communication between the body's sleep regulatory systems and the multitude of microbes living inside us. "This added a new dimension to what we already know," said Erika English, a PhD candidate at WSU and lead author on two recently published scientific papers introducing the findings. This view of sleep as arising from that "holobiont condition" joins a growing body of evidence suggesting that our gut microbiomes play an important role in cognition, appetite, sex drive and other activity -- a view that turns traditional brain-centric models of cognition upside-down and has implications for our understanding of evolution and free will, as well as the development of future treatments for sleep disorders. The recent findings regarding peptidoglycan, or PG, lend weight to that hypothesis and point to a possible regulatory role for bacterial cell wall products in sleep. PG is known to promote sleep when injected in animals, but until recently, the conventional view held that it did not naturally migrate to the brain. English found that PG, along with its receptor molecules involved in PG signaling and communication, was present in different locations within the brain, at levels that changed with the time of day and sleep deprivation. English is also lead author of a recent paper with Krueger in the journal Sleep Medicine Reviews that proposes the "holobiont condition" hypothesis of sleep. One posits that sleep is regulated by the brain and neurological systems. Another focuses on "local sleep," which frames slumber as the result of an accumulation of sleep-like states among small cellular networks throughout the body. It happens at many different speeds for different levels of cellular and tissue organization and it comes about because of extensive coordination." Links between the microbiome and behavior are emerging on several fronts, indicating that micro-organisms formed in the gut play an important role in cognition and fundamental human behaviors. "We have a whole community of microbes living within us. Those microbes have a much longer evolutionary history than any mammal, bird or insect - much longer, billions of years longer," said Krueger, who was named a "Living Legend in Sleep Research" by the Sleep Research Society in 2023. "Now that the world has come to appreciate how important microbes are, not just for disease but also for health, it's a very exciting time to start to expand on our understanding of how we are communicating with our microbes and how our microbes are communicating with us," she said.
