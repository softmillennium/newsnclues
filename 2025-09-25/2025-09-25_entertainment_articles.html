                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Together Again, Jesse Hassenger looks at actors and directors who have worked together on at least three films, analyzing the nature of their collaborations. It wouldn't be right to call Philip Seymour Hoffman a chameleon. Even before he became an Oscar winner and frequent player of first and second leads, Hoffman was a “that guy” character actor too distinctive to fully disappear into his roles. You don't hire “that guy” for his mastery of disguise. That the lovelorn porn-movie boom operator from Boogie Nights could also be the lonely obscene phone-caller in Happiness, or a wild tornado chaser from Twister might branch into a gregarious Lester Bangs in Almost Famous or an imitation Jack Black in Along Came Polly. Those are three major modes of Philip Seymour Hoffman, and far from the only ones. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't completely avoid casting Hoffman in his various types across their five movies together. But he often seemed to stay a step or two ahead of the conventional wisdom around how to use one of his favorite actors—skipping, for example, over the early supercilious-prep phase entirely. This vein ran through some of Hoffman's supporting work for years, well after he was done playing actual prep-schoolers, eventually turning into a kind of malicious inquisitiveness. But by virtue of identification with morally dubious characters, they're naturally antagonistic. Anderson cast Hoffman in antagonistic parts, too, but never especially witty ones. In Hard Eight, Anderson's first feature, Hoffman is on screen for less than three minutes, playing an obnoxious gambler at the craps table with the older, quieter, more experienced Sydney (Philip Baker Hall). Okay?”) He isn't on screen much more than he is during Hard Eight—maybe five minutes as opposed to three—but he looms more heavily over the proceedings as the would-be tormenter of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), via a phone-sex-line scam. Barry lacks Sydney's even keel, but his explosive bursts of rage are balanced by soft-spoken sweetness. Hoffman's Dean Trumbell, better known as the Mattress Man, defaults to rage and disgust in seemingly any interaction, paradoxically opening his side of several conversations with “Shut up.” Hoffman's most famous moment in the movie is a variation on this: When Barry confronts him about his extortion on the phone, he unleashes a barrage of “Shut! Shut up!” When Barry confronts him in person and Dean backs down, he still can't resist getting the last word in, screaming insults at Barry as he leaves, then immediately invoking Barry's proposed “That's that” like a kid on a playground frantically touching base during a game of tag. Anderson leaves the Mattress Man's ultimate motivations—whatever feelings he has beneath his contemptuous impatience—unspoken and offscreen, which makes him a sleaze-world version of the villain Hoffman would play in Mission: Impossible III a few years later. Hoffman's Scotty fits perfectly into this schema, which is to say he doesn't especially fit at all; he's the kid at the class party, lingering on the sidelines, genially tolerated but unloved on a deeper level. Scotty's story as it relates to the bigger picture—he's in love with an oblivious Dirk, he acts on it, and gets rebuffed—is pretty much over with an hour of the movie to go. But he sticks around, and doesn't meet the kind of end you might expect from the quiet tragedy of his unrequited love. For an arrogant and reportedly drug-addled late-'90s enfant terrible, Anderson spared many of his early characters from the worst possible suffering. Yet only the absolute worst misdeeds seem likely to face great cosmic punishment. Amid this assembly of Anderson's favorite actors, the filmmaker again zig-zags with Hoffman; having previously helped establish him as a jackass and then reshaped him as a socially awkward and emotionally needy type, he casts him here as Phil Parma, the home nurse caring for the dying Earl Partridge (Jason Robards). There's a feint early on, when Phil orders a few groceries for delivery, then casually tacks on copies of Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler; audiences could be forgiven for making an unconscious connection and wondering if Phil is meant to be some kind of creep. Yet, he turns out to be perhaps the most purely good person in Magnolia short of actual children. It may not be a coincidence that the character shares Hoffman's first name. That position gives him more to do this time, just as most of the characters in Magnolia are more multifaceted than their Boogie Nights counterparts. As Earl's nurse, witness to his decline, Phil has greater empathy for the man than someone who's spent decades with him (or estranged from him), though he seems more than faintly aware of how difficult the old bastard can be. When Earl feebly asks to get in touch with his son Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), Phil reaches out on his behalf and makes it happen. And you gotta believe me, this is really happening. In one of the most impressive casts of its era, it's difficult to picture anyone else in the ensemble making that dialogue work. Maybe that emotional rawness helps explain why Hoffman only has a small part in Punch-Drunk Love, and nothing in There Will Be Blood; Anderson's work was becoming a bit more obtuse during a period where Hoffman (thanks in part to Anderson) was more frequently and traditionally ingratiating. Then, after a decade apart, during which Hoffman won an Oscar for his standard biopic transformation in Capote and Anderson directed Daniel Day-Lewis to another Oscar for There Will Be Blood, Anderson and Hoffman came full circle with The Master—sort of. As in Hard Eight, Hoffman antagonizes the lead character, this time as the older man of greater (if self-styled) authority set against a younger, wilder man. But Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman) isn't exactly the villain of The Master, any more than Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) registers as a hero. The movie's point of view sticks mostly with Quell—including several scenes that seem like hallucinations or dreams, most notably when he sees Dodd singing to a room full of women who are suddenly all unclothed. This is not happening in the objective reality of this scene; it's all bundled up with Quell's neuroses, as he returns home from World War II, adrift and alcoholic and almost ruinously horny. Quell happens upon Dodd by chance, as the latter begins to build up The Cause, a Scientology-like religion full of pseudoscience and pseudophilosophy. Dodd rankles at challenges to his credentials, or his authority in general; at one Cause meeting, he haughtily dismisses one questioner with well-coiffed confidence until the man's persistence finally causes Dodd to rip the lid off of his rage and call out “Pigfuck!” in a way that suggests he had been suppressing the epithet for the entire interaction. Yet Quell's far more insinuating way of challenging him—by quite evidently not being a true believer, by attaching his lostness to this temporary solution that probably can't last—elicits Dodd's admiration alongside his frustration. Quell's id-like, tortured soul reflects Dodd's own divided psyche, the raging, redfaced side of himself he attempts to hide behind a quasi-academic composure. His occasional outbursts recall Punch-Drunk Love, and his queasy fascination with Quell plays like a more refined version of Scotty's transparent longings; mostly, though, past Hoffman performances are only faint, ghostly echoes, with that character-actor ethos emerging again. Dodd puts that sensibility into lofty, borderline ridiculous words: “If we meet again in the next life,” he tells Quell before he leaves The Cause for good, “you will be my sworn enemy, and I will show you no mercy.” If Anderson was ahead of the curve in his casting of Hoffman, how Lancaster Dodd might be reflected in his future roles remains a mystery. He made a couple of small non-Hunger Games pictures in between The Master and his death, but The Master feels like his last big one—and his first really big one for Anderson, despite the pair serving as each other's most frequent major collaborator. So there's something both familiar and completely new about having Hoffman's son Cooper star outright in Licorice Pizza, a coming-of-age comedy released almost eight years after the older Hoffman's death. Cooper Hoffman is his own person, giving a lovely performance in Licorice Pizza that falls far afield from how his dad might have played it, had he somehow been given the chance as a teenager. The elder Hoffman brought spiritual weight to many of his performances; he's hilarious in Punch-Drunk Love, but the Mattress Man also appears profoundly unhappy. Cast in the shadow of his father's death, subtly underlined by Gary's father never appearing in the film, that lightness never feels lightweight. Yet for those who love Hoffman's work, a melancholy awareness creeps in; in a barely perceptible way, Philip Seymour Hoffman lingers around the edge of this movie, too. The older Hoffman flashed an ingratiating star quality in certain parts; so far, the younger Hoffman leads with that quality, with flashes of something weightier. Towards the end of Licorice Pizza, when Gary is stalking around his latest business, throwing kids out of his Pinball Palace seemingly out of frustration that he's not enjoying himself more, Hoffman's brusqueness uncannily mimics his dad—in one mode, anyway.

Neil said doctors were able to discover that he had suffered the other strokes because they had “scarred right around the same spot” and that there were four scars in his brain due to strokes.

I went from a wheelchair to a walker to a cane to — I can walk now, but for five months it was just off and on, not knowing what's gonna happen.” He continued: “And the doctor said that I probably wouldn't be onstage again. Back in March, Neil had shared that the band — which he comprises with Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx, and new guitarist John 5 — would push back the residency from March to September over a vocal procedure. “My health is my top priority so I can bring you the awesome shows you deserve, and I can't wait to return to the stage,” Neil said in a statement at the time. However, the health issue was much more serious. To the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Neil explained that he did physical therapy for months in Nashville before being able to rehearse. You try to walk, but it doesn't come out right,” he explained, adding that he's around 95 percent back to “where I was before.” Mötley Crüe: The Las Vegas Residency kicked off at Dolby Live at Park MGM in Las Vegas earlier this month.

TelevisaUnivision Goes Public With YouTube TV Carriage Fight, "Discriminatory" Tactics What we knew was that when we looked at what customers enjoyed doing while on board via the Internet, the number one platform they were streaming was YouTube, and so we knew our customers love YouTube, and we knew we wanted to continue to elevate the experience for our customers,” adds Julieta McCurry, Delta's vp inflight entertainment and connectivity strategy. “So this partnership made a lot of sense — two leaders in each other's industries, really coming together to be able to create a really awesome experience for customers.” Passengers will be able to use Delta's inflight Wifi to access YouTube on their personal devices, of course, but a curated selection of YouTube content will also be added to Delta's inflight entertainment system, accessible via seatback screens, beginning Sept. 25. It is such a vast library, it's really hard sometimes to understand what's out there and what might I enjoy,” McCurry says. “I think about it as featured content, and we do this, obviously, in partnership with Delta, and we'll periodically update it,” Quiroga says. In-flight entertainment has emerged as a surprisingly prime piece of real estate for media companies, but while some, like Peacock, may cut deals for exposure to their programming, YouTube isn't in need of such brand positioning. “Our point of view is, consumers want to have us wherever they need to be, and being in the air or being a part of this type of relationship, we just think makes a ton of sense for us — there's always something new to surprise and delight in the YouTube experience as well,” Quiroga says. Part of that surprise and delight will come in October, when eligible passengers will be able to try out YouTube Premium, an ad-free subscription service, in a two-week free trial. McCurry says that the playlist actually came about from an impromptu conversation between a YouTube Music executive and one of Delta's flight attendants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As played by June Squibb, the title character of Scarlett Johansson's feature directorial debut is a bitingly sarcastic, tell-it-like-it-is nonagenarian who, in the midst of profound grief, makes an unconscionable decision. But Johansson's well-meaning film couldn't be more aggravating, and its biggest problem is its insistence that we find Eleanor so damn endearing, no matter what. Eleanor lives in Los Angeles with her best friend Bessie (Rita Zohar), whom she's known for 70 years. They've been roommates since their husbands died more than a decade ago, constantly trading quips and telling off whippersnapper grocery store employees. But, occasionally, Bessie has trouble sleeping, waking up from nightmares that take her back to her childhood in Poland, where she barely survived the concentration camps. At their kitchen table before the sun comes up, Bessie relates her horror stories to Eleanor, who tries to make her friend feel better. But those emotional scars are permanent, and Bessie knows she'll wear them to the grave. When Bessie does die, the terribly alone Eleanor flies to New York to move in with one of her adult daughters, divorced mom Lisa (Jessica Hecht), with whom she's never been close. Reluctantly attending one such event, Eleanor gets distracted by a separate meeting being held down the hall, only belatedly realizing she's accidentally joined a support group for Holocaust survivors. Tory Kamen's screenplay quickly provides the answer: A sweet NYU journalism student, Nina (Erin Kellyman), attends the meeting for an article she's writing, moved by Eleanor's harrowing tale. With her daughter and grandson (Will Price) wrapped up in their own lives, Eleanor doesn't have much human contact, so she lets Nina interview her, befriending this college student in the process. Unfortunately, the longer Nina spends with Eleanor, the more Eleanor draws on Bessie's stories, essentially creating an alternate identity based on her late friend. Adding more complications, Nina's father Roger (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the charming host of a local TV news segment focusing on unique New Yorkers, becomes interested in doing a broadcast on Eleanor's remarkable (and wholly fabricated) past. But once Eleanor starts stealing from Bessie's experiences, the deceit becomes troubling. But for the most part, Eleanor doesn't display any sense of guilt or concern—she's just so grateful to have a new friend. A sharper movie would have explored those intriguing questions. Her manipulative film introduces an inherently nervy premise but then quickly and unconvincingly pivots away from its more serious implications. Squibb plays Eleanor with blandly crotchety adorableness, her incurious movie ignoring any potentially compelling inner conflict. (Belatedly, Eleanor wants to finally have her bat mitzvah, inspiring an on-the-nose scene in which a rabbi discusses the Torah's teachings about lying.) But like another falsely feel-good film about bigotry—Jojo Rabbit, which earned Johansson an Oscar nomination—Eleanor The Great seeks uplift not insight. We're expected to sympathize with Eleanor because she's a lovable, lonely stinker who made an innocent mistake that got out of hand.

The Los Angeles Festival of Movies (LAFM), heading into its third year April 9 – 12 in 2026, has parted ways with MUBI as a presenting sponsor, as LAFM shared on Instagram Thursday. The festival launched in 2024 with MUBI as a sponsor to bring the best of independent film to Los Angeles over one weekend. MUBI has been subjected to internal and external strife since receiving a $100 million investment from the venture capital company Sequoia, which has also supported companies tied to Israeli military technology amid the war on Gaza.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deadline understands that Henson, who was most recently unscripted chief at NBC, is joining Beast Industries, the company founded by MrBeast, the world's top YouTuber. Henson has been named Head of Beast Industry Studios, which oversees MrBeast's YouTube channels as well as its moves into longform streaming series such as Beast Games, the Amazon competition series that has been renewed for two further seasons. It comes as MrBeast, otherwise known as Jimmy Donaldson, is expanding more into traditional television alongside his growing YouTube empire, where he has over 440 million subscribers. “MrBeast rewired how millions of people consume entertainment. “We're not just creating franchises, we're building worlds that actually matter to fans — and doing it across every screen.” Henson will report to Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries. Tech entrepreneur Housenbold joined the company last year. Housenbold told Deadline that he wants to turn Beast Industries into the next Disney. “Just like Disney has Mickey [Mouse], it also has Lucasfilm, Pixar, Marvel, Searchlight, ABC, ESPN, and so on — we have Jimmy. “Corie brings world-class experience and a proven ability to scale iconic franchises. We're excited for her to lead Beast Industries Studio as we continue to blend the best of traditional entertainment with creator-driven innovation and expand our global impact,” he added. In addition to his YouTube projects and Beast Games, Donaldson is also writing a book with James Patterson, launching an animation studio and a video game platform, and is releasing a theatrical feature. The company is also developing more unscripted and scripted series, which will be overseen by Henson. Earlier this year, Donaldson explained the rationale behind Beast Games, which saw 1,000 contestants compete in a series of physical, mental and social challenges to win a grand prize. “I've just always been really excited about taking the big spectacles we do on YouTube but being able to do it over an episodic series where we could actually get to know the contestants and have more depth and story and get more invested into the challenges and games. The idea was to take what we do on YouTube, but make it 10 times bigger and 20 times better,” he told Deadline. Beast Games, which premiered on Amazon's streaming service in December and ran through February, saw Donaldson give away $25 million in prize money including a $10M prize to the winner. The show was renewed for two more seasons in May. She joined NBCUniversal in 2022, where she became EVP, Unscripted Content, Competition and Game Shows, where she oversaw NBC staples such as America's Got Talent and The Voice as well as Peacock hits The Traitors and Love Island. Henson's big win at NBC was Deal or No Deal Island, a new spin on the classic game show that returned for a second season after strong ratings for its first season. She also greenlit Destination X, a major new adventure format that is expected to launch later this year and will likely be the first of a number of interesting international co-productions and deals. Before NBCU, Henson worked at Warner Bros. She was previously EVP, Head of Unscripted for TBS, TNT and truTV before she decided to leave following Warner Bros.' merger with Discovery. There, she oversaw series such as the reboot of Wipeout, The Go-Big Show and The Cube as well as Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses, the Warner Bros-produced, Helen Mirren-fronted competition series that performed well for TBS and Cartoon Network.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Oscar nominee Josh Brolin, who is coming off box office smash Weapons, has come on board to headline the action-comedy Mister from Bright White Light and John Wick outfit Thunder Road. As we told you during Cannes, the film will mark the directorial debut of well known second unit and action director Wade Eastwood, whose credits include Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Jumanji: The Next Level. Mister follows a man (Brolin) who wakes up in a strange house covered in blood and comes to realize his true identity while fighting off contract killers from his past — including everyone from his exes to his best friend. To get out, he teams up with his estranged daughter who also has ended up in the family business, but they will need to repair their relationship in order to survive. Nicki Cortese, who also penned the script with Nick Inglis, will produce with Wayne Marc Godfrey for Bright White Light (Runner), which also is financing the film. Executive producers include Chase Vergari, Ibrahim Mohammed, Eric Handler and Will Flynn. Black Bear represents international rights on the film, with CAA Media Finance handling domestic. Sophie Meyer and Alex Bigman will oversee for Bright White Light. Following his acclaimed performance in the breakout hit Weapons, Brolin next will be seen in Edgar Wright's The Running Man and Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. “Having the opportunity to collaborate with Josh is everything I could have hoped for,” said director Eastwood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Star Trek” actor William Shatner, who played the role of Captain Kirk, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 24, TMZ reports. The outlet adds that he “experienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon,” with the actor having “called emergency medical service workers for help as a precaution and paramedics showed up in an LAFD ambulance.” Shatner was taken to a local hospital, with TMZ reporting that he's doing “good” and “resting comfortably.” TMZ posted on social media, sharing the news, and many fans left comments, showing support for Shatner. I hope he's not beamed up just yet.. Stay strong @WilliamShatner.. In June 2025, Shatner opened up about a medical condition he has been dealing with for years called tinnitus. According to the Mayo Clinic, tinnitus is “when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears,” however, it isn't “caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.” The condition began when he was filming “Star Trek” due to the special effects explosion. “Over the years, I've had many ups and downs with my tinnitus,” he said. “I know from firsthand experience just how difficult it can get.” “It”s a diverse condition that comes in different degrees of severity. There are no effective treatments—and that's why we need more research,” he added. Shatner has played many iconic roles, including Captain Kirk, Denny Crane, T.J. Hooker. So with that, he is asking fans to “submit your own tale of how my characters: be it Kirk, T.J. Hooker, or even Denny Crane—have touched your life.” And a lucky few will get the opportunity to be interviewed by Shatner about their stories, while will be featured in the book.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two men who have long accused Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children are seeking a whopping $400 million in their court cases, his estate revealed in recent court filings. Wade Robson and James Safechuck have spent more than a decade litigating over their allegations of sexual abuse – and in a motion filed last week in Los Angeles court, Jackson estate executors John Branca and John McClain say they're seeking a monumental sum. “It would be disastrous for the Estate to default in this case,” Branca and McClain wrote in the court filings, which were obtained by Billboard. The revelation came amid an intra-estate dispute with Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson, who claims Branca and McClain have paid too much in legal bills to certain law firms. In the new filing, the executors argue that not paying those fees would have “profoundly destabilizing consequences,” including a costly judgment for Robson and Safechuck. Though Robson and Safechuck have being suing for years, it had never been reported that they were seeking such a massive award. Jackson, who died suddenly in 2009, was never convicted or held legally liable on any accusation of child molestation, but is still dogged by such allegations. Last year, the estate took legal action against a man named Frank Cascio, claiming he fabricated such claims as part of an alleged $213 million extortion attempt. Robson and Safechuck have spent years suing, and their allegations were amplified in 2019 by HBO docuseries Leaving Neverland, which laid out their claims in disturbing detail. In 2023, an appeals court revived their abuse lawsuits against Jackson's companies, and the cases remain pending with a trial currently scheduled for next year. Paris Jackson filed her petition in June, challenging how the estate had paid its lawyers. The Estate's attorneys — and those of its constituent businesses — are not going to work for free.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Billboard's music business podcast On the Record, senior editor Griselda Flores talks concert cancellations and the lack of Latin artists at Coachella. When Donald Trump was elected to his second term as President of the United States last November, Billboard‘s senior Latin editor, Griselda Flores, began watching to see if his forthcoming immigration policy changes would impact the Latin music business. There was already a historical pattern to support this thinking: Back in the 2000s, when George W. Bush strengthened immigration enforcement and tightened visa restrictions, Billboard found that it hurt the business of Latin music concert promoters, who depend on immigrants to fill seats. Through Flores's extensive reporting, she found that Trump's policies did, in fact, have some economic and cultural impact on this sector of the music industry. The Michelada Festival in Chicago was cancelled last minute this summer, citing a “rapidly changing political climate” and “uncertainty” around artist visas. Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny announced he would not be coming to the U.S. on his next tour, citing a fear of potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in the crowd. Mexican-born Narcocorridos artists and Cuban acts found it hard to get visas, and stadium-level acts like “Box Office King” Julión Álvarez had visas canceled at the last minute before shows.

Rihanna is now a proud mother of three. The musician announced on social media that she gave birth to a baby girl named Rocki Irish Mayers on Saturday, September 13. She had revealed her pregnancy in May on the carpet for the 2025 Met Gala.

Rihanna and her partner, A$AP Rocky, welcomed their first child, RZA Athelston Mayers, in 2022, and the singer gave birth to her second son, Riot Rose Mayers, in 2023. Despite the couple's predilection for “R” names, A$AP Rocky (who was born Rakim Athelston Mayers) had recently joked to GQ that he might name his third child Denzel, in honor of his Highest 2 Lowest co-star Denzel Washington.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Star Trek” actor William Shatner, who played the role of Captain Kirk, was rushed to the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 24, TMZ reports. The outlet adds that he “experienced an issue with his blood sugar while at his home in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon,” with the actor having “called emergency medical service workers for help as a precaution and paramedics showed up in an LAFD ambulance.” Shatner was taken to a local hospital, with TMZ reporting that he's doing “good” and “resting comfortably.” TMZ posted on social media, sharing the news, and many fans left comments, showing support for Shatner. I hope he's not beamed up just yet.. Stay strong @WilliamShatner.. In June 2025, Shatner opened up about a medical condition he has been dealing with for years called tinnitus. According to the Mayo Clinic, tinnitus is “when you experience ringing or other noises in one or both of your ears,” however, it isn't “caused by an external sound, and other people usually can't hear it.” The condition began when he was filming “Star Trek” due to the special effects explosion. “Over the years, I've had many ups and downs with my tinnitus,” he said. “I know from firsthand experience just how difficult it can get.” “It”s a diverse condition that comes in different degrees of severity. There are no effective treatments—and that's why we need more research,” he added. Shatner has played many iconic roles, including Captain Kirk, Denny Crane, T.J. Hooker. So with that, he is asking fans to “submit your own tale of how my characters: be it Kirk, T.J. Hooker, or even Denny Crane—have touched your life.” And a lucky few will get the opportunity to be interviewed by Shatner about their stories, while will be featured in the book.
