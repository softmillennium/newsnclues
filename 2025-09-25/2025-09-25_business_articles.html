                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on Thursday argued that the Supreme Court should reject President Donald Trump's request that he be allowed to fire her pending the outcome of her lawsuit challenging her removal. "The President's stay application asks this Court to act on an emergency basis to eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve Board," Cook's lawyers wrote in a new filing with the Supreme Court. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders that block him from firing Cook while her suit plays out. The president said in late August that he was firing her because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud. Earlier Thursday, a group that included every living former Federal Reserve chair, along with a number of former Treasury secretaries and former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers urged the Supreme Court to deny Trump's request to fire Cook for now. The Supreme Court could at any time rule on Trump's request. The key question in Cook's case is whether Trump has legal cause as required by the Federal Reserve Act to fire her. In their filing Thursday, Cook's lawyers said that Trump was citing "flimsy, unproven allegations of pre-office wrongdoing — allegations conveniently timed following the President's criticisms of the Board's policy decisions." Trump had complained for months that the Fed's board was not cutting interest rates as he wanted. The Fed last week lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point, with Cook participating in that decision. "This Court should deny the President's extraordinary application because his arguments defy established precedent and longstanding practice," Cook's lawyers said in their filing. "This litigation has barely begun, and further factfinding could avoid the need for this Court to decide the high-stakes legal issues raised in the President's application," her lawyers wrote. "On the merits, this Court is likely to reject each of the President's legal theories. The lawyers wrote that the Supreme Court is "likely" to ultimately ruled that the "for cause" standard provided by the Federal Reserve Act is meaningful protection for a Fed governor, "and is not satisfied by manufactured charges based on conduct that pre-dates her service on the Board."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The gunman who killed one detainee and wounded two others at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas was trying to target ICE personnel and appeared to be planning his attack for months, authorities said Thursday. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn of Texas, "specifically intended to kill ICE agents" in Wednesday's ambush, said Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Dallas field office, at a news conference. Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said that Jahn described ICE employees as "people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck" in one of those notes. The notes also included a plan of attack and target areas, and they indicated that he did not want to kill or harm detainees. Jahn also explicitly states in the notes, "Yes, it was just me," Larson said. Jahn's actions are "the very definition of terrorism," Larson said. The news conference came hours after FBI Director Kash Patel said in an X post that Jahn had searched online for "Charlie Kirk Shot Video" as recently as the day of the attack. Jahn also recently searched apps tracking the presence of ICE agents and downloaded a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said in the post. Patel said agents recovered a handwritten note reading, "Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'" Those details and other accumulated evidence indicate "a high degree of pre-attack planning" by Jahn, Patel said. Authorities said Jahn fired "indiscriminately" at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop on Wednesday. He was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound following the attack. The two wounded ICE detainees remained in critical condition on Thursday, an agency spokesperson told NBC News. No ICE agents were wounded in the attack. "I didn't think he was politically interested," Noah Jahn said of his brother. Joshua Jahn was registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, NBC reported. He has also been linked to addresses in Texas. All three detainees were shot while inside that van. There were five to seven others in the van who avoided the bullet spray, an ICE official told NBC. "The shooter was just shooting at random vehicles inside," Lyons said. "There were some brave men and women on the ground that went into those vans, were pulling those detainees out while they're under fire." Homeland Security Department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, said that because of the Dallas attack and other incidents, "DHS will immediately begin increasing security at ICE facilities across the country." Migrant check-in appointments at the Dallas ICE facility scheduled for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have all been postponed until Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi's MGX will be main investors in TikTok's U.S. business, sources told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday. Those three entities will control roughly 45% of TikTok USA, Faber reported. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday backing the proposed deal that will keep the social media app running in the U.S. ByteDance has faced an ultimatum under a federal law requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S. That law passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress who expressed national security concerns about the app and its potent content algorithm. Last week, Trump signed an executive order delaying the divestiture deadline until Dec. 16. Trump has been trying to keep the app afloat, repeatedly mentioning how important it was to his presidential victory in November. Billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass is a major ByteDance investor through Susquehanna, and he also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social, Trump's social media company. Backers of ByteDance, including General Atlantic, Susquehanna and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok USA, sources told Faber. The deal does not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a so-called golden share in TikTok's U.S. operations, CNBC reported Monday. Trump said Sunday that conservative media baron Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch could be involved in the TikTok deal as well as Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission on Thursday, resolving a case over its Prime subscription sign-up and cancellation practices that Business Insider exposed in an exclusive investigation. BI's 2022 report, based on internal Amazon documents, showed that the company had known since at least 2017 that its website design misled customers into joining Prime, the membership program that offers perks such as free delivery and video streaming. Despite years of complaints, Amazon took little meaningful action, and in some cases, abandoned proposed fixes after internal tests showed slower subscription growth, according to Business Insider's investigation. "On March 14, 2022, Business Insider published information leaked from current and former Amazon employees regarding the problems with Amazon's Prime checkout enrollment flow and the Iliad Flow," the FTC wrote in a previous filing. As part of Thursday's settlement, Amazon will pay a $1 billion penalty and refund consumers $1.5 billion, the FTC announced. The deal, reached three days after a Seattle jury was seated, bans Amazon and two executives from continuing the unlawful practices. It also requires Amazon to implement "meaningful changes" to its Prime enrollment and cancellation processes, ensuring transparent disclosures and streamlined procedures. "The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription," FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. An Amazon spokesperson told BI in an email that there was "no admission of guilt in this settlement by the company or any executives." "Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers. We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we'll deliver for Prime members in the coming years," the spokesperson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Citadel CEO Ken Griffin on Thursday knocked the Trump administration for making deals with large corporations to avoid the full extent of its tariff policies, describing such agreements as anti-American. "Is that our country, that we're going to favor the big and the connected?," Griffin told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from Miami. "When the state becomes involved in picking winners and losers, there's only one way this game ends: All of us lose," added Griffin, a billionaire and top Wall Street figure. Griffin's comments come as U.S. companies have raced to make agreements with the White House that allow them to avoid the steepest levies placed on imports from many foreign countries. Multiple well-known businesses including Apple and Nvidia have announced significant domestic investments in recent months, which have been viewed by some as ways to gain favor from the Trump administration. "The line outside the White House of every business arguing why they should be exempt from paying tariffs on what they import into their products is nauseating." The Wall Street bigwig said tariffs can be considered similar to a "national sales tax." Because the levies would make up a higher proportion of household income for lower earners, Griffin said there are "issues of equity and fairness" involved with Trump's tariff policy. He said those companies could find themselves disliked or having to make new deals when a new person takes the nation's highest office. "It's the government's engagement in picking winners and losers. And we should tread carefully on that water," Griffin said. "In fact, we should just stay out of it. "The core competency won't be that you can drive innovation," he added. "It's that you can drive the right favors from D.C." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft said Thursday that it has stopped providing certain services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. The company did not say which specific services it had stopped providing. "While our review is ongoing, we have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, wrote in an email to employees. "This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services." Microsoft's decision to stop providing those services follows pressure from employees who have protested Israel's use of the company's company's software as part of its invasion of Gaza. Over the last few weeks, Microsoft has fired five employees who participated in protests at company headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The move comes a week after a United Nations commission said that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians with its invasion of Gaza. Microsoft told Israeli defense officials that it had decided to disable cloud-based storage an artificial intelligence subscriptions the agency was using, Smith wrote. He said Microsoft does not look at customer data for the type of review it conducted, and he thanked the British newspaper for its reporting on the development. "As employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust," Smith wrote. On Thursday The Guardian reported that unnamed intelligence sources had said Unit 8200 was planning to migrate its supply of the phone calls to Amazon Web Services, the market-leading public cloud.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon will pay $2.5 billion to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that the company duped users into paying for Prime memberships, the regulatory agency announced Thursday. The lawsuit, filed by the FTC in June 2023 under the Biden administration, claimed that Amazon deceived tens of millions of customers into signing up for its Prime subscription program and sabotaged their attempts to cancel it. Three senior Amazon executives were at risk of being held individually liable if the jury sided with the FTC. Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty to the FTC and will refund $1.5 billion to an estimated 35 million customers impacted by "unwanted Prime enrollment or deferred cancellation," the agency said. Amazon admitted no wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, the FTC said. It also requires the company to make clear and conspicuous disclosures about the terms of the program during enrollment, and says Amazon must get consumers' express consent before charging them for a subscription. Amazon also has to provide an easy way for users to cancel their subscription, the agency said. As part of the settlement, Amazon and two of its executives, Prime boss Jamil Ghani and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in the company's health division who previously held a role in the Prime business, will be prohibited from unlawful conduct. "The Trump-Vance FTC is committed to fighting back when companies try to cheat ordinary Americans out of their hard-earned pay," Ferguson said in a statement. Amazon spokesperson Mark Blafkin said in a statement that the company and its executives "have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers." The agency in 2019 hit Facebook, now known as Meta, with a $5 billion fine for violating consumers' privacy. Still, the $2.5 billion fine is equivalent to roughly 0.1% of Amazon's market cap, which now sits at close to $2.4 trillion. Shares of Amazon were up slightly following the announcement. Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. Data has shown that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members. Amazon still faces a bigger legal case with the FTC. The FTC was joined by attorneys general from 17 states, in alleging Amazon used "monopoly power" to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition. Amazon won partial dismissal of the case last year, but is still slated to go to trial against the FTC in 2027.Earlier this month, the U.S. district judge overseeing Google's antitrust case ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Google lost the case against the government last year, but was spared of having to divest of any key assets. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Robert Kraft, who paid $172 million for the New England Patriots in 1994, has agreed to sell 8% of the NFL team to two groups in a deal that values the franchise at $9 billion, according to two sources who have first-hand knowledge of the deal but are not authorized to speak about it publicly. The buyers are Sixth Street Capital, at about 3%, and Dean Metropoulos with about 5%, according to a person with first-hand knowledge of the deal who is not authorized to speak about it. Metropoulos is listed by Forbes as having a net worth of $4.1 billion. Two other minority stake sales are slated to be voted on by the league's finance committee in October. First, a 10% sale of the New York Giants to Julia Koch, which would give the team a $10.3 billion valuation, according to an NFL owner. And Sports Business Journal reported about a vote on a 3.2% sale of the San Francisco 49ers to Fortress Investment Group Chairman Pete Briger Jr. at a $8.6 billion valuation. Several days ago, a 2.35% stake of the Chicago Bears changed hands at a valuation of $8.9 billion. The Patriots also own Gillette Stadium, which opened in 2002 and was renovated at a cost of $250 million in 2023. The Patriots have won six Super Bowls, all under Kraft's ownership, and are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most in football. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every living former chair of the Federal Reserve, as well as a slew of ex-Treasury secretaries and former White House economic advisors, urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to block President Donald Trump from firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook as her lawsuit challenging her removal proceeds. Signers of the brief included the former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen; former Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, Hank Paulson, Jack Lew, and Timothy Geithner; former White House Council of Economic Advisers chairs Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, Christina Romer, Cecilia Rouse, Jared Bernstein, and Jason Furman; and former Fed Governor Dan Tarullo. Members of the group had served under, and been appointed by, both Democratic and Republican presidents. The economists  Ken Rogoff, Phil Gramm, and John Cochrane also signed the brief, as did Phil Gramm, a Republican who previously served as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. The brief said that allowing Cook to be removed now "would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed's independence and jeopardizing the credibilityand efficacy of U.S. monetary policy." The filing comes as Cook's lawyers face a 4 p.m. ET Thursday deadline to respond to arguments by the Justice Department that Trump should be allowed to remove her from the seven-member Fed Board of Governors while the Supreme Court considers whether the president has legal cause to fire her. Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with applications she filed for two residential properties she owns. Cook sued Trump in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asking a judge to block her removal. That judge on Sept. 9 barred Trump from firing Cook as her suit plays out. A three-judge panel on the federal appeals court in D.C., in a split decision, later upheld that order. Trump then asked the Supreme Court to lift those rulings and allow him to remove Cook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starbucks on Thursday announced it would close many of its North American stores in addition to sweeping layoffs. The closures will target locations where Starbucks has found it is "unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect" or where it doesn't "see a path to financial performance," according to a statement published by the company. While the exact number of stores to be closed remains unclear, the closures will represent about 1% of those stores. Starbucks ended its 2024 fiscal year with 18,424 open stores in North America, including 7,281 licensed storefronts, which aren't affected by the announcement. It will end fiscal year 2025 — which ends on September 29 — with 18,300 open stores across the continent, per the company's announcement. Starbucks staff in affected stores will be notified of the changes this week, with efforts made to transfer employees in closing stores to open locations nearby, the company said. In a statement provided to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United, which represents 12,000 baristas across 45 states and Washington, DC, said the union would bargain with the company to ensure those affected are assigned to new stores in accordance with their preferences. The filing shows that roughly $150 million in expenses will be related to employee separation benefits, a further $400 million related to the disposal of store assets from closed locations, and about $450 million in costs related to early lease terminations at affected stores. The company said that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, it will continue to grow the number of coffeehouses it operates and refurbish more than 1,000 existing locations as it continues to invest in the business. In addition to the store closures, the company announced that about 900 non-retail employees will be laid off on Friday. "I believe these steps are necessary to build a better, stronger, and more resilient Starbucks that deepens its impact on the world and creates more opportunities for our partners, suppliers, and the communities we serve," CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement about the changes. Thursday's announcement is the second round of layoffs for Starbucks employees this year. Business Insider previously reported the company laid off 1,100 corporate staffers in February.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanks to President Donald Trump, Uncle Sam has a burgeoning portfolio. Once considered rare, Trump and his team have pushed the US to consider taking stakes in private companies. "You have stupid people say, 'That's a shame.' It's not a shame, that's called business." Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on August 25. At the time, Trump defended his decision to take a 9.9% stake in Intel, a once-dominant chipmaker, over criticism that such industrial policy isn't how the US typically operates. Most recently, the Trump administration has entered talks with Lithium Americas to take a small stake in the Canadian mining company. Under Trump's leadership, the US converted roughly $11 billion in Biden-era Chips Act grants into a 10% equity stake. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who helped lead the talks with the chipmaker, said it was a mistake to award grants without securing anything in return. "I mean, that is exactly Donald Trump's perspective, which is, Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money? What is in it for the American taxpayer?' And the answer Donald Trump has is we should get an equity stake for our money." The company has also cautioned in securities filings that the US stake could pose some risks, including potentially hurting international sales. In July, the Defense Department announced that it would become the largest shareholder in MP Materials after agreeing to buy $400 million worth of shares. Trump administration officials have said it is a national security risk for the US to continue to rely on China and other foreign nations for the key minerals needed for everything from iPhones to military jet engines. MP Materials CEO James Litinsky said that he views the deal as a "public-private partnership" that is different than the government's agreement with Intel. "Those are scenarios where you had commitments from a past administration, where the Trump administration has come in and said, wait a second, you had no-strings attached commitments to companies, we think we should get a piece of the action," Litinsky told CNBC. Shares in MP Materials have roughly doubled since the deal became public. Lithium Americas said it is in discussions with the Department of Energy and General Motors, its partner in a mining project in Thacker Pass, as first reported by Reuters. In exchange, the Trump administration wanted a "very, very small equity share" to "create more of a cash buffer for the project." Shares in Lithium Americas went up over 93% on September 24 after news of a potential stake became public. He specifically named Lockheed Martin as a potential example. "As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense," a spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consulting firms may be less outspoken than tech CEOs, but they're staring down the same staffing problem as Silicon Valley after President Donald Trump introduced a $100,000 H-1B application fee last Friday. The H-1B program temporarily allows employers to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized jobs. The Department of Labor reports that nearly 50% of H-1B applications are related to "professional, scientific, and technical services" — with professional services typically referring to the consulting and accounting work carried out by firms like Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and PwC. James Ransome, a partner and strategy consulting lead at Patrick Morgan — a firm focused on executive recruitment and industry analysis — said that Friday's executive order had raised concern over talent acquisition among consulting leaders. "For many firms, the H-1B route has been a steady pipeline for mid-level consultants with strong technical and analytical skills, roles that are difficult to fill at scale in the US domestic market. Leaders are concerned this change adds further friction at a time when competition for talent is already high," said Ransome. The number represents roughly 1% of its most recently reported US head count. At Accenture and EY, H-1B visa holders hired in the last three years — 5,862 and 5,298, respectively — represent almost 10% of each firm's last reported US headcounts of around 60,000. Deloitte, EY, and Accenture did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. But they would likely take a "dual approach" and shift their staffing models alongside any cost absorption, he said. Competition over tech talent has become a defining pressure point for consulting firms as they race to develop the strongest AI offering for clients, and the H-1B executive order will add to that pressure. Consulting firms competing for data scientists and other highly technical specialists will feel the competition increase, Tom Rodenhauser, a consulting analyst and the managing partner at Kennedy Intelligence, told Business Insider. "Consulting is mobile in the sense that individuals don't need to be based in the US to serve customers," said Rodenhauser. For years, top firms have used labor arbitrage to bolster their revenue streams, setting up nearshore and offshore centers in countries like India, Mexico, Argentina, and the Philippines. The reliance on foreign hubs has increased as technical capabilities within offshore centers have improved, and AI has reduced the demand for junior workers in US offices. In August, BI obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. Ransome said consultancies have already been reassessing the balance between onshore client-facing teams and offshore delivery hubs, and the potential changes around H-1B visas would accelerate those strategies. "Rather than simply paying more across the board, they'll use this moment to rethink leverage models: higher-value, client-facing work anchored onshore, with more delivery capability shifted offshore." Nearshore hubs, like those in Canada, would start looking more attractive. Toronto, given its proximity to New York and Chicago, would be particularly appealing, Ransome said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Netflix chairman Reed Hastings have been weighing in on President Donald Trump's new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas. The US issues roughly 85,000 new H-1B visas via a lottery system every year. The H-1B program is highly popular among US companies looking to hire foreign workers for in-demand roles such as tech and engineering. On Friday, Trump signed an executive order raising the H-1B visa application fee by $100,000. The sudden move has sparked concerns among Big Tech firms like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, whose workers are on H-1B visas. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee during an interview with CNBC on Monday. And we represent the American dream," Huang said in a joint interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The pair announced on Monday that Nvidia was making a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. "We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of aligning financial incentives seems good to me," Altman told CNBC during his joint interview with Jensen Huang on Monday. Netflix cofounder and chairman Reed Hastings praised Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, calling it a "great solution" compared to the existing lottery system. "It will mean H1-B is used just for very high-value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs," he wrote. "Shark Tank" star Kevin O'Leary said the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas would hurt American companies and limit their access to talent. And all of those companies took advantage of talent they couldn't find in the United States as they grew," O'Leary told Fox Business's "Varney & Co." on Monday. "I think what this does is hurt innovation long-term. I agree that it's going to push these really talented people into other countries," he added. O'Leary said that the US government should, in fact, be paying foreign graduates to stay and work in the US. We should give them a 100 grand to come here," he said. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood said Trump's new H-1B visa fee could be a part of his administration's negotiation strategy with India. In August, Trump raised US tariffs on Indian goods to 50% from 25%. He wrote in a Truth Social post on August 4 that this was because India was not only "buying massive amounts of Russian Oil" but also "selling it on the Open Market for big profits." More than 70% of all H-1B visa holders come from India. Longer term, I think President Trump and his team want to keep as much innovation, talent, and technology talent as possible in the US," Wood said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the executive order was a rule change that "caught everyone off guard." In an interview with CNBC this week, Dimon said he supports "merit-based immigration " and expects employers who rely on the program to object to the president's executive order. "He has accomplished border control, that's great, I mean, I think all nations want real border control, that helps make a nation, but after that, we should have good immigration," he said. It ranked first on a list of financial companies that use them. Royal Bank of Canada's CEO Dave McKay said the US President's move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas is a win for Canada. In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, McKay called the rule a "material opportunity" for Canada to attract more skilled tech workers. He said the country should capitalize on it to accelerate growth in its innovation sector. "So from India or from South Asia or from Europe, they'll say, 'Well, I can't get into the US, but I want to move to North America — I'll come to Canada,'" McKay said. The RBC chief added that the Canadian government could lower taxes to make it more attractive to launch and grow businesses. CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said that his company, like other tech firms, depends on talented individuals to help "build and drive" technology forward. "Anytime you add an additional fee to it, it does serve as sand in the gears," Intrator said in an appearance on CNBC on Monday. "It was yet another distraction for the management teams of America's leading companies, already whipsawed by various other presidential edicts." "The large tech companies hire foreign nationals because they possess particular skills," he added. Moritz said that the $100,000 fee will scatter jobs to other tech hubs like Istanbul, Warsaw, or Bengaluru, where engineers are as qualified as their American counterparts. "Like other Trump schemes, this H-1B caper will backfire," he wrote.</p>
