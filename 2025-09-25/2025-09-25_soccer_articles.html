                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uefa could decide as early as next week whether to suspend Israel from its competitions, with the governing body facing growing pressure from inside and outside the game. Reports on Thursday, initially in the Times, suggested a vote that would determine Israel's ­participation in World Cup qualifying and that of ­Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Europa League could be held by Uefa's ­executive committee before the ­international break begins on 6 October. There have been an ­increasing number of interventions away from the game. On Tuesday, a group of ­senior diplomats called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the ­publication of a report by the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry that found Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. Last week, the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York's Times Square to call for federations to boycott any matches with the country. It is understood that voices within the game have also been speaking up in private, including those from the club world. Italy is one of the countries under pressure to act. The Azzurri, along with Norway, are due to face Israel in the next round of ­qualifiers, with their match scheduled for 14 ­October in Udine. He also said he “denounced” the suffering in Gaza and that “there is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain”. Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote by the 19 members of Uefa's exco. Insiders suggest if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of ­passing with as few as three or four abstentions or votes against. “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national soccer team from the World Cup,” a spokesperson for the US Department of State told Sky News. Fifa, under its president, Gianni Infantino, has developed a strong relationship with the Trump ­administration. “I believe that Israelis should not be allowed to participate in any matches, whether they are Uefa- or Fifa-regulated,” he told TV2 in Norway. “Israel has violated principles, values and Fifa's statutes. Therefore, I believe that Israel should be sanctioned. In a statement reported by Radio ­Canada, Premier Tech said: “The current situation regarding the team name is no longer sustainable to achieve our goal.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States government says it will fight international calls for Israel to be banned from the 2026 World Cup, while Europe's governing soccer body is moving toward a vote to suspend Israel, the Associated Press reports. Israel's men's national team currently sits third in its UEFA World Cup qualifying table with the group winner securing a spot in next summer's World Cup and the runner-up advancing to qualification playoffs. The next round of qualifiers is coming up in October, with Israel slated to face group-leader Norway and second-place Italy on the road. Calls have intensified to ban Israeli teams banned from international competitions – the same way Russia was following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – in the weeks since a United Nations inquiry concluded that Israel has committed genocide in its war on Gaza since being attacked on Oct. 7, 2023. Spain's prime minister Pedro Sánchez expliticly expressed support for such a suspension, stating that "Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image." FIFA president Gianni Infantino has formed a close relationship with American President Donald Trump as the U.S. gets set to co-host the 2026 World Cup with Canada and Mexico. Israel is currently ramping up its assault on Gaza City. Israel has rejected all claims that it is committing genocide in Gaza. The Israeli football association told Reuters earlier in September that calls for the country to face consequences from soccer's governing bodies "feel like sickening anti-Semitism."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it will work to keep Israel from being banned from the 2026 men's World Cup. Israel is in the middle of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign and is third in its group of five as it bids to reach next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. It is unclear if U.S. officials have already pressured UEFA or FIFA to not ban Israel. The UN's statement on Tuesday called for the suspension of Israel from international competition due to what it described as an “unfolding genocide” in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies. UEFA competition matches have not taken place in Israel since the 2023 attacks, in which 1,100 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza following Israel's ground invasion, according to local health officials. The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed on Sunday that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood — a move with which President Trump said he disagreed. On Tuesday, four members of the United Nations human rights council — independent human rights experts who are not employed by the UN or any government  — called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer in response to the conflict in Gaza. The human rights experts released their statement following an investigation into alleged violations of humanitarian and human rights law during the Israel-Gaza war. Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC earlier this month that it rejected the report and described it as “distorted and false.” The report was published on Sept. 16 and the human rights experts released a statement on Tuesday, arguing that “sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.” “We are clear that the boycott must be addressed to the State of Israel and not to individual players,” they said. “We have always maintained that individuals cannot bear the consequences of the decisions their government makes, so there should be no discrimination or sanctions against individual players because of their origin or nationality. “National teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can and should be suspended, as has happened in the past (Russia is currently banned from global soccer due to the ongoing war in Ukraine). In April 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) asked FIFA to suspend Israel from competition in a submission made before FIFA's 74th annual congress. PFA president Jibril Rajoub spoke at the congress, calling on FIFA “to stand on the right side of history” and asking whether FIFA considers “some wars to be more important than others and some victims to be more significant.” An Israel Football Association (IFA) spokesperson had described the attempt to suspend the country as “nothing but a cynical and shameless move.” FIFA did not suspend Israel but opened two investigations into alleged breaches of its statutes by Israeli football teams and authorities. The PFA has accused FIFA of failing to provide “clarity or due process” with as yet no conclusion to the investigations. “Our issue, sadly again, is stuck in a highly politicized bureaucratic holding pattern,” said Susan Shalabi, vice president of the PFA. In September, an IFA spokesperson said he was surprised Israel had yet to be suspended from international football. In many aspects, this is a miracle,” Shlomi Barzel, head of the IFA's public relations department, told Israeli newspaper The Globes. “The miracle can be explained by action on our part and a lot of tolerance on the part of FIFA and UEFA, but historically countries have been suspended for much less than that.” Israel has been a member of the European confederation UEFA since 1994. They were later excluded from AFC competitions in 1974 following a vote after a number of teams refused to play against them. Domestic Israeli teams also participate in UEFA club competitions, with Maccabi Tel Aviv competing in the league phase of this season's Europa League. UEFA's 55 member associations are meeting today (Thursday) at a regular gathering, although the issue of Israel's participation is not on the agenda. UEFA's next meeting of its 20-strong executive committee, the organisation's main decision-making body, is scheduled for Dec. 3, but president Aleksander Ceferin could call one sooner than that. Slovenia, where Ceferin is from, issued sanctions against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Israel is due to play Norway and Italy away in World Cup qualifiers next month. Comparisons have been made between the situations of Russia and Israel, with former Manchester United player and France international Eric Cantona calling it “a double standard” for Israel to remain a part of international soccer, via The Telegraph. Russia's men's team had been due to play Poland in a World Cup play-off in March 2022, with the winner scheduled to face either Sweden or Czech Republic. All three teams had said they would refuse to play against a Russian side. Russian clubs were also suspended from European competition by UEFA. Should Israel be banned by FIFA and UEFA, this would prevent the national team from competing in competitions organised by the two governing bodies. Israel is in a qualification group alongside Norway, Italy, Estonia and Moldova, and has played five of eight qualifying matches. Israel sits third, level on points with Italy. Maccabi Tel Aviv is in the Europa League and is scheduled to play GNK Dinamo, Midtjylland, Aston Villa, Lyon, Stuttgart, Freiburg and Bologna during the league phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Maple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement released Thursday. FIFA says the three mascots all represent part of their respective country's culture. “Maple the Moose was born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture,” Thursday's release said. Zayu hails from southern Mexico's jungles and represents the nation's rich heritage. “Zayu embraces Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. More than an athlete, Zayu is a symbol of cultural celebration and connection, carrying the heart of Mexico with pride.” The three mascots are also footballers in their own right. Maple is the goalkeeper of the trio, Zayu is a striker known for their “exceptional ingenuity and agility”, with Clutch knitting it all together in midfield. The final is scheduled to be played a little over a month later, near New York City, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19. The schedule will consist of 104 matches, as the tournament has been expanded to include 48 national teams, up from 32.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We break down the USMNT's record by confederation to see which region gives them the most success…and trouble. The United States Men's National Team has had a complicated history at the World Cup. From appearing in the very first World Cup in 1930 to their 40 year drought to the modern era, they have had some ups and downs when playing in the world's biggest tournament. Whether you're in a so-called Group of Death or you're placed in a group that an opponent's fans consider to be “EASY,” the USMNT has had to claw and scrap in just about every World Cup they've been in. But, when you break down the USMNT's World Cup record by confederation, we get a further glimpse at which teams they may hit a bit above their batting average and where they fall flat. We take a look at the USMNT's record by confederation at the World Cup compared to how they've done all-time against teams from that region. UEFA - 3W-14L-7D, 16 group stage points (27% win rate) Starting with UEFA makes sense because at a World Cup, it's normally guaranteed that you have at least 1 team from Europe in your group. For the USMNT, it feels almost certain that they will be in a group that contains 2 teams from UEFA. The only times the USMNT were in a group that did not have 2 UEFA teams at a World Cup were 1930 - only Belgium was in their group - and 1934, which did not have a group stage and only had a bracket. In 1950, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2022, the United States was placed with 2 other UEFA teams. In 1990, the USMNT - returning to the World Cup for the first time in 40 years, was placed in a group with 3 UEFA teams. It's no wonder that they have played 24 of their 37 World Cup matches against European teams, and their record against Europe explains why there hasn't been a ton of World Cup success for the United States. Their 27% win rate far underperforms their all-time record against Europe (58W-100L-44D - 39.6% win rate) and that is what needs to improve quickly for the team to become a major force down the line. The USMNT doesn't play Oceania often. They're 2W-0L-2D (75% win rate) against New Zealand, the only current Oceania member that they've played in soccer. Of course, Australia was a part of Oceania until 2006, and they were 0W-1L-1D against them before they joined the Asian Football Confederation. The United States has never played an Oceania team at a World Cup. Of course, Concacaf is the home confederation for the USMNT where all-time they hold a 231W-97L-83D record (66.3% win rate). However, they've only faced a Concacaf opponent once in their World Cup history, and we all know which match that was: Dos A Cero in Jeonju. Their 50% win rate in the World Cup against Asian teams is just slightly off their all-time 57.9% win rate (21W-14L-9D). Like Asia, the United States have only seen 2 African teams in a World Cup: Ghana (2006 group stage, 2010 Round of 16, 2014 group stage) and Algeria (2010 group stage). Between 2006 and 2022, the USMNT only faced African or European teams at the World Cup in 13 straight matches, including 3 straight against African teams. Their 50% win rate and 6 group stage points earned against Ghana and Algeria is slightly off their 65% all-time win rate against African teams (12W-6L-2D). The USMNT have had their issues all-time against South American teams, with a 30W-59L-30D record (37.8% win rate) in their matches against CONMEBOL. The United States have a 40% win rate against South American teams in just 5 matches, beating Paraguay at the 1930 World Cup and famously beating Colombia at the 1994 World Cup. The United States will want to improve their record against South American teams, especially the traditional powers like Brazil and Argentina, but their win rate shows that they might have a decent shot when lining up against a team from South America in the World Cup. Overall, the United States Men's National Team will have to improve their World Cup record: 9W-20L-8D (35.1% win rate) with 40 goals scored and 66 conceded. To do that, they have to play better when the bright lights of the world stage shine upon them. As the co-hosts next summer, that spotlight will shine even brighter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A moose from our neighbors up north, Maple wears the No. 1 and is in charge of anchoring the net. From the name to his uniform color, Maple embodies some of the country's most recognizable emblems and is "born to roam, journeying across all of Canada's provinces and territories while connecting with people and embracing the country's rich culture." And although Les Rouges are better known for playmakers such as Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, it won't hurt to have Maple's antlers covering as much of the goal as possible. A jaguar who plays forward, donning the No. An elusive creature found in southern parts of the country, jaguars are a symbol to many of Mexico's ancient civilizations. Zayu is said to "embrace Mexican culture through dance, food and tradition, uniting people across borders with passion. And there's also no shortage of quality forwards for El Tri at the World Cup, including Javier "Chicharito" Hernández, Cuauhtémoc Blanco, and current striker Raúl Jiménez. You need a keen eye and some sharp instincts when wearing the No. 10 shirt, so it's no surprise to have a bald eagle representing the United States. Clutch is said to have "an unquenchable thirst for adventure, soaring across the United States and embracing every culture, game and moment with boundless curiosity and optimism." Christian Pulisic usually wears that number for the U.S. men's national team as a winger, so USMNT fans will hope he soars to new heights in 2026. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA pulled back the curtain on its three official mascots for the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged across Canada, Mexico and the United States. The Athletic's Adam Crafton shared the details on Clutch, Zayu, and Maple, which are intended to represent each host county. And Canada is symbolized through Maple the moose. The jaguar's connection to Mexico goes back centuries. "Ancient civilizations of Mexico, such as the Maya, bestowed huge significance upon the jaguar, linking it to the underworld and symbolizing strength and bravery," Crafton wrote. FIFA went even further by assigning positions to the three mascots. FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the mascots will add to the overall World Cup experience. "Maple, Zayu and Clutch are full of joy, energy and the spirit of togetherness, just like the FIFA World Cup itself," he said, per Crafton. "I can already picture them on children's shirts, high-fiving football legends and — in another first for this tournament — starring in video games played by millions worldwide." The World Cup is scheduled to kick off on June 11, 2026, and culminate in the final on July 19 at MetLife Stadium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it will work to keep Israel from being banned from the 2026 men's World Cup. Israel is in the middle of its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign and is third in its group of five as it bids to reach next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada. It is unclear if U.S. officials have already pressured UEFA or FIFA to not ban Israel. The UN's statement on Tuesday called for the suspension of Israel from international competition due to what it described as an “unfolding genocide” in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies. UEFA competition matches have not taken place in Israel since the 2023 attacks, in which 1,100 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza following Israel's ground invasion, according to local health officials. The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia confirmed on Sunday that they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood — a move with which President Trump said he disagreed. On Tuesday, four members of the United Nations human rights council — independent human rights experts who are not employed by the UN or any government  — called on FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer in response to the conflict in Gaza. The human rights experts released their statement following an investigation into alleged violations of humanitarian and human rights law during the Israel-Gaza war. Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC earlier this month that it rejected the report and described it as “distorted and false.” The report was published on Sept. 16 and the human rights experts released a statement on Tuesday, arguing that “sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalise injustices.” “We are clear that the boycott must be addressed to the State of Israel and not to individual players,” they said. “We have always maintained that individuals cannot bear the consequences of the decisions their government makes, so there should be no discrimination or sanctions against individual players because of their origin or nationality. “National teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can and should be suspended, as has happened in the past (Russia is currently banned from global soccer due to the ongoing war in Ukraine). In April 2024, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) asked FIFA to suspend Israel from competition in a submission made before FIFA's 74th annual congress. PFA president Jibril Rajoub spoke at the congress, calling on FIFA “to stand on the right side of history” and asking whether FIFA considers “some wars to be more important than others and some victims to be more significant.” An Israel Football Association (IFA) spokesperson had described the attempt to suspend the country as “nothing but a cynical and shameless move.” FIFA did not suspend Israel but opened two investigations into alleged breaches of its statutes by Israeli football teams and authorities. The PFA has accused FIFA of failing to provide “clarity or due process” with as yet no conclusion to the investigations. “Our issue, sadly again, is stuck in a highly politicized bureaucratic holding pattern,” said Susan Shalabi, vice president of the PFA. In September, an IFA spokesperson said he was surprised Israel had yet to be suspended from international football. “I'm surprised we're still part of international tournaments. In many aspects, this is a miracle,” Shlomi Barzel, head of the IFA's public relations department, told Israeli newspaper The Globes. “The miracle can be explained by action on our part and a lot of tolerance on the part of FIFA and UEFA, but historically countries have been suspended for much less than that.” Israel has been a member of the European confederation UEFA since 1994. They were later excluded from AFC competitions in 1974 following a vote after a number of teams refused to play against them. Domestic Israeli teams also participate in UEFA club competitions, with Maccabi Tel Aviv competing in the league phase of this season's Europa League. UEFA's 55 member associations are meeting today (Thursday) at a regular gathering, although the issue of Israel's participation is not on the agenda. UEFA's next meeting of its 20-strong executive committee, the organisation's main decision-making body, is scheduled for Dec. 3, but president Aleksander Ceferin could call one sooner than that. Slovenia, where Ceferin is from, issued sanctions against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Israel is due to play Norway and Italy away in World Cup qualifiers next month. Comparisons have been made between the situations of Russia and Israel, with former Manchester United player and France international Eric Cantona calling it “a double standard” for Israel to remain a part of international soccer, via The Telegraph. Russia's men's team had been due to play Poland in a World Cup play-off in March 2022, with the winner scheduled to face either Sweden or Czech Republic. All three teams had said they would refuse to play against a Russian side. Russian clubs were also suspended from European competition by UEFA. Should Israel be banned by FIFA and UEFA, this would prevent the national team from competing in competitions organised by the two governing bodies. Israel is in a qualification group alongside Norway, Italy, Estonia and Moldova, and has played five of eight qualifying matches. Israel sits third, level on points with Italy. Maccabi Tel Aviv is in the Europa League and is scheduled to play GNK Dinamo, Midtjylland, Aston Villa, Lyon, Stuttgart, Freiburg and Bologna during the league phase.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shaka Hislop and Steve Nicol praise Christian Pulisic after he became the top USMNT scorer in Europe's top five leagues. The European club season has been in full swing for over a month now, giving those U.S. men's national team players plying their trade overseas the chance to establish themselves. Some have gotten off to uneven starts, with the opening round of UEFA Champions League fixtures proving to be especially difficult. Others have hit the ground running. Then there's Christian Pulisic, who has been leading the U.S. charge in Europe for nine years now and already has five goals in all competitions this season. Fortunately for the USMNT, Pulisic is one of several players who have been hitting their stride in recent weeks. Throughout the season, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of the U.S. player pool, delivering insights into those whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing. ESPN will count down to June 11 every week so that way, when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. - Rae: Will Gladbach instability be a blessing or a curse for Reyna? - USMNT 2026 World Cup Big Board 2.0: Balogun, Zendejas rise - Carlisle: Zendejas' starring role has come at the right time for USMNT Tessmann had already enjoyed a solid start to the season, but last weekend he kicked his campaign into overdrive, scoring the lone goal in Lyon's 1-0 victory over Angers, a result that put the club in a tie atop the Ligue 1 table, behind AS Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain on goal differential. Not bad for a team that was threatened with relegation due to financial irregularities before the start of the season. As for Tessmann, the question remains: Will these performances be enough to get him back in the U.S. squad? He hasn't been called up since the Concacaf Nations League in March. To be clear, they should be, but the mind of U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino works in mysterious ways. At minimum, Tessmann should be in contention to provide cover for Tyler Adams, or even crack the starting lineup. Credit Tillman for showing a strong mentality, bouncing back from a dreadful match in midweek against F.C. København in the Champions League to deliver a man of the match performance against Borussia Mönchengladbach in which he scored his second league goal of the season. A tactical tweak from manager Kasper Hjulmand might have helped. Against Copenhagen, Tillman was operating as one of the dual No. 10s and struggled mightily to get on the ball. Against Gladbach, he was deployed deeper in midfield and had a much stronger impact on the game, even beyond his 70th-minute goal. Hjulmand afterward continued to preach patience, as Tillman is one of many new arrivals to the squad, but the player's ability to shake off a poor performance will serve him well for both club and country. This was an impressive week for Pulisic, even by his lofty standards. After scoring two goals and helping set the table for a third in last weekend's 3-0 win over Udinese, Pulisic maintained his fine form by scoring the final goal -- on the half-volley, no less -- in a 3-0 Coppa Italia win over Lecce. There's not much more to be said about Pulisic that hasn't been already. He remains the USMNT's most important attacking player, and he now holds the mark for most goals by an American in Europe's top five leagues with 59. As long as he can stay healthy, he's a lock to be in the U.S. lineup. He'll try to keep the momentum going in this weekend's momentous clash with top-of-the table Napoli. When Pochettino switched to a three-man back line during the September international window, it was a move that didn't appear to benefit Gladbach's Joe Scally. The wing back position favors the mobility and attacking instincts demonstrated by the likes of Sergiño Dest and Alex Freeman over the defending of Scally, but then Gladbach interim manager Eugen Polanski trotted out a 3-4-3 with Scally as the right wing back, and the American delivered an impressive performance. Scally showed an ability to get forward that was unexpected given that he recorded no goals and no assists this past season -- his xG of 0.26 is already on its way to eclipsing last year's 0.38. Granted, who knows what formation the permanent Gladbach coach will prefer once he's hired, but the performance should help keep Scally in the lineup. Given his performance last weekend, why isn't he in this week's in-form XI? It's a fair question, especially when you consider Dest conceded a penalty that was converted in PSV Eindhoven's 2-2 draw with Ajax. Combined with some defensively shaky moments during the September international window, it's worth weighing whether Dest is enough of a defensive liability that he loses his spot in the starting lineup. That said, Dest's value in attack is still high enough given his ability to deliver the unexpected, though Scally has given Pochettino something to think about in terms of who his starting wing backs should be. Meanwhile, the relative stock of the U.S. corps of forwards continues to go through some wild swings in form. Folarin Balogun looked to have gained some separation from the chasing pack after a great performance against Japan, but that was before his tepid effort in a 4-1 Champions League defeat to Club Brugge landed him on the bench for last week's league encounter against Metz. Even worse for Balogun, his replacement, Mika Biereth, scored the opener in a 5-2 win, while Ansu Fati scored two off the bench and George Ilenikhena also got on the score sheet. The silver lining for Balogun is that no other U.S. center forwards scored last weekend, although Ricardo Pepi's selfless run to the near post allowed Ismael Saibari to score PSV's first, so he'll remain the starter in this week's lineup. Also, Balogun's skill set is unique within the USMNT player pool, given his ability to make runs in behind the opposition defense, and this should mean his spot in the U.S. squad is still secure. He'll need to work his way back into the Monaco lineup, though, and this week's match at Lorient will reveal the extent to which his spot in the club hierarchy has fallen.

Robinson's recovery from offseason knee surgery took way longer than expected, but he finally played a full 90 minutes for the Cottagers in Tuesday's Carabao Cup victory over fourth-tier side Cambridge United. Now let's see if he can reclaim his spot in league play. Cardoso has been dealing with an ankle injury, hence his omission from the game-day roster in last weekend's 1-1 draw with Mallorca. Luca de la Torre, midfielder, San Diego FC: 2,299 minutes in 2025; 6.8 FotMob rating in 2025. Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Weah has been Marseille's Mr. Fixit, lining up as a right wing back in OM's 1-0 win over previously unbeaten PSG. Will that help him or hurt him when the next USMNT camp opens? Either way, his versatility remains impressive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PAOK fans displayed a banner reading 'Stop genocide' during their match against Maccabi Tel Aviv A United Nations commission of inquiry said earlier this month that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. That has led a panel of UN experts and the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to call for sporting sanctions against the country. Next year's World Cup is being co-hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada. Meanwhile, there have been reports that European football's governing body Uefa - which organises World Cup qualifying matches - could meet to decide whether to suspend Israel as early as next week. One senior source at a European member association told BBC Sport: "Our understanding is that Uefa leadership wants to see some action on this. Earlier this month Norwegian football federation president Lise Klaveness said her organisation "has to deal with Israel participating in their competitions, but cannot and will not be indifferent to the humanitarian suffering that is taking place in the region, especially the disproportionate attacks against civilians in Gaza". A panel of human rights experts at the UN subsequently called on world football governing body Fifa and its European body Uefa to suspend Israel's national team from international football,, external saying: "Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual." Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence. Its foreign ministry called the UN report "distorted and false". At least 65,419 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There has been an increase in calls to ban Israel from sporting competition since the UN's report. And it comes amid reports that Uefa could vote on whether to suspend Israel next week. Uefa has said that no meeting is currently planned. Israel are third in their World Cup qualifying group - organised by Uefa - on nine points, six behind leaders Norway. Spanish PM Sanchez said Israel should be treated in the same fashion as Russia by being banned from international sports competitions. Protesters knocked down barriers and occupied the road at several points on the course including Gran Via, where cyclists were due to pass multiple times. Earlier this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry sidestepped a question about sanctioning Israeli athletes, saying: "The sports movement has to showcase the good that is in humanity." Meanwhile, supporters of Greek side PAOK displayed Palestinian flags and banners during their side's Europa League match against Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv on Wednesday. Chants of "Free Palestine" were also heard after Maccabi supporters unfurled an Israeli flag. Demonstrators submitted more than 1,900 signatures to Uefa in support of a petition launched this week, which said there could be "no fair play with representatives of genocide".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Senior Pitch Management Manager, Alan Ferguson, this was an opportunity to test the newly developed shallow pitch profile system, which was deployed in varying levels in five stadiums for the Club World Cup, including MetLife Stadium, where Chelsea FC became the first winners of the new format. “The Club World Cup was hosted in twelve stadiums across America, with 63 matches, and each host city had its own challenges. “Everything from stadiums to weather really got us thinking, and we have certainly plenty to think about in the coming weeks, and if I'm honest, it's pretty much where I thought we would be.” From what I've seen across this tournament, I am confident we will fully align for the World Cup in ten months' time.” A significant amount of time, effort and money was invested in the research programme run by Tennessee and Michigan State Universities, which developed the shallow pitch profile system, and this was their first real-world tournament test. “The Club World Cup has given us invaluable insight into what we need to be ready for next year,” says Alan. “As the Club World Cup approached, the team installed nine pitches in nine cities in 10 days, which was no mean feat. Not only did we pull this off, but we also shallow stitched the pitch in situ using five machines in two days, which is another first. “There were some challenges that were unique to this tournament due to turnaround times and the needs of stadium owners that we won't face at the World Cup, but even those are valuable experiences that we can anticipate now. There were also issues with the weather that prompted us to think, but we can now try to prepare better for that.” “Most importantly, we've changed perceptions of overlay pitches in the US, showing our system can host several games across a tournament. This modular system proved to be a success, generating ideal surface hardness and traction. Standard stitching in a restricted profile was not an option. FIFA has already implemented this finding in its other tournaments, with two pitches in Chile for the Men's U20 World Cup, scheduled for September 2025, benefiting from the new technology. Anyone who works in delivering international football tournaments will know this tends to be the most difficult area. “Tournament training sites usually comprise a diverse range of venues,” Alan begins. “We had everything from professional MLS training grounds to state-run high school and university pitches.” “My preference is to pick up as many professional facilities as possible, because by working with the professional venues, we have a much higher starting point, often being able to save significant sums of money along the way.” “I have no issue transforming a local training pitch into an international training pitch and leaving a strong legacy for football after the tournament. But such exercises are often underestimated by local organisers. Not only does the uplift in a local pitch require quite a bit of work, but it also requires the staff to upscale training.” With new technologies, a better understanding of venue challenges, and a clear focus on legacy, the FIFA Pitch Team is more than ready for the world's biggest football event.”</p>
