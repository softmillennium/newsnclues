New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli opens up about his campaign on 'Hannity.' New Jersey gubernatorial hopeful Rep. Mikie Sherrill was blocked from walking with her graduating class at the US Naval Academy after being caught up in a massive cheating scandal, a bombshell report revealed. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., during an interview in New York May 2, 2025. Sherrill, who is also a former federal prosecutor, announced her candidacy last year for New Jersey governor, citing her leadership experience as a U.S. Navy helicopter commander and federal prosecutor. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., during a news conference about a Signal messaging chat used by Trump administration officials at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., March 25, 2025. The congresswoman said she was barred from walking because she declined to rat out classmates who were involved in the scandal that impacted 130 midshipmen in her class. "I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor," Sherrill (D-NJ) told the outlet. She declined to authorize the release of sealed disciplinary records about her time at the academy that would've revealed the details of why she was not allowed to walk at graduation. News of the scandal comes hours after a shocking poll showed her dead even with Republican Jack Ciattarelli after months of polling pegged her as the clear front-runner.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the ramifications of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Capitol Hill hearing about his MAHA agenda on ‘America's Newsroom.' A congresswoman from Michigan announced Thursday that she will introduce articles of impeachment against Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing the "health care chaos" and rising costs during his tenure. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., has repeatedly called for Kennedy's removal, most recently citing funding cuts for cancer research, infant death syndrome and combating addiction, as well as increased health care costs. Kennedy's restriction of vaccine access is another issue, as well as him spreading of "absurd conspiracies" that have put people's lives in danger, Stevens said. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., speaks at a National Breast Cancer Coalition rally outside the U.S. Capitol May 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Getty Images) "RFK Jr. is making our country less safe and making health care less affordable and accessible for Michiganders," Stevens said in a statement. "His contempt for science, the constant spreading of conspiracy theories, and his complete disregard for the thousands of research hours spent by America's top doctors and experts are unprecedented, reckless, and dangerous. "Enough is enough — we need leaders who put science over chaos, facts over lies, and people over politics, which is why I am announcing today that I have begun drafting articles of impeachment against Secretary Kennedy." In a statement to Fox News Digital, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said Kennedy "remains focused on the work of improving Americans' health and lowering costs, not on partisan political stunts." U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing a call for impeachment over his handling of the health agency. Stevens also accused Kennedy of lying during his confirmation hearings about the promises he made that had not come to fruition. Chief among them is Kennedy's promise not to break up the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) vaccine panel of independent experts. Stevens is one of several Democrats calling for Kennedy to step down. The secretary most recently faced scrutiny over his firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.

Panelists Joshua Ritter and George Terwilliger assess the mounting evidence against Tyler Robinson, the man charged with killing Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, on ‘The Ingraham Angle.' EXCLUSIVE: OREM, Utah — Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University earlier this month, "made contact" with a police officer near where investigators recovered the alleged murder weapon wrapped in a towel in the woods at the edge of campus, according to two law enforcement sources. It happened around 6:30 p.m. on Sept. 10, roughly six hours after a sniper's bullet struck Kirk in the neck as he was engaging the audience during a speaking event sponsored by the UVU chapter of his organization in Orem, Utah. Tyler Robinson appears virtually in Utah court on Sept. 16, 2025, to face charges in the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Prosecutors released excerpts from a text message conversation they say Robinson had with his roommate and romantic partner, Lance Twiggs, that occurred at an unspecified time on the evening of Sept. 10, in which Robinson allegedly discussed wanting to retrieve a rifle before returning home from Orem, which is about a four-hour drive from where he lived in Washington County. While law enforcement searched the area, Robinson texted Twiggs, telling him to "look under my keyboard," according to court documents. The roommate found and photographed a note there that read, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it." Authorities say Twiggs has cooperated with investigators. Investigators search a taped-off area in Orem, Utah, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. In another message, Robinson allegedly wrote he was "stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. "You weren't the one who did it right????" Authorities search a taped-off area in Orem, Utah, Sept. 11, 2025. "No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing," came another alleged reply from Robinson. "I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. A gray Dodge Challenger parked in the driveway of Tyler Robinson's family home in Washington, Utah, Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. Robinson reportedly drove a gray Dodge Challenger to UVU on the day he allegedly assassinated Charlie Kirk. Later in the conversation, he allegedly reiterated that he was looking for a chance to grab the rifle: "There is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't wanna chance it." I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpas (sic) rifle." Charlie Kirk throws hats to the crowd after arriving at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, 2025, in Orem, Utah. Robinson eventually surrendered to authorities in his hometown in southern Utah 33 hours after the slaying, after his parents and a family friend convinced him to turn himself in rather than take his own life, according to authorities.

FBI agents investigate the crime scene near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025, in Dallas. Edwin Cardona, left, who had an appointment at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, stands with his wife Arianny Sierra and their sons, after a shooting at the facility, in Dallas on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. DALLAS (AP) — The gunman who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas, killing a detainee and critically wounding two others, left behind a note saying that he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” the FBI director said Thursday. The assailant, who authorities said fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop, was involved in a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said, and agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from a Dallas-area home. “One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof? '” Patel wrote, quoting an apparent abbreviation for armor-piercing bullets. The gunman had also downloaded a document titled “Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management” containing a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said. Hours before the shooting, the assailant conducted multiple internet searches for ballistics information and video of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus this month, Patel said. Joshua Jahn, 29, was identified as the shooter by a law enforcement official who could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by the DHS on X. It happened two weeks after Kirk was killed by a shooter on the roof of a building at Utah Valley University and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted a backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities. The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety and respect.” “Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement. FBI agents investigate the crime scene near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025, in Dallas. The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them,” Cardona said, adding that they were later reunited. The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels. Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a home in suburban Fairview, outside Dallas, that public records link to Jahn. The street was blocked by a police vehicle, and officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard. A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018. In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state. “He's a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told the AP. Edwin Cardona, left, who had an appointment at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, stands with his wife Arianny Sierra and their sons, after a shooting at the facility, in Dallas on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence. FBI agents investigate the crime scene near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025, in Dallas. Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents. On July 4, attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack. Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a responding police officer before authorities shot and killed him. In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. Dozens of immigration field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody. Security varies by location, with some in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.</p>

A manhunt is underway in Oregon as authorities search for an accused murderer who was accidentally released this week due to a clerical error. Ty Anthony Sage, 26, was reportedly set free from the Multnomah County Detention Center in Portland after posting bail on Monday, according to FOX 12. However, a Sept. 17 release form shows Sage's bail was set for $5,000 and he was permitted to bail out – a direct violation of the judge's order. Ty Sage, a murder suspect in connection with the 2021 death of a 15-year-old boy in Oregon. Sage was arrested in connection to a 2021 robbery and shooting that killed 15-year-old Lowgunn Ivey and injured two others. "It's been an emotional rollercoaster for the last four years," mother Jodie Ramsey told the outlet. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, located in Portland, Oregon, is searching for alleged murderer Ty Sage. "We are committed to conducting a review of the incident to have a full understanding of what occurred. Sage's release appears to be an "isolated incident," according to Sheriff Nicole Morissey O'Donnell, who added that "this mistake should not have happened." "I recognize that the system has failed, and it's failed Lowgunn's family and our community. We hold the ultimate responsibility for a person's release. But we are committed to doing everything we can to restore community trust and confidence in our organization," Sheriff O'Donnell said, according to FOX 12. Ty Sage was arrested earlier this year in connection with the alleged murder of 15-year-old Lowgunn Ivey. Ramsey blasted the mistake made by authorities and expressed her frustration surrounding her son's alleged killer's release. "It's a major mess up, it's a monumental mistake that should have never occurred," Ramsey said. Ramsey added that Sage's release has left her and her family in fear as authorities work to locate the alleged killer. "Very fearful, very fearful, it's going to be a constant fear for me until he is back in custody, because he is [out of] custody doing God knows what," Ramsey said. However, as Sage remains on the loose, Ramsey reportedly said she has lost any sense of hope that her son will receive justice after his death. "I don't have any hope," Ramsey said. "I mean, once they finally caught him and they had him in custody, I had all the hope in the world. Now that he is no longer in custody, I have 100% doubts."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is holding talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House on Thursday and signaling that the United States might soon lift its hold on sales of advanced fighter jets to Ankara. During Trump's first term, the U.S. removed Turkey, a NATO ally, from its flagship F-35 fighter jet program after Turkey purchased an air defense system from Russia. Trump started his Oval Office meeting with Erdogan by offering hope that a resolution to the matter could be found during the leaders' talks. It was Erdogan's first trip to the White House since 2019. They forged what Trump has described as a “very good relationship” during his first White House term. Trump in remarks before reporters focused his concerns on Turkey's continued economic relationship with Russia. Turkey has been one of the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuel since the European Union announced in early 2023 it would boycott most Russian seaborne oil. Since January 2023, Ankara has purchased more than $90 billion in Russian oil, coal and natural gas. Only China and India have bought more from Russia in that period. “The best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia,” Trump said of Erdogan. The push on Erdogan to become more engaged in pressuring Putin comes after Trump earlier this week said he believed Ukraine could win back all territory lost to Russia in the war. Erdogan has made clear he is eager to see the hold on F-35s lifted, telling Trump that he came prepared to “thoroughly discuss” the issue. The Turkish president was even blunter in a television interview this week. “I don't think it's very becoming of strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go,” Erdogan said in an interview this week on Fox News Channel's “Special Report with Bret Baier.” Democratic President Joe Biden's administration kept Erdogan, who has served as president since 2014 and was prime minister for more than a decade before that, at an arm's length during Biden's four years in office. The reluctance to engage deeply was borne out of Turkey's record of democratic backsliding as well as Ankara's close ties to Moscow. Opposition parties and human rights organizations have accused Erdogan of undermining democracy and curbing freedom of expression during his more than two decades in power. International observers say that baseless investigations and prosecutions of human rights activists, journalists, opposition politicians and others remain a persistent problem in Turkey. Trump sees Erdogan as a critical partner and credible intermediary in his effort to find ends to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The Republican's administration is also largely in sync with Turkey's approach to Syria as both nations piece together their posture toward the once isolated country after the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in December. Trump and European leaders have followed Erdogan in embracing Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once commanded a rebel group that was designated a foreign terrorist organization. “I think President Erdogan is the one responsible for Syria, for the successful fight in ridding Syria of its past leader,” Trump said. “He doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement.” He believes Turkey can play an essential role for European security and is able to span geopolitical divisions over Ukraine and Syria as well as U.S. tariffs, which have sparked a global trade war. Turkey also believes it has emerged as a credible broker in the Black Sea region, preserving relations with both Ukraine and Russia. But the fall of Assad aggravated tense relations between Turkey and Israel. Trump has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be “reasonable” in his dealings with Ankara. Erdogan has been critical of Israel's handling of the war, which was launched after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and takin about 250 people captive. More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, and about 90% of homes in the territory have been destroyed or damaged. Erdogan, in his U.N. address, alleged that Israeli forces have committed genocide, an allegation contested by Israel and United States.</p>

Body cam footage of Gazan boy, Abboud, 8, emerges alive after former GHF contractor Anthony Aguilar falsely claimed Israeli forces killed him outside a GHF site on May 28. A young Gazan boy dubbed "Amir," who traveled to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution site and was reported as having been killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in May, has been found alive hiding out with his mother. Both were safely extracted from the Gaza Strip earlier this month, though the location has not been disclosed for their security. The boy, whose full name was later discovered to be Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, nicknamed Abboud, and who is 8 years old but will turn 9 in October, appeared with his mother, Najlaa, at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 late last month in a heavy disguise to avoid detection, a GHF representative involved in the operation confirmed to Fox News Digital. An extensive internal operation by the GHF was launched to uncover the identity of the boy in late July after a former GHF employee, Anthony Aguilar, a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Army and retired Green Beret Lt. Col. turned alleged "whistleblower," gave a series of explosive interviews in which he said a 10-year-old boy he called Amir had been killed by IDF forces after leaving a GHF aid site on May 28. Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, has been discovered with his mother in the Gaza Strip following a GHF investigation that concluded when they appeared as Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 in the Gaza Strip on Aug. 23, 2025. In his account, Aguilar showed images taken using his cellphone of the boy approaching himself and another contractor clutching bags of food and barefoot. The former Green Beret turned GHF contractor for UG Solutions — a subcontractor of the GHF which received $30 million in U.S. government funding to support its "critical work" — described to multiple outlets an emotional encounter he had had with the Palestinian child, in which he claimed the boy had kissed his hand, touched Aguilar's face, and thanked him for the supplies of rice and lentils he had found. But the footage taken by Aguilar and handed over to GHF officials before it was obtained by Fox News Digital, did not show this interaction ever took place. Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden and his mother appeared at the GHF SDS 3 ending a weeks-long search for him on Aug. 23, 2025. When asked by Fox News Digital why he said the boy engaged with him in this manner despite what the footage shows, he maintained his story and said, "Amir kissed my right hand. However, Fox News Digital was told that the GHF did not yet have access to non-lethal arms in the early days of the operations, according to a GHF colleague who was aware of Aguilar's position at SDS 3 on May 28. Additionally, Aguilar claimed that once the Palestinian civilians had been pushed out of the SDS center, IDF forces then opened fire on the crowd and killed "Amir," along with other Palestinians. He reiterated this claim in an interview late last month in which he had told Dialogue Works that the boy had received a "shot to the torso, a shot to the leg — dead." In one of his first accounts of the incident on July 29 to Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Aguilar claimed the killing happened first outside GHF aid site SDS 1 before telling MSNBC on Aug. 2 that the shooting happened near SDS 2, and then telling Dialogue Works last month the events had occurred outside SDS 3. On Sept. 9, Chris Hayes gave an update on the report, telling viewers that the boy who was reported dead was, in fact, found to be alive. He said NBC producers had confirmed that the boy was now out of Gaza in an unnamed country. Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, has been discovered with his mother in the Gaza Strip following a GHF investigation that concluded when they appeared as Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. In comments to Fox News Digital, Aguilar said, "I sincerely, and with bated breath and joy, hope that Amir is alive. "I have always said that due to GHF and IDF restrictions from UG S[olutions] personnel moving beyond the concentration camp style corals extending from the North entrance, that I was NOT, say again, NOT able to verify Amir's death," he said. "But I did in fact see Palestinians gunned down by IDF machine gun fire at the intersection of the SDS 3 exit and the military corridor, north of SDS 3, where an IDF Merkava tank was located." Abboud's stepmother also later told the GHF that the boy hadn't gone missing until July 28, two months after Aguilar said he had been killed. Abboud ran away to be with his birth mother on July 28 amid a rift with his stepmother's family, whose custody he was put in following the death of his father, per Palestinian law. A GHF representative involved in the operation explained the search to find Abboud became not only a matter necessary to uncover what allegedly happened on May 28, but because there was increasing concern regarding threats posed by Hamas as traction picked up around the story. The official explained that Hamas had a vested interest in making sure this child was not found, as it would discredit Aguilar's story that a Palestinian boy had been gunned down by Israeli forces outside a GHF site. Ultimately, the GHF were able to locate the boy and his birth mother by speaking with local Palestinians and later, a family member who agreed to speak with the team before connecting them with Najlaa. She then brought Abboud to the GHF site so that she, her son and four other male family members whose identities Fox News Digital has agreed to conceal, could be extracted from the Gaza Strip, after at least one of the male family members received direct threats from the Hamas terrorist network. The identities of Abboud, his mother and his relatives were verified by GHF using facial recognition software that compared the images of the boy with those captured by Aguilar. Facial recognition software, biometric data and the death certificate of Abboud's father were used by GHF to verify the family members' identities and relationships, and were also shared with Fox News Digital. Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, arrived with the T-shirt he was wearing on May 28, 2025, in the footage taken by Anthony Aguilar at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. Aguilar did not respond to Fox News Digital regarding the intact shirt, and said, "The new pictures are not Amir." When pressed on where specifically he thought there were discrepancies in the images of the boy, he said, "Amir in my photos had a scar on his left clavicle. The boy featured by GHF does not. "I believe that is a boy of similar appearance," Aguilar said, noting he believes the outcome of the investigation "is a lie." Aguilar told Fox News Digital that the GHF statements made against him during a July 29 press conference were "libel and slanderous." Fay described him as a "disgruntled former employee" who was "terminated for cause" after he engaged in "volatile conflicts with staff and erratic behavior." According to text messages shared with Fox News Digital, Aguilar also did not handle being removed from his role well, and threatened in a text exchange with a GHF official that he "could be your best friend, or your worst nightmare" if they didn't "put [him] back to work." David Panzer, counsel for UG Solutions, echoed this belief in a statement he gave on July 29 in which he said, "Mr. Aguilar was terminated from his contract with UG Solutions on June 13, 2025, due to poor performance, volatile conflicts with staff, and erratic behavior. "Since termination, Mr. Aguilar has spread a false narrative to media outlets around the world, all at the same time begging UG Solutions to hire him back," Panzer added. "Mr. Aguilar's activities in the last several weeks make clear that he's making good on his threats to, in his own words…be UG Solutions's ‘worst nightmare' if they didn't hire him back." Panzer said Aguilar's comments "raise[d] substantial questions of motive." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three people, including detainees, have been shot at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas and the shooter is dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, federal authorities said. The director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says three people have been shot at a Dallas ICE facility and the shooter is dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police block off the street close to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office after a reported shooting, in Dallas on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. A gunman fired upon a Dallas immigration field office from a nearby roof Wednesday morning, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Authorities said the shooter was involved in a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” and investigators found ammunition with anti-ICE messaging at the scene. After the shooting in Dallas, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide. Police block off the street close to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office after a reported shooting, in Dallas on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. All three were detainees, but officials have not released any additional information about their identities. DHS initially said two victims were dead, but hours later it issued a correction saying one was killed and two were critically wounded. No law enforcement officers were injured, authorities said. Edwin Cardona, left, who had an appointment at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office, stands with his wife Arianny Sierra and their sons, after a shooting at the facility, in Dallas on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. Authorities say the gunman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but they have not released his identity. A law enforcement official identified the suspect as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. FBI agents could be seen Wednesday afternoon at a house in suburban Dallas that public records link to Jahn. Jahn slept in his car during that time, he added. “He was lost, and I didn't expect him to be crazy,” Sanderson told AP. “Didn't really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age.” “I don't remember him being that abnormal, he didn't seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble, he kept his head down and stayed working,” Sanderson said. The gunman in the Dallas shooting used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The FBI on Wednesday said ammunition found at the scene had anti-ICE messaging, and FBI Director Kash Patel released a photo on social media showing a bullet with the words “ANTI-ICE” written on it. On Thursday, Patel announced that FBI agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from the shooter's home. “One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof? Patel also said the shooter researched DHS facilities, Kirk's killing and “searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.” At a news conference Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz said, “This is the third shooting in Texas directed at ICE or CBP. But Democrats accused Cruz and others of selectively releasing information and trying to “control the narrative” to fit Republican arguments that ICE agents are under siege. Immediately after the initial news conference in which authorities refused to say whether detainees were among the victims, Democratic U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey called in to Dallas' WFAA-TV newscast and said he was “absolutely sickened” by officials' comments. “If they are trying to control this narrative and they don't want migrants to be the victim in this story, then they may want to slow-walk giving us any information about this so they can still keep on talking about attacks on ICE,” Veasey said. The shooting occurred at the local field office in Dallas, where agents conduct short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by ICE. ICE facilities have varying security levels, with some heavily secured and others more exposed. John Torres, a former acting director of the agency, says facilities like the one in Dallas have vulnerabilities, including exposed loading areas for detainee buses. The Dallas facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers. Attackers dressed in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack. On July 7, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents as they were leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, which abuts Mexico. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks in his car.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Barack Obama on Wednesday said the Trump administration engaged in “violence against the truth” with its announcements this week linking autism and Tylenol. “We have the spectacle of my successor in the Oval Office making broad claims around certain drugs and autism that have been continuously disproved,” Obama said during remarks at London's O2 Arena, according to a transcript provided to CNN by the former president's office. “The degree to which that undermines public health, the degree to which that can do harm to women who are pregnant, the degree to which that creates anxiety for parents who do have children who are autistic, which by the way itself is subject to a spectrum, and a lot of what is being trumpeted as these massive increases actually have to do with a broadening of the criteria across that spectrum, so that people can actually get services and help,” Obama added. At a White House press conference Monday, President Donald Trump announced that the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” drawing immediate pushback from doctors in the US and abroad. Trump promoted a range of unproven theories about autism, Tylenol and vaccines, going beyond his administration's plans to highlight a cautious new warning on Tylenol, $50 million investment in further autism research and approval of a potential treatment. How Trump blew up his administration's carefully laid autism announcement plans Obama said Wednesday that “it is important for those who believe in the truth and believe in science, to also examine truth when it is inconvenient for us.” Obama also said the country is being “tested” by threats against free speech and the rule of law but called it a “clarifying moment” of what Americans should stand for. “It's fair to say that what I see repeatedly in my own country in the loss of leadership in promoting values like democracy and rule of law and free speech, and economic fairness, the fact that not only do we not promote them, but we actively oppose those values now, in many cases, it's fair to say I find appalling. It's much harder when the people next to you seem just terrible and are promoting ideas that feel like they're inciting violence towards you.” And earlier this month, Obama commented on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, calling it a “horrific tragedy” and saying that “the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resort to violence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Republican Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's top public schools official who lauded President Donald Trump, pledged to put a Turning Point USA chapter in every high school to honor Charlie Kirk and end what he called “wokeness” in public schools, is resigning to lead a conservative educators' group. Walters, 40, said Wednesday night on Fox News that he is stepping down as state superintendent of public instruction to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a nonprofit that says it assists educators “in their mission to develop free, moral, and upright American citizens.” “We're going to destroy the teachers unions,” Walters said on Fox. He has also tried to require social studies teachers to promote conspiracies about the 2020 election, track the immigration status of children in schools and require applicants for teacher jobs coming from California and New York to pass an exam designed to safeguard what he described as “radical leftist ideology.” Many of his efforts have led to lawsuits against him and the agency, even as Oklahoma's national ranking in several education metrics has continued to decline. Just Tuesday, Walters announced that Oklahoma high schools will have Turning Point USA chapters. He said parents, teachers and students “want their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values.” Kirk founded the organization to mobilize young, Christian conservatives. It has seen a massive surge in interest and support since the activist's assassination on Sept. 10. Walters, a former teacher, was elected to the superintendent's job. He had served as Oklahoma Secretary of Education from September 2020 to April 2023. He was appointed to that position by Gov. Ever since then, “we have witnessed a stream of never-ending scandal and political drama,” Oklahoma Attorney General Genter Drummond said in a statement. “It's time for a State Superintendent of Public Instruction who will actually focus on quality instruction in our public schools,” Drummond, a Republican and candidate for governor in 2026, said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This satellite photo from Planet Labs PBC shows a scorched launch pad at Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport in Semnan province, Iran, on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has likely carried out an undeclared missile test at its Imam Khomeini Spaceport, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed Thursday, underlining Tehran's effort to maintain its weapons program despite the 12-day war with Israel in June. Iran has not formally acknowledged last week's test at a circular pad that has hosted other major launches by the country's civilian space program. A single lawmaker in Iran's parliament, however, claimed, without offering evidence, that Tehran tested a possible intercontinental ballistic missile. The test and the claim raise concerns that Iran may be trying to expand the reach of its missiles as tensions remain high ahead of United Nations sanctions, which are likely to be reimposed this weekend over Tehran's nuclear program — as it also repairs missile sites that were struck by the Israelis. “Israel's successes in the 12-day war against Iran's missile attacks reinforced for Tehran the importance of developing more ballistic missiles and qualitatively better versions of them,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. On Sept. 18, Iranian social media users posted images of the sky over Semnan province, showing what appeared to be a rocket's contrail at sunset. Iranian officials did not acknowledge what caused the contrail, nor did Iranian state media report on the incident. Satellite photos taken prior to that by Planet Labs PBC show the circular pad at Imam Khomeini Spaceport — about 230 kilometers (145 miles) southeast of Iran's capital, Tehran, in Semnan — painted blue ringed with red, white and green lines — the colors of the Iranian flag. But in satellite images since Sept. 18, the pad appeared discolored, though it wasn't fully clear until a more-detailed Planet image requested by the AP taken this Wednesday. That image shows significant scorch marks, the pattern of which resembled scorching seen at the pad following past launches. When rockets launch, the flames from their engines pour down onto pads. Fabian Hinz, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who studies missiles, said the scale of the scorching suggested Iran launched a solid-fuel missile, as burning aluminum oxide particles cause such marks.

He portrayed it as a sign of Iran's strength as it faces challenges from Israel and the West. “We have neither abandoned (nuclear) enrichment, nor handed uranium over to the enemy, nor backed down from our missile positions,” said Zanganeh, a member of parliament's budget committee from Iran's Khorasan Razavi province. “The night before last we tested one of the country's most advanced missiles, which until now had not, so to speak, been trialed — and that test was successful,” he said. “I mean to say that even under these conditions we are conducting a security test of an intercontinental-range missile.” Zanganeh did not elaborate on where he got his information, nor did he provide any evidence to support his assertion. Iranian parliament members have made exaggerated claims in the past. Intercontinental ballistic missiles typically have ranges greater than 5,500 kilometers (3,415 miles). That would extend far beyond the range reportedly allowed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which is 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). An intercontinental missile would at least put all of Europe in rage. The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees its Mideast operations, did not respond to a request for comment. However, the fact that it uses solid fuel and is capable of reaching space has raised concerns by the U.S. government that Iran could potentially build an intercontinental ballistic missile. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess that Iran is not actively pursuing an atomic bomb, though it had been enriching uranium to up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran may also have used the launch to signal to the West that it will continue its missile program, despite sanctions and pressure — though without a formal confirmation, it remains unclear just what Tehran was trying to do. “The problem is that so much happens with Iran,” Hinz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli authorities have arrested an American-Israeli dual citizen on suspicion of spying for Iran, accusing him of sharing information on public figures and sending videos and pictures of locations across the country to his handlers. Police and the Shin Bet said in a joint statement Perl requested asylum for himself and his family but received no response. In 2023, he began engaging with Iranian news outlets on social media and publishing content critical of Israel and Zionism. In January, Perl wrote an article that authorities say supported Hezbollah following Israel's killing of the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. After the article's publication, he was approached by Iranian operatives, with whom authorities say he agreed to cooperate. When Perl was unable to recruit people in Israel to work with him, authorities say he traveled to Israel himself in July and began gathering intelligence at the direction of his Iranian handlers. “He provided the Iranians with information on Israeli public figures and citizens, including former IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir,” police and the Shin Bet said. “As part of his activities, Perl also took photos and videos of various streets and locations throughout Israel. He was paid in cryptocurrency for his work.” The statement said that Perl's actions were “all based on ideological motives and opposition to Zionism.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Commerce Department said Wednesday that it had opened new national security investigations into the import of personal protective equipment, medical items, robotics and industrial machinery. The “Section 232” investigations, which were opened on September 2 but not publicly disclosed previously, could be used as a basis for even higher tariffs on a wide swath of medical and industrial goods including imported face masks, syringes and infusion pumps, as well as for robotics and industrial machinery like programmable computer-controlled mechanical systems and industrial stamping and pressing machines. The probe asks companies to detail projected demand for robotics and industrial machinery and the extent to which “domestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand,” as well as the role of foreign supply chains in meeting US demand. The US Commerce Department is particularly interested in the role of major exporters like China in meeting US medical needs and the “impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices.” Trump's tariffs are bigger than his tax cuts for most Americans The probe also covers pacemakers, insulin pumps, coronary stents, heart valves, hearing aids, prosthetics, blood glucose monitors, orthopedic appliances, computed tomography scanners and magnetic resonance imaging machines. The robotics probe includes machine tools for cutting, welding and handling workpieces, autoclaves and industrial ovens. The department has opened numerous probes into the national security ramifications of imports of wind turbines, airplanes, semiconductors, heavy trucks, polysilicon, copper, timber and lumber and critical minerals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump on Tuesday responded to Jimmy Kimmel's return to airwaves by alleging that the late-night host “is yet another arm of the DNC” representing “a major illegal Campaign Contribution.” Let's see how we do,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. Trump has leaned heavily on the courts during his second term to challenge media outlets, but as of Wednesday night, the president's legal team has not brought a new lawsuit against ABC, for predictable reasons, according to experts. Brett Kappel, a campaign finance attorney with Harmon, Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg, told Forbes that Kimmel's on-air comments are “clearly covered” as protected speech by the Federal Election Commission's media exemption and do not amount to campaign contributions, as Trump claimed. Election law scholar Ned Foley similarly wrote in a Wednesday blog post that Trump's threat is “incredibly alarming” on First Amendment and election law grounds. “There is no credible claim, despite Trump's insinuation, that ABC is ‘owned or controlled by' the Democratic National Committee, just as there would be no credible claim that The New York Times or any other liberal-leaning media outlet is.” White House officials directed inquiries about a possible new lawsuit against ABC back to the president's Tuesday statement on Truth Social. “People do not lightly disregard public officers' thinly veiled threats to institute criminal proceedings against them if they do not come around,” Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote at the time. Trump does have a long history of suing media companies, including a handful of successful lawsuits filed on the 2024 campaign trail and since entering office in January. In December of last year, as referenced in Trump's Tuesday night statement responding to Kimmel's return, ABC settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos for $15 million. Paramount settled a lawsuit with the president's legal team in July for $16 million regarding an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired ahead of the 2024 general election. Earlier in September, a federal judge threw out Trump's $15 billion defamation suit against the New York Times, although the decision did give Trump's legal team a month to refile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest in a string of physical attacks against federal immigration officers this year occurred on Wednesday at an ICE field office in Dallas, where a gunman whose rounds espoused an “anti-ICE” sentiment opened fire and killed one detainee while critically wounding two others. The attack came two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a university in Utah. Vice President JD Vance spoke about the incident in Concord, North Carolina, and said evidence not yet made public confirmed that the shooter was “politically motivated to go after people who are enforcing our border.” “You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell.” @VP SLAMS Democrats for their constant demonization of ICE agents: In Dallas, Texas, an ICE facility was opened fire upon by a violent left-wing extremist… We know this person was politically motivated. "It is time to STOP the rhetorical assault on law enforcement." “For months, we've been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed,” Noem said in a statement. “This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also blamed Democrats' “demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe.” Democrats must stop demonizing the heroic men and women of ICE who are just doing their jobs to keep Americans safe. Back in May, a city council member in Worcester, Massachusetts, helped to incite a mob into attacking ICE officers and local police as they attempted to make an arrest. A Massachusetts police union called on Etel Haxhiaj to face federal charges for organizing the violence. Many incidents of sitting Democratic members of Congress comparing ICE to Nazis and the Gestapo have been made on social media and in public settings since the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown commenced in January. Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (R-NJ), attempted to break past the fence into an ICE facility in New Jersey earlier this spring. McIver was arrested on charges of assaulting a federal officer while attempting to enter. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) signed five bills into law meant to curtail ICE from carrying out as many arrests throughout the state on the basis that Trump's immigration raids were “lawless.” On Wednesday afternoon, Jeffries joined House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (D-TX) to issue a statement that called the Dallas shooting “horrifying” and went on to thank police who responded. “The political and ideologically-motivated violence in America has reached a breaking point this year. Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin also followed suit and thanked police “who ran toward danger” before adding that the violence was not one-sided. “Democrats remain committed to resolving differences through debate and elections, not with weapons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Violet Affleck, the 19-year-old daughter of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, took the stage at the United Nations this week, calling for urgent action on clean air, pandemic protections, and broader social justice issues. “I represent a generation that in many ways already knows how we've been failed,” she said. This summer alone has seen youth uprisings in Nepal, Angola, and Indonesia, to say nothing of ongoing youth mobilization worldwide for a free Palestine. She added: “We know what that means for our lives in no small part, thanks to the people in this room. It is airborne floating and lingering in the air. “Every subsequent infection increases the risk of long COVID and places people who already have it in greater danger.” She described her fears for children facing a lifetime of post-viral illness. “I am terrified for the children who do not, or soon will not, know a world without debilitating pain and exhaustion,” she said. It is neglect of the highest order to look children in the eyes and say, ‘we knew how to protect you and we didn't do it. “We can create clean air infrastructure that is so ubiquitous and so obviously necessary, tomorrow's children don't even know why we need it.” Why are they just letting rich nepo babies get up there and rant with masks on?” influencer Link Lauren asked. “What the hell did those two do to their daughter,” Newsmax host Rob Schmitt said on X. She has been wearing a mask for 5 YEARS,” another user claimed. “Can celebrities have normal children?” one commenter asked. “Why is an Affleck child speaking at the UN? ?” Jennifer Sey, former Levi's executive and gymnast, asked on X. “Hey @BenAffleck, come get your kid,” another person posted. This is not Violet Affleck's first time making headlines with her activism. In 2024, she testified before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, demanding expanded access to masks, ventilation improvements in government buildings, and opposition to mask bans. Her mother, actress Jennifer Garner, has also waded into politics and activism. She campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race and supported Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Garner has also publicly celebrated Pride Month, wrapping rainbow-colored decorations around her yard trees, and was photographed in June 2024 drumming alongside activists wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh. Affleck's younger sibling, Fin, formerly known as Seraphina, publicly used the memorial service of Garner's father to share their new name and identity for the first time in April 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Office of Management and Budget memo obtained by Punchbowl News on Wednesday detailed the administration's personnel plans for a shutdown, which go beyond the standard furloughs. The OMB says programs “that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown.” The memo largely blames Democrats for any possible shutdown. Both parties have been at a standoff concerning how to fund the government. President Donald Trump recently refused a meeting with Democratic leaders, citing their alleged “unserious and ridiculous demands.” “Unfortunately, congressional Democrats are signaling that they intend to break this bipartisan trend and shut down the government in the coming days over a series of insane demands, including $1 trillion in new spending,” the memo says. The President supports enactment of a clean CR to ensure no discretionary spending lapse after September 30, 2025, and OMB hopes the Democrats will agree,” the memo concludes.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries ripped OMB Director Russell Vought over the plans, calling him a “malignant political hack,” while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said of the plans, “This is an attempt at intimidation. “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today,” Schumer added. An anonymous OMB official told Politico that programs like Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and air traffic control will continue regardless of the shutdown.TRUMP TO TARGET ‘RADICAL-LEFT' GROUPS FUNDING VIOLENCE THAT LED TO CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH Trump issued a statement Wednesday calling for the government to remain open and telling Democrats that the ball “is in your court,” to which Schumer and Jeffries both responded on X, “We're realistic about what the country needs so we're ready.</p>
