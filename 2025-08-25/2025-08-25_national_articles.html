                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, an activity that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled is legitimate political expression protected by the U.S. Constitution. The order the Republican president signed in the Oval Office acknowledged the court's 5-4 ruling in a case from Texas in 1989, but said there is still room to prosecute flag burning if it “is likely to incite imminent lawless action” or amounts to “fighting words.” “You get one year in jail, and it goes on your record, and you will see flag burning stopping immediately.” Today's Supreme Court is much more conservative than the makeup of the court in 1989 and includes three judges Trump appointed in his first term. Civil liberties advocates and constitutional scholars questioned both the legality and the merit of Trump's action. A lawyer working for a free speech group said Trump does not have the power to rewrite the First Amendment. “While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity — even if many Americans, including the president, find it ‘uniquely offensive and provocative,'” added Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. Trump said burning the U.S. flag “incites riots at levels we've never seen before,” with some people “going crazy” over the act of setting it afire and others expressing anger at people for burning it. An American flag is burned during a march for Jayland Walker, July 6, 2022, in New York. A White House fact sheet referenced recent protests, including in Los Angeles in June, where the flag was burned “alongside violent acts and other conduct threatening public safety.” “All over the country they're burning flags. All over the world, they burn the American flag,” Trump said, as Vice President JD Vance, Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other administration officials stood behind him as he sat at his desk. Hans, a law professor at Cornell University who focuses on the First Amendment, said the country has not suffered from an “endemic of flag burning.” “I don't think this is something that has been a big problem,” Hans said in an interview. It is a statement of contempt, hostility, and violence against our Nation — the clearest possible expression of opposition to the political union that preserves our rights, liberty, and security. Burning this representation of America may incite violence and riot.” Foreign nationals could face having their visas, residency permits, naturalization proceedings and other immigration benefits revoked, according to the order. Flag-burning has been on Trump's mind for years. After he was elected president in November 2016, Trump said “there must be consequences” for anyone who burns an American flag, such as jail or loss of citizenship. “Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag — if they do, there must be consequences — perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!” Trump wrote on what then was Twitter. Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this report.</p>

A college student's parents died and his siblings injured in a highway crash in North Carolina during a trip to drop him off at school. Noah Nunney, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was waiting on campus to reunite with his family when he received word of a serious car accident nearby. "When I arrived to the scene, I thought all four were gone," Nunney told PEOPLE. The accident occurred on Friday, Aug. 15, around 1:18 p.m., as Nunney's family members left their hotel to meet him for lunch. Community members are mourning the loss of two Ohio teachers who were killed in a crash while dropping their son off at college in North Carolina. Police said their vehicle "struck several small trees, traveled down an embankment and collided with a large tree." Nunney, who told the outlet he was tracking his sister's phone, noticed their location hadn't changed and rushed to the scene with a friend. Authorities said Maria Nunney, 50, who was in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at the scene. Donald Nunney, 55, was flown to a hospital and later died, reportedly from a heart attack that triggered the crash, his son told PEOPLE. Ohio teachers David Nunney and Maria Galindo Nunney died during a trip to drop their son off at college in North Carolina. After learning that both his parents had died, Nunney told PEOPLE he realized that he "had to focus on what was important in this situation," which was doing anything he could to make sure his siblings were going to be OK. "Since then, that's been my main priority," he said. Nunney's 9-year-old brother sustained multiple broken bones and was placed on a ventilator, but is now off the ventilator and "talking nonstop," he said. "Seeing them improve has really helped me improve mentally with the whole situation," Nunney said, adding she had not yet been told about their parents' deaths. A spokesperson for the North Carolina State Highway Patrol told Fox News Digital that the crash remains under investigation and further details about what caused the fatal collision were not available. Nunney said that his family had planned a special day on campus before returning home to Ohio. His sister, a fan of the show, "The Summer I Turned Pretty," had been looking forward to visiting filming locations with her brother. Donald and Maria Nunney, longtime teachers in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, were killed in a car crash while dropping their son off at school in North Carolina. Nunney's parents were beloved, longtime teachers in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. Within hours of the crash, members of the Morehead-Cain scholarship program, UNC staff and relatives had gathered to offer help. A GoFundMe campaign to assist the family has raised over $350,000. The organizers praised Maria and Donald as "amazing and devoted parents," emphasizing their strong commitment both to their family and their roles as educators. "Maria and Donald leave behind a legacy of community, family, and love, all rooted in the devotion they had for their children and their family," a post on the fundraising page read. "I know that's what my parents would've wanted," he said. Reflecting on their final moments together, Nunney shared what it meant to have his parents drop him off last year for his freshman year of college. "It was the first time they saw me as an adult," he recalled. "They saw me, truthfully, as more of a man than just their kid, and I felt like that was something that will always stick with me."

NEW YORK (AP) — There are some tennis players, such as Frances Tiafoe or Madison Keys or Ben Shelton, who can't wait for the U.S. Open to come around each year, with its boisterous crowds, its bold-faced names in the stands, its music at changeovers, its buzz. “I operate well in chaos,” said Tiafoe, twice a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows. Sometimes, it all can get out of control, as happened during a match that ended early Monday. There was a delay of more than five minutes while spectators booed and shouted — egged on by 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev, who was angered by chair umpire Greg Allensworth's ruling after a photographer interrupted play by going on court, of all things. “They didn't want to stop,” Medvedev said about the fans. Daniil Medvedev, of Russia, bottom right, reacts next to chair umpire, Greg Allensworth, left, after a photographer ran onto the court during a match against Benjamin Bonzi, of France, in the first-round of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Sunday, Aug. 24, 2025, in New York. Not everyone is able to shrug off that sort of mayhem at a Grand Slam tournament famous — some would say infamous — for the over-served fans, airplanes roaring overhead, the Manhattan-Queens commute and the odors of everything from marijuana to food being grilled. “It's something you really can't train the brain to kind of deal with,” 1991-92 champion Monica Seles said. There also are those, such as 2024 champion Aryna Sabalenka or 2014 champion Marin Cilic or Petra Kvitova, who didn't start out with an affinity for the anarchy — “Really confusing,” was Sabalenka's initial impression — but grew to be OK with it. Tennis fans show support for Alexandra Eala, of the Philippines, against Clara Tauson, of Denmark, during the first round of the US Open tennis championships, Sunday, Aug. 24, 2025, in New York. And there are even some whose opinion shifted the other way, from embracing to despising. There's always a lot of noise. I've visited most of the places in New York; I don't need to go to Central Park for the 1,003rd time,” said Adrian Mannarino, 37, a Frenchman who began his 15th U.S. Open on Sunday by upsetting 29th-seeded Tallon Griekspoor. “It used to be fun,” Mannarino said about the tournament, “but sometimes I'm like, ‘Gosh, I wish I could concentrate a little bit more. Spectators wait for gates to open at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for the first round of the US Open tennis championships, Sunday, Aug. 24, 2025, in New York. The hushes that envelope Wimbledon's Centre Court or the French Open's Court Philippe-Chatrier — which hold nearly 10,000 fewer spectators than 23,859-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium — are harder to come by in New York. People are definitely more quiet and respectful, I guess you could say,” said Emma Navarro, an American who reached the semifinals at Flushing Meadows last year. Open, it feels a bit more casual. There is a constant hum at Ashe and other arenas. That's just fine with Shelton, whose first of two major semifinals came at the 2023 U.S. Open. For the retired Agnieszka Radwanksa, the runner-up at Wimbledon in 2012, nothing ever came as easily at the U.S. Open, where she went 0-5 in fourth-round matches. “Everything takes so much energy from you and just sucks it up. “I respect the players that don't see the difference and don't feel that and can play like nothing is happening.” Casper Ruud, of Norway, returns a shot during the mixed doubles final at the U.S. Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2025, in New York. Elisabetta Cocciaretto, the Italian who stunned 2024 U.S. Open finalist Jessica Pegula in Wimbledon's first round last month, never felt at ease until she stopped staying at an official tournament hotel and switched to a more off-the-beaten-path spot. “I like to separate myself a bit,” Cocciaretto said. “Because otherwise, you're amid the madness. And if there's too much of that, your head explodes.” While he's come to enjoy New York, particularly the restaurants, there's one thing that bothers him about the city: “I'm not a big fan of the smell of weed when you walk around.

Zohran Mamdani, New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, told reporters on Monday how he would fight against the Trump administration in New York City. Boston and Los Angeles are providing a "model for how to fight" President Donald Trump's sweeping second-term agenda in New York City, Zohran Mamdani claimed on Monday. It's not to call him," Mamdani told reporters in Brooklyn in an apparent jab at his competitor, former Gov. When asked how the Democratic mayoral nominee would respond if Trump moved to eliminate cashless bail in New York City, as he did in Washington, D.C., on Monday morning, Mamdani vowed to fight. "The Trump administration is one that we can see a model for how to fight it across this country. We can also see it internationally with President Sheinbaum of Mexico," Mamdani said. New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani closed out his "Five Boroughs Against Trump" tour across New York City in Queens on Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has rejected Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration since he won back the presidency last year. Specifically, she reaffirmed and strengthened The Trust Act, an ordinance that limits local cooperation with federal immigration authorities, in Dec. 2024 ahead of Trump's second term. When Attorney General Pam Bondi sent her and fellow blue-city leaders a letter threatening federal action over Boston's sanctuary city policies, Wu was quick to defend her home city. "Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Wu was one of several "sanctuary city" mayors who defended Boston's local immigration laws before the House Oversight Committee earlier this year. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu speaks during a campaign rally in support of the statewide Massachusetts Democratic ticket, Nov. 2, 2022, in Boston. "I think you have to use every single tool available to you, and I think we saw in California how effective it can be to use the tools of the law, even though the Trump administration thinks itself above the law," Mamdani said on Monday. Earlier this year, protests rejecting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Trump-led deportation rollout delved into riots in Los Angeles. Gavin Newsom, widely considered a 2028 presidential hopeful, sued Trump for his so-called "unlawful" deployment of the National Guard without Newsom's consent. Newsom and Trump have since been duking out the constitutional legality of such a move, and the California governor has been seizing any opportunity to troll the president. Gavin Newsom attends a press conference, July 2, 2025, in Burbank, California. As Trump continues to push border security, fulfilling his leading campaign promise, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected the Trump administration's attempt to send U.S. troops into Mexico. "It is through belief in the convictions that you hold in the very fabric of the city you represent, that you are able to fight back against an administration that is seemingly hellbent on tearing apart the city," Mamdani said on Monday. The self-described Democratic socialist has joined national Democrats in criticizing Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which Mamdani claimed "will throw millions of New Yorkers off their health insurance, cut SNAP benefits for the hungry, and will make it even more difficult to afford to live in the most expensive city in the United States of America." While Republicans argue the bill only cuts waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, according to the Congressional Budget Office, about 10 million more people will be uninsured by 2034 due to Trump's megabill.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday tasking his secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, with establishing “specialized units” in the National Guard that will be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues” — the clearest sign yet he intends to expand the US military's role in domestic law enforcement activities across the country. Under the newly signed order, Hegseth is charged with “ensuring that each State's Army National Guard and Air National Guard are resourced, trained, organized, and available to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order whenever the circumstances necessitate, as appropriate under law.” A primary mission of the National Guard is already to be trained and available to assist law enforcement with public safety, often at the request of their state's governor. It also orders Hegseth to “designate an appropriate number of each State's trained National Guard members to be reasonably available for rapid mobilization for such purposes” and establish a standing “quick reaction reaction force that shall be “available for rapid nationwide deployment.” Questions remain, however, about how the order will work in practice. The National Guard already has reaction forces, designed to rapidly respond to incidents requiring law enforcement or security support in each state, territory, and the District of Columbia. These forces primarily perform their mission under the command and control of governors, and Trump's executive order on Monday does not specify what authority the units outside of DC would report to if a state's governor does not wish to use them. “It seems very performative,” Rachel VanLandingham, a former Air Force judge advocate and current law professor at Southwestern Law School, told CNN on Monday. This move follows a directive by Hegseth last week that authorized members of the National Guard deployed in Washington, DC, to begin carrying weapons. National Guard members deployed to DC started carrying sidearms Sunday, a spokesperson for the Joint Task Force carrying out the mission told CNN. A release from Joint Task Force – DC on Sunday said Hegseth directed guard members to carry their assigned weapons. A US official told CNN on Monday that some troops will carry M4 rifles, as that is their primary weapon, whereas military police, for example, primarily use a M17 handgun. A Joint Task Force spokesperson said the troops are authorized to use their firearms for “personal protection” only, meaning self defense— and “not for policing.” Hegseth's order marked a notable shift in guidance from the Pentagon, which had previously indicated that National Guard members could be armed if the circumstances warranted. “The problem is, it's not nice when you go in and do it and somebody else is standing there saying, as we give great results, say, ‘Well, we don't want the military.' Trump could send National Guard troops into a state against the governor's wishes, reminiscent of what occurred in Los Angeles this summer, when troops were federalized. But that critical distinction of who the troops report to impacts what guard members can or cannot do while they are mobilized. Federalized troops, like those who mobilized in LA, cannot perform law enforcement activities, as it would be a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. Troops on Title 32 orders, like those mobilized inside DC, are not subject to Posse Comitatus and therefore able to assist in law enforcement. “It sets an example of normalizing this when nothing is normal about it, and DC is not representative of other states. … It would just be a whole new world for them to try a Washington, DC-type maneuver in Chicago or anywhere else that's not Washington, DC, because Washington, DC, is so legally different than any other area.” “It comes as no surprise Donald Trump is once again attacking Chicago, but that doesn't change that Trump's continuing pattern of politicizing and misusing our nation's military for his own partisan gain and to crush dissent is deeply disturbing, is un-American and has no place in any of our cities,” Duckworth, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services, said in a statement ahead of Monday's executive order signing. Logistically, Monday's executive order also leaves questions unanswered as to how the “specialized units” would train or whether there would be coordination between those units across the states. “Are you saying each state is going to have its own quick reaction force that can handle everything? Are you looking at an amalgamation of units that come together under a Pentagon official, commander? If so, then you need to have a schoolhouse where they're getting together and training on this, and what are the regulations on it? … This is classically how military missions fail, when you don't have clear guidance and you haven't been training together,” VanLandingham said. A US official told CNN on Monday that the guard is working through what equipment will be needed and what sites they'll assist with, but tasks are expected to include things like painting over graffiti, picking up trash, and removing driftwood from the Tidal Basin by the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial. For weeks, Trump has ramped up efforts to crack down on crime in Washington, DC, which has also included a federal takeover of the city's police department and increased federal law enforcement presence. To assist the DC National Guard, troops from the National Guards in West Virginia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Ohio, Louisiana and Tennessee were called upon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump welcomed Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, to the White House on Monday afternoon for talks on trade and defense. Hours ahead of the visit, Trump posted on social media that a “Purge or Revolution” was taking place in South Korea and threatened not to do business with Seoul. It was not immediately clear what Trump was referring to, but South Korea had been in a state of political turmoil for the last several months after its former leader, the conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, was ousted from office after imposing martial law last December. Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot on North Korean soil in June 2019 during an unannounced trip to the DMZ. President Donald Trump listens during a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Washington. “I would like to see if we could get rid of the lease, and get ownership of the land where we have a massive military base,” Trump said. “I don't know that they'll meet, Trump said. Trump last week following his hosting of European leaders and Zelenskyy for talks, as well as speaking by phone with Putin, said that he was arranging direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy that might be followed by three-way talks in which he'd take part. But Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made it clear Friday that Putin won't meet with Zelenskyy until the Ukrainians agree to some of Moscow's longstanding demands to end the conflict. He highlighted to use of flying drones, which have been widely deployed for reconnaissance and weaponry. “I would like to ask for your role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula,” President Lee told Trump. Kim added of a possible upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, “I believe that he will be waiting for you.” Lee Jae Myung complimented Trump's decorative touches in the Oval Office, to which Trump has added numerous gold accents around the room. He also said, “I think America is becoming great again.” House Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer wrote that the Republican-led committee will probe “disturbing allegations that DC crime data is inaccurate and intentionally manipulated” in a letter to Metropolitan Police Chief Pam Smith. Comer cited local reports that a police commander for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department was put on administrative leave after allegedly altering some crime statistics. Mayor Muriel Bowser has confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into the incident. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., speaks to reporters as he arrives for a deposition with former Attorney General Bill Barr, on Capitol Hill Monday, Aug 18, 2025, in Washington. More than 2300 National Guard troops have been deployed to the city along with a surge in federal law enforcement agents from the FBI, ICE, DEA and other agencies. The Justice Department launched its own investigation into DC's crime statistics. Trump and Republicans have cast doubt on those statistics and scrutinized some local policing policies they allege reduced the reports of criminal acts. The endowment is “updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the Administration Consequently, we are cancelling existing funding opportunities that fall outside these new priorities,” reads an email sent to novelist Marie Myung-Ok Lee, echoing language received by numerous authors who posted emails from the federal agency. The fellowships were established in 2001 and have been awarded to hundreds of authors, including such prize winners as Jhumpa Lahiri, Andrew Sean Greer and Terrance Hayes. The NEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Like other federal cultural organizations, the NEA has faced cuts in funding and pressure from the Trump administration to emphasize more patriotic themes. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung waves as he is greeted by President Donald Trump upon arriving at the White House, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Washington. They are now headed for their meeting at the Oval Office. But Trump said on Monday, “we haven't even discussed the specifics” of just how the U.S. would be involved in assisting a European-led effort. Just before wrapping up his comments in the Oval Office, Trump said the administration would soon be reducing drug prices anywhere from 1,000% to 1,500%. He noted that many other countries pay far less for prescription drugs than people do in the U.S. Trump made a similar promise earlier in August. Drug prices obviously cannot be reduced more than 100%, but experts have told the Associated Press that while the Trump administration has taken steps to lower prescription drug prices, there's no indication costs have dropped such a massive drop. “I find it really difficult to translate those numbers into some actual estimates that patients would see at the pharmacy counter,” said Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University who studies the U.S. pharmaceutical market. She added that Trump's math is “really hard to follow.” FILE - U.S. President Donald Trump, right, meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Sentosa Island, in Singapore, June 12, 2018. “I have very good relationships with Kim Jong Un and North Korea,” Trump told reporters. No it's good,” Trump added, recalling meeting with North Korea's leader during his first term. “In fact, some day, I'll see him,” Trump said of a possible second-term meeting with Kim. Israeli officials say of the 50 hostages still held by Hamas, only about 20 remain alive. In long comments to reporters, Trump mixed up the name of Michigan Gov. He was trying to describe an April meeting where Whitmer and the president discussed sparing an Air Force Base in Michigan from being closed. But the president appeared to be mixing up Whitmer's name with that of Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey. In other comments Monday, Trump suggested Biden “didn't know he was alive” and “didn't know what he was doing.” Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been detained by immigration authorities in Baltimore and faces possible efforts by the Trump administration to deport him to Uganda. Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett signaled the same Monday, telling CNBC that Friday's deal that some conservatives have labeled “socialism” was part of broader strategy of setting up a sovereign wealth fund that would invest in an array of companies. “I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries,” the National Economic Council director said. Asked about an overnight Israeli strikes on a hospital in southern Gaza that killed five journalists, including a freelancer who worked for The Associated Press, Trump said initially he wasn't aware the incident before offering: “I'm not happy about it. “And I think he's very bad for votes,” Trump said. He also criticized “liberal courts” for protecting Abrego Garcia, but added, “We have that under control.” Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking in the Oval Office at Trump's side, said of Abrego Garcia, “He will no longer terrorize our country.” Trump and members of his administration have made unsubstantiated exaggerations in order to justify bringing the military into Democratic run cities such as Washington and Los Angeles. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff on Washington: “You have people who can walk freely at night without having to worry about being robbed or mugged, or wearing their watches again. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller speaks as President Donald Trump holds an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Washington. More than 180 current and former employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency published a letter Monday warning that debilitating cuts to the agency charged with handling federal disaster response risks a catastrophe like the one seen after Hurricane Katrina. Addressed to the FEMA Review Council and Congress, the letter contains six “statements of opposition” to current policies at FEMA, including a burdensome expenditure approval policy implemented by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem which the signatories say reduces FEMA's ability to perform its missions. About 140 staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency were placed on administrative leave last month for signing a similar statement. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth listens as President Donald Trump holds an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Washington. “It's just common sense to make sure they're armed,” Hegseth said. He added that troops are therefore, “Capable of defending themselves and others.” Some National Guard units patrolling the nation's capital have started carrying firearms at Trump's direction — a major escalation of his military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by Hegseth. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin is calling on his party to “fight like hell” as he welcomes Democrats from across the nation to the DNC's summer meeting in Minneapolis. In his welcome address Monday morning, Martin charged that President Trump is dismantling democracy and peoples' lives. Martin is focusing his ire on the Republican president, but he's also confronting internal divisions in the DNC's first meeting since he became party chair. His critics believe the party isn't doing enough to push back against Trump. Vice President JD Vance listens as President Donald Trump holds an executive order signing in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Washington. He said Trump's Washington crackdown meant people who would have been killed are now “living, breathing” and going on with their lives in the nation's capital. Standing with the President from left are, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Trump said those who burn the United States flag would be charged with inciting a riot and receive one year in jail with no opportunity for early release. Trump said burning an American flag “incites riots at levels we've never seen before.” He's been complaining about former President Joe Biden's use of an autopen to sign executive orders and pardons, suggesting without evidence that presidential power was hijacked under his predecessor. After saying last week that he'd ask Congress for “about $2 billion” in funding to improve Washington, the president declared, “Congress said they'll give us whatever money is needed to fix up the capital.” “This is another ‘men in women's sports' things,” he said. “Politically, I hope they don't, but actually, in terms of love for the country, I hope they do, because it would be good to work together.” He repeated threats to send National Guard troops into Chicago. Standing with the President from left are, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. He complained about unfair coverage and said there are “purposely negative stories.” He also claimed reporters are happy with his law enforcement crackdown but “most of you won't say that because you're radical left.” Trump said the media has lost its influence because he's won elections despite negative coverage. President Trump greeted Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, by asserting a “Purge or Revolution” was taking place there and threatening to not do business with Seoul as he prepared to host the new leader at the White House later Monday. It wasn't immediately clear what Trump was referring to, but South Korea had been in a state of political turmoil for the last several months after its former leader, the conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, briefly imposed martial law last December which eventually led to his stunning ouster from office. We can't have that and do business there,” Trump posted on social media Monday morning. Yoon, who was elected to a five-year term in 2022, was considered more ideologically aligned with Trump and had even taken up golfing again after the U.S. president was reelected last November to try to forge a bond with him. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy listens to German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil during their meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025. Special envoy Keith Kellogg was speaking in Kyiv on Monday about efforts to end the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine as a lack of progress fuels doubts about whether a peace settlement could be on the horizon. Officials are “hoping to get to a position where, in the near term, we have, with a lack of a better term, security guarantees” that address Ukraine's fears of another invasion by Russia in the future, Kellogg said. “That's a work in progress,” Kellogg said of the potential security guarantees after attending Ukraine's annual National Prayer Breakfast along with politicians, business leaders and diplomats. But Russian officials have signaled that such a summit won't happen any time soon. Trump has been escalating his focus on public safety, particularly in Democratic cities such as Washington, where he's deployed National Guard troops and federal agents over the objections of local officials. The president is scheduled to sign executive orders at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. One involves ending cashless bail, according to the White House Assistant Press Secretary. Another is designed to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is an act protected by the First Amendment. At noon, he's scheduled to greet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung speaks during a ceremony to celebrate the 80th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. President Trump will sign an executive order later Monday that's meant to crack down on those who burn the American flag, which is protected by the First Amendment. The order calls on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute those who break laws “in ways that involve desecrating the flag,” according to a White House official. Trump has long demanded punishment for those who burn a U.S. flag, although the Supreme Court has ruled that doing so is a form of constitutionally protected free speech. The court order signed by Chief Judge George Russell III automatically pauses any effort by the Trump administration to immediately deport Abrego Garcia. Any immigrant seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court is covered by the order, which blocks their removal from the U.S. until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, says a lawsuit had been filed in federal district court in Maryland shortly after his detention asking for an order that he not be deported. This latest development makes good on a directive issued late last week by Trump's defense secretary. A Defense Department official who wasn't authorized to speak publicly said some units on certain missions would be armed — some with handguns and others with rifles. The spokesperson said that all units with firearms have been trained and are operating under strict rules for use of force. An Associated Press photographer on Sunday saw members of the South Carolina National Guard outside Union Station with holstered handguns. A statement from the joint task force that has taken over policing in the nation's capital said units began carrying their service weapons on Sunday and that the military's rules say force should be used “only as a last resort and solely in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.” It said the force is committed to protecting “the safety and wellbeing” of Washington's residents. They filed it in the federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, where U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has been presiding over a string of hearings for the original case. ▶ AP Morning Wire curates the most important stories and sends them straight to your inbox.

(AP Photo/Brett Carlsen) A local gang, Barrio 18, began extorting his family for “rent money.” When he was 12, the gang threatened to take Abrego Garcia away until his father paid “all of the money that they wanted.” In March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he and three other men were detained by local police, court records say. They were suspected of being in MS-13 based on tattoos and clothing, according to the records. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges. The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning. On Friday, Abrego Garcia returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was greeted with cheers and flowers following his release from a Tennessee jail on Friday after his case attracted significant attention amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown when he was mistakenly deported in March.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hurricane season can be stressful as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives. Here's a few tips on how to prepare and stay safe. Brianna Quick holds her dog Hina while checking out the coastal flooding in the Colonial Place neighborhood of Norfolk, Va., as a result of Hurricane Erin, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025.

This image provided by York Beach Fire/Rescue shows a sailboat capsized by the high surf Saturday into the rocks at York Harbor in Maine. (AP) — Hurricane Erin never made landfall but left behind rough ocean conditions along the U.S. East Coast. At least two people died after they had been swimming in the heavy current, and a search continued Monday for a man who was missing after his boat capsized. Beaches were beginning to reopen Friday after Erin, twice the size of an average hurricane, had weakened into a post-tropical cyclone far from land, but was still capable of causing life-threatening surf and rip currents, the National Hurricane Center in Miami had said. Erin's outer bands had already brushed North Carolina. In Massachusetts, a team of police and U.S. Coast Guard members were resuming their search Monday for a man in his 50s who was missing after a boat capsized off of Salisbury Beach on Saturday. Despite challenging weather and sea conditions including 6- to 8-foot swells, the team performed sonar scans, dives, surface and aerial patrols on Sunday, the state police said in a news release. In New Hampshire, authorities are investigating the death of a 17-year-old boy who had been swimming with family members off of Hampton Beach on Sunday night. Witnesses said he was pulled away by a strong ocean current and his father unsuccessfully tried to rescue him. Lifeguards brought both to shore and began livesaving efforts on the teen, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital. A man drowned Saturday after being caught in a strong rip current off the New York coast, at Sailors Haven in the Fire Island Natoinal Seashore in Suffolk County, authorities said. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Juliette formed Monday in the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles from Mexico's Baja California peninsula as Tropical Storm Fernand churned in the Atlantic Ocean. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect for either storm, the hurricane center said. Juliette posed no immediate threat to land, forecasters said. It had maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (72 kph). Some strengthening was forecast through Tuesday, with weakening starting Wednesday. In the Atlantic basin, Fernand formed Saturday but was also far from land and forecast to remain over open ocean waters. It was about 425 miles (684 kilometers) east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 kph) and heading north-northeast at 13 mph (21 kph). The storm was expected to turn more to the northeast as it moves away from Bermuda and weaken starting Monday night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A White House official confirmed that under the two cashless bail executive orders, the federal government would withhold approval, funding, and services if jurisdictions with cashless bail do not repeal their policies, in addition to any “actions” Attorney General Pam Bondi identifies as “necessary and appropriate because of the emergency conditions.” Trump's cashless bail executive orders coincide with his federal takeover of Washington's law enforcement amid plans to deploy the National Guard to other Democrat-run cities around the country in response to crime and homelessness, including Chicago and Baltimore. Trump used the executive order signing ceremony Monday to criticize Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), who is speculated to be considering running for president in 2028, advising the governor to “spend more time in the gym.” “Chicago is a killing field right now, and they don't acknowledge it,” Trump told reporters. “It also instructs the Attorney General to refer flag desecration cases that violate state or local laws to appropriate state or local authorities,” the White House wrote in a third fact sheet. During the signing ceremony, Trump told reporters, “If you burn a flag, you get one year in jail,” adding, “It goes on your record.” “But when you burn the American flag, it incites riots at levels that we've never seen before. “The U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that this type of statute is unconstitutional,” Bondi said in 2007. In its fact sheet on flag burning, the White House underscored that “the Supreme Court has never held that flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or serve as a form of ‘fighting words' is constitutionally protected.” “Thank you for protecting the American flag, and we'll do that without running afoul of the First Amendment as well,” Bondi told Trump on Monday.</p>

Alex Pelbath, who flew the last American plane out of Kabul, joins 'Fox & Friends' to reflect on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan four years later. EXCLUSIVE: A retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who commanded the final American evacuation flights out of Afghanistan four years ago on Monday launched a Republican campaign in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. Alex Pelbath, who describes himself as a "Trump Conservative," is running in the 2026 race to succeed three-term GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, who is bidding for governor rather than seek re-election in the right-leaning coastal district in South Carolina's Lowcountry. My mission is clear: provide President Trump the reinforcements he needs, deliver leadership that makes the Lowcountry proud, and bring an outsider's perspective to Washington," Pelbath said in a statement shared nationally first with Fox News Digital. Alex Pelbath, a retired Air Force officer and pilot, on Monday launched a Republican campaign for the U.S. House in South Carolina's 1st Congressional District. During the much-maligned U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during former President Joe Biden's first year in the White House, Pelbath served as air mission commander for the final evacuation from Kabul, overseeing all aircraft involved. And he personally flew the last American plane out of Afghanistan. But the mission's not over," Pelbath said in his statement and an accompanying video.

(U.S. Marine Corps photo by 1st Lt. Mark Andries; AP) "I witnessed the devastation caused by career politicians' weak leadership," Pelbath argued in a statement. "I never planned to run for Congress, but I can't stand by while Washington puts politics before the mission. America needs leaders who will stand with President Trump and deliver on his effort to Make America Great Again – by ending the flow of illegal immigrants, stopping the woke nonsense in our schools and military, and fighting for an economy that works for Lowcountry families." Pelbath, a U.S. Air Force Academy graduate, lives in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, with his wife and their two children. Rep. Nancy Mace announces that she will run for governor of South Carolina during a news conference at the Citadel in Charleston on Aug. 4, 2025. Mace, who was first elected to the district in 2020, is one of five major candidates running for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in the race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who is the Palmetto State's longest-serving governor. Pamela Evette, Rep. Ralph Norman and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell are also seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the reliably red state. Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention. Every week, it feels as if there's a hot new fitness trend. The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists. She's a journalist and author of the book, Let's Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped the World. According to Friedman, we're living in a fitness golden age, but it wasn't always this way. In the 1950s, people were actively discouraged from exercising. “For women, exercise was seen as especially dangerous,” she says. “There was a widespread belief that strenuous exercise would make your uterus fall out.” This week on Explain It To Me — Vox's weekly call-in podcast — she tells us how the messaging around movement changed. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Friedman, edited for length and clarity. When did we first start to see our ideas around exercise evolve in America? The post-World War II era was actually a time when Americans were moving less than ever before that then helped give rise to what would come. Push button appliances became popular, ranch houses eliminated stairs, driving replaced walking, and TV exploded. So the good life meant a life of little sweat, and it was at that point when the first real fitness influencers stepped onto the scene through TV. The message that exercise was both necessary and good for you was beamed into living rooms across the country, and almost as soon as this period of inactivity began, there were these fitness evangelists who were saying, “Not so fast, we actually need to move our bodies to feel good.” There were a few really popular TV fitness personalities who had to work really hard to convince the country that exercise would not kill you. Yeah, there was a lot more fear about over-exertion than under-exertion at the time. There were still outdated beliefs that you were only born with a certain number of heartbeats and you didn't want to waste them on exercise. Muscles were seen as unseemly and unladylike. Heading into the '60s, people like [fitness pioneer] Bonnie Prudden were saying, “No. You need to do it.” And as people started discovering that a regular exercise habit made them feel good, and in some cases improved measures of health, slowly the cultural messaging began to take off. There were still outdated beliefs that you were only born with a certain number of heartbeats and you didn't want to waste them on exercise. We also had a president at the time, JFK, who famously wrote a piece in Sports Illustrated before he even was inaugurated called “The Soft American.” There were a lot of fears about the fact that basically in this Cold War era, Americans were becoming really physically unfit and soft, and we would have trouble defending ourselves. All of these cultural forces were helping to shape what happened in the early '60s, and we started to see some of the first really early group fitness classes. Pilates was created basically a hundred years ago. This is a decade you've written that has changed fitness forever. Books like Our Bodies, Ourselves, the seminal feminist health tome, actually had a chapter about exercise, and they were telling women, “It's okay for women to have muscles.” It was part of this messaging that women can be independent and self-sufficient. There was the passage of Title IX in 1972, which created so many more opportunities for girls to play high school and college sports, so there was a whole new generation of women who were active and wanted to continue to be active. There was also the birth of exercise science, which is huge. For a really long time, even as some enlightened doctors knew or suspected that exercise was good for your health, those fears about overexertion were very real. Against that backdrop, there was an explosion [of exercise]. And in the '70s, we saw what we would now look at as almost like the virality of so many workouts and modes of exercise that laid the groundwork for how we move today. Before the early '70s, it was seen as people who ran for fun and ran in public were really kind of kooky, and they would sometimes have cans thrown at them. Women were not allowed to run most marathons. Before the early ‘70s, it was seen as people who ran for fun and ran in public were really kind of kooky, and they would sometimes have cans thrown at them. Chorus Line was this huge Broadway hit. Everyday Americans wanted to have good dance skills, and that helped to fuel the rise of aerobic dancing. It was created by a professional jazz dancer, and she discovered that there were a lot of adult women who had no plans to become professional dancers, but wanted to look like dancers and were kind of captivated by dance. And for a lot of women at that time, going to a jazzercise aerobics dance class was the first time that they had ever worked out as adults. They very famously spent time at an ashram in India, and that helped to normalize it a little bit among Americans. A lot of Americans still saw yoga as dangerous. It felt scarily exotic to them, and there was a mystical element to it And then the real turning point was a PBS show called Lilias, Yoga, and You. So a lot of housewives who just had the TV on were exposed to her. You've also written about how weightlifting took off in the '70s. Men who really focused on strength training and building muscles were viewed suspiciously either as being narcissists or they were often portrayed as thugs or bodyguards. Enter Arnold Schwarzenegger who was a champion bodybuilder at the time. He was kind of a ladies man, and he helped make bodybuilding and strength training aspirational in this country. There's another celebrity who had a huge impact on fitness at the time. None of them had quite the impact as Jane Fonda. She was the first Hollywood celebrity also to become a fitness influencer. Part of her success was selling herself, and the idea that if you workout like me, you can be like me. Her biggest impact came in 1982 when she released the Jane Fonda workout video. At the time, not that many people even owned VCRs because the idea that you would want to watch the same movie over and over again was new and people couldn't quite wrap their heads around it yet. She, more than anyone who came before her, made exercise aspirational, especially for women. Fitness culture, as we know it, is an American invention. Some of the popular workouts that we do today, like barre and Pilates, have their roots in other countries, but it was in America that they became commercialized. I think there is something about always striving for thinner, better, faster, stronger that does feel uniquely American, but hopefully now we're beginning to recognize some of that and we can move away from it a bit.

'Outnumbered' panel reacts to a massive crowd of protesters blocking the 101 freeway in Los Angeles. FIRST ON FOX: President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Monday cracking down on suspects who desecrate the American flag, including burning it, by mandating they face prosecution, Fox News Digital exclusively learned. "The American flag is the most sacred and cherished symbol of the United States of America, and desecrating it is uniquely and inherently offensive and provocative," a fact sheet on the order provided to Fox News Digital reads. "It is a statement of contempt and hostility toward our Nation, and an act used by groups of foreign nationals calculated to intimidate and threaten violence against Americans." The order additionally directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to refer flag desecration cases that violate state and local laws to appropriate local authorities. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order Aug. 25, 2025, cracking down on suspects who desecrate the American flag. The American flag has been desecrated by protesters in recent months, as captured in video footage, most notably during anti-Israel protests that rocked U.S. cities and college campuses under the Biden administration and during Trump administration ICE raids to remove illegal aliens from the nation. The order directs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas or other immigration permits and benefits of non-citizens "wherever there has been an appropriate determination that flag desecration by foreign nationals permits the exercise of those remedies under applicable law," according to the fact sheet. Anti-Israel protesters were seen lighting the American flag on fire outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024, as well as in Washington, D.C., in July 2024 when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress amid the war that has continued since 2023, as well as flag burning in New York City's Washington Square Park over the Fourth of July weekend in 2024 to protest U.S. support of Israel. More recently, anti-ICE protesters were seen in June waving Mexican flags on the streets of Los Angeles while burning Old Glory in response to federal law enforcement raiding the city to remove illegal migrants as part of the Trump administration's efforts to secure the U.S. border. We need to take down this empire once and for all," a protester holding a bullhorn in Los Angeles was heard saying as the American flag laid on the ground engulfed in flames, the New York Post reported in June. One protester was seen spitting on the flag as it burned. A protester waves the Mexican flag in front of a burning Waymo vehicle during an anti-ICE protest in downtown Los Angeles, June 8, 2025. Trump's expected executive order Monday follows a handful of other presidential actions and initiatives he has launched to restore and promote patriotism, including banning State Department offices nationwide, such as embassies, from flying any other flag than America's. The president additionally installed two massive 88-foot-tall American flags on either side of the White House in June as part of a patriotic endeavor that Trump personally funded. "President Trump personally paid to install two big, beautiful American Flags to wave proudly over the White House for years to come," White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Fox News Digital of the newly installed White House flags back in July. "This is just one of many projects President Trump selflessly paid for to make the White House even more patriotic and beautiful."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Jessica Knurick explains how to counter MAHA when no one trusts experts. The way Jessica Knurick sees it, the Make America Healthy Again movement won over Americans on social media — and so that's where public health's battle to win back people's hearts and minds must be fought. She serves up snappy videos featuring news clips and charts to debunk the latest claims from US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other MAHA leaders. Her voice is playful but authoritative — making her explanations of basic scientific concepts more engaging and hopefully more likely to help people to navigate the sometimes-deranged social media wellness influencer ecosystem. A shift was underway and became especially pronounced in the most personal way. She said that in 2019, during her first pregnancy, she recalled misleading and fear-based content for pregnant women being present but hardly overwhelming. But then the pandemic hit and polarized people about public health even more than they had been. When she had her second child in 2022, it seemed like that was the only kind of content she was being shown. “A lot of people who maybe trusted science before, maybe trusted our institutions, or never even thought about them and went about their lives, they were in their houses on social media, and saw tons and tons of conspiratorial information and health information taken out of context,” Knurick told me in a recent interview. “That started laying the foundation for this anti-science, anti-public health movement we're seeing now.” The seeds for this transition had been laid over many years. Facebook and Instagram have overhauled their algorithms in ways that elevate fear-based content — and the wellness businesses that used that kind of marketing to target young women, and moms in particular, have thrived. When Kennedy launched his presidential campaign in 2024, he gave this broad collection of people who feared toxins and chemicals and a corrupt food and medical industry a name: the Make America Healthy Again movement (MAHA). Knurick and other public health experts believe parts of Kennedy's agenda could actually lead to more sickness based on the available evidence; falling vaccination rates, for example, have already led to a historic measles outbreak this year. But how do you persuade people when appeals to authority aren't effective anymore, because many people reflexively don't trust the experts? She is an expert herself and reads the latest research from reputable scholarly journals, as any trained dietitian would. But that is not the focus of her messaging. Instead, she told me that she is trying to figure out how to use the tools of the MAHA movement to argue that, while its concerns about chronic diseases are sincere and well-founded, its explanations for that crisis and its proposed solutions are misplaced. I spoke with Knurick about how she goes about the work of trying to counter MAHA on its own turf. Our conversation is below, edited for clarity and length. Among those, which in particular do you take most seriously? I think what tends to confuse a lot of people when they first come across my content is the fact that I do sound a lot like the people in MAHA on a surface level — because what I always say is they largely get the problem right. RFK Jr. will just cite random statistics, like that nearly 50 percent of American children have Type 2 diabetes when it's really less than 1 percent. I think what MAHA has really tapped into is this idea that we do have a food system that prioritizes profit over people's health. We do have a health care system that largely prioritizes profits, as opposed to most health care systems in the world. They really tap into this feeling we all have that our systems are set up for us to fail. Our systems are set up for corporate profits and they're leaving us behind. When I saw this movement coming, it was literally my exact area of expertise; exactly what I've been studying. I saw how they were manipulating the narrative. Where I diverge with them is: The issues are largely right, but what they identify as the causes of those issues are largely wrong and misleading. MAHA really leans into this idea of corruption, right? It's all very focused on this idea that you can't trust experts. When you look at the original MAHA report, what was supposed to be their scientific report about the causes of childhood chronic disease, it really leaned heavy into this conspiratorial corruption narrative. “People aren't recognizing the conflicts that we're seeing right in front of us when it comes to wellness and MAHA.” Whereas if you're actually looking at it from a very evidence-based place, that's not what's causing chronic disease. MAHA doesn't even talk about these things, which are very evidence-based causes of chronic disease. You can't really talk about health disparities because of the Trump administration's opposition to DEI. They really have this strong focus on things like food dyes and seed oils, and, in fact, the evidence is quite the opposite for something like seed oils. Food dyes are a bit more nuanced, but if I make a list of one to 20 things in our food environment that are causing issues, food dyes are going to be quite low on that list. To put all of our emphasis into that and not talk about the actual issues is just disingenuous. They talk about the dietary guidelines as being corrupt, right? The dietary guidelines are in bed with these food corporations. And even if he didn't make that mistake, they bring up the food pyramid like we still use it. But if they did, research suggests that their diet quality would be greatly improved. So when you're trying to talk about what the problems are with health in America, and you are very disingenuously saying that it's the dietary guidelines because it plays into this idea of corruption — when it's absolutely not the dietary guidelines, and again, if more people followed them, we'd be better off — it just says to me that this is not a genuine movement to improve health. It's more to play into this idea of corruption so that we don't trust our public health agencies, we don't trust scientists, and they can insert ideology instead of evidence. Who do you see being the core audience for MAHA? RFK Jr. has his core base that's been with him since he was running for president, and over the last couple of decades with his work at the Children's Health Defense. That core base is really based on an anti-vaccine movement. Then within the broader MAHA coalition, it is more moms. They really play into this MAHA mom and younger women generally. This isn't all of them, but I would say that a good representation of MAHA is moms with young kids who are middle- to upper-class white women. They don't necessarily need to think about all of the factors that play into the health of Americans, particularly low-income Americans. But they genuinely want a healthier food environment. They want to see an improvement in health outcomes for the people they know and, for some of them, Americans overall. Maybe they have never thought through these issues before. For a lot of them, this is the first time they've ever thought about these issues. I've also seen people say, Well, at least an administration is talking about our health. So obviously, they weren't paying attention during the Obama administration with Michelle Obama's movement, but a lot of them were probably children. Moms with young kids are a very vulnerable population. We really just want to do what's best for our children. We are very susceptible to fear-based messaging like, You can't trust this in your food. And the MAHA movement does that quite well. Who do you see as the audience for your own content? So I was really trying to reach people who were open to hearing another side but just hadn't had that opportunity. But they were being a bit misled by the narrative. People who still care about science and evidence, but maybe they just didn't think about these topics before. I would love to reach people who have already been misled by this movement, who really do care about changing systems, because I think that if we can diagnose the causes correctly, that will give us more momentum to actually make real change. One of my goals is to never be condescending or talk down to the people in the MAHA movement who have just been caught up by it because they've never thought of these issues. How do you bring in the people who have been misled without alienating them by being sarcastic about RFK Jr. — somebody they like? You can take a very confrontational tone in some of your content. Yeah, it's something that I've given a lot of thought to. I'll tell you that there's a human component in this where I'm just so distraught at seeing what he's doing to our public health agencies and the science, even if I wanted to be kind in my tone to him. But what you'll see is that I don't disparage him as a person. I talk about what he's doing and how it's detrimental. I go after the misinformation that they're spreading. I try to really stay focused on that. I'm not going to get everybody because people who love RFK Jr. will come to my page or they'll watch a video and they'll hear my tone towards him, and they won't even listen to the rest. But for every person like that, there are people who you know will be like, Oh my gosh, how can she take such a strong stance about him, and then be more inquisitive and listen more. I've had several people send me DMs, somebody literally said this to me the other day: You know, I came to your page as a hater. A lot of your content is dedicated to explaining foundational scientific concepts, like “correlation does not equal causation.” What are some of the concepts people need to be able to really grasp nutrition science — and all kinds of science — and navigate this chaotic information environment that we all exist in? These are things that I see in a lot of these misleading videos, and so I try to point them out to people. A lot of people will show graphs of two different variables increasing at the same time and use that to imply causation. Identifying that, I think, can be really important. I have also noticed that you call out some of these financial conflicts of interest that involve MAHA movement leaders, their businesses, and where the movement diverges with consensus science. Calley Means, one of the leaders in the MAHA movement, for example, has a company called TrueMed that allows FSA and HSA dollars to be spent on any number of wellness products or supplements. His sister [US surgeon general nominee Casey Means] has a company that sells continuous glucose monitors. Now we have HHS coming out recommending more research into supplements and wearable technology. I think it's really important for people to identify that most of the people who are high up in this MAHA movement are financially benefiting from this. People aren't recognizing the conflicts that we're seeing right in front of us when it comes to wellness and MAHA. ﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention. Millions more people will be taking a GLP-1 soon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted interest rate cuts could be coming soon in a speech on Friday, a move that could affect everyone from global markets to individual Americans. Powell underscored that any upcoming rate cut would be dependent on the economic data. But Fed watchers took his comments to mean the central bank's monetary policy committee may decide to lower them at its next meeting, in mid-September. “While a September rate cut is highly probable, it is not a done deal,” cautioned Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. Investors nonetheless welcomed the prospect of a rate cut, sending the Dow soaring 800 points on Friday to close at a record high. Whenever the Fed does cut interest rates, here's how it could affect your financial life. When the Fed cuts its key overnight lending rate, lower rates on bank savings and loans tend to follow. But they may even start slipping a little in advance of any decision on your savings. “Savings rates and CD rates will start to slide, and that will pick up speed as we get closer to the actual resumption of rate cuts,” McBride said. Whatever happens with rates, one thing likely won't change: You're still likely to get the highest interest rates on your savings if you put your money in a high-yield savings account from an FDIC-insured online bank, which has to compete for deposits more fiercely than behemoths like Chase or Bank of America. Jerome Powell hints long-awaited rate cuts are coming soon — the first during Trump's term If you locked in a really high rate already and the CD is “callable,” it's possible the bank may decide to recall it. Any loan you've already taken out with a fixed rate won't change. Any new loan you're seeking will likely have a lower rate than you would have seen if the Fed hadn't cut. When it is to the advantage of the lender, rates may be slower to move lower than consumers would like,” said Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner at CardRates.com. But, she added, as in any rate environment, “the stronger your credit, the more you are likely to see a better loan rate, because you are a more desirable consumer for the lender.” Your credit card issuer will lower your variable rate, mimicking whatever rate cut the Fed makes, though there could be up to a three-month lag, McBride said. But don't expect to save a ton of money if and when it happens. Credit card rates are crazy high – the average is still 20.13%, per Bankrate. Make your money work for you by ‘laddering' bonds or CDs Remember, the Fed cut rates a full percentage point last year — and the average credit card rate is still over 20%,” McBride said. In fact, you might have better luck just asking your card issuer for a lower rate. A Lending Tree report last year found that about three-quarters of card holders who asked for a lower rate were successful — by an average of 6.5 percentage points. If you're shopping for a home or looking to refinance your mortgage, it's not clear how influential a Fed rate cut will be on its own. Mortgage rates are not tied directly to Fed moves, but rather to moves in the yield of the 10-year US Treasury note. And that yield is influenced by a host of economic expectations. “Inflation, debt and deficits have kept mortgage rates elevated and will likely limit the extent that mortgage rates come down,” McBride said. “Unless the economy starts to keel over, we probably won't see mortgage rates moving sustainably below 6%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge said Monday that she will order officials to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia in the United States while she weighs a new legal challenge from him over the Trump administration's plans to quickly deport him to Uganda. US District Judge Paula Xinis said during a brief hearing Monday afternoon that she's planning to stretch out an existing hold on Abrego Garcia's removal so she can more fully consider whether officials are violating his due process rights, including by deporting him to Uganda even after he said he fears being persecuted or tortured in the African nation. Abrego Garcia is currently being held at a detention facility in Virginia, his attorney said. Under that new order, the judge said, the government will be “absolutely forbidden to remove Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.” Xinis said she was also worried that sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda would result in an “end run” around a court order barring him from again being sent to El Salvador. She's also planning to hold an evidentiary hearing with witnesses in coming days. Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after turning himself in to a facility in Baltimore. “Regardless of what happens today in my ICE check-in, promise me this,” Abrego Garcia said at a rally with members of his family, immigration activists and community leaders before reporting to the ICE facility on Monday. Abrego Garcia returned home at the end of last week from Tennessee, where he was being held pending trial in a federal human smuggling case. His attorneys provided Xinis, an appointee of President Barack Obama, with a copy of notices Abrego Garcia sent over the weekend to immigration officials that said he has a fear of being sent to Uganda and that he preferred to be sent to Costa Rica, a country that has said it would be willing to give him some form of legal status should he be sent there. I also fear torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official in that country,” Abrego Garcia wrote in the notice sent Saturday. “Finally, I fear that country will refoul me (re-deport me) to El Salvador, where I also fear persecution on account of the above-mentioned protected grounds and torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official, and where I have been tortured in the past,” he wrote. That deal also seemed to strike Xinis as being legally dubious. “You can't condition the relinquishment of constitutional rights in that regard,” she said during Monday's hearing. Abrego Garcia's lawyers urge judge to drop his criminal case, alleging ‘vindictive and selective prosecution' “They're throwing the entire federal apparatus at one father of three to prove that no one should dare challenge their authority,” she continued in a statement. Activists joining Abrego Garcia on Monday morning accuse the Trump administration of “retaliating” against him for fighting against his deportation and trying to exercise his constitutional rights. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also argued in court papers Saturday that offers by the administration to eventually deport him to Costa Rica in exchange for his guilty plea were evidence of the government's effort to punish him for challenging his wrongful deportation. They told the judge in his criminal case that their client had until Monday morning “to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever.” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen said he spoke to Abrego Garcia on Sunday for the first time since they met in El Salvador in April. The Democratic senator said he told the father of three and his wife that “we will stay in this fight for justice and due process.” CNN's Michael Williams and Casey Gannon contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance said Russian President Vladimir Putin will not install a “puppet regime” in Ukraine after the war between Russia and Ukraine has concluded. Vance also praised Trump's “energetic diplomacy” while pursuing peace negotiations to end the conflict. Vance said Russia was prepared to make some concessions in peace negotiations, but not everything, as of yet. He stressed that there was still work and a long way to go. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning.” “And importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he added. “And what … I admire about the president in this moment is he's not asking 3 1/2 years ago,” Vance said. “He's not, you know, trying to focus on every nitpicky detail of how this thing started 3 1/2 years ago. And how do you build a foundation from one side of that ledger to the other so that you can stop the killing?” Vance also acknowledged that Russia has done “a lot of things” that the United States did not support or “like,” including the strike against an American electronics manufacturer in Ukraine. “I don't like it, Kristen,” Vance said. And this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don't like. So you asked me what I'm enraged by. What I'm enraged by is a presidency in Joe Biden who, for three years, did nothing to end the killing.” He then praised Trump's diplomatic efforts and said that such initiatives were a legitimate attempt to end the war and establish a peace deal. “What I'm actually excited about right now is that we have a president who's engaging in energetic diplomacy to try to stop the killing,” Vance said. I think the American people should be proud of it. And whatever the outcome of this, whether the war ends in three months or six months or hopefully not beyond, but maybe, we should be proud that we have a president who's trying to stop the killing.” It's the most complicated, but we're trying despite that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>America's next big showdown is brewing over Donald Trump's zeal to impose unusual presidential power as he eyes big, Democratic-run cities to expand a crime crackdown that sent troops flocking onto the streets of Washington, DC. “We should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Trump last week also name-checked Baltimore and Oakland, California, where he argued crime is “very bad.” Wes Moore, a potential Democratic presidential hopeful in 2028, who had suggested the president walk with him through Baltimore to view local attempts to stem violent crime. Trump's critics argue his deployment of National Guard forces in the US capital and in Los Angeles in response to demonstrations earlier this year against his immigration policies are prototype operations for wider national crackdowns. But the president has smaller legal leeway to surge federal troops into cities and to dictate law enforcement policies in the states than in Washington, a federal district. Sending troops or dedicating federal agents to police work into a major city such as Chicago or Baltimore against the will of Democratic state and city officials would create a new test of the presidential powers Trump incessantly seeks to expand and would threaten state sovereignty — which Republicans have historically sought to preserve. Declaring yet another national emergency to federalize National Guard reserve troops normally commanded by a state governor would trigger legal showdowns over Trump's preferred method of unlocking new and questionable executive authority. He suggested last week he might declare a national emergency in Washington, to get around a 30-day limit on troop deployments. A CNN analysis of government data found that in the first week after the administration took control of the capital's police force and deployed federal agents and troops on the streets, there was a moderate dip in reported crime while arrests of immigrants were up tenfold from typical ICE arrest tallies. The risk would be that such moves could disrupt chains of command between local elected officials and police chiefs and upset community policing initiatives designed to stem violent crime. And it would reinforce a growing impression that Trump is seeking to normalize the anomalous use of soldiers in domestic settings to purse his political priorities. As was the case in Washington, a Chicago crackdown would give Trump another opening to impose his conservative power and autocratic tendencies on a population that voted overwhelmingly for his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024. And it would enable him to put Democrats in a political vise, forcing them to walk a tightrope between rejecting federal takeovers and his hardline tactics while risking alienating voters who are concerned about violent crime and the impact of past lax border policies. Then there is the question of paying for all this. Trump's growing zeal for using federal troops and agents will sooner or later raise the question of resources. Redeploying federal agents from other duties could affect the FBI's ability to target transnational crime or anti-terrorism investigations. Trump's warnings about supposedly lawless inner cities do not necessarily reflect the true picture of public order. In Chicago, the police said Friday that homicides were down 31% this year, and shootings fell 36%. Still, that doesn't mean people who live in big cities feel safe. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday, “I think everybody should take a step back and realize that, as a commander in chief over his two terms, he's only deployed and put boots on the ground in American cities, never overseas. And just think about what that means as a country.” Emanuel, a CNN senior political and global affairs commentator, suggested that Trump's true purpose was to redouble immigration enforcement in cities — like Chicago — that do not cooperate with federal authorities in crackdowns against undocumented migrants. “This will not be about fighting crime,” he said. And Emanuel, a former senior member of Democratic House leadership, White House chief of staff and ambassador to Japan, offered some advice for his party, which has sometimes struggled to connect with voters on crime. “We have a strategy for fighting crime: more police on the beat and getting kids, gangs and guns off the street.” Jeffries, from New York, said on “State of the Union” that Democrats, like all Americans, want safer communities, but opposed Trump's power grabs. “We should make sure that the flood of guns into these communities is cut off. We should make sure that we're dealing with the mental health crisis that exists all across the United States of America, and, by the way, which Donald Trump is exacerbating by cutting funds to actually help people who are dealing with emotional distress.” Democratic local leaders are trying to discredit the president's claim that crime is so out of control in cities as to merit such a crackdown. On Saturday, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, issued a statement pointing out that his state had received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking whether it needs help, after Trump named Chicago as a future venue for his surge of military and federal personnel. He said those agencies were trained to combat crime, while the National Guard is not.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) claimed on Sunday that mortgage fraud is President Donald Trump‘s “new weapon” as a Department of Justice investigation into the California senator is already well underway. Since early August, Trump's special attorney Ed Martin has been leading the investigation into Schiff over allegations that he listed more than one property as his primary residence and falsified “bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms” on one of the properties. Schiff has consistently denied wrongdoing but has recently created a legal defense fund as a legal war over the matter looms. In an appearance on NBC News's Meet the Press on Sunday, Schiff trashed the investigation as manufactured, claiming Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who sent the criminal referral to the DOJ in May, “knows it” and is merely doing Trump's “bidding.” Basically, it's free rein with a corrupt leadership at the Justice Department.” Pulte responded to Schiff's latest comments earlier Sunday, vowing not to back down from the investigation. “Fraud is bad, no matter who does it. I will not be intimidated,” he posted on X. Schiff's latest remarks on the investigation come as the DOJ is looking into other high-profile officials over alleged mortgage fraud. Those include New York Attorney General Letitia James and, most recently, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom Trump said he will fire if she doesn't resign.</p>

An online petition is seeking “fair sentencing” for an illegal immigrant accused of causing a fatal highway crash in Florida, saying the charges against him don't align with “the circumstances of the incident.”

On Aug. 12, Harjinder Singh, a truck driver, made an illegal U-turn in a semi-truck on Florida's Turnpike, killing three people in an oncoming minivan. After the crash, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced an investigation into it, and Singh was most recently denied bond, with a Florida judge ruling that he constitutes a substantial flight risk. He is currently in custody on state vehicular homicide charges and immigration violations.

The petition in support of Singh, directed to Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and the Florida Board of Executive Clemency, claims the three deaths in the crash were “a tragic accident – not a deliberate act.” The petition also requests a “reasonable” sentence recognizing it was an accident, as well as parole eligibility “after a fair portion of the sentence has been served.”

“By granting clemency, you would reaffirm the value of proportional justice, the power of community advocacy, and the potential for rehabilitation. We believe this case is not just about one individual — it speaks to the broader principles of fairness and mercy in the justice system,” the petition says.

As of Sunday evening, the petition has nearly 2.5 million signatures.

In the wake of the car crash, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he is pausing worker visas for commercial truck drivers. 

The Department of Transportation found that Singh failed the English language proficiency assessment, answering 2 out of 12 verbal questions correctly and identifying one of four highway signs during a compliance investigation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.</p>
