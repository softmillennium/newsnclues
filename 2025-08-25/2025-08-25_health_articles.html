                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-interest is good when it ensures that one's needs are met, but it can also be maladaptive; research shows that the tendency to self-focus promotes the occurrence of depression and anxiety and can even prolong these conditions. Danika Geisler and Meghan Meyer, from Colombia University, explored this question in their new JNeurosci paper. This activity could predict whether people started thinking about themselves during the break a few seconds later. Geisler and Meyer then turned to a broadly used publicly available database called the Human Connectome project. Thus, the tendency to engage in self-centric thinking may be reflected by fluctuating activity in distinct brain areas during rest. For example, Danika is working on an exciting project examining whether engaging this neural signature predicts people's real-world social network positions. We are also interested in seeing if this neural signature can prospectively predict the onset of depression or anxiety; if so, intervening on this neural signature could offset the development of these mental health conditions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of scientists led by the Institute for Glial Sciences (IGS) at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine has discovered a built-in "brake" that controls when key brain cells mature. By identifying the molecular brake that controls when oligodendrocytes mature, we reveal a clear path to unlocking the brain's own repair program." "MS is a progressive disease that gets worse over time and patients still lack therapies that can restore the myelin they've lost," Tesar said. "We believe these new insights will help deliver on the promise of regenerative therapies that MS patients so urgently need." The study focused on oligodendrocytes, which wrap neurons in protective myelin sheaths that are lost in MS. Oligodendrocytes belong to a category of cells known as glia, which comprise over half of the cells in our nervous system but have largely been overlooked by scientists in favor of neurons. The IGS was created last year at Case Western Reserve to understand how these vital cells function in health and disease. To understand how oligodendrocytes acquire their ability to myelinate neurons, the IGS scientists tracked thousands of molecular changes as immature cells developed into mature, myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. This brake is essential in healthy brain development because it prevents premature myelin formation and ensures that oligodendrocytes mature at the right place and time. But in MS, this normally protective timing mechanism appears to get stuck. "We were surprised to find that SOX6 can so tightly control when oligodendrocytes mature," said Kevin Allan, the study's co-lead author and recent graduate of the School of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program. "This gives us a potential explanation for why these cells often cannot remyelinate damaged neurons in diseases like MS." When the researchers examined brain tissue data from people with MS, they saw an unusually high number of cells stuck in this SOX6-linked immature state. But this stalled maturation seems to be specific to MS: there was no evidence of it in samples from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients. To test whether releasing the brake could accelerate development, the team used a targeted molecular drug called an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to reduce SOX6 in mouse models. Within days, the treated cells matured and began to myelinate nearby neurons. "Our findings suggest that oligodendrocytes in MS are not permanently broken, but may simply be stalled," said Jesse Zhan, the study's co-lead author and medical student in the School of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program. "More importantly, we show that it is possible to release the brakes on these cells to resume their vital functions in the brain." Transient gene melting governs the timing of oligodendrocyte maturation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers led by Hiroshi Ohno at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences (IMS) in Japan have discovered why smoking tobacco helps people suffering from ulcerative colitis, a chronic disease typified by inflammation of the large intestine. These findings imply that protection against ulcerative colitis can be achieved through prebiotics like hydroquinone or probiotic therapy with bacteria like Streptococcus mitis, thus eliminating the need to smoke and all the associated risks for other diseases. Along with these differences is a mystery that has puzzled doctors and scientists for over 40 years; smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease but somehow protects against ulcerative colitis. As both diseases are related to gut inflammation—which is an immune response— and gut immunity depends in part on the types of bacteria in the gut, Ohno and his team at RIKEN IMS set out to investigate whether the differential effects of smoking on these diseases can be explained by gut bacteria.The researchers used a combination of human clinical data and experiments with mice to reach their conclusions. They found that levels of several gut metabolites were higher in smokers with ulcerative colitis than in ex-smokers with colitis. But how do these bacteria help reduce inflammation? And why don't they help in Crohn's disease?The researchers then went back to the oral bacteria that they had discovered was growing in the gut mucosa of smokers with ulcerative colitis, and isolated 10 strains from the saliva of smokers. When they treated mouse models of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with each of these 10 strains for five days, they found that giving the mice Streptococcusmitis had almost the same effect as smoking. Inflammation was reduced in mice with ulcerative colitis and exacerbated in mice with Crohn's disease.Analysis showed that S. mitis triggered the emergence of helper Th1 cells, which are an important part of the gut's immune response to invaders. In Crohn's disease this likely worsens the condition because the original inflammation is actually caused by these same helper Th1 cells. But in colitis, the Th1 cells fight against an initial Th2-immune response, and this ends up reducing inflammation.As smoking poses high risks for cancer, heart disease, and many other illnesses, it is not a sustainable treatment for ulcerative colitis. Logically, direct treatment with this kind of bacteria, or indirect treatment with hydroquinone, is thus likely to mimic the beneficial effects of smoking but avoid all the negative effects."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, a research team at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities demonstrated a groundbreaking process that combines 3D printing, stem cell biology, and lab-grown tissues for spinal cord injury recovery. The study was recently published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, more than 300,000 people in the United States suffer from spinal cord injuries, yet there is no way to completely reverse the damage and paralysis from the injury. The method involves creating a unique 3D-printed framework for lab-grown organs, called an organoid scaffold, with microscopic channels. These channels are then populated with regionally specific spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs), which are cells derived from human adult stem cells that have the capacity to divide and differentiate into specific types of mature cells. "This method creates a relay system that when placed in the spinal cord bypasses the damaged area." In their study, the researchers transplanted these scaffolds into rats with spinal cords that were completely severed. Regenerative medicine has brought about a new era in spinal cord injury research. While the research is in its beginning stages, it offers a new avenue of hope for those with spinal cord injuries. The team hopes to scale up production and continue developing this combination of technologies for future clinical applications. This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the State of Minnesota Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Grant Program and the Spinal Cord Society.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research indicates that many patients with advanced cancer report receiving treatment focusing on longevity over comfort, even when their goal is the opposite. Treatment of serious illnesses generally aims to optimize longevity and quality of life, but in some cases, these goals are at odds with each other. Therefore, clinicians must strive to understand each individual's objectives so that patients do not receive burdensome treatments that go against their wishes. But sometimes, patients and oncologists face tough choices, especially when the goals of living longer and staying comfortable begin to compete with one another." Manan P. Shah, MD, lead author, University of California, Los Angeles To assess the relationship between patients' preferences and their treatment, Dr. Shah and his colleagues analyzed survey responses from adults with advanced cancer and other serious illnesses who were enrolled in a multi-site trial of advance care planning. These proportions were similar to those observed in the 868 patients with other serious illnesses (48% and 13%). Also, life-extending care did not appear to actually extend life in patients who did not wish to receive it. Among patients with cancer preferring comfort-focused care, there was no significant difference in 2-year mortality between those who reported receiving discordant life-extending versus concordant comfort-focused care. "One takeaway is that doctors need to have open conversations with patients about their goals, clearly explain the intent of the treatment they are providing, and try to reconcile any real or perceived discordance between goals and treatment." Patient‐reported discordance between care goals and treatment intent in advanced cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tobacco smoking is the number one cause of preventable disease and death in Canada; it is highly addictive and hard to stop. Recognizing these challenges, a new guideline from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care provides a menu of effective options to help people quit smoking, with behavioural and medication options and a natural health product that can be tailored and combined for personal choice. The guideline is published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241584. Quitting smoking can be hard, and people may need to try to quit many times with a variety of options like counselling, medication or in combination. Dr. Eddy Lang, task force member, emergency physician at the University of Calgary and guideline coauthor Targeted at clinicians, smoking cessation practitioners, and patients, the guideline includes tools to help people decide which options are best for them, alone or in conversation with a health care provider. It is based on the latest evidence and aligns well with international guidelines. The guideline recommends against acupuncture, hypnosis, laser therapy, electric current stimulation to the head, ear acupressure, St. John's Wort, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) for smoking cessation. The recommendations do not apply to traditional or ceremonial tobacco use by Indigenous peoples. The task force engaged members of the public who smoke or had recently quit smoking to help rate potential outcomes such as success in quitting and quality of life. The guideline working group also involved 2 external content experts, a physician-scientist who treats people with tobacco addiction and another physician-scientist with expertise in implementing hospital-based smoking cessation programs. Many organizational interest holders also provided input into the guideline. The guideline recommends that most people first use behavioural and pharmacotherapy options known to be effective. Although e-cigarettes may help people quit, their use should be for those who could not quit using other ways or who express a strong preference for e-cigarettes. There are important uncertainties for people to consider, including the lack of approved products with consistent formulations and lack of long-term safety information, and e-cigarettes may not address nicotine addiction. "Using these practical, evidence-based options will help people achieve their goal to quit smoking," said task force member Dr. Donna Reynolds, a family physician, specialist in public health and preventive medicine, and guideline vice-chair. "Clinicians can use the menu of options that we've made available as a patient–clinician discussion tool for shared decision-making with patients to discuss what is best for them.

A new survey by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center reveals many people don't realize these symptoms can mean there's a problem in the hip. The survey of 1,004 people in the United States shows 72% are not aware that knee pain can actually be a sign of a hip problem. We'll also do X-rays to determine arthritis in the hip and if a replacement would be beneficial." Matthew Beal, MD, orthopedic surgeon, Ohio State Wexner Medical Center The Ohio State survey also showed that four out of 10 people respond to unexplained pain by just "pushing through it." While more than half (52%) say they take over-the-counter medications to manage their pain. Ohio State experts say it's important for people to consult a medical expert if they are having any unexplained pain so that a correct diagnosis is made and patients can lead fuller lives. "Getting up and walking after the surgery can serve as ample physical therapy for most patients." The survey was conducted by SSRS on its Opinion Panel Omnibus platform. The SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus is a national, twice-per-month, probability-based survey. Data collection was conducted from June 6-9, 2025, among a sample of 1,004 respondents. All SSRS Opinion Panel Omnibus data are weighted to represent the target population of U.S. adults ages 18 or older.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Feelings of shame are linked to reduced quality of life - as shown by the first study to measure shame as a factor influencing the connection between chronic gastrointestinal disorders and mental health. The results highlight the importance of compassion in healthcare for these patients and their painful experiences of shame." The study is published in the scientific journal Gastroenterology and is a collaboration with researchers at the University of Gothenburg, led by Professor Magnus Simrén.Inês Trindade has examined how feeling of shame affect people with "Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction" (DGBI) - a group of disorders of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal problems where clinical examinations are not able to identify the underlying causes. One example is IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).The study builds on the understanding that quality of life and psychological well-being interact with symptoms from the gut. More severe symptoms can lead to greater psychological distress. "We also know that gastrointestinal problems are often perceived as shameful due to judgmental societal attitudes. This creates a stigma that can cause individuals to feel shame," says Inês Trindade.These types of gastrointestinal disorders (DGBI) can have various consequences. They include needing to use the bathroom frequently, having diarrhoea or constipation, abdominal pain, and bloating. As a result, individuals with DGBI avoid certain foods and social situations to prevent discomfort or for fear of exposing symptoms to others. These physical problems are associated with psychological conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and with overall quality of life.The study shows that different levels of perceived shame among participants impact quality of life. "We demonstrate that shame is an important explanatory factor - a mechanism linking these gastrointestinal problems to poor mental health and reduced quality of life. But there is also a direct link between gastrointestinal symptoms and mental health that is not associated with shame," says Inês Trindade.She emphasizes that it is normal to feel shame because we are social beings. One example is the tendency to avoid contact with others.Inês Trindade sees potential implications for healthcare based on the study's results, even though patient-provider interactions were not the focus of this research project. Instead, she draws on results from other studies in interpreting the significance of her findings:"Empathy and compassion are crucial remedies for feelings of shame. Empathy in healthcare is not a luxury - it's part of evidence-based care," says Inês Trindade.More than 2,400 Swedish people participated in the study, and 537 met the criteria for a DGBI diagnosis related to gastrointestinal problems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk. One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial. We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions." Yuxi Liu, PhD, study first author, research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E (APOE), has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease - the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses' Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants' blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant's inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing. "These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," Liu said. "This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant." In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer's disease. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice. "In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," Liu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows. In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests. "CDC hasn't reached out to us locally," Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. "My staff feels like we are out here all alone," she added. A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells. "All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak," one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. "All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything." If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially. While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills. "This is absolutely outrageous," said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested. "I think this may be very large," she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations around town: "According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone. One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours. "Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?" About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours. "Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently." Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit. "We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit." Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after. "There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed," one CDC scientist said. "Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February," he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves. "It's not that the CDC was delinquent," Benjamin said. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. "I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community," Holbrooks said. "There's a lot of people in the shadows out here." Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more. Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. "We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public," he said. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized. The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. "I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented," Zucker said. Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: "I'm so overwhelmed." On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision. In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development. Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including one founded by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes. "How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?" "HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials," one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. "If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. Another CDC official said they've had to "walk a fine line" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS. While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. "We're providing vitamin A," Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. "There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness," he claimed, "against serious disease and death." The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare. Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. There is no evidence that measles vaccines "cause deaths every year." Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications. In another interview, Kennedy said, "The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris." The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News. Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. "Local hospitals are at capacity," wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. "I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding," Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. "Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua. Then another child in West Texas died of measles. In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. "A lot of people presumed their kids had measles," he said, "and didn't see the need to confirm it." A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on "medical mismanagement," without evidence. At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year. Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. "Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience."

Children whose parents had only compulsory education were 1.64 times more likely to develop eating disorders than those with university-educated parents. “Identifying and addressing existing barriers that might prevent young people from deprived backgrounds from accessing eating disorder services should be research and policy priority,” the study authors wrote. “Provision of comprehensive medical training might facilitate identification of a broader spectrum of eating disorder presentations in primary care, particularly in populations who are more likely to be missed.” It was published online on August 20 in JAMA Network Open. Several people from low-income backgrounds dropped out of the study, which could have created bias in results. The tool used to measure restrictive eating may not have captured extreme restrictive behaviors like anorexia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been known for millennia that the human body accumulates waste as a result of day-to-day functioning, but it's now recognized that the awake, active brain also builds up waste that negatively affects neural function if not removed. Thankfully, it was recently discovered that the brain has a garbage removal mechanism. As a medical student he learned about the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the brain “we thought of it as an inert fluid with a primarily protective purpose, functioning as a sort of shock absorber,” he said. The reality is far more complex, and it's now known that the CSF plays “an important part in cleansing brain tissue by removing waste products and conveying nutrients throughout brain tissue.” When first described in 2012, there was skepticism that a brain waste clearance system existed in humans but a new proof-of-principle study used contrast MRI imaging to visualize the glymphatic system. Senior author Juan Piantino, MD, MCR, associate professor of pediatrics, Division of Neurology, School of Medicine and physician scientist, Neuroscience Division, Papé Family Research Institute, both in Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, said their study was the first to “definitively reveal” the network of perivascular spaces in human beings. Five patients consented to receiving a gadolinium-based contrast agent through a lumbar drain that was already in place for tumor removal. The images revealed that fluid moved along defined pathways rather than diffusing uniformly through brain tissue. This finding was documented with fluid attenuated inversion recovery, which showed the perivascular spaces brighten when perfused with the CSF. Both Iliff and Piantino believe that better understanding the glymphatic system may shed light on the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may ultimately lead to drugs or other strategies to enhance healthy brain function. Iliff explained that because there's no lymphatic circulation within the brain itself, extracellular proteins must be cleared by some alternative mechanism. His research used imaging techniques and fluorescent tracers in a mouse model to demonstrate the drainage pathways. CSF flow is enabled through the expression of a water transporter called aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Sleep is the most important time during which this “brain housekeeping” takes place, Iliff said. The term “glymphatic” was coined to join two ideas: “lymphatic” function which supports waste clearance and “glia” because it's the brain's glial cells that support these processes, Iliff recounted. The term may be new, but there were published reports of a nascent concept. The name ‘glymphatic system' was coined by Stephen Goldman and Maiken Nedergaard, but the neologism wasn't well received by all. “Some members of the field felt that by renaming this biology, we were claiming it as our own, and not adequately acknowledging prior research,” added Iliff. Although the anatomical and functional connections between these two networks “aren't completely understood,” a powerful body of evidence supports the existence of a glymphatic system and its relationship with the meningeal lymphatic network. Its role was demonstrated in multiple lines of research. For example, AQP4 gene deletion exacerbated glymphatic pathway dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and promoted the development of neurofibrillary pathology and neurodegeneration. But a 2017 paper called the glymphatic model into question, noting that not all AQP4 data could be replicated. Another study challenged the notion that a function of sleep is to actively clear metabolites and toxins from the brain. '” Additionally, the mice were anesthetized for an hour or so, but studied over many hours, after it had worn off. There has been a long-standing clinical association between sleep disruption and dementing disorders such as AD. He has reported that the glymphatic system clears amyloid-beta during sleep. More recent data found it clears tau and alpha-synuclein as well. Conditions that are risk factors for neurodegeneration are also associated with impairment of glymphatic function in animal models, he said, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — a modifiable risk factor for AD and Parkinson's disease (PD). A wide range of neurologic conditions are associated with impaired glymphatic function, including AD, PD, normal pressure hydrocephalus, stroke, cerebral small vessel disease, multiple sclerosis, TBI, migraine, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Additional diseases associated with alterations in the glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic system interplay include Huntington disease, frontotemporal dementia, the neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorders, and even brain tumors — particularly gliomas. “That, on its own, would suggest paying attention to sleep problems, particularly in midlife, as a potential modifiable risk factor for dementia,” Iliff said. He encourages his patients to “take steps to improve the quality of sleep now, including establishing a relaxing routine and minimizing screens in the bedroom before sleep.” Other suggestions for keeping your glymphatic system healthy are to improve cardiovascular health since the system relies on arterial pulsatility and physical exercise, which has a positive impact on sleep architecture as well as cardiovascular benefits. In the future, Iliff envisages being able to identify impairment early using a blood test, imaging scan, or device for example. Healthy older adults wore a head-cap fitted with electrodes to continuously measure sleep-active changes in parenchymal resistance. In two crossover studies participants were subjected to one night of natural sleep and one night of wakefulness, separated by at least 2 weeks. Across both studies, it was found that parenchymal resistance remained constant or increased during periods of waking but declined steadily through periods of sleep. “We found that the glymphatic system was functioning in deep and REM [rapid eye movement] sleep, and as the person was waking up,” Iliff said. Applied Cognition, the company that developed the device, is also developing drugs to enhance glymphatic clearance of amyloid and tau in human beings, according to Iliff. He looks forward to ongoing “exciting” developments, which will pave the way for new therapeutic approaches to the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
