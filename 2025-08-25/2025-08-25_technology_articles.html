                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI automation giant UiPath announced Monday that it hired Seattle-based marketing vet Michael Atalla as its new chief marketing officer and separately confirmed it is moving its Bellevue, Wash., offices to the city's Lincoln Square development in September. Atalla's career includes nearly 14 years at Microsoft, ending in 2016 as a director with the Office 365 group. Atalla also co-founded The MJJM Group, which advised early-stage clients on product growth and investment efforts. The company, which went public in 2021, uses AI to automate digital tasks such as data entry, file management and system integration. The Lincoln Square complex includes a 28-story downtown office building that was once primarily occupied by Microsoft. UiPath's expansion comes as multiple Seattle-area companies tackle the challenge of teaching machines to perform repetitive computer operations. That includes Vercept, a startup launched by former Allen Institute for AI research leaders, and Caddi, which emerged from the AI2 Incubator. Both companies are developing agentic AI software that observes users performing basic tasks and automates those workflows. Your company's success hinges on the ability to hire and retain great talent, whether an all-star engineer or a world-class salesperson. Prime Team is revolutionizing staffing with AI and human expertise to change the client experience, while GeekWire's trusted connections and reach into the tech community open doors to new hires. Together, we are committed to solving your company's most vexing talent needs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is tightening security measures around Android app distribution, the company announced on Monday. The tech giant stresses that this does not mean developers can't distribute outside of the Play Store through other app stores or via sideloading — Android will remain open in that regard. However, developers who appreciated the anonymity of alternative distribution methods will no longer have that option. According to its own survey, Google says that more than 50 times more malware came through internet-sideloaded sources compared with Google Play, where it has required developer verification since 2023. By September 2026, any app installed on an Android device in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand will have to meet the new requirements. Developers will have to provide their legal name, address, email, and phone number, which could push independent developers to register as a business for their own privacy's sake. Google notes that student and hobbyist developers will be able to use a separate type of Android Developer Console account when this system rolls out, as their needs differ from commercial developers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, while every single other film distributor would've celebrated this fact, the streamer didn't report the numbers. This wasn't meant to be a huge money grab or play for theatrical dominance. It was more of a thank you to the fans who streamed the film in record numbers and an elaborate advertisement for Netflix. But the film's undeniable success brings up many questions about how and why this happened, if it could be repeated, and what all that means. The biggest question among those is whether KPop Demon Hunters would have been as big a success had it been exclusively released in theaters? The film debuted on Netflix in late June and was immediately embraced by everyone who watched it. At that time, Netflix also released the film in three theaters for one week back in June to qualify it for the Academy Awards. The streamer never reported that data, but we can tell you, it was not number one at the box office. Slowly but surely, KPop Demon Hunters became one of Netflix's biggest hits ever. Songs from the film are on the Billboard Top 10, gaining airplay on national radio and streaming services. Toy companies have come calling to make merchandise. There's talk of sequels, spin-offs, and over two months since its initial release, it's on its way to being Netflix's most successful original movie of all time, live action or animated. All of which happened before this weekend. In Hollywood today, the traditional way of thinking is that a film being on streaming kills its box office prospects. If people can stream it at home, they will not go to the theaters. And there is surely data to back that up. Most people think the perfect formula is for something to be released exclusively in theaters, where it can generate great buzz and box office, which then drives interest towards the home release. A quadruple dip with excitement and publicity, ideally, driving new viewers to each format. It wasn't released on Netflix with a ton of publicity. And by the time, months later, the film got a larger theatrical release, it had permeated the culture to become less a first-run hit and almost a repertory movie. A movie that fans are so familiar with, they pay to see it in theaters just for the experience. Historically, those kinds of movies can be box office successes, but not always. But those movies had already been available at home for a long time. KPop Demon Hunters is generally thought of as a new title. But in terms of popularity and awareness, thanks to the incredible speed with which we consume content in 2025, it's already well established beyond its age. Twenty-six million watched KPop Demon Hunters over its ninth week of release from August 11 to 17 (which is the most recent data Netflix has released as of publication). Crudely, if you pretend each one of those people paid $10 to see the movie, that's $260 million, about what Spider-Man: No Way Home made in its opening weekend. The point being, months after release, people are still streaming the crap out of it in wild numbers. Would the film have made even close to that if it had gone the traditional route to theaters? Not in its ninth week, to be sure. Would kids of all ages have gone to theaters over and over to watch the movie in record numbers? But the fact that it had already become something everyone could enjoy certainly aided in this case. If a movie can debut on streaming first, find its audience, and then retroactively become a box office hit, all bets are off. No one wants to give something away for free if people are willing to pay for it. KPop Demon Hunters, as well as the new sing-along version, which played in theaters this weekend, is on Netflix.

Newegg is promoting one of the best CPU bargains of the year right now, featuring Intel's previous-generation Core i5-14600K discounted to historically low prices, combined with Intel's Gamer Days Bundle, worth $315 by itself. At Newegg, you can grab Intel's Core i5-14600K for just $189.99 right now as part of its shell shocker sale. Paired with the Core i5-14600K is Intel's Gamer Days bundle, which includes several games and apps: Battlefield 6 Phantom Edition, Assassin's Creed Shadows Digital Deluxe Edition, Canvid, XSplit Premium Suite, and Vegas Pro 365. The Intel Core i5-14600K is at an all-time low price. This 14-core processor has 6 P-cores and 8 E-cores with 20 threads. The Core i5-14600K is still one of the fastest gaming CPUs in Intel's arsenal, despite being a generation old. Intel's fumble with Arrow Lake-S has put the Core i5-14600K in the unusual spotlight of being Intel's fastest mid-range gaming chip across two generations. Newegg's combo is hard to ignore if you are in the market for a mid-range CPU for your next build or CPU upgrade. The Intel Gamer Days bundle is the cherry on top, even if you only plan to play Battlefield 6. There is so much content in the Gamer Days bundle that it's worth more than the CPU if you were going to buy it all. In fact, the Intel Gamer Days bundle is being promoted on several Intel products right now, including the ASRock Challenger Arc B570 going for $229 and the Core Ultra 5 245K (which also happens to have a $50 promo code).

He also submitted an unsolicited bid to take over OpenAI for $97.4 billion, which the company rejected. Musk posted anticompetitive allegations against OpenAI and Apple on X earlier this month, claiming that it's “impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.” The partnership between Apple and OpenAI was announced last June, with collaborative features expected to ship in December.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Though Black Mirror: Bandersnatch was removed from Netflix earlier this year as part of the streamer's pivot away from interactive programming, there may be yet another chance to choose Stefan Butler's '80s video game creation adventure anew. According to Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker, a comeback may be on the horizon. Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Brooker was asked about rumblings that Bandersnatch may return to Netflix soon, perhaps classified as a game this time around. Watch this space, things are brewing,” Brooker told THR. I think over time, all these things are going to slightly merge.” By “these things,” he seemingly means narrative programming and games, because he then went on to talk about “Plaything,” an episode from the most recent Black Mirror season. It's about Thronglets, a video game that aims to take over the world, and Netflix released a tie-in game to go with it. There are bespoke video clips you can unlock,” Brooker said. “Plaything” also ties back to Bandersnatch, with Will Poulter reprising his mad-genius character Colin Ritman. “Will Poulter showing up as a living Easter egg showed me that we can continue to break the format to bring back characters or revisit worlds,” Brooker said. “Bandersnatch was also executed seamlessly by the Netflix engineers. “I had a whole idea for an interactive sequel to Bandersnatch. The interactive form generally is something I wouldn't rule out for the future, because I'd have to be crazy to rule that out,” he said. Black Mirror seasons one through seven (but not, for now at least, the interactive special Bandersnatch) are streaming on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No matter what, a mobile design will lead to tradeoffs. First on the list for many was Elden Ring, and it didn't take long for the port to drive users mad. Numerous gamers started flooding social feeds with news that the game did not run well on Switch 2 in handheld mode. Nintendo Life and IGN, which had hands-on with the game, further fueled the cinders with claims of sub-30 frame rates in Elden Ring's open areas. Nintendo and developers FromSoftware did not allow anybody to take footage of the game being played. Don't worry, cause videos eventually leak through Nintendo's castle walls. YouTuber MDee14 broadcasted Elden Ring played on the Switch 2 in docked mode from Fan Expo Canada. Finally, on Sunday, a separate YouTuber dropped gameplay of Elden Ring in handheld mode, saying the frame rate was “awful,” though it's nearly impossible to judge merely through video. All players' anxieties stem from a single tweet by user EpicNNG on X. We simply don't know what the case will be until closer to release. Players have every right to be concerned they won't get as good an experience with their games as other consoles. However, so far most Switch 2 ports have proved playable. Other upcoming ports seem like they haven't faced these same performance dilemmas. Digital Foundry recorded gameplay of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade and called it “the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2.” Intergrade first hit the scene in 2021, and it seems the current version plays at least 40 fps on Nintendo's handheld, according to people who went hands-on at Gamescom. The current builds of Elden Ring on Steam Deck can hit around 40 fps with the settings dialed in, so it would only make sense the Switch 2 could at least achieve some level of playable frame rate. Developers at CD Projekt Red specifically worked directly with Nintendo on the port. A video by Digital Foundry shows how devs managed to get better frame rates by limiting unnecessary background detail and relying on Nvidia's DLSS upscaling. Which leads to the lingering question: if Square Enix and CD Projekt Red can craft quality handheld ports, why can't other developers do the same? The Switch 2's system on a chip, or SoC, was crafted in partnership with Nvidia. That T239 chip is built with eight ARM Cortex A78C cores. The fact these are ARM cores means porting games to the Switch 2 isn't as simple as it may seem. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are built using AMD-made x86 chips. That is an instruction set you see on most modern Intel and AMD processors for PCs. These chips are specifically designed for the system type itself, which helps reduce power consumption and save on battery life. Porting games from x86 to ARM isn't necessarily a massive undertaking, but it shows how much of a specific platform the Switch 2 can be. Developers need to understand the Switch 2's hardware and design for it. That puts even more onus on developers to work within the bounds of Nintendo's design, likely more than any other platform. If you could compare Switch 2 to other consoles, it has similar graphical capabilities just beyond the original PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nintendo's device in handheld mode will have to run at lower clock speeds and TDP, or thermal design power. This keeps the device from overheating or dying too quickly. At higher TDP, the Steam Deck may still be superior, as it should be for any device that can overclock to any degree. Inevitably, we will find better or worse examples of ports.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Cody, a co-owner of a retro and import video games retail business, remarked upon his surprise at booting up this particular Xbox 360 and finding “an error I've never seen before.” However, a Microsoft MVP has piped up to explain that the system's 17559 update removes any such restrictions. Repairing Xbox 360s today and found an error I've never seen before. Under the program, you would maintain monthly payments for a minimum term to eventually own your console, without further restrictions. According to an Xbox 360 era report published by GamesRadar, Microsoft launched the new easy payment schemes for wannabe console owners in Q4 2012. Under the agreement, purchasers would put down a modest initial sum, starting from $150. Then they would commit to “a contractual obligation for two years of Xbox Live membership, adding up to $360 by the end of the agreement.” Now, 13 years later, we are seeing what would happen. Perhaps people generally stuck to their obligations, as this ‘bad debt' message has stirred a lot of interest. Many commenters suggested that Cody ‘hack' the Xbox 360 to bypass any restrictions. Just two weeks ago, Modern Vintage Gamer (MVG) published a video on the Badupdate Exploit. The hack has now reached version 1.2, and is enhanced so that “Any Xbox 360 can now be hacked in less than one minute,” he explained. Latest update no longer honors that flag in the keyvault.August 25, 2025 Thankfully, no hacking shenanigans should be necessary to get Cody's Xbox 360 back into a fully enabled state. Eric Marsi, a Microsoft MVP, piped up to explain that “If you update it to 17559, the lock will go away.” Marsi later explained that this update for the 360, which was released in Nov 2019, cuts Microsoft's losses on any blocked consoles, as it no longer honors the rental program flag in the keyvault.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A majority of school districts in Washington state will have policies in place this school year to limit students' use of cellphones and other devices such as smart watches. “Our educators, parents, and families are seeing, on a daily basis, how students' learning is disrupted — repeatedly — by their smart devices,” State Superintendent Chris Reykdal said in a news release. “As an education system, we have a responsibility to protect the learning environment, removing disruptions and ensuring our policies are updated regularly to address emerging needs.” Seattle Public Schools, the largest K-12 school system in Washington state, previously told GeekWire that it leaves it to school administrators to set campus policies, and in May a spokesperson said the district was “evaluating whether a district wide ‘away for the day' cellphone policy is necessary. Two public middle schools in Seattle implemented restrictions last year — Hamilton International and Robert Eagle Staff both introduced Yondr pouches, which allow students to lock away their phones, limiting their use throughout school hours. In a University of Washington study on the effect of cellphone policies, teachers reported feeling less stressed and said they're more effective in the classroom without phone-related disruptions. Students said there were academic improvements when phone use was curbed, but most did not report emotional and mental-health benefits. Tina Koteck signed an executive order this summer prohibiting cellphone use during school hours in the state's K-12 public schools. “Our young people are navigating a deeply connected online world where they have 24/7 access right at their fingertips,” Reykdal said last week. “There are benefits to these powerful technologies if used responsibly. Studies have found negative impacts on mental health, learning, sleep, and more. I'm proud of our school district leaders who are tackling this problem head-on.” Public schools leader urges Washington state districts to devise rules limiting smartphone use Proposed law would restrict phone usage in Washington public schools Petition urges Seattle Public Schools leaders to restrict students' use of smartphones</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brave and Guardio have revealed serious vulnerabilities in the AI-powered Comet browser. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Perplexity said that Comet "transforms how businesses interact with the internet" by "combining enterprise-grade security, powerful AI capabilities, and intuitive user experiences." That alone should have been enough to make users wary about the browser's security. It didn't take long to prove those suspicions correct. "This allows attackers to embed indirect prompt injection payloads that the AI will execute as commands." Brave demonstrated the potential impact of this vulnerability by embedding a malicious command in a Reddit post that could take over a Comet user's Perplexity account if they asked the browser to summarize the web page. Usually, the biggest threat from spending too much time on social platforms is brain rot, yet trying to avoid that with Comet's summarization features posed even greater risks. "This attack presents significant challenges to existing Web security mechanisms," Brave said. "When an AI assistant follows malicious instructions from untrusted webpage content, traditional protections such as same-origin policy (SOP) or cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) are all effectively useless. The AI operates with the user's full privileges across authenticated sessions, providing potential access to banking accounts, corporate systems, private emails, cloud storage, and other services." It also showed that Comet would scan an obvious phishing email, visit the malicious website, and prompt its user for their banking account credentials without any indication that something might be amiss. Without strong AI guardrails, that decision is essentially a coin toss - and when your security is left to chance, it's only a matter of time before it lands on the wrong side." Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Let's be clear: Comet is currently limited to Perplexity's Pro and Enterprise Pro customers, meaning people and businesses pay for access to the browser. In return, they have received a browser riddled with vulnerabilities independently discovered by two organizations that benefited more from disclosing them to the company and the public than they would have from exploiting the flaws themselves. It should also be said that Perplexity has bid more than twice its current valuation for Google's Chrome browser. Comet is already built on top of Chromium, so it's not trying to buy a foundation for its AI browser; it's specifically looking to buy Chrome's existing market share. Given the findings from Brave, Guardio, and who-knows-who-else, that should be a terrifying prospect for anyone still using Chrome to browse the web.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Many modern soundbar brands prefer to sell high-priced single bars, with add-on speakers available for an additional fee. LG provides a subwoofer, dual surrounds, and LG's unique mix of five (not four) height channels to put you in the center of the action for 3D sound formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X from the get-go. It's perhaps no coincidence that the S95's biggest rival, Samsung's 11.1.4-channel Q990, has also raised its price in recent years, keeping LG's slightly less elaborate 9.1.5-channel setup the more affordable option at full price. I still prefer Samsung's warmer, more musical sound signature, but the S95AR is a thrilling performer that offers similar (if not better) value, along with exclusive features for owners of newer LG TVs. If you're looking for a one-stop setup that gets you close to a multi-component home theater solution, but with much less hassle, the S95AR is among the best soundbars around. For the second time in two products from LG, the S95AR landed on my doorstep in a somewhat abused state, with notable dents to its metallic acoustic grille. The system seemed otherwise no worse for wear, and while its 50-inch width pushes to the edges of midsize consoles, its height of less than 3 inches fits neatly below most TVs. Setup was mostly uneventful, allowing me to get it connected and spinning sound through the four-piece system in short order. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I did not do this, and the left rear surround wouldn't connect. Unplugging everything and reconnecting it in order fixed things (or perhaps it was just the power cycling), and I had no other connection issues over several weeks. LG's ThinQ app has grown up over the years, now standing as a capable and mostly stable control center for all software setup and settings. The app found the bar nearly instantly and made it easy to connect to my network, futz with speaker channel levels, and perform LG's AI Calibration that tunes the soundbar to your space. You can easily change inputs or sound modes and “Effects” from Music and Cinema modes to Night mode for softening the bass when the kids (or neighbors) are tucked in. There's also a separate remote for many of these controls, but due to the bar's lack of any real visual display, using it for anything more than a quick volume adjustment or input switch is a hassle, as you're relying on voice cues. That could be helpful for those with accessibility issues, but otherwise, the app is your interface. Nestled within the main bar are front, left, and center channels that handle the majority of your music and TV content, dual side-firing drivers to bounce sound off your walls, and a trio of “height” channels to bounce effects off your ceiling, including LG's unique center height channel for enhanced immersion with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X mixes. You'll get three more channels in each football-sized surround speaker, including front, side, and height channels, and an 8-inch side-firing subwoofer. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. At the main bar's back side, you'll find an optical port (good for connecting legacy audio devices and older TVs) and dual HDMI ports, one of which connects the system to any modern TV over HDMI eARC/ARC. You'll want to choose HDMI over the optical port, as it's necessary for high-end formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and should also let you control power and volume on the bar with your TV remote. I was pleased to find that the S95AR's spare HDMI port offers high-bandwidth pass-through for gaming features like VRR at up to 120 Hz, so serious gamers won't lose a TV input. If you own one of LG's best TVs from the past few years, you may also be able to connect the soundbar wirelessly over LG's WowCast system, but I was unable to get this to work with my LG B5 review model—the TV could see the bar and attempted to connect, but would ultimately just spin out. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. WowCast aside, I wish the S95AR offered one more HDMI input, especially since LG's 2025 TVs don't support DTS decoding, even though its soundbars do. An abundance of streaming options includes AirPlay and Google Cast, as well as Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, and Bluetooth, covering nearly every angle. Amazon Alexa is supported with a third-party device, but there's no built-in smart assistant. LG TV exclusives include the previously mentioned WowCast, Wow Interface for controlling some settings directly from the TV, and Wow Orchestra for using LG TV speakers and the soundbar in tandem. I found myself tweaking the surround sound channels a bit, especially when faced with loud effects like the almost invasive babbling brooks of my latest gaming obsession, Ghost of Tsushima. Otherwise, the system is remarkably hands-off by default, offering poise and balance between registers and seamless movement between its multitude of speakers. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The height channels were the biggest standouts, providing striking overhead effects in Dolby Atmos demo scenes that translated to thrilling cinematics in regular mixes. The system continued to impress over several days of testing, offering clear and detailed effects, rich symphonic soundtracks, and decisive dialog in everything from action flicks to sitcoms, without the need for the available Clear Voice mode. The bass was sometimes less articulate than I'd hoped for, especially with music streaming where the sub had trouble keeping up with tricky bass lines or drum beats. The Music mode is much more spacious for stereo playback, while AI Sound Pro adds some fun virtualization, particularly successful with complex electronic mixes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In their research, they had monitored the social media platform Discord and found a server with approximately 5,000 children actively and openly discussing suicide. These conversations were unfolding in a digital space with virtually no adult supervision — a dark corner of the internet where despair was festering among the generation expected to build our future. While parents of previous generations worried about what their kids were doing at the park, today's parents must contend with a borderless, anonymous digital world that operates 24/7. Platforms like Discord are designed for community, but without vigilant oversight, they can become echo chambers for the most dangerous aspects of adolescent angst. We are allowing our children to be raised by algorithms and anonymous peers in environments we don't understand and can't control. Before we can even begin to prepare them for a future shaped by AI, we must first pull them back from the digital abyss by re-engaging in their online lives, establishing firm boundaries, and fostering open communication about the dangers they face online. The curriculum is focused on rote memorization and standardized testing—skills that AI can already perform better than any human. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this month revealed that 71% of Americans are concerned that AI will lead to too many people losing jobs, yet our schools continue to guide students down career paths that may not exist by the time they graduate. We are preparing them for a world of predictable, linear careers, while the reality they will face is one of constant change and disruption. This trend leads to a deeply concerning cultural shift. Surveys of Gen Zs and millennials consistently show a deep desire for purpose-driven work and a healthy work-life balance — things the current system seems ill-equipped to provide. We need a radical overhaul of our education system, one that shifts the focus from what AI can do to what it can't. First, we must prioritize critical thinking and complex problem-solving. AI itself can be a powerful tool in this process. Educators can leverage AI as a Socratic partner for students, a tireless tutor that can challenge their assumptions, ask probing questions, and force them to defend their reasoning. As one report notes, schools must integrate these “soft skills” into the core curriculum. The world awaiting our children is complex and dynamic. Immersive simulations can provide a safe and controlled environment for them to practice making difficult decisions with real-time feedback. Finally, we need to teach adaptability and lifelong learning. The idea of learning a single trade for life is dead. Education must instill a “growth mindset,” teaching students how to learn, unlearn, and relearn continuously. Achieving that goal requires embracing new, personalized learning technologies and creating a system that supports individuals throughout their entire careers, not just for the first 18 years. We are standing by as a generation grows up unsupervised online and unprepared for the profound economic and social shifts that AI will bring. It demands that parents reassert their role as guides in both the real and digital worlds. It requires that our education system shed its industrial-age skin and transform to cultivate the skills that will matter most in the coming century. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold combines large dual screens with AI-powered features. Yet, after its reveal last week, the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold has cleared that bar with room to spare, cementing its place as this week's standout product. This phone isn't just an iterative update; it's a confident stride forward that perfects the phone/tablet hybrid, wrapping bleeding-edge AI and photography into a stunningly refined package. New tools like “Camera Coach” provide real-time suggestions to improve your photo composition, while “Magic Cue” proactively surfaces information from your apps when you need it. This year's launch event in New York was the most Apple-like yet — a polished, confident presentation that showcased not just a phone but an entire ecosystem. This polish addresses one of the few remaining hardware gaps, leaving the core reasons users prefer Pixel phones over their Apple alternatives shining brighter than ever. It comes down to the software experience and intelligent assistance. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003. He has an MBA in human resources, marketing and computer science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shortly after US president Donald Trump hung up a call with Russia's Vladimir Putin this spring, an obscure shortwave radio channel, broadcasting from a military base somewhere in Russia, sprang to life. Through a fog of static, at 4625 kHz on the shortwave dial, a man's voice spoke in monotone: “Nikolai, Zhenya, Tatiana, Ivan.” He repeats the message—spelled out in the Russian phonetic alphabet—followed by a series of numbers and letters. The whole message reads: “NZhTI 01263 BOLTANKA 4430 9529.” What it means is anyone's guess, but lots of people were guessing. This radio station, dubbed UVB-76, has spent much of 2025 broadcasting cryptic messages, strange music, and pirate interruptions. Now, Moscow's network of propagandists and warmongers are suddenly fascinated by this obscure channel. UVB-76's real purpose is almost certainly innocuous and mundane. But in recent weeks, Moscow has capitalized on the eerie fixation with the channel to stoke fears of nuclear armageddon. Because shortwave broadcasts can traverse huge distances, it became a favorite medium for soldiers and spies. Tune in to the right frequency, and you could hear a KGB officer reading out coded messages for their undercover operatives in America, a Cuban intelligence officer relaying a message to Moscow, or a CIA asset in eastern Europe trying to get in touch with Langley. At the same time, however, amateur radio fans began congregating online, and they scoured for spy stations on the radio dial. A perpetual tone, an incessant buzzing, was thought to be a way for the operator to reserve the frequency, even when it wasn't actively being used. Try as they might, listeners never decoded those messages. For years, the station's main signal emanated from a military outpost some 50 miles north of Moscow. When urban explorers reached the site in 2011, they found it abandoned—but forgotten radio equipment and log books suggested that it had once been the headquarters of UVB-76. (“In general, it was boring,” the explorers wrote.) Russian broadcaster RT also visited the site that year, reporting that the site was, most likely, just a mundane part of Russia's military communication apparatus. In the years since, an online community has sprung up across YouTube, Reddit, X, VKontakte, and across multiple dedicated podcasts and online forums. Its fanbase stretches across history buffs, ham radio operators, and those obsessed with creepypasta. A dedicated site, Priyom.org, sprang up to meticulously catalog UVB-76's many mysterious messages. In at least one case, a frequency hijacker seemed to communicate with UVB-76's operator. A military journal obliquely references the site as part of a program to maintain communication between Russia's various military assets, even amid warfare. “Its main goal is indeed to serve the Russian strategic military radio network,” Goldmanis says. Given Russia's huge territory, Goldmanis says, shortwave networks like UVB-76 are useful for connecting far-flung outposts. “This is a normal peacetime operation,” he says. It's impossible to say whether the channel has an axillary purpose, as the Russian military is understandably secretive about its communication systems. This includes the unsubstantiated idea that UVB-76 was a central part of Moscow's nuclear failsafe. After a quiet month, the station delivered 24 transmissions in a single day—a record, according to its fan club on Russian social media network VK. Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti published what appears to be its first-ever article on UVB-76, summarizing the new broadcasts and explaining to its readers that “it is called a ‘Doomsday Station' because it is believed to have been allegedly created as part of the Dead Hand system.” Since early this year, RIA-Novosti has published roughly one story per week on UVB-76, suggesting its coded messages are related to missile strikes on Iran, the war in Ukraine, and negotiations with Trump. RT, which had once pooh-poohed the idea that UVB-76 was part of Moscow's nuclear deterrence, began regularly posting its broadcasts on X, writing in April that the station often broadcasts “coded alerts pre-major events”—particularly around phone calls between Trump and Putin—and suggesting that it operates as a “nuke failsafe.” “In the time of tension between Russia and the West,” Goldmanis says, “such articles are ideal for mounting tension and fear.” There is some irony in the fact that Russians seem to be spooking themselves with tales of their own military communications network, but he argues that it speaks to a deeper fear in Russia: “Fear of losing the war, fear of the state collapse, fear of Western nuclear action, fear of their own government and military.” All of this domestic shadowboxing, in turn, drove international headlines. The British tabloid The Sun proclaimed that Russia's “doomsday radio station” had transmitted its “cryptic ‘nuke' code.” Belgium's Het Laatste Nieuws reported that the radio messages had caused “heightened alertness among military analysts worldwide.” Politika, a Serbian daily newspaper, penned a lengthy article that claimed that UVB-76 “put fear in the hearts of NATO generals and the Pentagon,” which have been powerless to crack its code. (That article was republished in Russian by RT's foreign translation service.) Amid this new attention, Moscow's communications regulator Roskomnadzor—responsible for monitoring, regulating, and censoring all mass media, including both shortwave radio and the internet—commented on UVB-76 for the first time. A spokesperson for the agency didn't say much, telling RT that information about the frequency and its purpose “is not publicly available.” On May 23, an operator read out the code “БЕЗЗЛОБИЕ,” roughly translated to “the absence of malice,” and “ХРЮКОСТЯГ,” or “oink,” followed by a series of numbers. This message, in particular, caught the attention of Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev has served as both president and prime minister of Russia and now serves on the hawkish Security Council of Russia as deputy chairman. “Doomsday Radio: May's ‘lack of malice' has been replaced by a fierce ‘oink,'” Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel. Invoking a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks that had roiled Moscow, Medvedev levied thematic insults against the Ukrainians and their backers in Europe: “Pigs,” “hogs,” and “boars.” He ended the post: “Password: ‘БЕЗЗЛОБИЕ.' Coincidental or intentional, Russia's new fascination with UVB-76 comes just as it attempts to ratchet up fear of nuclear armageddon. Such a response could effectively end life on Earth. When those films were released, in 1964, Moscow had no such program. It would take another two decades before the USSR completed its response system, codename Perimeter. Perimeter, housed in a deep bunker in the Ural mountains, was connected to a series of inputs: Seismic and radiation sensors, which monitored for warhead impacts on Soviet soil; and radio links back to the Kremlin. Perimeter was revealed in a 1993 op-ed in The New York Times by Bruce G. Blair, an American nuclear expert who had been handed details of the program by a Soviet scientist. “Perimeter exists, and it was a real system that was put on combat duty shortly after Mikael Gorbachev took office in 1985.” Hoffman, who based his book on extensive interviews with those familiar with the program, says there is good evidence that Perimeter was maintained, though switched off, after the end of the Cold War. Putin's ascent to the presidency, however, marked a “gray zone,” he says. In recent years, Russian commanders have said that the system remains operational, and Moscow has upgraded the command bunker where Perimeter was based. It's particularly conspicuous because, based on everything we know about Perimeter, there's no way UVB-76 has any role in launching nuclear weapons. Goldmanis concedes that UVB-76 could certainly be useful if a nuclear strike destroys Russia's communications network, but the idea that it could automatically order missile launches is “neither logical nor technically possible,” he says. So there is no real mystery about UVB-76's role in Russia's Perimeter system. Since its inception, the Kremlin has actually been notoriously mum about Perimeter—odd, because part of the utility of such a weapon is its power to deter a first strike. “It is absolutely a completely absurd situation,” Hoffman says. The president fired off a Truth Social post calling India and Russia “dead economies” and excoriating Medvedev to “watch his words.” That taboo generally extended to threats of nuclear warfare as well. Between 2022 and 2023, the Center for Strategic and International Studies tracked nearly 200 instances where Russian officials issued threats around the use of nuclear weapons, particularly as it tried to dissuade Western support for the Ukrainian government amid its ill-fated invasion. That culminated in changes to the Russian nuclear doctrine last year. The new orders, approved by Putin, allow Moscow to launch a nuclear strike in response to certain large-scale conventional attacks on Russian territory. It increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, misperception, and miscalculation. While UVB-76 continued to gurgle out messages over the past week, amid an extraordinary meeting in Alaska between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, speculation about its true purpose has noticeably quieted on pro-Kremlin channels. Hoffman is skeptical that this most recent fascination with UVB-76 and Perimeter is anything more than marginal, given that Putin himself has already begun the nuclear saber-rattling. Still, Hoffman says, “the whole lore of the Dead Hand is that it's a monster out of control.” It's not true, of course—“it was built as a retaliatory system,” he notes, “as a second strike”—but the idea of the Russian doomsday machine continues to loom large. “The Dead Hand is also a great myth,” he says. It may be based on a real system, but secrecy breeds mystery. “No one can be sure, as they can't access it.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Sun's most complex mysteries could soon be solved thanks to artificial intelligence. Having been trained on large datasets of solar activity, this AI tool aims to deepen humanity's understanding of solar weather and accurately predict solar flares—bursts of electromagnetic radiation emitted by our star that threaten both astronauts in orbit and communications infrastructure on Earth. Surya was trained with nine years of data collected by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), an instrument that has orbited the sun since 2010, taking high-resolution images every 12 seconds. It also takes precise measurements of the sun's magnetic field—essential data for understanding how energy moves through the star, and for predicting solar storms. Historically, interpreting this vast amount of diverse and complex data has been a challenge for heliophysicists. To address this challenge, IBM says that Surya's developers used the SDO data to create a digital twin of the sun—a dynamic virtual replica of the star that is updated when new data is captured, and which can be manipulated and more easily studied. Surya also proved to be effective in various predictive functions, including predicting flare activity and solar wind speed. According to IBM, traditional prediction models can only predict a flare one hour in advance based on signals detected in specific regions of the sun. In contrast, “Surya provided a two-hour lead by using visual information. “By developing a foundation model trained on NASA's heliophysics data, we're making it easier to analyze the complexities of the sun's behavior with unprecedented speed and precision,” said Kevin Murphy, NASA's director of data science, in a statement. “This model empowers broader understanding of how solar activity impacts critical systems and technologies that we all rely on here on Earth.” The risk posed by abnormal solar activity is not minor. A major solar storm could directly affect global telecommunications, collapse electrical grids, and disturb GPS navigation, satellite operations, internet connections, and radio transmissions. “We want to give Earth the longest lead time possible. Our hope is that the model has learned all the critical processes behind our star's evolution through time so that we can extract actionable insights.” This story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.
