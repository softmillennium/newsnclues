                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The GOP-led committee issued the subpoena to Epstein's estate Monday, demanding a slew of documents that include the so-called “birthday book” – a reported collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday that included a note bearing President Donald Trump's name. Trump has repeatedly denied writing the letter and sued The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on it, for defamation. “Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged ‘birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,” GOP Chairman James Comer wrote in a letter to Epstein's estate. The committee is also seeking Epstein's will, all non-disclosure agreements executed by him, his financial documents and “any document or record that could be reasonably construed to be a potential list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking” facilitated by Epstein. “It is our understanding that the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is in custody and control of documents that may further the Committee's investigation and legislative goals. “The Epstein Estate received a subpoena this afternoon from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; we are reviewing it. As the Co-Executors have always said, they will comply with all lawful process in this matter, and that includes the Committee's subpoena,” said Daniel Weiner of the law firm Hughes Hubbard and Reed. The Kentucky Republican also announced that the committee would sit down with Alexander Acosta, who served as secretary of the Department of Labor during Trump's first term, for a transcribed interview. During his time as US attorney in Florida, Acosta oversaw a 2008 plea deal with Epstein. Acosta had been widely criticized during Trump's first term for that plea agreement. In 2019, then-Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for Acosta's resignation after accusing him of having “cut Epstein a sweetheart deal.” But Democrats on that panel have said only about “3 percent” have new information, including flight logs from the Customs and Border Protection agency on the location of Epstein's former plane. Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement, “After weeks of pressure from Oversight Democrats, Chairman Comer has finally issued a subpoena for Jeffrey Epstein's infamous birthday book, which contains critical information about Epstein's social network—and has agreed to hear testimony from Alex Acosta. These are important steps forward to get long-overdue answers about sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lil Nas X was charged Monday with four felonies after police say he charged at them when they confronted him for walking naked down a Los Angeles street last week. Prosecutors charged the musician, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one felony count of resisting an executive officer, the District Attorney's Office said. He is set to be arraigned later Monday. His representatives have not responded to requests for comment. Police said officers found the 26-year-old walking naked on Ventura Boulevard, a major thoroughfare in the Studio City neighborhood, shortly before 6 a.m. Friday, They say he charged at the officers when confronted and was arrested. Police, suspecting a possible overdose, took him to a hospital where he spent several hours before being taken to jail, where he has remained since. The charges were first reported by TMZ. The rapper and singer from Atlanta is best known for his huge hit from 2018, “Old Town Road,” which merged country and hip-hop. It spent a record 19 weeks at No. 2 on the Billboard album chart and was nominated for a Grammy for album of the year.</p>

Big banks across the world are substantially increasing their financing of the fossil fuel industry, including for the industry's expansion during a time of intensifying climate crisis, all while pulling back from previously stated climate commitments. These are among the key highlights of the most recent Banking on Climate Chaos report, which found that the 65 biggest banks globally committed a whopping $869 billion to companies conducting business in fossil fuels in 2024, representing a huge $162 billion increase from 2023. “These financial flows reflect the policy retreat of banks abandoning climate goals for short-term profits,” Campaign Director for the Climate and Energy Program at Rainforest Action Network Dianne Enriquez told Truthout. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Banking on Climate Chaos, co-authored by several organizations including Rainforest Action Network, Oil Change International, Indigenous Environmental Network, and Sierra Club, is an authoritative annual study — endorsed by hundreds of organizations across the world — of how banks finance the fossil fuel industry. The report also shows that U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo dominated the heights of fossil fuel financing. A Truthout analysis reveals that the CEOs of the top six U.S. banks that are financing fossil fuels together made over a half-billion dollars from 2022 to 2024. CEO pay is astronomically larger than the average incomes of communities most impacted by their fossil fuel financing. “These billion-dollar industries are making money off of our backs while killing us,” Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which endorsed the report, told Truthout. The most notable finding in the new report is that, during 2024, global banks “significantly increased their fossil fuel financing, including ramping up finance for fossil fuel expansion,” with the 65 biggest banks globally committing $429 billion to companies expanding fossil fuel production and infrastructure in 2024. “Global banks continue to fuel the climate crisis at an alarming scale,” Jessye Waxman, Sustainable Finance Campaign Advisor for the Sierra Club, told Truthout. This comes amid intensifying climate chaos and the desperate need to vastly ramp down fossil fuel production, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has called for “a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use” without delay. banks are leading this surge,” said Waxman, who noted that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo alone “collectively represent over 21 percent of the total global fossil fuel financing covered in the report.” The report includes case studies on the banking behind contested companies and projects worldwide, such as Mozambique LNG and JSW Steel in India. Banking on Climate Chaos also contains findings on howbanks finance fossil fuel corporations — findings that support the claim that banks have been “greenwashing” themselves by giving lip service to climate concerns even as they continue to bankroll climate catastrophe. This corporate-level financing increased by nearly $117 billion from 2023 to 2024. In other words, while banks have restricted direct financing of dirty fossil fuel projects that could garner bad publicity, they've simultaneously increased direct, unhindered financing to the corporationsdoing business in fossil fuels. “Banks' corporate financing loophole is a textbook case of greenwashing,” said Sierra Club's Waxman, noting that the loophole “gives fossil fuel companies unrestricted capital to pursue harmful expansion.” All this adds weight to accusations of greenwashing: Banks are making face-saving gestures even as they continue to bolster the corporate coffers of the fossil fuel industry. Meanwhile, the report also highlights many banks' rapid flight from the net-zero “commitments” that they so adamantly committed themselves to just a few years ago. Leading fossil fuel financiers like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo had previously celebrated their self-proclaimed climate concerns by joining the NZBA. But in the face of rising opportunities to capitalize on fossil fuel expansion — from corporate mergers and expanded drilling practices to a new oil-friendly Trump administration — these banks and many more have quit the NZBA entirely. U.S. lawmakers have suggested that banks like JPMorgan Chase have misled the public and investors as it backed away from its purported climate commitments. Rather, banks are active agents maneuvering to keep bankrolling fossil fuels corporations, and they have revealed their climate commitments to be exceedingly thin. Notably, this CEO compensation is astronomically higher than the per capita incomes of communities most impacted by the fossil fuel projects overseen by companies that their banks are financing. As Truthout previously reported, local organizers like the Vessel Project's Ozane are resisting the construction of facilities like Venture Global's huge new LNG export terminal, Calcasieu Pass 2. Banking on Climate Chaos notes that Venture Global LNG's top two bankers in 2024 were Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847. This means Dimon took in 1,087 times the per capita income of a Lake Charles resident last year. (It's worth noting that while Morgan Stanley's April 2025 proxy statement reported Pick's 2024 compensation at $24,881,032, an earlier February 2025 filing said his 2024 compensation was set as $34 million, which would be 948 times the income of an average Lake Charles resident). Ozane called Jamie Dimon's 2024 compensation of $39 million “staggering,” especially given that it was “based off investments in fossil fuel projects that are not only killing the people in my community, but harming this entire world.” “It highlights the troubling disconnect between the financial elite like Jamie Dimon and everyday people like myself and my community members,” she said. “It's time for these institutions to align their practices with the urgent need for climate action and the urgent need to put people before profit,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, experts have stressed there is a long way to go before pig lungs can be used in patients. “These lungs are not able to independently sustain a patient,” he added. Andrew Fisher, a professor of respiratory transplant medicine at Newcastle University, agreed. “This work is very welcome in furthering our understanding, but it marks an incremental step forward. There is much more work required and we are not on the dawn of an era of lung xenotransplantation using pig lungs,” he said. Xenotransplantation has become a hot area of research in recent years, with the heart, kidneys and liver among the organs that have been transplanted into humans from pigs. Studies are often initially carried out on brain dead human recipients before, in some cases, being used in living patients. While there have been only a handful of living recipients, many have died within weeks or months of such surgery, albeit not necessarily from complications relating to the transplant. But experts say xenotransplantation using lungs is particularly tricky. “So the immune system in the lung is very sensitive and very active, which means when you're dealing with organ transplantation, where you know you don't want the immune system to be very active, it poses extra challenges.” Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in China reported how they transplanted the left lung from a Chinese Bama Xiang donor pig with six genetic modifications into a 39-year-old brain dead male recipient. However, 24 hours after transplantation the lung showed signs of fluid accumulation and damage, possibly initially due to transplant-related inflammation. And despite the recipient being given powerful immunosuppressive medication, the transplanted organ was progressively attacked by antibodies, resulting in significant damage over time. “Continued efforts are needed to optimise immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase,” they wrote. Friend said other approaches to increasing the availability of organs were being investigated, including remodelling donor organs using stem cells. Some research groups are also exploring the possibility of growing humanised organs inside pigs or sheep. Fisher added that while xenotransplantation for lungs held promise, another promising avenue was to treat human donor lungs deemed to be unsuitable for transplantation so they could be used. “If we get that right, that's something can be implemented within months, and certainly in years could be making very big differences,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows. In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. “CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” she added. A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells. “All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.” If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially. While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills. “This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested. “I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours. “Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed' currently.” Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit. Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after. “There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said. “Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves. “It's not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. “I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.” Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized. The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: “I'm so overwhelmed.” On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision. In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development. Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including one founded by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes. “How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked in an email. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. Another CDC official said they've had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS. “We're providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.” The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is no evidence that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications. In another interview, Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News. Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. “I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua. Then another child in West Texas died of measles. In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn't see the need to confirm it.” A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine aims to secure at least $1 billion a month from its allies to purchase American-made weapons as it fights off Russia's ongoing invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 25. Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Zelensky said Norway had joined NATO's Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, which allows participating nations to buy weapons from the United States. "Our goal is to fill this program with no less than $1 billion every month," Zelensky said. "We also discussed our domestic drone production and joint opportunities with partners. Investments now can help not only physically but also force Russia to end this war." Zelensky added that more Ukrainian-made drones for air defense and long-range strikes would increase pressure on Moscow, as it continues to disregard calls for a ceasefire. Ukraine's request comes as Kyiv seeks to anchor long-term U.S. security guarantees through a major arms procurement deal. Zelensky said on Aug. 18, Ukraine had proposed buying $90 billion worth of U.S. weapons — financed largely by European partners — as the second pillar of its security framework, alongside building a strong domestic army and expanding drone production. Ukraine has expanded drone production across all domains — air, land, and sea — since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. We cannot provide any administrative or social services there," Andriy Besedin, head of the Kupiansk military-civil administration, said. During his Aug. 25 speech, Trump made contradictory statements about the possibility of ending Russia's war against Ukraine. "I can't imagine a better gift for (Russia's President Vladimir) Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet," Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said. "We also discussed our domestic drone production and joint opportunities with partners. Investments now can help not only physically but also force Russia to end this war," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "By taking part in a festival that brings together (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's supporters and mouthpieces, Allen is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine every day for 11 years," Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said. The move underscores Norway's growing role in supporting Ukraine's defense as Western partners move closer to finalizing security guarantees amid a push to organize a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow. "We would like to understand from the American side whether the Russians are ready — and in what format — for a bilateral, and eventually trilateral, meeting," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. But another recent announcement may make the "Long Neptune" slightly redundant.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's late announcement left operators with ‘extremely limited timeframe to get prepared' Postal services across Europe have suspended most parcel shipments to the US, citing widespread uncertainty about the impact of new import tariffs announced by Donald Trump. France's La Poste on Monday joined other operators, including Germany's Deutsche Post, Spain's Correos, Poste Italiane and the Belgian, Swedish and Danish postal services, which all halted a majority of US-bound shipments over the weekend. A total of 1.36bn packages were sent last year under the so-called “de minimis” exemption, containing goods worth $64.6bn, according to US Customs, but such parcels will now face a 15% tariff – the same rate as most other imports from the EU. Analysts have said that the regulatory changes, if they are maintained, are likely to have a considerable impact, particularly on small and medium-sized European companies exporting lower-value goods to the US. European postal services said they would continue to ship letters and parcels sent by individuals containing gifts worth less than €100, but warned that these would be subject to extra checks to prevent the service being used for commercial goods. “Key questions remain, particularly regarding who will have to pay the tariffs and how, what additional data will be required, and how data will be transmitted to US Customs,” said DHL, Europe's largest logistics company, which owns Deutsche Post. La Poste, which sends 1.6m packages on average to the US each year, 80% of them from businesses and 20% from individuals, said the new rules had been confirmed by US authorities only on 15 August. The late announcement had left European postal services with “an extremely limited timeframe to get prepared. Poste Italiane said it had been “forced to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing merchandise destined for the US”. PostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no practical solutions could be found before 29 August, it was likely that all its members would suspend the bulk of parcel shipments to the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two First Nations have formed a joint partnership with a transport company to purchase the Port of Stewart bulk terminal on the Portland Canal that separates British Columbia and Alaska. First Nations Bank sells almost 9-per-cent equity stake to meet growing demand for business loans Opinion: If Canada is seeking an ideal nation-building project, it should invest in First Nations infrastructure The three equal partners said the deep-sea terminal's primary purpose is transporting critical minerals such as copper concentrate to market from sources including Newmont's Brucejack and Red Chris mines in Nisga'a and Tahltan territories. Premier David Eby saying the joint venture furthers reconciliation while creating jobs and “demonstrating how British Columbia will become Canada's new economic engine.” The partnership between the Nisga'a Nation, Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership and Arrow Transportation creates a new entity called the Portland Canal Holdings Limited Partnership that is also launching a new transportation business by consolidating two regional trucking operations. is home to more than half of the province's exploration and mining sector. Arrow's executive vice-president, Tim Bell, said that consolidating the terminal and its trucking operations creates an integrated supply chain, and the project reflects a commitment “to working with Indigenous communities as equal stakeholders.” The statement says the terminal has six full-time employees and handles about 260,000 tonnes of copper and gold concentrate annually, operating at 50 per cent of rated capacity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Aug. 25 condemned American director Woody Allen's participation in the Moscow International Film Week, calling it "a disgrace" amid Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. "By taking part in a festival that brings together (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's supporters and mouthpieces, Allen is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine every day for 11 years," it added. Russian media reported that on Aug. 24, Allen appeared via videoconference at the festival, where he discussed the future of cinema in light of artificial intelligence and expressed admiration for Russian film. The ministry emphasized that "culture should never be used to whitewash crimes or serve as a tool of propaganda." Allen, 89, is best known for films such as Annie Hall and Manhattan and has been one of the most prominent figures in American independent cinema for decades. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. "I can't imagine a better gift for (Russia's President Vladimir) Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet," Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poland will treat Ukrainians who commit crimes in the country the same way it does with other nationalities that disrupt public order – by deporting them, Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski said. "If anyone violates our laws, they must accept that they will no longer be able to stay here, regardless of their nationality," Kierwinski stated at a ministry meeting broadcast on the Interior Ministry's social media accounts. At the same meeting, Border Guard chief Robert Bagan reported that 57 Ukrainians and six Belarusians were subject to deportation following riots at a concert by singer Max Korzh in Warsaw. Of these, 13 people have already been forcibly removed from Poland, while ten left voluntarily. In total, 30 individuals were banned from entering the Schengen area. The unrest took place on August 9 during Korzh's concert at Warsaw's National Stadium, attended by 60,000 people. Disorder began when some audience members attempted to break through barriers separating the stands from the stage area, leading to scuffles with security guards. Videos and photos later circulated on social media showing a group of young people waving the red-and-black flag of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and its military wing - the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, both banned in Russia. Polish media widely covered the incident, and opposition as well as far-right politicians strongly condemned it, demanding criminal liability for those involved or their conscription into Ukraine's armed forces. Following the concert, more than 100 people were detained, and deportation proceedings were initiated against 63 Ukrainian and Belarusian citizens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Knix founder Joanna Griffiths in the Soho neighborhood of New York, home to the underwear and apparel company's only U.S. store. New York has the highest concentration of online customers for Knix.Kellyann Petry/The Globe and Mail When Canadian underwear and apparel brand Knix Wear Inc. opened the doors of its first store in New York this month, the company was looking for a bit of a do-over. It was not the first time the retailer - which designs and manufactures intimates, including its signature leak-proof underwear, as well as swimwear and clothing - had attempted to establish a brick-and-mortar presence south of the border. It eventually exited those locations, which underperformed for various reasons. “I would say in hindsight, we bit off more than we could chew, to be honest,” said founder and president Joanna Griffiths. But she also knew that Knix's next phase of growth would require establishing a greater foothold in the world's largest consumer market. Podcast: How Knix founder Joanna Griffiths built an underwear empire in a room full of naysayers (Knix is sold at stores such as Holt Renfrew and Sporting Life, and it also has a partnership with Costco.) Knix will have 20 locations in Canada by the end of this year, with another 8 to 10 openings planned for next year. “We have a recipe that's working for us in Canada, that's a combination of retail stores, online, and select wholesale partners,” Ms. Griffiths said. The year before that deal, Knix's sales reached $133.6-million a year; it has now surpassed $200-million in annual sales in the U.S. and Canada. Knix has learned from its last go-round in the States, becoming “much more selective” about locations, Ms. Griffiths said. New York has the highest concentration of online customers for Knix; it plans to open two more locations, likely in Manhattan and Brooklyn, before launching more stores farther afield. The Trump administration's widespread tariffs on imported goods have upended how many companies do business and led to major spikes in cost to bring products into the market. Knix had to hike its prices for U.S. customers by 7 per cent in response. But like other retailers, it has had to absorb some of the cost increases. Before the U.S. cancelled the “de minimis” exemption – a rule that waived duties on shipments valued under US$800 – Knix paid nothing to ship online orders to the U.S., since they generally fell below that threshold. As Canada lifts countertariffs on American goods, what does it mean for consumers? How will Canadian consumers be affected by Trump's de minimis changes? Two things brought those costs down more recently: The U.S. lowered the tariffs on Chinese imports amid continuing negotiations, and Knix opened its first fulfilment centre south of the border, in Cincinnati, Ohio, in mid-July. That means Knix is now shipping roughly 40 per cent of its products directly to the U.S., instead of paying additional duties on transfer pricing for items that land in Canada first before crossing the border. Coming out of the height of the pandemic, Knix also had to rethink how centralized its manufacturing was in China. Diversifying has helped mitigate the tariff impact, although countries remain in active negotiations, and much is still uncertain. How Knix underwear founder Joanna Griffiths knew it was time to sell “If I have it my way, we won't touch prices again,” she said. “If anything, we see this as, potentially, an opportunity to double down.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The full transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with Donald Trump's deputy attorney have been published. Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein, was interviewed by Todd Blanche in July. “Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Mr Trump has faced immense political pressure over his former friendship with Epstein, whom he fell out with over a property deal in Palm Beach. Asked about her knowledge of Mr Trump and Epstein's relationship, Maxwell said she has no incriminating evidence against Donald Trump. She said: “I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. “First of all, let's just state, I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew. The Duke was accused of sexually abusing one of Epstein's first accusers, Virginia Giuffre, on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17. Maxwell claimed the Duchess of York, who she described as her “frenemy”, pursued Epstein. When asked why she thought so, Maxwell responded: “My female intuition.” Read more: Duchess of York ‘tried to put the moves on Epstein' Maxwell told Todd Blanche her ex-boyfriend did not ever love her and that she wasn't his “type”. “There was some indications that [Epstein] would actively tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from me, and that he never loved me and I wasn't his type,” Maxwell said. The pair had a romantic relationship but after breaking up continued to work together until his arrest in 2019. Several witnesses testified that they thought the pair were a couple, while others believed they had just a business relationship. The nature of Epstein's death is a contentious point for many Trump supporters, who believe he was murdered in order to suppress in order to cover up a so-called “client list” of high-profile figures. “I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she said. She said she did not know who was behind his death but that it was not a difficult thing to arrange. “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. Maxwell also denied that Epstein maintained a “client list” or “black book”. “There is no list,” she told Todd Blanche during the first day of their interviews. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr Trump had submitted a note for an album Maxwell was assembling for her then-boyfriend's birthday, in which he told Epstein they had “certain things in common”. The note allegedly concluded: “May every day be another wonderful secret”. “I do not remember,” Maxwell answered, when asked whether Mr Trump had sent a message for Epstein's 50th birthday. She added that she had not found a birthday letter from the president among her possessions in New York. However, she confirmed she had put together a book of birthday messages for Epstein, and that the financier had told her: “I love that idea.” Mr Trump has fiercely denied writing or sending the letter and has launched legal proceedings against the newspaper and its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch. In addition to Mr Trump and Prince Andrew, a number of high-profile individuals came up during Maxwell's interview but she did not incriminate any of them.</p>

BERLIN, August 25. /TASS/. Since February 2022, Germany has provided a total of €50.5 billion to support Ukraine, the DPA news agency reported, citing data from the German Ministry of Finance released during the ministry's chief Lars Klingbeil's visit to Kiev.

Of this sum, about €25 billion was spent on receiving and housing Ukrainian refugees, €17 billion on weapons supplies and troop training, €6.7 billion on civilian aid, and €1.9 billion on direct budgetary support.

According to financial planning, Germany intends to continue providing Kiev with more than €8 billion annually in bilateral military aid until 2027.

On Monday, Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil arrived in Kiev on an unannounced visit, where he is scheduled to meet with government officials, members of the Verkhovna Rada, and representatives of civil society.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ANDREI SOLDATOV is a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and Co-Founder and Editor of Agentura.ru, a watchdog of the Russian secret services' activities. IRINA BOROGAN is a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and Co-Founder and Deputy Editor of Agentura.ru. In late April 2024, Nikolai Patrushev, the longtime head of Russia's Security Council, chaired a meeting in St. Petersburg of top security officials from countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The meeting was about information sovereignty and security—the Kremlin's way of describing cybertechnologies that are designed to protect against Western surveillance, influence, and interference. But Patrushev also had a more specific message. Flanked by Sergei Naryshkin, the head of the Kremlin's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, Patrushev informed the audience that Russia's top cybersecurity companies could help their governments gain control of their national information space. Just days earlier, the U.S. Congress had approved a long-delayed $60 billion aid package to Ukraine, and Europe was preparing its 14th round of sanctions against Russia. Yet governments in many other parts of the world were paying attention. Although the full list was not released, participants in the meeting included national security advisers, the heads of national security councils, and the heads of security and intelligence agencies from a wide variety of countries including Brazil, Sudan, Thailand, and Uganda; close Russian allies such as China and Iran; as well as the Arab League. For many of these security officials, Patrushev's pitch was welcome: Russia has long excelled at cybertechnologies, and they understood that its resources could be valuable to securing their national digital infrastructures. Some of them had witnessed the “Twitter revolutions” of the last two decades and tended to share Russian President Vladimir Putin's view that such events—enabled by American-owned social media—reflected a U.S. tactic of fomenting mass protests that were often destabilizing. Moreover, many of their governments have maintained business relations with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine and are not particularly concerned about Russian influence in their countries. It involves an expanded use of soft power, such as the opening of new “Russia Houses” in more than a dozen countries in Africa. These are cultural centers run by the foreign ministry that serve to promote the Kremlin's narratives, including about its war in Ukraine; to work with Russian émigré communities in target countries; and to provide cover for Russian intelligence operatives—a time-honored practice for Russian cultural centers since the Cold War. The campaign also includes a push to expand Russian intelligence capabilities in regions caught between superpowers. According to past findings by European governments and the United States, several top Russian cybersecurity firms have links to the Kremlin's military and security services. And in June 2024, the United States put sanctions on Kaspersky Lab, another top Russian firm, for “cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities” that Treasury officials said is “contrary to U.S. national security.” Since 2022, the EU and some European countries have also taken steps to limit Russian cyber-companies' access to their markets. In a public statement, Positive Technologies called the Treasury's conclusions “groundless.” A Kaspersky spokesperson told Reuters that the U.S. decision was “unjustified and baseless.” Although it remains unclear how Russia's security services may be exploiting these deals, cybersecurity analysts say that such arrangements could give Moscow new ways to preempt Western intelligence activities. In recent months, as the Trump administration has softened its stance on Russia and pulled back U.S. foreign and intelligence assets aimed at foreign cybersecurity threats, Moscow has pursued this expansion with relatively little scrutiny. Left unchecked, these new relationships could put Washington and its allies at a significant disadvantage in the developing world, even as they potentially give Russia more ways to conduct cyberwarfare against the United States and Europe. They brought with them both expertise and determination. Some of them built successful international companies such as Kaspersky Lab, founded in 1997, which developed an array of highly advanced Internet security and cybersecurity tools and became known for exposing cybersecurity threats. In 2010, a team of Kaspersky researchers uncovered the Stuxnet virus, a highly sophisticated malware weapon that was used against Iran's nuclear program and was jointly designed by Israel and the United States. For nearly two decades, Russian cyber-companies were focused on building large markets for their products in Western countries, targeting both corporations and foreign government agencies. Following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, however, growing Western pressure on Moscow and concerns about cyberwarfare by Russian intelligence made it much harder for these companies to do business in the United States and Europe. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security ordered all government agencies to remove Kaspersky software from their systems, citing unspecified “information security risks” presented by Kaspersky-branded products and noting that the company's antivirus and other software “provide broad access to files” that could be exploited by malicious actors. In October 2017, investigations by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Russian hackers had stolen classified documents related to U.S. cyberdefenses from the National Security Agency, in part by using Kaspersky software on an NSA contractor's computer. The firms mentioned by Patrushev included Positive Technologies and its spinoff Cyberus Foundation, Kaspersky Lab, Angara Security, Kod Bezopasnosti, Security Vision, and Solar. By and large, these companies provide products that protect digital infrastructure against cyberattacks—whether from vigilante hackers or hostile foreign governments. There are several strategic reasons behind the Kremlin's push. In many cases, when a foreign government acquires cutting-edge surveillance and cybertechnologies from Russia, their local security and law enforcement agencies lack the expertise to operate them. As a result, they rely on the Russian suppliers not just for technical guidance but also for help integrating the technology into their domestic legal frameworks. That kind of relationship offers the Russian cyber-companies a rare level of access to systems and to local contacts within the client country. Moreover, many of Russia's leading cyber-companies were created by engineers and computer scientists from Russian elite technical universities, which were originally established to supply engineers for the Soviet military and intelligence agency, the KGB. Going back to the Soviet era, these schools have produced generations of engineers who are trained to work in secrecy. According to Western security officials, Putin has sought to rebuild this tight relationship between the intelligence services and the country's top technology developers. But it did sanction 12 other Russian nationals who are senior executives at the company. Kaspersky Lab denied that the executives have any links to Russia's security services. “It would be weird (and flat-out wrong) to assume these executives were introduced into the company's top management to give Russian spies leverage in Kaspersky Lab's actions,” the company said in a 2018 statement. The Russian government has also applied more overt pressure on its cybersecurity companies. In 2016, for example, several top Russian cyber officials—including a top manager at Kaspersky Lab—were thrown into Moscow's Lefortovo prison by the FSB on charges of high treason. The U.S. Treasury put Positive Technologies and Kaspersky Lab on the U.S. sanctions list, and after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, other Western countries followed suit. In 2023, Positive Technologies was sanctioned by the European Union. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Italy's national cybersecurity agency also banned the use on government devices of various Russian-designed cybersecurity applications—including those of Kaspersky, Positive Technologies, and also Group-IB, another leading Russian company—citing national security concerns. Since the April 2024 meeting in St. Petersburg, Positive Technologies has continued to expand its international reach. Positive Technologies has been particularly attractive to Riyadh because the company provides protection against so-called advanced persistent threat attacks—cyberattacks in which a malicious actor may remain hidden within a system for a long time to accomplish strategic objectives—which have been particularly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. In 2024, the company found that of the groups it could identify that had launched such attacks, 88 percent had targeted telecommunications and military industries in Saudi Arabia. In June 2025, Cyberus Foundation, which describes itself as a “tool for consolidating business, the cyber defense industry, and the state to achieve common goals,” signed a strategic agreement with Al-Adid Business, owned by Sheikh Suhaim bin Ahmed bin Sultan bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of the ruling family of Qatar. The deal is designed to develop Qatar's cybersecurity capabilities, including by establishing Cyberdom Qatar and Hackademy, institutions for training cyber experts in the country. There is no direct indication that Russian intelligence was involved in these deals. But they indisputably give Russian companies far-reaching access to these countries' digital infrastructures. In April 2025, Cyberus also signed a partnership agreement with the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Kremlin-led military alliance of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. Kaspersky Lab, for example, has signed an agreement with Smart Africa, a partnership among 40 African countries aimed at developing information and communications technologies. Kaspersky is also involved in the African Network of Cybersecurity Authorities, an initiative established in February 2025 to “tackle cross-border cybersecurity challenges across the Continent.” In making such arrangements, Kaspersky Lab has positioned itself to be the leading shaper of the emerging cyber-industry across Africa. For instance, in June, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum—the annual conference sponsored by Putin that has long served as a showcase for Russia's economic and geopolitical power—featured Yury Maksimov, the co-founder of Positive Technologies and Cyberus, as one of its key speakers. Maksimov discussed the need for the countries that “don't have complete technological independence”—meaning countries that are unable to create national online services that are capable of competing with Western platforms—to understand how to maintain digital sovereignty. Bezrukov's current occupation—leading the “export of technological sovereignty”—reflects what the Kremlin, Russian intelligence agencies, and Russian cyber-companies aim to achieve: to provide target countries with cyber-services that would shield their information spaces from the perceived threat of Western influence, including in cybersecurity and social media control. Given that neither Bezrukov nor Naryshkin have hidden their affiliations with the SVR, it appears that Russia's spy agencies think their colleagues in the client countries are little concerned about the possibility of Russian intelligence penetration in their digital infrastructure as long as they can obtain cyberprotection from the West. The stakes in this quiet yet intense new cyberbattle are high. It is not only about which companies gain access to the national digital infrastructure of dozens of countries outside the West but also about the training of those responsible for protecting that infrastructure. Russian intelligence has a long reach, and the country's leading cyber-companies have been made well aware of it.

TAIPEI, Aug 24 (Reuters) – Veteran Pan Cheng-fa says he clearly remembers fighting for China against the Japanese in World War Two, but gets agitated when asked about the role of communist forces who at the time were in an uneasy alliance with his republican government. “We gave them weapons, equipment – we strengthened them,” Pan, 99, said at an event in Taiwan's capital Taipei to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two. As China gears up for a mass military parade in Beijing next month to mark the war's end, both Taiwan – whose formal name remains Republic of China – and the People's Republic of China are locked in an increasingly bitter war of words about historical narrative and who should really be claiming credit for the victory. Taiwan's own anniversary events are much more low key, and don't mention the role of the communists apart from to lambaste them. A defence ministry concert on Thursday night in Taipei featured performers dressed as World War Two-era republican soldiers, images of the Flying Tigers – volunteer U.S. pilots who flew for the republican Chinese air force – and rap by Taiwanese hip-hop group Nine One One. China has hit back at what it sees as misrepresentation of the Chinese Communist Party's role. On Tuesday, the party's official People's Daily wrote in an online commentary that vigilance was needed against efforts to “distort and falsify the Chinese Communist Party's role as the country's backbone” in fighting Japan. China says the victory belongs to all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, and is also celebrating the fact the war's end in 1945 led to Taiwan – a Japanese colony from 1895 – being “returned” to Chinese rule as part of the peace agreement. Taiwan says nothing in any agreements talked about handing over Taiwan to the Chinese Communist Party-run People's Republic of China which was only founded in late 1949. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te marked the surrender anniversary of August 15 with a Facebook post saying aggression will be defeated, in a pointed reference to Beijing's military threats against the island. The People's Republic of China says it is the successor state to the Republic of China and that Taiwan is an inherent part of Beijing's territory, a view Taipei's government vehemently opposes. Taiwan's government has urged its people not to attend China's military parade, warning against reinforcing Beijing's territorial claims and backing its version of what the anniversary means. Veteran Pan, who says family members left behind after the civil war were brutalised while he escaped to Taiwan, sees Beijing's parade as having nothing to do with him. “I can't say anything good about the communists,” he said.
