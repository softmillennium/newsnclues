                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cleveland cut former Pro Bowl quarterback Tyler Huntley Sunday, an NFL journeyman who stood fifth on the depth chart, part of 17 roster cuts ahead of the Tuesday deadline to get down to the 53-man limit. In the team's 3-0 exhibition run he was 17-22 passing for 129 yards with one touchdown without an interception. Five quarterbacks remain on the roster ahead of Tuesday, Flacco, backup Kenny Pickett who's battling a groin injury, third-round pick and former Duck Dillon Gabriel and fifth-round selection Shedeur Sanders. Tyler Huntley came right in and lead those same group of players right down the field, and Shedeur was also playing against guys who are also going to get cut. A cadre of Browns fans, pundits and former players insist that the beleaguered franchise (40 starting quarterbacks since 1999) is mishandling or even sabotaging Sanders in his bid to become an NFL starter. Saturday the rookie from Colorado and son of an NFL Hall of Famer was badly outplayed by fellow rookie and Oregon Duck Dillon Gabriel. Gabriel played in the second quarter and led an 11-play, 86-yard drive in the two-minute drill, throwing his first pro touchdown pass. In 2024, 15 of the 32 starting NFL quarterbacks were black, including Super Bowl winner Jalen Hurts, three-time Super Bowl winner and two-time NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes, and NFL Rookie of the Year Jayden Daniels. Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl in 1988. The brewing tempest in the Cleveland teapot prompted former Duck and NFL lineman Geoff Schwartz to post a sarcastic blast on X. My OL coach came up to me and said "Hey Schwartz you need to block worse when Smith is playing quarterback so he looks bad" ... totally normal conspiracy that happens all the time https://t.co/vUYv1OwAHb The NFL cares about two things: winning and making money. Sanders fifth-string status has everything to do with his pocket awareness and performance, and little to do with his race. He hasn't played well, despite a strong debut in Charlotte on August 8th. Within an organization, even an organization as badly-run as the Browns, it helps if the backup is a team-oriented guy who doesn't draw controversy. The job is to hold a clipboard, attend meetings and wait. Sulking, speed through 40 mile-an-hour traffic zones and being a media lightning rod create distractions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First Lady Melania Trump's signature on the letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin is at the center of wild social media speculation At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. First Lady Melania Trump wasn't at the big Ukraine war summit in Alaska between her husband, President Donald Trump, and Russian President Vladimir Putin — but she was there in spirit. “In today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future,” the first lady wrote. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.” That's because of how similar it looked to the president's signature Sharpie scrawl. So weird,” said one person on X, who shared a side-by-side image of the two. “Melania has the same type of signature as Trump ... odd ... ” wrote a Facebook user. “No way is that her signature,” said another. Others questioned why the first lady's signature appears to have changed over the years, with one user asking Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot, “Why did Melania Trump change her signature?” “Melania Trump's signature evolved after her 2005 marriage, shifting from a flowing cursive style (as Melania Knauss) to a peaked, stylized one resembling Donald's,” Grok replied. “Analysts suggest it's for branding unity, quick signing via autopen or to reflect tenacity and privacy. The chatbot's answer actually tallies with the opinion of Bart Baggett, a handwriting expert who has testified in criminal cases. “She's got angular writing that's a fast, analytical line. “Her current handwriting is almost like a brand, like a logo, and I think she morphed it a little bit more into matching Trump's as she bought into the brand,” Baggett added. He had a lot of pomp and circumstance,” Baggett said. “I don't see any nefarious thing about her letter,” Baggett said. “Those conspiracy theories, I think, are just grasping at straws.” Chatter online turned to Trump's Sharpie, the marker he raved about during his first term, and he has used to sign dozens of executive orders since his return to the White House. “Did she borrow his Sharpie?” one person joked on X. “I think a Sharpie probably was used, and it is very typical of his brand,” he said, referring to the signature on the Putin letter. “I was signing documents with a very expensive pen and it didn't write well,” Trump said in a 2018 HBO documentary in partnership with Axios. Reddit and X users were also wildly speculating whether the first lady used an autopen—which has become one of the president's go-to attack lines on his predecessor Joe Biden. Earlier this year, Trump began accusing Biden of using the mechanical device to sign pardoning documents, rather than doing so by hand. Trump claimed, without providing evidence, that Biden had no knowledge or approval of the documents. “Did Melania use Donald's autopen?” asked one X user. “The autopen can only have one signature preset,” jested another. “If [Melania] has an autopen, we don't know about it,” Baggett concluded.

For years, TV writer Patrick Tarr has been writing scripts for shows like Murdoch Mysteries, Cardinal and Saving Hope — but his dream was always to write a book. Now, that dream has become a reality. Tarr's debut novel, The Guest Children, is a chilling supernatural tale inspired by real-life history: the evacuation of 6,000 British children to Canada during the Second World War. He joins guest host Gill Deacon to talk about reframing these events as a ghost story.

Vice President JD Vance revealed that he's "obsessed" with mysterious UFO videos during an appearance on the "Ruthless" podcast on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He had moved the government on from divisive social issues. After a couple of rocky years and a disastrous general election result, unity had at last been restored to the SNP. Then along comes Nicola to remind everyone of all the things they furiously disagree on. If you're an SNP strategist looking ahead to next year's Holyrood elections, they'll have had you weeping with clumps of your own hair in your hands. Scottish voters go to the polls in eight months' time and instead of hearing why they should hand the Nationalists an unprecedented fifth consecutive term in government, they are being reminded of the woman who was First Minister or Deputy First Minister for most of the last two decades. In a landmark 2015 speech, Sturgeon decried the school attainment gap between rich and poor children and outlined her mission to ‘close that attainment gap completely'. She even insisted: ‘I want to be judged on this.' A decade on, far from closing, the gap is widening. She was the First Minister who saw Scotland become the drug deaths capital of Europe, who boasted about ambitious climate targets even as her government habitually missed them, and whose attempt to procure two ferries ended in ballooning budgets, endless delays, and a nationalised shipyard. Not only are voters being prompted to recall all this, they are doing so while watching Sturgeon push her memoirs, ironically titled Frankly, and be feted by literary luvvies at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. (In one shot, she is seen standing behind a glass wall, peering out intently. Perhaps it was meant as a metaphor for the gilded cage of political life, but I was waiting for her to ask Clarice if the lambs had stopped screaming.) An argument popular among Sturgeon's fan club is that her detractors are afraid of a strong woman and a champion of Scottish independence. Dealt a hand that would bankrupt a Vegas casino (Corbyn, Brexit, Boris, Covid, Truss), not only did she fail to advance the independence cause, she set it back with her catastrophic Supreme Court gambit, confirming in law Westminster's supremacy in constitutional matters. Better Together should give her a lifetime achievement award. No, it's people on her own side who are rapidly losing patience. Some are more public in their criticisms than others. Irvine Welsh says gender identity ought to be ‘a fringe issue' but Sturgeon caused it to ‘leak right into the whole independence debate'. She did so, the Trainspotting and Porno author reckons, because she was ‘out of step with what people feel and believe in the way that social engineers always are'. Is he one of those Right-wing misogynist transphobes Sturgeon seems to find everywhere she looks, like a gender-obsessed Joe McCarthy? The Harry Potter author penned a coruscating review of Sturgeon's memoirs and the former First Minister thought the wise thing to do would be to go on Iain Dale's LBC show and pour kerosene on the flames, accusing Rowling of ‘punching down on trans people'. I would make enough to retire within a week. Then again, at least Rowling can exercise her right of reply. The same can't be said of Alex Salmond, with whom Sturgeon has also been picking fights, rather unsporting considering the man's been dead ten months. One passage in Frankly that has caused ructions is her account of the path to legislating for same-sex marriage. She claims that Salmond became ‘increasingly hostile' to the idea, fearing it would undermine support for independence, to the point where he was ‘implacably opposed'. Geoff Aberdein, Salmond's former chief of staff, said this was ‘demonstrably false', and pointed to a newspaper clipping from the 2011 election campaign, when Salmond confirmed his backing for gay marriage. ‘If you're going to speak ill of the dead,' he quipped, ‘at least make your claims accurate.' It's no great secret that Sturgeon and Aberdein aren't exactly besties, but he was in many of the rooms where the big decisions were taken. His perspective is valuable and, honestly, more plausible than Sturgeon's. The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 was government legislation. If Salmond was implacably opposed, what changed his mind? What I could believe is that Salmond tried to triangulate between liberal, professional urbanites and the rural and religious voters he had coaxed into the Nationalist fold. Salmond was a crafty old dog when it came to political tactics. If he is to be damned for wishing at times for ca'canny on major social change, he shouldn't face judgement alone. When Sturgeon claims her old boss ‘made arguments that seemed rooted in the prejudice which had put Section 28 on the statute book', it is worth considering her stance on removing Section 28 (called Section 2A in Scotland) from the statute books. When Christian businessman — and SNP supporter — Brian Souter funded a methodologically unreliable ‘referendum' that showed voters opposed to repeal, Sturgeon said: ‘The ballot confirms what we already knew — that many people are concerned about the repeal of Section 2A.' It was Sturgeon who told Holyrood ‘the real concerns of parents must be addressed'. Sturgeon who demanded statutory footing as a way of ‘reassuring parents that local authorities would not be at liberty to disregard guidance'. Sure, she has a book to sell, but it's not even that cynical. Poor judgement, failure and division accompany Sturgeon wherever she goes because these were her principal contributions to Scottish public life.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For years, scientists have scanned the skies for extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes and optical tools to detect artificial signals. A recent study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society introduces a new way to look for possible extraterrestrial probes near Earth. The researchers suggest using Earth's shadow as a natural filter to block out interference caused by satellites and space junk. To tackle this issue of “contamination,” an international team led by Beatriz Villarroel of Stockholm University turned to Earth's shadow. When Earth blocks the Sun, it creates a cone-shaped shadow in space where no sunlight can bounce off satellites or debris. This makes it an ideal area to carry out a clean search. For objects in geosynchronous orbit, around 35,700 km above Earth, the shadow stretches across a base of nearly eight to nine degrees. This is why the team focused on Earth's shadow. Each night, it creates a space where sunlight cannot reflect off satellites or fragments of debris. Since human-made satellites rarely give off visible light, apart from occasional cases such as communication lasers or thrusters, any bright flash or streak seen within this shadow could point to something far more unusual. They used an automated system called NEOrion, which flagged thousands of possible candidates. Most of these turned out to be meteors, aircraft or already known asteroids. The system detected an unidentified object moving much faster than typical asteroids and not listed in any existing database. The study also suggested new paths for future work. These include looking at astronomical photographs taken before 1957 to search for unexplained objects from before the space age, and studying the light signatures of materials that may have been altered by long exposure to space. Although no alien artefacts were confirmed, Villarroel and her team believe their work shows that systematic searches are possible with the telescopes we already have. They are now working on the ExoProbe project, a telescope network that will capture simultaneous observations and help measure the distance to unusual objects. Pinchen Fan, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University and the study's lead author, said, “Considering the direction and frequency of our most common signals gives insights into where we should be looking to improve our chances of detecting alien technosignatures.” To increase the chances of detection, the team said scientists should focus on moments when exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, line up with their host stars, or at least when such alignments occur.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Written during a profoundly transformative period in her own life, author and psychic medium MaryAnn DiMarco invites readers to go on a spiritual and intuitive journey. The Guide Book(s) offers a compassionate roadmap for connecting with spirit guides who help support and guide each of us in unique ways. Harper's Bazaar: Your book presents spirit guides as reliable companions on life's journey. For someone feeling sceptical, what's the first small step they can take towards that possibility? MaryAnn DiMarco: I think it's okay to feel sceptical. If we could shift our perspective to believe that we are part of the light—as made from it—we can begin to connect with spirit and guides on the other side. HB: You've structured The Guide(s) Book as a spiritual road trip. What was happening in your own life that made this metaphor feel essential? MD: My whole life was moving around, shifting, and changing. For one, it was the resistance to moving which caused me stress and anxiety because it brought up things from being a child and moving a lot. But I decided to make stops along the way, understand the scenic route, and allow myself to embrace it differently. I was making these road trips back and forth to my new destination down in Florida from New York over and over again, and it was stirring up a lot within me. I worked with my guides on it, and they were like, 'Let's write about this.' HB: Many people struggle to trust their intuition, even if it feels loud. How do you suggest they differentiate between true spiritual nudges and ordinary thoughts or fears? MD: A great way to make this discernment is to start learning about claircognizance, or your inner knowing, and intuition. We must nourish that muscle and allow it to grow, and the spirit will give us validation to move into spaces of trust. A post shared by Body, Mind, & Spirit Books (@newworldlibrary) How can we begin to see stillness as sacred, rather than stagnant? I thank them for allowing me the time to pause so that I can welcome reflection into my mind, body, and soul. And I started to be really grateful for that. Your physical self might still feel angst, but the knowing calms you. The reassurance of your own true story that lies within you becomes crystal clear. Our perception in these moments is key to the change. How we choose to look at it and how we speak about it will allow the information to flow to us more easily, or we can create resistance. HB: Some might think connecting with spirit guides requires a rare gift or lifelong spiritual practice. MD: It is never too late to lead into the most authentic parts of your soul ever. HB: Can you share a moment from your own journey when working with your guides shifted the direction of your life in a way logic alone never could? It brought me to a beautiful place of wisdom. HB: You've taught countless students and worked with many clients. What are some common spiritual blocks that you see? Fear, in all its various forms, is one of the biggest lessons that people work on trying to understand, especially when they come to me. I love to get them out of that space of fear and give them the power to understand it better. HB: If readers could only walk away with one enduring lesson from The Guide(s) Book, what do you hope it would be? MD: It would be that they are never alone. That even though we are technically walking through this (life) journey all by ourselves, we have a whole spiritual team on the other side that's here to help us. If we just say yes, we can help create many beautiful things in our lives, we can understand the hard times with a healthier perspective or a more healing perspective. That they can take away with them the feeling that anytime they want, they can hear the journey that they came here to experience and that their guides, their loved ones, their angels on the other side are cheering them on and that they want us to succeed. I always say, "We sign up for the lessons, but I don't know that we sign up for the experience of how those lessons come into fruition". But I believe that they are cheering us on, and I think that they have always been with us. My hope is that people lean into that thought process and allow themselves to make the most beautiful connection that they could ever have while they are here in this space to help change their lives. I think it's extraordinary how they work with us. And so, I hope they find that magical miracle for themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb earnestly hopes that the interstellar alien object in the solar system turns out to be a spacecraft sent by extraterrestrial beings. This comes after his very open assertion, backed by evidence, that it is not a natural space rock or comet. He has said that almost everything about 3I/ATLAS points to it being an object designed by someone. In fact, he actually wishes that the interstellar object were an alien probe coming for Earth. In a new blog post, Loeb states that the "mothership" will be a wake-up call for humans busy fighting for land and resources on Earth. He has previously called for world leaders to join hands and work towards a common threat, which 3I/ATLAS could be. Also Read: 3I/ATLAS and its 'intent': Harvard scientist calls on world leaders to prepare for an alien attack Also Read: Scientist claims mystery interstellar object is here to test human intelligence, and we have already failed. Loeb says he is aware that "our financial or political systems will respond to such a potential threat in earnest only after our first encounter with alien technology." If the world agrees that 3I/ATLAS is aliens coming to seed Earth and other planets with probes, it "would reset our priorities", Loeb says. "Humanity desperately needs a wakeup call," Loeb wrote, and if his fears about the interstellar visitor turn out to be real, it would reset priorities and humans will be forced to stop focusing on "terrestrial conflicts", and explore what lies "beyond Earth". Also Read: Scientist reveals HOW and WHEN alien 'mothership' could attack Earth, warns governments to take action If an alien spacecraft is coming towards Earth, it would be a treasure trove of technology that humans have yet to create. Accessing the scientific knowledge of another world will fast-forward human technology without adding to the financial burden of funding research to reach there, besides saving time. But encountering an alien spaceship will help them go beyond just the red planet. Loeb argues that if humans are sure that aliens can attack Earth, they would sit up and take the necessary steps to protect the planet. He wrote that setting up "an alert system of monitors and interceptors around the Sun would protect Earth from a global threat by alien technology," besides telling us what lies beyond what we already know.
