                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Linked with moves to MLS and Serie A via LAFC and Parma, U.S. Men's National Team attacker Gio Reyna's new club ultimately proved closer to home, leaving Borussia Dortmund for fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach — a move team management admitted involves an element of “risk.” The 22-year-old's move to Monchengladbach was announced on Saturday as he signed a three-year deal to reunite him with USMNT teammate and former New York City FC academy co-star Joe Scally. Following Reyna's transfer, Monchengladbach's sporting director Roland Virkus admitted that the move was one “where we normally have no chance — no chance. But he wants to make a fresh start with us,” as per Goal. Virkus said that when it comes to where Reyna could line up under head coach Gerardo Seoane, who has been in the role since 2023, he explained, “It's important for competition that you're not tied to one position. This isn't the first time the term “risk” has been associated with Reyna, whose domestic career has faltered in recent years after a remarkable start with Dortmund. USMNT legend Alexi Lalas recently suggested on his 'State of the Union' podcast that, “Anybody signing Gio Reyna, given what has happened and how far his stock has fallen, there's inherent risk in that. “It wouldn't be the first time that a player has had multiple years of down problems, whatever you want to call them, and resurrects his or her career by going some place else. But, you have to kick those tires and worry that this is not a temporary type of event or something that this player can't grow out of." However, injuries, off-the-field concerns, and falling out of favor under multiple coaches at Dortmund have ultimately plagued his career in recent years, limiting him to just 627 minutes across all competitions last season. With the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, rapidly approaching, it is perhaps more important than ever that Reyna finds regular minutes if he's to earn a spot on Mauricio Pochettino's roster. Following confirmation of his move to Monchengladbach, Reyna posted an emotional farewell message to Dortmund on Instagram, reading, “I arrived at BVB as a 16-year-old kid, and over the past six years I've grown into the person and player I am today. “I'll carry so many unforgettable memories with me, from my Bundesliga debut to lifting the DFB-Pokal, and all the moments in between. Dortmund has shaped me in ways I'll never forget, both on and off the field. Your support through every high and low has meant the world to me. “Now it's time to close this chapter and start a new one, but BVB will always have a special place in my heart. Monchengladbach's season got off to a slow start on Sunday, drawing 0-0 with Hamburger SV at home ahead of their first away game of the campaign on Saturday at VfB Stuttgart.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several USMNT players were in the mix for their respective club teams. Let's rewind the best moments from last week: Josh Sargent has appeared in four matches since the 2025-26 season for Norwich City, and he's scored in all four. His most recent goal came in the 85th minute on an impressive high-arching shot that sailed above the goalkeeper's head. It cut Norwich's two-goal deficit in half, but ultimately the Canaries fell to Middlesbrough FC as City played with 10 after a red card was handed out. Sargent will have another chance to add to his season total when Norwich plays in the second round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday. Coventry City tallied an impressive 7-1 win over QPR, and Haji Wright scored in the 12th and 37th minutes to secure the brace. He recorded his first goal of the season in Coventry's win over Derby County on a penalty kick. Wright left USMNT camp during the Concacaf Gold Cup run to tend to an Achilles injury; however, now he appears healthy and making a good impression with his club early in the season. Brian White has been one of the most prolific scorers in MLS this season and leads the Vancouver Whitecaps in scoring. The Whitecaps finished off St. Louis CITY 3-2 with another penalty kick, this time from German legend Thomas Müller, who recently joined MLS from FC Bayern Munich. Forwards Ricardo Pepi, Folarin Balogun and defender Antonee Robinson have yet to play for the USMNT in 2025 because of injury, but each returned to their clubs this weekend. Pepi made his Eredivisie debut this season for PSV in a 4-2 victory against FC Groningen, subbing on late in the 86th minute. The friendly in late July marked his first minutes on the field since January as he dealt with a meniscus injury. Balogun played all 90 minutes in AS Monaco's 1-0 loss to LOSC on Sunday. Before that, Balogun was rehabbing from a dislocated shoulder, which kept him away from National Team training.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Questa sera, al termine della partita contro il Parma, Weston Mckennie è stato oggetto di espressioni discriminatorie di natura razzista, da parte di alcune persone presenti nel settore ospiti, mentre si allenava in campo con i compagni che non avevano preso parte alla gara.La… "Juventus strongly condemns this episode and every manifestation of racism and will ensure the utmost collaboration with the sports justice authorities to identify those responsible." It's unclear what was said to McKennie -- who joined the squad back in 2020 -- but he has yet to speak on the matter himself. "Racial intolerance, or any other type of abusive behaviour, is NEVER tolerated or acceptable and must therefore be addressed, fought, and condemned at all times." During a match in 2023, Inter Milan's Romelu Lukaku faced racist chants from Juventus fans. In another 2023 incident, McKennie and other Juventus members had discriminatory chants directed at them during a match against Fiorentina -- resulting in a partial stadium one-match ban. In 2024, U.S. Soccer stood up for its players after some individuals sent them racist messages following their 2-1 loss to Panama. Just last week, FIFA President Gianni Infantino condemned two incidents of alleged racist abuse during German Cup games, calling it "unacceptable."

Trump floated the possibility of Putin showing up during the FIFA 2026 World Cup tournament — hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico — while meeting Friday with FIFA President Gianni Infantino. During the meeting, Trump displayed a photo of himself with Putin from their recent summit in Alaska. Then Trump referenced the World Cup and said he believes Putin “will be coming, depending on what happens,” according to video of the White House meeting. He followed up by saying Putin “may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens.” MetLife Stadium is scheduled to host eight games during the tournament, including the final game on July 19. A total of 48 teams will be participating, up from 32 four years ago. Rob Jennings may be reached at rjennings@njadvancemedia.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 FIFA World Cup may still be 10 months away, but the European season could not have started any better for Tajon Buchanan and Jonathan David, likely to be two of Canada's key players at the tournament. For Buchanan, it was a hat trick for Villarreal in a 5–0 win over Girona, and for David, the first goal of Juventus's season in a 2–0 victory over Palma. “They're all playing at big clubs, they're all being challenged in big ways, which I think is a big part in developing as a person and as a player …being put in an environment that is very, very challenging and where the levels are very, very high.” Buchanan had already provided some standout moments for Villarreal as a loan player at the tail end of the 2024–25 season. Still, his comeback from injury and limited minutes hit their peak against Girona. Playing as an outright left winger, he caressed the ball with slick dribbling in the 13th minute, weaving past two defenders before smashing a shot in from a sharp angle, scoring two more goals before the 30th minute. Now, he's returned to top form, with eight goals and an assist in his last 10 games for club and country. In addition to becoming just the second Canadian to score a hat trick in Europe's top five leagues—the other being David—he made 22 of 26 passes, completed five dribbles and created four chances. “The first goal was probably my favorite ... I'm super happy with the game for everyone and obviously my first hat trick,” Buchanan said after the match. While other Canadians, such as Alphonso Davies at FC Bayern Munich, have had standout moments, few match the level that Buchanan hit on Sunday night, with Villarreal now sitting atop La Liga after two matches. “It's only two games and the schedule means we played them both at home,” Villarreal manager Marcelino García Toral said. I am proud and grateful to the players; it's been a real pleasure. We will have a glass of wine with the family and keep working.” Few situations in soccer come with as much pressure as being a new marquee striker signing at a major club. Yet, that was no issue for David, nicknamed “The Iceman,” who made his presence known in his Serie A debut. He hung around the back post, before slipping off his defender to finish a cross from Kenan Yıldız in the second half. “It's everything I hoped for," said David after the match. The pressure will only mount now for David, too, as he hopes to lead Juventus to their first Scudetto title since 2019–20, while also establishing himself as the outright striker option ahead of Dušan Vlahović, who scored off the bench against Parma.

Morgan will always be part of our family, and we're grateful for everything she's brought to our club.” Prior to playing for Orlando, Gautrat had stints with the Kansas City Current, Chicago Red Stars and the Houston Dash. While in Chicago, the midfielder helped the Red Stars to four-straight playoff appearances, appearing in 62 matches and scoring six goals across all competitions. In 2018, Gautrat spent time overseas playing for French club Olympique Lyonnes where she appeared in four matches and recorded one goal and one assist. During her rookie season, she appeared in 10 matches but spent a large part of the season with the U.S. Women's National Team at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. After her rookie campaign, Gautrat would go on to log over 1,000 minutes for the Dash while also being part of the USWNT's participation in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. Overall with the USWNT, Gautrat has made 88 appearances and tallied eight goals and 11 assists since making her senior team debut on June 15, 2013. She won two FIFA Women's World Cups in both 2015 and 2019 and was the youngest member of the 2015 winning squad.

South Korea coach Hong Myung-bo on Monday called up former German youth international Jens Castrop for next month's friendlies against World Cup co-hosts the United States and Mexico – the first time a foreign-born, mixed-heritage player has been included in the men's national squad.

Hong named the Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder in his 26-man squad as the Koreans begin preparations for next year's World Cup.

The 22-year-old Castrop, who was born to a German father and a South Korean mother, was picked along with captain Son Heung-min – who joined Los Angeles FC earlier this month after a decade in the English Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur – and Paris St Germain's Champions League winner Lee Kang-in.

Castrop, who was born in Dusseldorf and played for Germany from Under-16 to Under-21 level, asked Fifa to switch his international allegiance to South Korea, and the change was signed off by the sport's world governing body two weeks ago.

He played for Koln and Nurnberg before joining Mönchengladbach in February, making his debut appearance in the top tier of German football on Sunday as a substitute in a 0-0 draw against Hamburg.

“Although Castrop is young, he is a player who has consistently grown while gaining experience in the Bundesliga,” Hong said. “Above all, I highly value the strong will and sense of responsibility he has shown to join our national team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Morgan Gautrat has won two World Cups with the United States. At 32, the midfielder has seen and done it all, albeit from a lofty vantage point. Since 2015, when she joined that league's Houston Dash as the number one pick in its college draft, she has played at the top. She steps out, bends down and touches the grass. “This is like a footballer's dream,” she says. They, too, are newly minted winners — their victory over Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final last season earned them a first piece of domestic silverware for 70 years — yet their women's side are in the second tier of the Women's Super League (WSL). In that context, Gautrat's presence — she has signed on loan from Orlando until the end of December, a short initial spell which she “definitely, definitely,” hopes to extend — is vaguely astonishing. As recently as 2023, Newcastle were on the fourth rung of the ladder in English women's football and the players were juggling their careers as athletes with full-time jobs and training at night. Not too long before that, Becky Langley, the manager, would be eating her evening meal at 11pm after training and washing the team's kit herself. The players paid to play under her. Since Newcastle's takeover in October 2021 — the club are now majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund — that outlook has been transformed. Gautrat's arrival takes their number of close-season signings to six, with the others including Jordan Nobbs, who has been capped 71 times by England. To put it bluntly, Newcastle want what Gautrat has had. “It's a really amazing project that's going on here,” Gautrat says, when asked about her motivation for the move. “When Ben talked to my agent and me and tried to sell me on it, it just seemed like the club is extremely ambitious. And at this point in my career, I'm really excited to join something like this, to help lead a team and make history. “I've always wanted to play overseas and experience a different footballing culture and immerse myself in something like Newcastle. A lot of people follow the Premier League at home and know about Newcastle and how much people love this team. “It's an exciting time to be part of this, and then I had a good conversation with Becky, and it seems like everyone is headed in the right direction. Orlando, who are challenging again as the NWSL season enters its second half, have just signed Lizbeth Ovalle from Mexican side Tigres for a women's football world-record fee of $1.5million (£1.1m). Gautrat is far from an afterthought there. She has explained her thought process about joining Newcastle, but why leave a club like that at a time like this? “I had an option year in my contract, and they have to tell you ahead of time if they're planning on exercising that. Once they tell me that (they're not exercising), I'm a free agent, so I can look around the world and the market and within the league and see what other opportunities are out there. This one caught my eye, just because of the project. “I've always loved joining places that I could help make better and where I could leave a lasting impact, and this is going to be no different, hopefully. I've done it all in the NWSL. I've done a lot in my career in America, I had a short stint playing in France (with Lyon seven years ago), and I didn't have a great experience, so I've always kind of wanted to rewrite that chapter and enjoy something different. “I've played in the NWSL for 11 seasons now and I would say that my technical ability and skill set weren't always utilised, because it's so athletic and transitional (as a league). “I feel like most European players watch soccer from a very young age and they're immersed in it from the beginning of their lives. People don't watch the game very often, and there's not a ton of teams with a rich culture in the history of football. “What's made us successful for so long on the women's side is our athleticism and our physical ability. I would say that for 70 per cent of the players in the United States, the way that they're developed from a young age is more about winning than development. How this will translate to WSL 2 is unclear. Playing at this level will provide a different kind of challenge, but, as she says, “I'm in a different place in my career where I'm excited to be a leader and help the younger players. “Winning the NSWL and the Shield and having success gives you that experience of big games and how to get the best out of your team-mates, closing out games, learning how to manage games within the game. Gautrat has made 88 appearances for the United States, most recently in 2022. Is dropping down a level a tacit acknowledgment that this part of her career is now over? “It would have to be special and the right moment if I were ever to go back and entertain that, but obviously I would love to play for my country. Playing abroad has always appealed but, as mentioned above, her previous taste of it was not ideal. “When you're drafted at number one (from college), you go to the worst team (from the previous season) and so, for my development, being at Houston Dash was hard,” she says. They had some of the best players. They had a training environment and style of play that suited me better than playing in the NWSL, so when they got in touch with my agent I wanted to experience all that. The training was amazing, but there were a lot of things, on and off the field, that didn't go well. “My husband (Fabrice Gautrat, who has been the Dash's head coach since January) is half-French and moved over there with me and they had kind of said they'd help find him a job, which they didn't really do. There were politics going on that I got caught in the middle of and leading into the 2019 World Cup, I needed to be playing consistently. Naturally, she hopes Newcastle will be different. “It helps that we speak English,” she says, although this may prove to be a gross underestimation of the Geordie accent. “Flying in here, I could see the coast and I love the water — I grew up on the water (her hometown is on St Simons Island in the southern state of Georgia), so that's very exciting,” she says. “I'm not looking forward to the cold quite so much. But I got off the plane today and oh my gosh, ‘Is this summer? Gautrat's new team will play most of their home games across the river Tyne from Newcastle itself in Gateshead, but the temperature will not be an issue in November, when they host Sunderland, their local rivals, at St James'. It is always a feisty, white-hot occasion. Because I imagine those matches are pretty rowdy.” A Tyne-Wear derby will be another voyage of discovery for her, but Gautrat knows all about the big games — the biggest games. A potentially transformational signing at a club hellbent on transforming themselves into winners, Gautrat now has to make those games the norm for Newcastle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People living in the shadow of the country's national Azteca Stadium in Mexico City say development plans will add to pressure on water sources and put green spaces at risk As a community leader in Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in southern Mexico City, he's become adept at taking on developers and bureaucrats to protect his neighbourhood over the past decade. Mexico's national Azteca Stadium – the largest in Latin America – is a sprawling complex. The stadium's perimeter will be expanded to include new shopping and leisure centres, and there will be renovation of the Azteca itself. They include Indigenous and native people, as well as the Santa Úrsula Coapa community, located just a stone's throw from the main entrance. These individuals, many living in poverty, are quietly being affected by the World Cup plans, according to Ramírez. Chief among grievances is water – or the lack of it. The community's water supply already experiences regular outages, and residents say it will be further threatened by stadium expansion due to increased demand. Water shortages are common across Mexico City, where ageing infrastructure loses an estimated 30-40% of supply and rapid population growth has caused demand to outstrip the locally available renewable freshwater resources. Many neighbourhoods routinely face rationing or water truck deliveries, especially in poorer areas. The Santa Úrsula community says this contract was illegal and has contributed to over-exploitation, with extraction now required at a depth of 400 metres against the original 80 metres. On 1 May, Lara was arrested alongside a colleague while protesting against the World Cup stadium expansion. The arrest was captured in a video widely shared on social media. The charges were quickly dropped, but she says her arrest was part of a wider trend to silence protesters. The office of Mexico City's mayor, Clara Brugada, did not reply to a request for comment. However, during a community visit in May after protests, Brugada seemed to acknowledge the problem. Quoted by local media, she said Mexico could not be “hosting a World Cup if next to the great Azteca stadium we have a lack of water, flooding or other kinds of problems”. Activists say no action has been taken since the meetings. Their central plea is for the private concession, which extracts 450m litres of water annually, to be withdrawn. There is palpable excitement in this nation of football fanatics that Mexico will host the international tournament for the third time. John Horne, a retired British professor of sport and sociology, has studied mega-events like the World Cup. His research found that these spectacles often involve the “routinisation of harm to local populations”, with the diversion of critical urban resources a key factor. His study also showed that the much-cited benefits of mega-events are often spread highly unevenly and the occasions frequently fail to deliver promised legacies, with notorious examples including South Africa's staging of the 2010 Fifa World Cup. The capital alone expects to invest $250m (£190m) in infrastructure, along with promising jobs and improved services. Economic advancement would be welcome for communities surrounding the stadium, which are generally not well off. Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team It may be a good sign that house prices in the area have risen above average, in anticipation of the games. Yet Lara suspects residents will see little economic benefit from the World Cup – at best, small earnings from charging for parking or selling drinks. She says: “We're going to get a tiny slice.” Since then, life for the community has become nearly unbearable on match days, with extreme traffic congestion, resource depletion and noise pollution. Though smaller in scale, he says they brought little positive change and worries that promises of infrastructure improvement to the immediate area is a distraction from the underlying issues. The constitution stipulates that authorities must legally consult local communities and leaders such as Ramírez when constructing on Indigenous land. They have failed to do so adequately, he argues. The plans, he says, were publicly announced without prior consultation. Worse, other projects are being touted to take advantage of the World Cup buzz – including a dinosaur theme park. If redevelopment occurs, families will lose homes to make way for lorries. Lara adds that the World Cup is being used to justify wider urbanisation plans and “gentrification” without regard for environmental and social challenges. Legal protections technically exist to prevent the urban forest's destruction, but the government has failed to give solid assurances that communities will be spared construction. Developers continue to visit the site, and Televisa's longstanding plans for a large luxury residential project nearby remain under discussion. For Ramírez, it's a reminder of inherent tensions with development and how Indigenous rights remain sidelined.</p>

U.S. men's national team and Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie was the target of racist remarks during Sunday's game in Italy against Parma.

McKennie was training with his Juventus teammates after the Serie A game when the incident took place. 

The USMNT midfielder came on as a substitute in the 89th minute of the 2-0 win. In a statement, the club added that it had reported the incident to the authorities. 

McKennie was the target of racial abuse last season as well. Following a Coppa Italia match against Lazio in April, Juventus said it was launching an investigation against Lazio fans for racist remarks against the player. In November 2024, McKennie and several of his teammates were subject to abuse by Fiorentina fans. 

McKennie has been at Juventus since 2021, which included a brief loan to English club Leeds United in 2023. With Juve, he has 151 appearances and 13 goals but has often been linked to a move away from Italy. 

McKennie is expected to be part of the U.S. squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.</p>
