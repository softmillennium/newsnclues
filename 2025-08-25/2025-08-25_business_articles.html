                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Monday that the Department of Justice will sue California over Gov. Gavin Newsom's efforts to draw a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map. The redistricting push in California was ignited by a similar effort underway in Texas to gerrymander key House districts to more heavily favor Republicans. "I think I'm going to be filing a lawsuit pretty soon, and I think we're going to be very successful in it," Trump said of Newsom's redistricting push during a lengthy press event in the Oval Office. "We're going to be filing it through the Department of Justice. Newsom promptly responded on social media: "BRING IT." Trump's announcement that the government intends to challenge the California plan came just days after he praised Texas Republican legislators' efforts to codify a new map that would give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races in the 2026 midterm elections. That map passed the Texas state Senate early Saturday morning, sending it to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk to be signed into law. Trump previously told CNBC that the GOP was "entitled to five more seats" in Texas. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's remarks. House redistricting efforts typically take place every 10 years, after each new U.S. Census reveals changes in population distribution. Newsom, who is widely viewed as a 2028 presidential contender, has led the charge for the Democratic Party by advocating for California to redraw its own congressional map, to serve as a counterweight to Texas. Newsom last week signed two redistricting bills, setting up a special election in November on whether to finalize the new California congressional map. Trump pressured Texas Republicans to push for that state's redistricting, underscoring how crucial the president believes it is for Republicans to maintain control of both chambers of Congress. But Trump already faces headwinds: His approval ratings are declining, according to numerous polls, and the incumbent president's party tends to lose seats in the midterms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett is not in the market to buy another railroad but he did meet with the CEO of CSX and discuss greater cooperation, he told CNBC's Becky Quick on Monday. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Buffett and CEO designate Greg Abel met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs in Omaha on Aug. 3 in his office alone without any advisors present. They made clear to Hinrichs that they would not make a bid for CSX, but believed they could cooperate more and gain some of the same benefits from combining the two companies. CSX shares fell more than 5% on the news. Buffett's comments come after Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF and CSX announced a partnership to provide new coast-to-coast rail services on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump cast doubt Monday on the United States' ability to do business with South Korea, hours before hosting the key trade partner's new leader at the White House for an in-person summit. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June following a snap election, is expected to discuss investment details in the nations' trade agreement and a shipbuilding deal during his visit. But just before Lee's arrival at the White House, Trump painted South Korea as a nation in turmoil, saying on social media that the country appears to be experiencing a "purge" or a "revolution." "WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA?" he wrote in the all-caps post on his social media platform. "We can't have that and do business there," he continued. When asked about his post later on Monday, Trump said that he heard there were raids on churches in South Korea in recent days and that the government "even went into our military base and got information." "They probably shouldn't have done that," he said during an executive order signing event in the Oval Office, before his meeting with the South Korean president. News reports show that investigators have conducted searches at churches and the Osan Air Base as part of its probe into South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, on corruption charges. Trump's surprise comments could foreshadow a frostier negotiation than what South Korean leaders had wanted. Coming just months after Lee took office, the Trump meeting is a pivotal foreign policy test for the newly elected president. But he also said at the time that South Korea "will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President." Since then, questions have emerged over the investment pledge and how it would be structured. One other point of discussion likely to be front and center at the meeting is a deal to boost U.S. shipbuilding in South Korea. South Korean officials have announced a $150 billion proposal, which they've dubbed "Make America Shipbuilding Great Again," seeking to revive U.S. shipbuilding. Another topic likely to be discussed is the future of the more than 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. Trump wants South Korea to take on more responsibility in its defense efforts so that the U.S. troops can focus on China, but South Korea worries that doing so could leave the country more vulnerable to threats from North Korea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Monday that the United States is with South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, "100%," during the leaders' high-stakes meeting just weeks after the two countries reached an 11th hour trade deal. The bilateral touched on boosting the shipbuilding industry — with Trump saying that the U.S. will buy ships from South Korea — as well as national security and trade. Lee, who took office in June following a snap election, began his summit with Trump by praising the appearance of the Oval Office as "bright and beautiful," foreshadowing what would be a largely amicable first meeting between the two leaders. Just months after Lee took office, his meeting with Trump was a pivotal foreign policy test for the newly elected president. Trump's praise of the new South Korean president came just hours after he painted South Korea as a nation in turmoil, saying on social media that the country appears to be experiencing a "purge" or a "revolution." Trump appeared to be referring to news reports showing that investigators have conducted searches at churches and the Osan Air Base as part of a probe into South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, on corruption charges. "It didn't sound to me like South Korea," Trump said during the meeting. Diplomacy loomed large over the meeting, and Lee asked for Trump's role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, even suggesting the creation of a Trump Tower in North Korea. Trump touted his "great relationship" with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, and said he "looks forward to meeting with" him again. "We can do big progress with North Korea," Trump also said. The two nations reached a trade deal last month that capped tariffs on South Korea's exports to the U.S. at 15%. But Trump suggested Monday that he is open to holding continued conversations with South Korea, but he appeared unlikely to budge on the tariff rate. Trump also said when he announced the deal that South Korea "will give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as President." Since then, questions have emerged over the investment pledge and how it would be structured. This is a developing story and will be updated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's xAI sued Apple and OpenAI on Monday, accusing the pair of an "anticompetitive scheme" to thwart artificial intelligence rivals. The lawsuit, filed by Musk's AI startup xAI and its social network business X, alleges Apple and OpenAI have "colluded" to maintain monopolies in the smartphone and generative AI markets. It accuses Apple of deprioritizing so-called super apps and generative AI chatbot competitors, such as xAI's Grok, in its App Store rankings, while favoring OpenAI by integrating its ChatGPT chatbot into Apple products. "In a desperate bid to protect its smartphone monopoly, Apple has joined forces with the company that most benefits from inhibiting competition and innovation in AI: OpenAI, a monopolist in the market for generative AI chatbots," according to the complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. An OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement, "This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment." Representatives from Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The Tesla CEO launched xAI in 2023 in a bid to compete with OpenAI and other leading chatbot makers. Musk earlier this month threatened to sue Apple for "an unequivocal antitrust violation," saying in a post on X that the company "is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store." After Musk threatened to sue Apple, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded, "This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like." An Apple spokesperson previously said that its App Store was designed to be "fair and free of bias," and that the company features "thousands of apps" using a variety of signals. Apple last year partnered with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iPhone, iPad, Mac laptop and desktop products. Several users replied to Musk's post on X via its Community Notes feature saying that rival chatbot apps such as DeepSeek and Perplexity were ranked No. 1 on the App Store after Apple and OpenAI announced their partnership. Musk co-founded OpenAI alongside Altman in 2015, before leaving the startup in 2018 due to disagreements over OpenAI's direction. In a counterclaim, OpenAI has alleged that Musk and xAI engaged in "harassment" through litigation, attacks on social media and in the press, and through a "sham bid" to buy the ChatGPT-maker for $97.4 billion designed to harm the company's business relationships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia announced Monday that its latest robotics chip module, the Jetson AGX Thor, is now on sale for $3,499 as a developer kit. The first kits ship next month, Nvidia said last week, and the chips will allow customers to create robots. After a company uses the developer kit to prototype their robot, Nvidia will sell Thor T5000 modules that can be installed in production-ready robots. If a company needs more than 1,000 Thor chips, Nvidia will charge $2,999 per module. CEO Jensen Huang has said robotics is the company's largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence, which has led to Nvidia's overall sales more than tripling in the past two years. "We do not build robots, we do not build cars, but we enable the whole industry with our infrastructure computers and the associated software," said Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president of robotics and edge AI, on a call with reporters Friday. The Jetson Thor chips are based on a Blackwell graphics processor, which is Nvidia's current generation of technology used in its AI chips, as well as its chips for computer games. That allows them to run generative AI models, including large language models and visual models that can interpret the world around them, which is essential for humanoid robots, Nvidia said. The Jetson Thor chips are equipped with 128GB of memory, which is essential for big AI models. Companies including Agility Robotics, Amazon, Meta and Boston Dynamics are using its Jetson chips, Nvidia said. Nvidia has also invested in robotics companies such as Field AI. However, robotics remains a small business for Nvidia, accounting for about 1% of the company's total revenue, despite the fact that it has launched several new robot chips since 2014. The company said its Jetson Thor chips can be used for self-driving cars as well, especially from Chinese brands. Nvidia calls its car chips Drive AGX, and while they are similar to its robotics chips, they run an operating system called Drive OS that's been tuned for automotive purposes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel on Monday warned of "adverse reactions" from investors, employees and others to the Trump administration taking a 10% stake in the company, in a filing citing risks involved with the deal. A key concern area is international sales, with 76% of Intel's revenue in its last fiscal year coming from outside the U.S., according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For Intel's international customers, the company is now directly tied to President Donald Trump's ever-shifting tariff and trade policies. "There could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors," the company wrote in the filing. "There may also be litigation related to the transaction or otherwise and increased public or political scrutiny with respect to the Company." Intel also said that the potential for a changing political landscape in Washington could challenge or void the deal and create risks to current and future shareholders. The deal, which was announced Friday, gives the Department of Commerce up to 433.3 million shares of the company, which is dilutive to existing shareholders. The purchase of shares is being funded largely by money already awarded to Intel under President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act. Trump called the agreement "a great Deal for America" and said the building of advanced chips "is fundamental to the future of our Nation." Shares of Intel rallied as momentum built toward a deal in August, with the stock up about 25% for the month so far. However, the filing notes that Commerce may vote its shares against any move that might unwind the deal or otherwise reject the government's stake in Intel. Furthermore, the company acknowledged in the filing that it has not completed an analysis of all "financial, tax and accounting implications." Intel's tumultuous fiscal 2024 included the exit of CEO Pat Gelsinger in December after a four-year tenure during which the stock price tanked and the company lost ground to rivals in the artificial intelligence boom. CEO Lip-Bu Tan took the helm in March. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking a road trip in an EV is no easy feat, as two Tesla alumni found out the hard way. Range is already a significant anxiety for EV owners taking long journeys, and towing a heavy RV can cause an electric vehicle battery to drain even faster. Toby Kraus and Ben Parker, two ex-Tesla employees who each spent five years working at the EV giant, say they have an answer. The two founders, who live in California and Colorado, respectively, took a cross-country trip ahead of their first pitch for the new EV startup. "I rented a Tesla Model X and a trailer, and towed it, laboriously, all the way out to Colorado to meet him," said Parker. Things took a turn outside Grand Junction, Utah, when a strong headwind meant the Model X began to run out of charge just as it began to get dark. "We'd been deep in conversation about the company we wanted to start, and looked down at the range meter and realized we were not going to make it to the next charger," said Parker. Parker and Kraus briefly considered using a tiny 1800-watt gas generator to charge the Tesla, one mile at a time, before ditching the trailer at an exit ramp and "crawling" to the nearest supercharger. It is a nightmare to go trailering with an EV today," said Parker, who described the initial road trip as a key part of Lightship's inception. "There are plenty of products now that have 300, 350-mile range, which is awesome, but guess what? If you use them to tow, all of a sudden your range drops by two-thirds," he said. Lightship, which has raised over $60 million since it was founded in 2020, now employs around 100 people at its Colorado base. In addition to the limited edition $250,000 AE.1 "Cosmo", the company is working on more affordable versions of its motorized electric RV, which are set to cost from $151,000 to $184,000 and begin deliveries in the Spring of next year. Parker added that the tariffs had been a factor in Lightspeed's decision-making as it sets up its supply chain, and said that they had been inspired by Tesla's approach of trying to build vehicles where it sells them. Despite this, Kraus said the company had still faced tariff-related turmoil. I think we've built the business plan and overall strategy in manufacturing here to be resilient to this," he said. "Any complex hardware manufacturing company in the modern age is going to be impacted," he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense stocks have soared this year as European governments ramp up military budgets, and the spending spree could deliver a windfall in another corner of the market. "As markets focus on Russia-Ukraine talks and as European defense spending ramps up, we estimate a large boost to industrial metals demand from rising EU defense spending," wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a Thursday note. The MSCI Europe Aerospace and Defense Index has surged 72% higher this year to date. The rally in defense stocks followed the European Union's commitments to boost military budgets amid heightened security concerns — and renewed pressure from Washington for NATO allies to spend more. Goldman estimates Europe's rearmament will lift the region's overall demand for industrial metals by 6% by 2027 — an "impressive" jump given that defense made up only about 2% of Europe's metals use in 2023. Copper — one of the world's most commonly used metals — stands out. Goldman estimates the defense-driven bump could lift global copper demand growth from 2% to 2.4% annually. The boom in AI data center infrastructure is also driving demand for copper. The demand from defense and AI could ripple into prices. Goldman flagged upside risk to its 2026 and 2027 copper price forecasts of $10,000 and $10,750 per metric ton, respectively, even as high inventories may cap gains in the near term. Benchmark 3-month copper futures on the London Metal Exchange are trading around $9,797 per ton.</p>
