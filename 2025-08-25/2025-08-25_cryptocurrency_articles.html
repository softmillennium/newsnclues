                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's Jackson Hole gains evaporated after an assortment of BTC holder cohorts began to distribute. Bitcoin's sharp rebound after Jackson Hole fizzled into a bearish weekly engulfing candle. Seasonal weakness and spot BTC ETF fatigue raise risks of a drop toward $100,000–$92,000. It marked BTC's strongest daily return since July 10, fueling optimism for another leg toward fresh all-time highs. However, momentum quickly evaporated, with Bitcoin reversing over the weekend and sliding to $110,600 on Monday. A bearish weekly engulfing candle underscores downside vulnerability, as onchain data points to broad distribution among holders. The synchronized behavior across wallet sizes highlights uniform sell-side pressure, weighing on price stability. Similarly, analyst Boris Vest notes a split across wallet behavior: smaller holders (0–1 BTC) have steadily accumulated since the peak, while 1–10 BTC wallets resumed buying below $107,000. The realized price for one to three-month holders sits at $111,900, while the three to six-month and 6–12 month cohorts are anchored much lower at $91,630 and $89,200, respectively. The wide gap reflects heavy short-term positioning near recent highs, versus longer-term holders with cost bases closer to $90,000. Market analysis suggests that if Bitcoin loses $105,000, the lack of dense cost support between current levels and $90,000 could accelerate downside momentum. Related: Bitcoin late longs wiped out as sub-$110K BTC price calls grow louder The current pullback also aligns with Bitcoin's seasonal tendencies. Cointelegraph reported that this period has often coincided with softer risk appetite and profit-taking among traders. Based on these averages, a retreat toward the $105,000–$100,000 range remains consistent with seasonal patterns and technical support zones. Adding to the cautious tone, crypto trader Roman Trading flags structural risks in BTC's current rally. The analyst said that BTC/EUR has not registered a new all-time high since last year, suggesting that recent upside is more closely tied to a weakening US dollar than organic demand. Roman further warns that the post-spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch enthusiasm may be fading, with higher-timeframe exhaustion resembling past distribution phases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Treasury ETHZilla Reveals $250 Million Buyback After Stock Craters ETHZilla Corporation—a publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm formerly known as 180 Life Sciences—announced Monday that its board has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $250 million of the company's outstanding shares, effective immediately. Last week's price decline came as the company filed with the SEC on Friday to offer 74.8 million convertible shares, as part of an agreement reached on August 8. ETHZilla has given up most of its recent gains following last week's price plunge, with the stock showing a less than 5% rise over the last month. The Palm Beach, Florida-based company also disclosed it now holds 102,237 ETH at an average acquisition price of $3,948.72, valued at approximately $474 million as of this writing. The firm also has about $215 million in cash equivalents. "At ETHZilla, we continue to deploy capital to accelerate our Ethereum treasury strategy with discipline and record speed," said ETHZilla Executive Chairman McAndrew Rudisill, in a release. "As we continue to scale our ETH reserves and pursue differentiated yield opportunities, we believe an aggressive stock repurchase program at the current stock price underscores our commitment to maximizing value for shareholders." The stock repurchase program is scheduled to expire by June 30, 2026, or when $250 million in shares has been repurchased. The program will be funded through working capital and potential future fundraising efforts. The price of Ethereum hit an all-time high Friday for the first time in nearly four years, and continued to rise higher on Sunday, peaking at a new record of $4,946 according to data from CoinGecko.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The next billion-dollar SPX6900 ‘index' coin – TOKEN6900 (T6900) – must end its ICO in just three days, so there's no time to lose to get in on the price action. Available to purchase for just $0.0071, the token prides itself on being the ultimate ‘vibe liquidity' asset to save your wealth from the avarice and incompetence of legacy finance. TOKEN6900 makes no pretense about tracking an underlying asset class like stocks, bonds or oil – T6900 is pegged to the meme zeitgeist. Sure, there might be an 84% chance that Fed chairman Jerome Powell will cut rates in September, and equity markets will hit new records as a result, but some of that euphoria could be wearing off already. Are we about to see the mother of all sell-offs, or are asset prices about to reach the stars (moon)? Well, if you buy into T6900 token you really don't need to worry your pretty head about such things, because T6900 is a commitment to the raw future of finance, where brain rot is celebrated and degen enthusiasm is a feature, not a bug. Although it may not yet have sunk in for Warren Buffett and other value investors, the new crypto-led realities of finance mean that there is money to be made from the memeification of everything that moves. So, after you've maybe bought a top 10 altcoin like ETH or SOL, don't forget to sprinkle in some meme coin stardust to magnify your portfolio returns and deliver you from the drudgery of the 401(k) blues. Remember, the FOMO is building with only three days to go before TOKEN6900 starts trading on decentralized exchanges. At a market cap of $1.17 billion, SPX6900 is still the one to watch, for now, as far as index coins go. Its blend of frivolity and poke-in-the-eye irreverence is what has attracted bleary-eyed traders on the hunt for the next big thing. The same thing is happening all over again with T6900. Although we have our doubts about Buffett's wisdom regarding his analysis of crypto, we agree with him that investors should be greedy when others are fearful. Bitcoin has pulled back to $111,434, ETH hit an all-time high at $4,953 yesterday, and then a whale sold big, leading to a flash crash. OG degens know a buying opportunity when they see one, and this is it. Although you are probably not thinking about it yet (leave that to mom and pop), there will be only one true way forward for your future retirement plan – the monetization of viral engagement. But you are always thinking about making money, which means that, regardless of pensions, T6900 token is your essential late-capitalism exit liquidity. If that doesn't get the juices going, then you are playing in the wrong asset class pool. Perhaps you should grab yourself some Nvidia stock instead and cry later when the top pops? TOKEN6900 is crypto's first Non-Corrupt Token (NCT), although many other coins likely claim similar censorship-resistant attributes. This hot presale is launching very soon, as the Cilinix Crypto YouTube channel reminds its 100k subscribers. These 1,000x opportunities don't come by every day, so you have been warned: don't wait this one out a moment longer than necessary. Do your due diligence if you must, but all you need to know is that it is a consciousness parasite like the worm in Robert F. Kennedy Jr's brain worm. TOKEN6900 is here to make your dreams of financial freedom come true – and you can earn dynamic staking rewards of 33% per annum too. T6900 is audited by Coinsult and SolidProof so no need to worry about sketchy code or rug pulls. You're in good hands with Best Wallet because it recently became WalletConnect Certified.

The firm's fundraising drew backing from some of the most active investors in digital assets, including ParaFi, Pantera, FalconX, CoinFund and Arrington Capital. Alice Zhang, co-founder of Solana-backed project Jambo, also joined the firm as chief investment officer and board member. Sharps is the latest public firm pivoting to accumulate cryptocurrencies, a recent trend that has captivated stock markets. These firms, often dubbed digital asset treasuries (DATs), raise money on capital markets to buy cryptos, aiming to replicate the success of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR). The fever has already extended to Solana, with SOL Strategies (HODL), DeFi Development (DFDV) and Upexi (UPXI) being among listed firms stacking SOL. However, they could come under pressure during market downturns when the premium contracts, capping their ability to raise funds to fuel purchases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SBI partners with Chainlink to develop blockchain tools, enabling tokenized assets, cross-border payments, and transparent finance across Asia. SBI Group, one of Japan's leading financial companies, has announced a major partnership with Chainlink. Chainlink is a global blockchain platform that helps connect real-world data to smart contracts. Thus, it provides the appropriate setting to trial and release new blockchain-based tools. This may be in the form of buildings, bonds, or even funds. These applications may enable the financial firms to make faster and cheaper transactions. In addition, they will utilize the Chainlink technology to guarantee transparency, including on-chain proof of stablecoin reserves. A survey by SBI Digital Assets Department has revealed that more than 76 percent of financial institutions intend to invest in tokenized securities. These companies are aiming at reducing expenses and settlement periods. A lot of them, however, are also dissatisfied with the state of the existing infrastructure, in which case it is not suitable enough to make serious investments. This is where the services of Chainlink come in. This system enables the safe yet confidential transfers between blockchains. Besides, Chainlink SmartData will facilitate bringing crucial data, such as net asset value (NAV), on-chain to tokenized funds. Furthermore, the two companies will work on improving foreign exchange (FX) and cross-border payments. Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, said that it has been a good experience collaborating with SBI. Similarly, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of SBI Holdings, reported that Chainlink is an ideal partner. He commended the on-chain capabilities and international scope of Chainlink. He further stated that the collaboration would assist in making safe and regulation-friendly solutions. These tools will facilitate the use of stablecoins and tokenized assets in international trade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drug delivery solutions company Sharps Technology, Inc. has announced a private placement financing valued at more than $400 million to support the creation of a digital asset treasury centered on Solana's native token, SOL. According to a Monday press release revealing the funding round, the private investment in public equity transaction (PIPE) will include the purchase and sale of common stock, pre-funded warrants, and stapled warrants. Each unit was priced at $6.50, scheduled to close around August 28, 2025, the company's announcement read. Sharps Technology mentioned that stapled warrants will be exercisable for three years at $9.75, 150% of the per-unit price. Investors who choose to fund their purchases with SOL, locked or unlocked, will receive pre-funded warrants and warrants exercisable once the company receives stockholder approval. According to Google Finance data, shares of Sharps Technology, STSS, traded 4.4% higher in the US premarket trading session, climbing to $11.90 within the day. Sharps Technology is a Nasdaq-listed company in the medical device and pharmaceutical packaging business, where it supplies safety syringe products to healthcare providers. The health technology firm has reportedly signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Solana Foundation, a non-profit based in Zug, Switzerland. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is the lead placement agent for the transaction, while Aegis Capital Corp. served as co-placement agent. Madison Global Partners LLC provided financial advisory services to the company. “Solana defines the standard for digital infrastructure, providing a high-throughput, low-cost, real-time settlement layer for everything from blue-chip equities to bonds to private assets,” Alice Zhang, Sharps Technology's newly appointed Chief Investment Officer and board member, told reporters. The company also appointed James Zhang, co-founder of Jambo, who has previously spoken at Solana Breakpoint, Davos, and Forbes events, in an advisory capacity. Meanwhile, Solana's native token, SOL, is trading at around $195, well below its 5, 10, and 20-hour moving averages, according to Coingecko data. Loss from operations totaled $5,028,151, with heavy expenditures falling on research and development, as well as general administrative costs. However, the company reported a net income of $5,488,141 for the quarter, from a fair market value gain of $11,087,700 on warrants. Basic and diluted net income per share came to $10.45, a figure significantly affected by the warrant valuation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sharps Technology, a small medical device and pharmaceutical packaging company, announced Monday that it plans to sell $400 million worth of its stock to fund a treasury for Solana, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Large crypto investment funds like ParaFi, Pantera Capital, and CoinFund contributed to the raise. Alice Zhang, a venture capitalist and cofounder of crypto smartphone maker Jambo, will join the board of Sharps and become the company's chief investment officer. James Zhang, another cofounder of the smartphone company, will join as a strategic advisor and consultant. “We will have a team with deep ties to the Solana ecosystem and proven founder-level experience in scaling institutional digital asset platforms,” Alice Zhang said in a statement. DeFi Development Corp., another public company that amasses Solana, has a bit more than $250 million. But Sharps' position as frontrunner may be short-lived. Crypto heavyweights Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto are in the market to raise $1 billion to start their own Solana treasury company, according to a report from Bloomberg, which cited anonymous sources. A spokesperson for Jump Crypto declined to comment. The investment into Sharps comes on the heels of a slew of announcements from small public companies to establish so-called digital asset treasuries, or pools of cryptocurrency held on companies' balance sheets. The strategy was first popularized by the data analytics software company Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy, which started buying up Bitcoin in 2020. Michael Saylor, Strategy's cofounder and executive chairman, became one of Bitcoin's biggest boosters as his company added more and more of the token to its balance sheet. As the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency increased and Strategy added more and more of it to its balance sheet, the company's share price surged, as traders bought up its stock as a proxy for Bitcoin. Other small publicly traded companies began adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet in the hopes of pops in their stocks.

On Monday, August 25, Sharps Technology announced  that its $400 million private placement offering would support plans to adopt a digital treasury strategy centered on SOL. Sharps Technology (Nasdaq: STSS / STSSW) completed a $400M PIPE financing to build the world's largest Solana (SOL) treasury, with investors including ParaFi, Pantera, and Monarq. It signed an MoU with the Solana Foundation to buy $50M SOL at a 15% discount.… “Global adoption of Solana's ecosystem is accelerating as it continues to receive institutional support for its vision of a single global market for every tradeable asset, making now the right time to establish a digital asset treasury strategy with SOL,” said Chief Investment Officer Alice Zhang. Sharps Technology also intends to assemble a team with deep ties to the Solana ecosystem and “proven founder-level experience” in scaling digital asset platforms. Sharps has recently faced pressures  related to Nasdaq compliance and strained cash reserves , which may have influenced its pivot into the digital asset space. In recent months, digital asset treasuries have become a growing strategy among firms seeking new sources of value and visibility. Ethereum has been a popular choice for many corporate treasuries this year. Alongside strong corporate interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is now entering a defining moment. The plan reportedly involves acquiring an existing public company and converting it into a Solana reserve.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rise of blockchain technology has transformed how businesses and investors approach fundraising, with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) emerging as one of the most powerful tools for project financing. Designed to ensure interoperability, security, and ease of integration, ERC20 has played a crucial role in building investor confidence and providing a framework for developers to create reliable digital assets. In a market often criticized for volatility and lack of regulation, adherence to the ERC20 token standards is not merely a technical decision but a strategic one, as it helps organizations establish credibility, ensure compliance, and foster trust among investors who are increasingly cautious about where they place their capital. These standards establish a set of universally recognized rules that allow tokens to interact seamlessly with wallets, exchanges, and decentralized applications. For ICOs, this not only means greater accessibility and reduced friction but also an added layer of credibility that reassures investors. In an industry where technical flaws can quickly erode confidence, adopting ERC20 is about creating stability and consistency in the marketplace, enabling projects to grow while maintaining trust and transparency. Interoperability Across Platforms: ERC20 tokens are universally recognized across wallets and exchanges, meaning investors don't need specialized tools or platforms to interact with them. This ease of use makes ICO participation seamless and attracts a wider investor base. Reducing Technical Barriers for Developers: With clear guidelines in place, developers don't need to reinvent token mechanics for every project. Building Investor Trust: Investors are more likely to participate in ICOs backed by ERC20-compliant tokens because these tokens guarantee compatibility and minimize risks associated with poorly designed smart contracts. Foundation for Regulation: As global regulators begin to examine the cryptocurrency market, ERC20 provides a solid standard that aligns with the push toward greater accountability, transparency, and compliance. As ICO fundraising continues to evolve, regulatory compliance has become a central concern for projects and investors alike. ERC20 offers a foundation that projects can build upon to meet Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and transparency requirements. For startups, this means not only avoiding penalties but also appealing to a broader audience of institutional investors who demand accountability. Global Regulatory Landscape: Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to ICO regulation, with some embracing innovation while others impose strict guidelines. Understanding these differences is vital for ICO organizers who want to operate across multiple regions. By embedding these practices, ICOs can protect investors and prevent misuse of funds. Following ERC20 standards makes it easier to provide this transparency in a verifiable way. Long-Term Investor Confidence: ICOs that prioritize compliance not only reduce legal risks but also build stronger relationships with institutional investors who are cautious about regulatory uncertainties. Trust is at the heart of every successful fundraising initiative, and in the world of ICOs, establishing it can make or break a project. ERC20 tokens help projects foster trust by providing a transparent, secure, and verifiable framework that reassures investors about where and how their funds are being used. With strict coding standards, clear token mechanics, and visibility of transactions on the blockchain, ERC20 makes it easier for investors to verify claims and monitor progress. This transparency, combined with robust community engagement, ensures that projects not only attract investors but also maintain their confidence over the long term. Security of Smart Contracts: ERC20 defines strict rules for token transactions, which reduces the chance of bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Transparency in Token Supply and Movement: Since all ERC20 token movements are visible on the blockchain, investors can independently verify supply, distribution, and transactions. This level of transparency is rarely seen in traditional fundraising. Community Engagement: With clear token standards, projects can easily involve their community in audits, feedback, and verification, further strengthening trust between project teams and investors. ERC20 doesn't just provide compliance and trust benefits—it also delivers significant technical advantages that make ICO fundraising more efficient. Standardized token functions reduce errors, increase reliability, and simplify integration with platforms across the blockchain ecosystem. These technical strengths are why ERC20 remains the gold standard in ICO fundraising. Ease of Integration with Exchanges: Because ERC20 tokens are widely accepted, getting listed on major exchanges becomes more straightforward, improving liquidity for investors. Standardized Functions for Transactions: Functions like transfer, approve, and balance Of ensure that token interactions are consistent across platforms, reducing the risk of transaction errors. Lower Development Costs: Instead of creating custom code from scratch, developers can rely on ERC20 templates, cutting down on costs and speeding up ICO launch timelines. Compatibility with Decentralized Finance (DeFi): ERC20 tokens are easily integrated into the DeFi ecosystem, giving investors more opportunities to stake, lend, or trade their tokens after an ICO. ICO fundraising involves more than launching a token; it requires strategic planning, clear communication, and long-term vision. ERC20 provides a reliable technical framework, but success comes from how effectively organizers manage transparency, compliance, and investor relations. Ultimately, these lessons help ensure that ICOs not only raise funds but also deliver lasting value to their investors. Leverage Professional Expertise: Collaborating with experienced blockchain consultants or even a trc20 token development company can provide insights into token design, smart contract security, and compliance alignment. Plan for Long-Term Growth: ICO fundraising is not just about raising initial capital—it's about creating a sustainable token economy that attracts ongoing investor support. Investor protection has always been a crucial topic in financial markets, and the ICO space is no exception. For ICOs, this protection translates into stronger participation and more sustainable growth opportunities. Investors can filter out low-quality or non-compliant projects more easily. Improving Investor Education: Since ERC20 has become widely known, investors understand how the tokens work and what to look for, reducing the likelihood of falling into deceptive schemes. Enabling Safer Multi-Chain Expansion: With the rise of alternative chains, some projects seek expertise from a trc20 token development company to ensure similar standards and investor safeguards when build The landscape of blockchain tokens has expanded significantly, with various standards emerging to meet different project requirements. This section explores ERC20's benchmark status, the rise of alternatives, challenges in cross-chain integration, and why ERC20 remains the preferred choice for ICO projects. Partnering with a trc20 token development company ensures smooth adoption for multi-chain projects. Why ERC20 Still Leads With its maturity, extensive ecosystem support, and recognition among regulators, ERC20 continues to dominate ICO fundraising. Launching a successful ERC20-compliant ICO requires more than following technical specifications; it involves a strategic approach that ensures security, transparency, and investor confidence. Organizers must focus on smart contract integrity, clear tokenomics, effective community engagement, and strong partnerships to maximize fundraising potential. Understanding the best practices not only mitigates risks but also establishes credibility in a competitive market. This section covers essential strategies that ICO teams should adopt to deliver reliable, investor-friendly, and compliant token offerings that stand out in the blockchain ecosystem. Smart Contract Auditing Independent audits help detect vulnerabilities before launch, ensuring investor funds remain safe. Clear Tokenomics Design Transparent allocation, vesting schedules, and use-of-funds statements give investors confidence in the long-term vision. In an environment where the credibility of digital assets is constantly questioned, adhering to ERC20 standards allows projects to stand out as trustworthy and professional. Looking forward, partnerships with experts such as a trc20 token development company can help projects navigate the complexities of compliance, technical implementation, and multi-chain ecosystems. Ultimately, ICOs that embrace strong token standards, prioritize compliance, and foster investor trust are best positioned for long-term success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past few months the European Central Bank has frequently cited the expansive US approach to stablecoins as triggering urgency for a digital euro. The 2024 central bank digital currency (CBDC) survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found that a third of central banks have intensified efforts on their CBDC work in response to developments with stablecoins and other cryptoassets. However, the drop was more significant in emerging markets. The definition of ‘work' includes research, pilots or working towards production initiatives. The survey expanded its coverage from CBDC to include tokenization and briefly covers stablecoins and crypto. For stablecoins, most central banks reported trivial mainstream usage or use by niche groups, with around one fifth saying they are seeing some usage for domestic payments, remittances or cross border retail payments. However, a few emerging market central banks cited more significant usage, with cross border retail payments (2% of central banks) and remittances (4% of respondents) showing the highest responses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price fell below $112,000 as Japanese firm Metaplanet announced the purchase of 103 BTC worth $11.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 18,991 BTC ($2.2 billion), while simultaneously being upgraded to mid-cap status in the FTSE Japan Index. Bitcoin's price retreated below $112,000 as Japan's Metaplanet announced the purchase of an additional 103 BTC worth approximately $11.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 18,991 BTC valued at roughly $2.2 billion. The index inclusion, set to take effect after market close on September 19, marks a significant milestone for corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies. The company's aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC. This financing mechanism, while diluting existing shareholders, enables continued Bitcoin accumulation without depleting cash reserves. Metaplanet's inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index creates a regulated route for BTC exposure and paves the way for other Bitcoin-forward companies to join major benchmarks. The company's transformation from a traditional hotel group to Asia's most active Bitcoin treasury firm reflects a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. In the past month alone, five public companies have announced significant Bitcoin treasury initiatives, including Ming Shing Group's $483 million purchase and KindlyMD's $679 million acquisition. The integration of Bitcoin-heavy companies into traditional equity indices presents new challenges for institutional investors. While passive inflows through index inclusion could boost liquidity and long-term stability, large movements in Bitcoin prices could create unexpected volatility for passive investors. His involvement highlights the growing intersection between traditional finance and Bitcoin treasury strategies. Metaplanet's FTSE inclusion may serve as a template for other companies looking to balance Bitcoin treasury operations with mainstream market participation. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption shows no signs of slowing, with analysts expecting more companies to announce Bitcoin treasury initiatives in the coming months. This growing institutional acceptance, coupled with innovative financing structures, suggests that corporate Bitcoin holdings could become an increasingly significant factor in both equity and Bitcoin markets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Ethereum dominates NFT market with 62% transactions in 2025, but BNB Chain, Mythos, Solana, and Immutable are rapidly gaining ground through specialized use cases and efficiency. - BNB Chain leads in high-value NFT sales ($19.4M/week) with low fees, while Mythos outperforms Solana in transaction volume ($9.7M/week) via gaming and sports partnerships. - Immutable focuses on secure gaming NFTs with 19,589 transactions/week, and Solana maintains broad user engagement despite rising competition from niche-focused chains. - Emerging investment trends include hybrid NFTs, Bitcoin-based Ordinals, and utility-driven tokens, as diversified portfolios combining Ethereum and alternative chains become critical for long-term value capture. The NFT market has entered a new era of diversification, with blockchain networks beyond Ethereum carving out significant niches in sales volume, transaction efficiency, and specialized use cases. While Ethereum remains the dominant force—accounting for 62% of NFT transactions in 2025—the rise of alternative chains like BNB Chain, Mythos, Solana, and Immutable is reshaping the landscape. These platforms are not only outperforming Ethereum in specific metrics but also offering compelling investment opportunities for forward-thinking investors. Its ecosystem hosts blue-chip collections like CryptoPunks and Beeple's Everydays, which continue to command multimillion-dollar sales. OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, operates primarily on Ethereum and reported a trading volume of $14.68 billion in 2025. However, Ethereum's high gas fees and scalability limitations have spurred the growth of alternative blockchains. BNB Chain has emerged as a formidable competitor, particularly in high-value NFT trading. This suggests a shift toward larger individual sales on BNB Chain, driven by its low fees and fast processing times. BNB Chain's partnerships with NFT marketplaces and gaming platforms have further solidified its position. Mythos, a Polkadot-based blockchain, has outpaced Solana in weekly NFT sales, achieving $9.704 million with 441,450 transactions. For investors, Mythos's specialization in niche markets and its ability to process more transactions per user highlight its potential to disrupt the NFT gaming sector. Solana, while recording $7.984 million in weekly sales, maintains a larger user base with 48,856 buyers and 40,035 sellers. However, Solana faces increasing competition from more specialized chains like Mythos. Partnerships with major game studios and its focus on secure, tamper-proof NFTs make it a compelling investment for those targeting the gaming sector. Utility-Driven NFTs: Platforms offering token-gated content, membership access, and redeemable rewards are seeing sustained engagement.

HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) has achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 16 EH/s of global Bitcoin mining hashrate, marking substantial progress toward its target of 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving. The company has doubled its daily Bitcoin production to over 8 BTC since May 2025. HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) ha raggiunto un traguardo importante superando i 16 EH/s di hashrate globale per il mining di Bitcoin, segnando un progresso significativo verso l'obiettivo di 25 EH/s entro il Giorno del Ringraziamento negli USA. L'azienda prevede di raggiungere 18 EH/s nelle prossime settimane, con l'avvio della Fase 3 a Valenzuela previsto per settembre. A 25 EH/s, HIVE stima una produzione giornaliera di Bitcoin pari a 12 BTC, che rappresenterebbero quasi il 3% dell'offerta globale all'attuale difficoltà di rete. HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE)는 전 세계 비트코인 채굴 해시레이트가 16 EH/s를 돌파하는 중요한 이정표를 달성했으며, 미국 추수감사절까지 25 EH/s라는 목표를 향해 큰 진전을 보였습니다. 2025년 5월 이후 회사의 일일 비트코인 생산량은 8 BTC 이상으로 두 배 증가했습니다. 파라과이에서의 HIVE 확장에는 이미 Yguazú 2단계에서 가동 중인 5 EH/s 이상의 차세대 Bitmain S21+ Hydro 채굴기가 포함됩니다. 회사는 수주 내에 18 EH/s에 도달할 것으로 예상하며, Valenzuela에서의 3단계 배치는 9월에 시작됩니다. 25 EH/s에 도달하면 HIVE는 일일 비트코인 생산량을 12 BTC로 예상하며, 이는 현재 네트워크 난이도 기준으로 전 세계 공급의 거의 3%에 해당합니다. HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) a franchi une étape importante en dépassant les 16 EH/s de hashrate mondial pour le minage de Bitcoin, marquant des progrès notables vers son objectif de 25 EH/s d'ici Thanksgiving aux États-Unis. La société s'attend à atteindre 18 EH/s dans les prochaines semaines, avec le déploiement de la Phase 3 à Valenzuela qui débutera en septembre. HIVE Digital Technologies (NASDAQ: HIVE) hat einen wichtigen Meilenstein erreicht und die globale Bitcoin-Mining-Hashrate von 16 EH/s überschritten, womit es deutliche Fortschritte auf dem Weg zum Ziel von 25 EH/s bis zum US-Thanksgiving macht. Seit Mai 2025 hat das Unternehmen seine tägliche Bitcoin-Produktion auf über 8 BTC verdoppelt. HIVE Digital Technologies has reached a significant operational milestone, scaling its Bitcoin mining capacity to 16 EH/s, more than doubling from earlier this year. The company's growth trajectory is particularly compelling for three reasons. First, they've achieved a rapid deployment in Paraguay, with 5 EH/s of next-generation Bitmain S21+ Hydro miners already energized. Second, they're demonstrating clear execution on their roadmap with Phase 2 at Yguazú nearing completion and Phase 3 at Valenzuela beginning in September. Third, they've improved their fleet efficiency to approximately 18.4 Joules per Terahash (J/TH), enhancing unit economics through better energy utilization. At current network difficulty of 129T, each exahash generates approximately 0.50 BTC daily. This mathematically predictable relationship between hashrate and production means HIVE's projected 25 EH/s capacity would yield about 12 BTC daily, representing nearly 3% of global supply. The company's emphasis on using next-generation ASICs allows them to generate more hashrate per unit of energy consumed, effectively lowering their cost basis. With Bitcoin trading at $113,000 and network metrics indicating a hash price of $55 per PH/s per day, HIVE projects a mining margin after electrical costs of approximately 60%. HIVE's fully-funded expansion demonstrates the scalability of their business model, with significant revenue growth potential without proportional increases in overhead or labor costs. This news release constitutes a "designated news release for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024. San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - August 25, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the "Company" or "HIVE"), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, today announced that it has surpassed 16 Exahash per second ("EH/s") of global Bitcoin mining hashrate, marking another major milestone in its journey toward 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving. "Our rapid deployment in Paraguay is precision execution at scale and a true testament to the tenacity, velocity, and vision of our team," said Luke Rossy, HIVE's Chief Operating Officer. Rossy continued, "With over 5 EH/s of next-generation Bitmain S21+ Hydro miners already energized in Phase 2 at Yguazú, and new machines arriving weekly, our team, under the phenomenal leadership of Country President of Paraguay Operations, Gabriel Lamas, is working around the clock to install new machines as quickly as they arrive." Deployment will then begin at the Phase 3 Valenzuela site in September, the final stage of HIVE's fully funded path to 25 EH/s. At which point, HIVE's daily Bitcoin production is projected to reach 12 BTC per day (based on current Bitcoin network difficulty), with HIVE having a global fleet efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH, representing nearly 3% of global supply at current network difficulty. The Company's expansion demonstrates the benefits of scale and energy efficiency, with the latest generation ASICs allowing HIVE to improve unit economics by generating more hashrate per joule of energy consumed, realizing additional revenue without additional labor or corporate overhead. "The team continues to be laser-focused on executing our ambitious growth strategy. After scaling from 6 EH/s to 16 EH/s so far this year, we expect to complete Phase 2 at Yguazu on schedule, and reach 18 EH/s in the coming weeks," added Aydin Kilic, President & CEO. At today's network Difficulty of 129T, one exahash generates approximately 0.50 BTC per day, including block rewards and transaction fees. Similarly, in the previous epoch when Difficulty was 127T, one exahash generated approximately 0.51 BTC per day, including block rewards and transaction fees. This data is publicly available from Bitcoin block explorers, which make mining data available (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts#mining%20information is one example) . From that revenue, the analyst subtracts costs to determine mining margin. Electricity, our primary cost, varies by usage (mining) which means that it is tied to revenue. This transparency is what makes the mining industry unique. Unlike many industry sectors where pricing power is uncertain or revenue forecasting is complex, Bitcoin miners know how each unit of computational power converts into economic output. Each exahash deployed represents a measurable contribution to daily Bitcoin production and revenue. With disciplined capital allocation and access to low-cost energy, miners can translate scaling into predictable cash flow. In short, Bitcoin mining economics are not a mystery-they are mathematically determined, with all data being available through the Bitcoin blockchain network statistics, widely available through many popular Bitcoin block explorers. We strongly encourage investors in our industry to become familiar with the economic framework of Bitcoin mining. Once Phase 2 at the Yguazú site is fully complete in the coming weeks, HIVE expects to surpass 11.5 EH/s of capacity in Paraguay, with a global total operating hashrate of 18 EH/s, while improving global fleet efficiency to approximately 18.4 Joules per Terahash ("J/TH"). This energy efficiency is a measure of unit economics, representing how much energy the Company uses to produce one Terahash of Bitcoin compute. With Bitcoin price at $113,000 and Difficulty at 129T, the Bitcoin network hash price is approximately $55 per PH/s per day, with a global fleet efficiency of 18.4 J/TH, and HIVE's mining margin after electrical costs* would be approximately 60%. In mining, the most significant expense is power costs, in this estimate we are assuming an average of 5 cents per KWHR for indicative purposes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anurag Arjun outlines Avail's mission as a full-stack unification layer and its innovative steps toward seamless blockchain integration. Liquidity scattered across L2s, bridges kept breaking, and “data availability” turned into the new bottleneck. Founded to deliver verifiable, scalable data availability, the project now positions itself as a full-stack unification layer: a DA base, Nexus for proof-based interoperability, and Fusion for shared security that can restake ETH, BTC, and rollup tokens. In this CryptoSlate Q&A, Avail co-founder Anurag Arjun walks us through how that thesis is moving from roadmap to reality. We start with a real-world stress test: Sophon's $60 million node sale, which extended Avail's light client to production scale and hinted at new, verifiable fundraising primitives for app-specific chains. From there, we dig into EnigmaDA—encrypted data availability designed to meet institutional privacy mandates without re-introducing trusted intermediaries—along with how banks and TradFi pilots can reconcile encryption, key management, and auditability on-chain. If Avail is right, the next phase of crypto won't be “L2 vs. L2” but app-centric rollups speaking a common, proof-based language—privacy-aware when needed, credibly neutral by design, and finally usable at internet scale. Sophon adapted Avail's light client to power its $60 million node sale. The Sophon partnership was a pivotal moment; they needed custom light client infrastructure that could handle massive scale for their node sale and support their validium architecture, which Avail delivered. This proved our technology is not just capable of supporting live networks, it extended the scope of Avail, offering a tangible way to help projects with fundraising. Networks can both fundraise and scale on this technology, even with minimal technical skills (normally running verifying nodes requires server based infra and experience with the command line).The developer UX enabled Sophon to extend the existing light client and add features without friction. This has sparked a trend with more projects looking to Avail's light client infrastructure to not only support verifiable data requirements but also expand on the fundraising use case pioneered by Sophon. EnigmaDA lets rollups post fully encrypted blobs while still proving data integrity. How does this satisfy TradFi privacy mandates (KYC, trade confidentiality) without re-introducing central points of trust? This way, L2s can decide on their privacy model while leveraging Avail's public DA infrastructure. This gives institutions blockchain benefits without introducing new trust assumptions or central failure points. Avail now markets itself as a full-stack unification layer (DA + Nexus + Fusion). What pain points convinced you to go wider instead of doubling down on DA alone? The goal of Avail has always been to enable a connected and thriving blockchain ecosystem. However, once you solve that problem, you end up in the situation with a lot of L2s and a further exacerbated fragmentation problem. The first version of Nexus for example enables interoperability between 9 networks on mainnet, and the only one of those that's native to Avail is Sophon. So through this integration, Sophon (and other Avail Native chains) automatically tap into the multi-chain liquidity enabled by Nexus ($145 Billion in multichain stablecoin TVL and $95 Billion in multichain DeFi TVL). Bridges break; Nexus promises “one SDK, 9 chains, no network switching.” Under the hood, how does Nexus avoid the replay, quorums, and liquidity-fragmentation risks that still plague most bridge tech? Nexus will offer a comprehensive crosschain solution leveraging TEE and ZK verification that ensures solving fragmentation doesn't compromise the trust and security that make blockchains valuable. We have more to share on this in the coming months. The result is a system where one SDK integration provides access to multiple chains without requiring users to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or navigate complex bridging interfaces. Developers integrate once and immediately gain access to users and liquidity across all connected chains, while users experience seamless cross-chain interactions without ever leaving their preferred interface. Is the future a mesh of “app-centric L2s” all speaking via Nexus-style proofs? The future we're building centers on app-centric rollups communicating through proof-based interoperability protocols. Think of this evolution as similar to how TCP/IP became the universal communication protocol for the internet, a standardized approach that enables seamless interaction between diverse systems without requiring them to understand each other's internal architecture. This approach becomes the new standard because it aligns with fundamental market demands. Developers consistently express the desire to build once and scale everywhere, rather than rebuilding applications for each blockchain ecosystem. Users expect seamless experiences without needing to understand which chain powers their applications, similar to how internet users don't think about which servers host websites. Economic efficiency emerges through shared liquidity pools and composability across chains, creating network effects that benefit all participants in the ecosystem. Avail's technology has been in development for over 4 years and that institutional knowledge is not easy to fork. What specific programs or narratives drove that growth, and how do you prevent community bloat from turning into empty hype? The foundation of our 600K+ member community was built through comprehensive developer education including extensive resources, hackathons, and grants that empowered builders to create applications they couldn't build elsewhere. People joined because our infrastructure enabled genuine utility, from Lens Protocol's social applications to Sophon's gaming ecosystem rather than speculative promises. Instead of pure marketing messaging, we provide regular updates on technical progress, sharing both breakthroughs and challenges. This honesty builds trust and attracts community members who understand the technology's real potential. Additionally, our ecosystem benefits create tangible value for community members who see direct advantages from our partnerships and integrations, making their involvement meaningful beyond token appreciation. To prevent hype bloat, we focus relentlessly on engagement metrics over vanity numbers. Active developers building on our infrastructure, meaningful partnerships that drive real usage, and genuine transaction volume matter far more than follower counts. Our community programs are designed to reward actual contribution, whether through development, education, or ecosystem building, rather than just participation. With 11 chains live and 50 + queued, what criteria decide who gets in next? How do you vet TradFi-facing dApps for compliance before they tap EnigmaDA? With 50+ chains queued for integration, we maintain selective criteria focused on quality and strategic fit rather than simply maximizing numbers. Our chain integration process evaluates four key areas: technical compatibility to ensure new chains can properly support our proof systems and security model; ecosystem value that brings unique use cases or significant user bases to strengthen the overall network; development maturity demonstrated through active development teams with clear roadmaps; and community alignment with values that match our unification vision rather than fragmentation. Our technical review covers proper implementation of EnigmaDA's encryption features, ensuring sensitive data remains protected while maintaining cryptographic guarantees. We require security audits for applications handling sensitive or institutional use cases, and establish ongoing monitoring capabilities for compliance tracking and reporting to meet regulatory standards. Each new chain or application should enhance interoperability, bring new users or use cases, and align with our vision of seamless blockchain connectivity. Avail's light client claims to run on phones, smart-watches, even browsers, using <1 MB/s bandwidth. What cryptographic shortcuts make that possible, and how big a deal is this for emerging-market adoption? What we've done with the Avail Light Client is entirely novel. The light client conducts Data Availability Sampling (DAS) verifying validity proofs from KZG Polynomial commitments. In simple terms, it uses math to check the network is operating correctly, and your phone can find out for itself when it's not. Traditional light clients rely on a trusted full-node, but because we have DAS and validity proofs (along with erasure coding and some other technologies) we remove the necessity for Avail light clients to have a trusted full node that they're connected to – they instead sample the network directly. Speed is addictive, but does slashing block times compromise liveness or validator diversity? TurboDA offers a fast pre-confirmation which gives immediate UX benefits, however Avail's block time (to date) is still 20 seconds. This is why our infinity blocks roadmap has taken a radically different approach to achieving scale, speed and decentralization – aimed at achieving 10GB blocks in 600ms without any centralized infrastructure. For banks experimenting with tokenized deposits, how do encrypted blobs, key-management, and auditability co-exist on EnigmaDA? Lens Chain (650 k profiles) and Sophon both stake their core infra on Avail. What have these deployments exposed as the next technical bottlenecks? What's the roadmap to triple those numbers without killing performance? The Nominated Proof of Stake architecture that Avail's mainnet is built on is capable of handling higher validator numbers which will continue to grow as the ecosystem expands. Benchmarks show 128 MB today and an ambition for 10 GB / 600 ms tomorrow. What engineering breakthroughs (erasure-coding, blob markets, state pruning) must land before that's main-net ready? Companies now hold over 5% of Bitcoin's supply, turning their balance sheets into high-stakes bets on digital gold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dipped over the weekend following a short-lived rally, as analysts suggested that large holders were shifting their positions from bitcoin to Ethereum. The cryptocurrency had fallen to a low of around $112,500 on Sunday. Bitcoin's recent drop follows a surge above $117,000 last Friday. The brief rally was fueled by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments at Jackson Hole, where he hinted at a possible interest rate cut in September. "Bitcoin's [spike] after Powell's speech was driven by thin liquidity, not lasting conviction," said Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu. "Once leverage unwound and no fresh catalysts emerged, momentum quickly faded, leaving BTC back below key levels." Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that bitcoin's retreat reflects a "market recalibration" as lingering market uncertainties overshadowed Powell's dovish speech. Meanwhile, posts circulating on social media platform X suggested that a single whale sold over 24,000 BTC over the past several days, causing a "flash crash" in bitcoin price. "Once the whale started selling, it triggered a panic cascade, with other traders selling too, amplifying the crash," King said on X. "Most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, $2B bought and $1.3B staked." However, Kronos' Liu told The Block that it is difficult to pinpoint a "single culprit" when it comes to bitcoin price. "It's more likely the work of multiple whales or an exchange with significant holdings, rather than a single entity," Liu said. "Large-scale transactions like this often involve institutional players or coordinated actions." In recent weeks, the market has seen some major holders switching out their bitcoin holdings for Ethereum. Last Friday, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet recently rotated part of its 100,784 BTC to buy 62,914 ETH and establish a 135,265 ETH derivatives long position. Spot exchange-traded funds have shown a similar trend among institutional investors, where ether ETFs have seen larger inflows compared to smaller inflows or outflows spotted among BTC ETFs in August. LVRG's Ruck also said that he sees a trend of high-value holders selling BTC for ETH, betting on Ethereum's upward potential backed by growing corporate reserves. Bitcoin dominance is currently at 57.94%, down from around 61% at the beginning of this month, suggesting that investors are shifting their focus to altcoins. Ethereum is currently trading at around $4,712, after setting a new all-time high last Friday above $4,946. In the short to medium term, the market will likely see more volatility as traders keep a more keen eye on key macroeconomic data including Thursday's initial jobless claims, Liu noted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin fees have fallen to their lowest level in more than a decade, reflecting weaker demand. Altcoins are attracting capital as BTC holders diversify, though long-term conviction remains notable. Glassnode data indicated that the daily Bitcoin transaction fees, measured on a 14-day average, have dropped to just 3.5 BTC. The last time fees were this low was in late 2011, when the network was still in its early stages. This spike in active sending addresses usually signals holders moving coins out of their wallets — often to re-balance or take positions elsewhere. Most major altcoins have logged strong gains in the same period, which adds weight to the idea that investors are rotating capital away from Bitcoin in search of higher short-term returns. Despite the aforementioned on-chain developments, Bitcoin has also recorded a sharp rise in exchange outflows over the past week. Analysts interpreted that as a bullish sign, since long-term holders move assets into self-custody. Part of those outflows could still be headed into altcoins rather than cold storage, reflecting a wider repositioning across the market. Bitcoin appears to be losing some trading momentum to altcoins, which have been the stronger performers over the last 48 hours. However, the exchange outflows still hint that long-term confidence in BTC has not disappeared.
