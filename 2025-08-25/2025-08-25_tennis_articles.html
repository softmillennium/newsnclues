                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Competing for the first time since Wimbledon due to an arm injury, Jack Draper did not have it easy Monday at the US Open. Nonetheless, the 2024 semi-finalist battled through at Flushing Meadows. Despite letting slip a match point in the third-set tie-break, this year's Indian Wells champion rebounded with a clean performance in the fourth set to advance after three hours and one minute. ‚ÄùUnbelievable to be out here in New York, playing on Louis Armstrong. I wasn't too sure if I was going to make it here this year, but we did a great job with the team since Wimbledon to get myself back on court,‚Äù Draper said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúIt wasn't my finest performance, but credit to my opponent, he played some outstanding tennis and I look forward to hopefully improving and getting better as the tournament carries on.‚Äù ‚ÄúI felt like my arm was shutting down a little bit when I was hitting forehands and on the serve, as well,‚Äù he said. The big-serving lefty averaged just less than 110 miles per hour on his first serve Monday, but it was enough to navigate past Gomez. Draper broke early in the fourth set and did not relinquish his advantage. Draper earned his biggest major breakthrough at the US Open last year, when he was No. 5, he is back for more in New York and will next take on Belgian Zizou Bergs. ‚ÄúI'm not putting too much expectations on myself. ‚ÄúObviously there are so many amazing players in this draw, but the main thing is I'm just so happy to be able to compete here in front of you guys in New York.‚Äù In other early action Monday, #NextGenATP star Joao Fonseca hit 51 winners in a 7-6(3), 7-6(5), 6-3 triumph against Miomir Kecmanovic, this year's Delray Beach titlist. Fonseca has thrived at the majors in 2025, upsetting Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open as a qualifier before making the third round at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. One year ago, Fonseca was World No. 162 when he lost in qualifying at Flushing Meadows. 40 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, inside his career-high No. No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a three-hour battle on Arthur Ashe, Renata Zarazua upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the second round. NEW YORK -- For years, Renata Zarazua has labored at the fringes of big-time tennis, far from the spotlight. Last year was the first time in the 27-year-old Mexican's career that she played in all four Grand Slam singles main draws. But in sprawling Arthur Ashe Stadium, playing with fiery intensity and undeniable determination, Zarazua changed that with the biggest victory of her career, by an astounding 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5 score over reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys. Zarazua, who trailed by a set and 3-0, is the first Mexican woman to defeat a Top 10 seed at a Grand Slam since Angelica Gavaldon took down Jana Novotna at the 1995 Australian Open. The match required a draining 3 hours and 10 minutes. Check out these final point totals: Zarazua 131, Keys 125. ‚ÄúI was really nervous coming in,‚Äù Zarazua told reporters. The fear, the nerves, all of that, [I] just tried to leave them on the side and just focus on my game and what I had to do.‚Äù For context, consider that this was only her ninth major main-draw and she has never advanced past the second round. Todas las emociones üíöRenata Zarazua of Mexico notches the biggest win of her career, rallying from 7-6 3-0 down to stun Keys! Zarazua was previously 0-6 against Top 10 players, losing most recently to No. That she did it against Keys made the accomplishment even more impressive. Coming in, Keys led all women with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins. Zarazua was able to practice on Ashe a few days ago for the first time. ‚ÄúFirst few rallies, it was like, 'Oh, my gosh, this court is really super big,'" she explained. ‚ÄúI really like how it plays, a little bit slower than some of the outside courts. So I liked that, because I knew it was going to help me a bit, like, having one or two extra seconds when Madison was hitting as hard as she hits.‚Äù Keys was her own worst enemy, hitting 89 unforced errors against 46 winners. After winning 13 straight first-round matches in majors, Keys lost for only the sixth time in 49 first-round matches. The first set was a match in itself, running some 72 minutes and featuring nine set points -- five of them belonging to Zarazua, a Mexican ranked No. With the tiebreak score 10-all, with points at 51 each, Keys smashed a forehand winner and Zarazua's tired forehand found the net. Keys responded with a fist pump and, sitting in the stands, actor Jeff Goldblum's face wore a look of disbelief. Keys ran out to a 3-0 lead in the second set, but Zarazua countered by going on a five-game streak. But serving for the set, she was broken by Keys (with another massive forehand winner) to level the frame at 5-all. The third set progressed on serve -- until Zarazua broke Keys following a double fault and a backhand that soared long. In a three-hour battle on Arthur Ashe, Renata Zarazua upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys to reach the second round.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diana Shnaider's surge back into the Top 20 headlined a busy week of rankings moves, with Sorana Cirstea, Ekaterina Alexandrova and several rising names also making big strides. Last week, the final preparations for the US Open wrapped up with the WTA 500 in Monterrey and the WTA 250 in Cleveland -- two tournaments that gave their champions much-needed rebounds. Diana Shnaider ended 2024 as the World No. 13, seemingly poised to go even higher after sweeping up four titles last year. The 21-year-old climbed to a career high of No. 11 in May but has found a breakthrough to the next level elusive. After a succession of coaching changes, she headed to Monterrey with a modest season record of 19-19. But both Shnaider's raw talent and battling spirit shone through in Mexico en route to her second WTA 500 trophy. In the quarterfinals, she faced a total of five match points -- and trailed 5-1 in the third set -- against Elise Mertens before pulling off one of the year's greatest comebacks. After falling out of the Top 20 last week, Shnaider has already rebounded, climbing five spots from No. This time last year, Sorana Cirstea was on crutches, ending her season after Wimbledon after plantar fasciitis necessitated foot surgery. She returned to action in January, but fell out of the Top 100 the following month. But the 35-year-old Romanian has been steadily rebuilding her ranking with promising results such as a semifinal run in Iasi and a fourth-round showing in Cincinnati -- and last week, she went all the way to the trophy in Cleveland. It's just Cirstea's third career title, and her first on hard courts since Tashkent 2008. 12: Alexandrova continued the most consistent season of her career by reaching her second final of 2025 in Monterrey, a run that included a quarterfinal defeat of defending champion Linda Noskova. Alexandrova's 2025 record is now 35-18, and she's up to another new career high. 44: Prague champion Bouzkova reached her second semifinal in her past three tournaments in Monterrey. 56: Parks scored her seventh career Top 20 win, and third of the season, over Emma Navarro in Monterrey en route to her first WTA 500 semifinal. 69: Croatian 22-year-old Ruzic reached her first WTA 500 quarterfinal as a qualifier in Monterrey, scoring her second Top 50 win of the month over four-time champion Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova along the way. Ruzic jumps to a new career high. 90: Zakharova, who reached her career high of No. Carol Young Suh Lee, +33 to No. Lee, who represented the Northern Mariana Islands as a junior and now competes for the United States, extended her 2025 record to 66-15. The Belgian teenager, who was ranked No. 1,060: Competing in just her second professional tournament, 15-year-old German Manescu qualified and reached the semifinals of the Erwitte ITF W35 two weeks ago. Diana Shnaider's surge back into the Top 20 headlined a busy week of rankings moves, with Sorana Cirstea, Ekaterina Alexandrova and several rising names also making big strides.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In her tour-level debut at the US Open, Janice Tjen upset Veronika Kudermetova to become the first Indonesian player to win a Grand Slam match since 2023. Of the 12 players who successfully made it through US Open qualifying last week, Indonesia's Janice Tjen garnered some of the most attention. The 23-year-old's rise since graduating from Pepperdine University with a degree in sociology last year had been meteoric. 149 this week, sweeping up 13 ITF titles in the process. 25 seed Veronika Kudermetova represented another step up in level. It was not only Tjen's tour-level debut, but the first time she'd ever faced a Top 50 opponent. Tjen responded brilliantly, upsetting Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 despite losing a break lead in the second set, and setting up a popcorn second-round encounter with Emma Raducanu. The seventh Indonesian woman to compete in a Grand Slam main draw in the Open Era, Tjen also snapped a long drought for her country at this level of the sport, becoming: "Hopefully like this, by me making appearance here, will inspire more tennis player -- like, younger kids to play tennis and also believing that they can be here too." Tjen patterned her game after a former World No. Against Kudermetova, Tjen excelled with a throwback game style that's become all too rare in tennis: sliced backhands, a powerful forehand with which she struck a slew of lethal angled winners and an eagerness to get to the net, where she won 20 out of 30 points. "Me and my coach have been working on that," Tjen said with satisfaction afterwards. "Just making sure that if it is a 50/50, we're going in, coming into the net. And I would say we have a pretty good percentage of winning up at the net, so we would want to make more appearance up there." It's all reminiscent of none other than former World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, who retired in 2022 -- and it's no surprise that Tjen has consciously patterned her game after the three-time major champion. "I have been hearing that a lot," Tjen said. I would watch a little bit of her matches and try to copy what works for me, what's not, and just trying to understand her game a little bit more." Tjen and Eala are both making history for south-east Asia in New York On a strong day for south-east Asian tennis, Tjen's breakthrough was mirrored by none other than her former junior rival Eala, who delivered Day 1's only other seeded upset, knocking out No. Eala, the first Filipina to win a Grand Slam main-draw match in the Open Era, remembered Tjen well from their junior rivalry. You know, I haven't been able to spend a lot of time with her recently. I'm so happy for her, and it's nice to see someone that you grew up with in the biggest stages in the world." Tjen was encouraged by her college coaches and a fellow Indonesian player Going pro was never an automatic decision for Tjen. After finishing with juniors, the travel costs involved meant that she and her parents opted for the college tennis pathway -- which she feels paid off after her coaches at Pepperdine University helped to develop her game. And after spending her college career contemplating whether or not she should turn pro, they were also instrumental in encouraging her. "The coaches at Pepperdine told me I think you should give it a try, at least for two years," she said. 48 Aldila Sutjiadi -- was also a key figure in Tjen's emergence. It's very nice to be around another Indonesian here." In her spare time, Tjen is a Mario Kart fan "We've been grinding on that one," she told press. "I would be a little bit not happy if somebody took that. In her tour-level debut at the US Open, Janice Tjen upset Veronika Kudermetova to become the first Indonesian player to win a Grand Slam match since 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has lost three ATP Tour finals in 2025, and in two of them he held match points (Acapulco and Washington). ‚ÄúIt's a learning curve,‚Äù he admitted on Sunday after storming his way to a 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 over Alexander Shevchenko, the most resounding Grand Slam win of his career. ‚ÄúIf you look at the final at Delray Beach, after the 5-2, 15-40 I couldn't play that game because I was really nervous and I was talking a lot. ‚ÄúI think that's the lesson; being calm during tense moments. In the end, the finals I've been in this year, I'm learning from them and I use that to know how to handle it in the future.‚Äù At the start of the year, Davidovich Fokina lost in Delray Beach to Miomir Kecmanovic despite having had a 5-2 lead in the deciding set and earning himself two match points. He also bowed out of the title bout in Acapulco against Tomas Machac and a few weeks ago he fell at the last hurdle to Alex de Minaur in Washington where he again had a 5-2 lead in the decider as well as three match points at 5-4 on the Australian's serve. After that defeat, the third in a final in 2025 (and the fourth final he has lost in his career), there was an outpouring of affection from many of Davidovich's peers, including De Minaur himself, who sat with him on the bench in Washington and devoted some kind words to him at the prizegiving ceremony. ‚ÄúFils, Lehecka, Cobolli‚Ä¶ I have several friends on tour and they could see I was in a bad place after that final,‚Äù confessed Davidovich Fokina, the No. Fils is one of my best friends on Tour and also off court. ‚ÄúUltimately, for me, it's also like saying ‚ÄòI know I'm doing things right and the title will come.' You May Also Like: Davidovich Fokina won't let heartbreak hold him back: 'I want more' After that final in Washington, and without taking a break, Davidovich reached the last sixteen at the ATP Masters 1000 in Toronto, where he retired from the match with Andrey Rublev, just as he did in Cincinnati, when he was unable to finish against Joao Fonseca. ‚ÄúI was very tired, above all mentally and physically,‚Äù said the Spaniard. It wasn't the best decision to play in Toronto after Washington. I didn't get a single day's rest and the fatigue accumulated. In the end, having a week and not resting, your body tells you it's too much. We had to reflect and figure out what was happening. In the end it was all about getting a proper rest.‚Äù Sometimes the solution is simpler than it may seem. ‚ÄúThe day after losing to Fonseca I went to Miami with my wife and spent four days there doing nothing,‚Äù said Davidovich Fokina. ‚ÄúWe were relaxing on the beach and eating good food. That was my preparation for arriving here stronger.‚Äù Having thrashed Shevchenko in his first match at the US Open, Davidovich is into the second round at Flushing Meadows and could not be feeling better.

"I was not upset with the photographer," said Medvedev. What ensued was a viral moment Medvedev has become known for: making his voice heard, loud and clear. He berated Allensworth for the decision, saying, ‚ÄúHe wants to go home guys, he doesn't like to be here, he gets paid by the match, not by the hour.‚Äù Medvedev then mentioned Reilly Opelka, who at this year's Dallas Open called Allensworth the ‚Äúworst ump on tour.‚Äù‚ÄúDelay from the photographer was probably four seconds and a half,‚Äù Medvedev would later say. ‚ÄúI'm not sure it's enough for a second serve.‚ÄùCombined with a cascade of boos from the crowd inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, some six minutes passed before Bonzi struck his (second) first serve. ‚ÄúDelay from the photographer was probably four seconds and a half,‚Äù Medvedev would later say. ‚ÄúI'm not sure it's enough for a second serve.‚ÄùCombined with a cascade of boos from the crowd inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, some six minutes passed before Bonzi struck his (second) first serve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniil Medvedev is unlikely to look back fondly on the 2025 Grand Slam season. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has ended his year at the majors with just one match win after he fell to a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7(5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat against Benjamin Bonzi on Sunday night at the US Open. After stealing the third set amid chaotic scenes, Medvedev twice surrendered a break in the fifth set. After shaking hands with Bonzi, he tossed six racquets from his bag to fans in the stands. Despite a courageous comeback and some excellent shotmaking, Medvedev produced an error-strewn performance on Louis Armstrong Stadium, offering up 64 unforced errors overall. For Bonzi, it was a second consecutive Grand Slam victory against Medvedev following his four-set triumph in the pair's clash at Wimbledon in late June. The 20-time tour-level champion Medvedev began his Grand Slam year by rallying from two-sets-to-one down to defeat then-World No. ‚ÄúI'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,‚Äù Medvedev said of his 2025 Grand Slam season. Benjamin Bonzi defeats Daniil Medvedev on Sunday at the US Open. Sunday night's encounter between Medvedev and Bonzi in New York did not lack drama. Bonzi appeared set to wrap a comfortable upset when he stepped up to serve on match point at 5-4, 40/30 in the third set, but an unexpected interruption acted as a catalyst for wild scenes on Louis Armstrong Stadium. Medvedev ran towards the umpire's chair to remonstrate and soon after encouraged the crowd to raise as much noise as they could muster. Sustained crowd noise delayed play for about five minutes. As Bonzi paced near the back of the court, even Medvedev was concerned things had spiralled out of control and he signalled for an end to the chaos. Upon resumption, a Bonzi fault drew an enormous roar from fans. Massive roars rang out when Medvedev then earned ‚Äì and converted ‚Äì a break point to level at 5-5. The former US Open champion, who once fancied himself a villain to the New York crowd ‚Äì made a heart symbol with his hands to thank them for their support. Despite serving below full strength due to a leg injury, Bonzi fought off five break points to hold for 4-3 and soon after broke Medvedev in the final game of the match to secure a dramatic win for new coach Nicolas Mahut. ‚ÄúIt's a very important win, it's my first Grand Slam with Nico, our first week together,‚Äù Bonzi said on court after the victory. Then Daniil playing great and taking full advantage in the fourth. For me it's like my best victory ever. But the 29-year-old's horror show at the Slams represents a dramatic dropoff for a player who has been of the most consistent performers at that level in recent years: Medvedev reached at least one Grand Slam final per year from 2021 to 2024.

Daniil Medvedev saves match point and gets a break in the third set. It was reminiscent of Medvedev's 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later said in his post-match interview that the crowd gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson during the match and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire's chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.Medvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later.

Djokovic's demeanor and physical condition were also mysterious at times. He walked slowly and took extra time between points. He bailed out of long rallies with drop shots. By the end of the third set, though, he was close to his normal self again, and the scoreline looked routine.In that sense, this was also a predictable result for an opening night at the Open.

In that sense, this was also a predictable result for an opening night at the Open. Typically, this is when we see a very high seed play his first-round match against someone who has never experienced an evening session in New York before. That was certainly true of Tien, who hasn't made it past the first round of the US Open in four tries. At 19, in his first full year on tour, he's even greener than Djokovic's average opening-round victim. So it was no surprise that he looked like a deer in the headlights as he littered up the court with misses in the first set.But it also wasn't a surprise that, once he got the blood flowing and got used to the stage, Tien challenged Djokovic in the second set, and briefly brought some buzz and tension to the building. During one of them, Tien had a look at a forehand, but he tapped the ball tentatively to the middle of the court, where Djokovic quickly bashed it for a winner. Later, with Djokovic serving at 4-5, Tien reached set point. He chose to back up to return serve; Djokovic, seeing his deep position, sent the ball out wide for an ace. From there, though, he put a backhand into the net, double faulted, and missed a regulation backhand long.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic was forced to battle through some Sunday-night struggles to kick-start his 2025 US Open campaign. The four-time champion at the New York major overcame #NextGenATP home favourite Learner Tien in straight sets inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, but he was quick to admit the victory had been far less straightforward than the scoreline suggests. Just over 20 minutes, first set, I felt really good,‚Äù said Djokovic in his post-match press conference following his 6-1, 7-6(3), 6-2 win. ‚ÄúThen some long games to start the second set, and then I started to feel really‚Ä¶ I don't know why. ‚ÄúYeah, we had long exchanges, but also, I kind of dropped my level and made a lot of unforced errors and kind of got him back into the match. Djokovic was competing in his first match since he also struggled physically in a straight-sets Wimbledon semi-final defeat to Jannik Sinner six weeks ago. This time around, the 38-year-old was able to get the win, but he acknowledged he will hope to feel physical improvement in his second-round encounter on Wednesday against another American, Zachary Svajda. ‚ÄúHopefully that doesn't happen, because then it makes my life on the court definitely much more challenging. I don't have any injury or anything. I just struggled a lot to stay in long exchanges and recover after points."

But in the important moments I just put one ball more in the court than he did. ‚ÄúI think it was also good to experience that, in a sense, kind of break the ice officially in the tournament.

Djokovic hadn't played a match since Wimbledon, and Tien had an incredible 4-1 record against Top 10 players this year.But the favorite came out firing on Sunday night, rolling through the first set‚Äîthere was some danger in the second set, as Djokovic faced a set point in his 4-5 service game, but he saved it, held and eventually clinched the set in a tie-break to secure a two-set lead.Tien broke serve in the first game of the third set but it was all Djokovic from there, as the 24-time Grand Slam champion won five games in a row for a 5-1 lead, and then‚Äîafter getting broken while serving for the match‚Äîbroke the American one last time to close it out. Just over 20 minutes, first set, I felt really good," Djokovic said. "Then some long games to start the second set, and then I start to feel really‚ÄîI don't know why. Yeah, we had long exchanges, but also, I kind of dropped my level and made a lot of unforced errors and kind of got him back into the match. "There are positives, but also things that hopefully won't happen in terms of how I feel on the court physically the way I felt in the second set. Hopefully that doesn't happen, because then it makes my life on the court much more challenging. I don't have any injury or anything. I just struggled a lot to stay in long exchanges and recover after points."

He's just the third man in tennis history to play that many majors, after Roger Federer and Feliciano Lopez, who contested 81 major tournaments each.Awaiting the Serb in the second round will be another American, Zachary Svajda, who won an all-qualifier battle against Hungary's Zsombor Piros earlier in the day, 6-4, 6-2, 7-5.Djokovic will be playing against Svajda for the first time.

Wertheim and Eala stroll around Manhattan before settling on John's Pizzeria for a wide-ranging conversation.¬© Andrew Shelley When Eala is hot, no one on either tour produces winners with such a jaw-dropping mix of pace and precision. The rookie's level, as it had in many of her matches this season, swung wildly from one set to the next.She began with a series of blazing winners‚Äîtaken early, hit flat, and aimed fearlessly at the corners‚Äîthat knocked Tauson back on her heels and thrilled her flag-waving supporters.

Eala has produced some of the season's highlight moments, and added to that reel today.¬© AP But at 20, another, much-less-precise version of Eala still exists. Was it an Our Father or a Hail Mary? What we do know is that, on the outside, she appealed to a different higher power: her fans. Her fan club responded immediately.When Eala is hot, no one on either tour produces winners with such a jaw-dropping mix of pace and precision.‚ÄúDefinitely hard to see the positives when, you know, you're down 5-1, but that's what I tried to do,‚Äù Eala said. And obviously, you know, with all these people backing me up, it's hard not to stay in the moment and get their energy.‚Äù So what did Eala say to herself when she was down 1-5 in the third?

Serving for the match at 5-2, Tauson double faulted to go down break point, then watched Eala blister a return past her. Serving at 5-4, she double faulted twice more and was broken again. Every errant swing of Tauson's was greeted with something close to a standing ovation.But credit Tauson for settling down again and holding at 5-6. Eala reached match point four times; Tauson saved them all.Finally, at 11-11, Eala hit another backhand winner that skidded off the baseline, and finished with a full-cut forehand that Tauson couldn't handle.

Which may be more understandable when you realize that this was the first time in the Open Era that a player from the Philippines had won a match at a major.‚ÄúTo be Filipino is something I take so much pride in,‚Äù Eala said. ‚ÄúI don't have a home tournament, so to be able to have this community here at the US Open, I'm so grateful that they made me feel like I'm home.‚Äùüëâ WATCH: The Alexandra Eala interview, with Jon Wertheim ‚ÄúTo be Filipino is something I take so much pride in,‚Äù Eala said. ‚ÄúI don't have a home tournament, so to be able to have this community here at the US Open, I'm so grateful that they made me feel like I'm home.‚Äùüëâ WATCH: The Alexandra Eala interview, with Jon Wertheim ‚ÄúI've never seen any other nationality do this,‚Äù Eala told Wertheim about the intense support she receives from Filipino fans around the world.¬© Andrew Shelley</p>
